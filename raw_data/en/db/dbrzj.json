Box by David WilliamsThis report was prepared by the Council of State Governments in collaboration with the Association of State Correctional Administrators, theBazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Center for Behavioral Health,Justice & Public Policy, the National Association of State Mental HealthProgram Directors, the Police Executive Research Forum, and the PretrialServices Resource Center. The Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project was supported by grant number 2002-DD-BX-0002, awarded by the Office of JusticePrograms, U.S. Department of Justice and grant number 01 M008529-01-D, awarded by the Center for Mental Health Services, Substance Abuseand Mental Health Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services. The Consensus Project also received support from thevan Ameringen Foundation, the Melville Charitable Trust, the Robert WoodJohnson Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Open SocietyInstitute, and Pfizer, Inc. and Eli Lilly, Inc. Points of view, recommendations, or findings stated in this document are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official positionor policies of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services, the other project supporters, or the advisoryboard members who provided input into this document.iii Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectThe Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project is an unprecedented national, two-year effort to prepare specific recommendations that local, state, and federal policymakers, and criminal justice and mentalhealth professionals can use to improve the criminal jus- tice system's response to people with mental illness. The goal of this project has been to elicit ideas from some of the most respected criminal justice and mental health practitioners in the United States, to develop rec- ommendations that reflect a consensus among seeminglyopposing viewpoints, and to disseminate these findings widely so they can make the greatest possible impact on a national problem that affects every community.Throughout the project, every effort has been made to provide concrete, practical approaches that can be tai- lored to the unique needs of each community. The Council of State Governments (CSG)\u2014in part- nership with the Police Executive Research Forum, the Pretrial Services Resource Center, the Association ofState Correctional Administrators, and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors\u2014 coordinated this project. The Bazelon Center for MentalHealth Law and the Center for Behavioral Health, Jus- tice & Public Policy provided CSG with extensive and valuable assistance. Together, representatives of theseseven organizations made up the Steering Committee for this project.Following two meetings of a focus group compris- ing various criminal justice and mental health stake- holders in 1999, project partners established four advi- sory boards. Collectively, these advisory groups includedmore than 100 leading state lawmakers, police chiefs, officers, sheriffs, district attorneys, public defenders, judges, court administrators, state corrections directors,community corrections officials, victim advocates, con- sumers, family members and other mental health advo- cates, county commissioners, state mental health direc-tors, behavioral health care providers, substance abuse experts, and clinicians. A complete list of advisory board members appears on the following pages. In addition tothe insights of these experts, the project benefited from surveys and document reviews that project partners con- ducted to identify relevant efforts from the field. The policy statements, recommendations for imple- mentation, and program examples described in this re- port are important products of the Consensus Project. The true value of this initiative, however, will be the extent to which policymakers replicate in their jurisdic- tions the substantive bipartisan, cross-system dialoguethat this project has fostered, and the extent to which agents of change\u2014whether elected officials, criminal jus- tice and mental health professionals, or community lead-ers\u2014implement the practical, specific suggestions con- tained in this document.Prefaceiv Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectAcknowledgements ........................ vi Law Enforcement Advisory Board ..................... xiii Courts Advisory Board................... ix Corrections Advisory Board............ x Mental Health Advisory Board...... xi Executive Summary...................... xii Introduction ............................... 2 The Problem .................................. 4 Reasons for Hope .......................... 9 How to Use this Report............... 10 Getting Started ........................... 13 Next Steps ................................... 21CHAPTER I Involvement with the Mental Health System... 26 Policy Statement 1.Involvement with the Mental Health System ................................... 28 CHAPTER II Contact with Law Enforcement ........................ 34 Policy Statements 2.Request for Police Service ................................................................. 36 3.On-Scene Assessment .......................................................................

Although it is not feasible to recognize each of these con- tributions individually, the Council of State Governments(CSG) staff would like to highlight the special roles of several people involved in this two-year initiative. First, CSG staff would like to thank the co-chairs of the project, Senator Robert Thompson of Pennsylva- nia and Representative Michael Lawlor of Connecticut. They initiated this effort, and they provided the leader-ship to realize a vision of bipartisan consensus around issues that initially seemed to many as hopelessly com- plex and controversial. Perhaps most importantly,through changes to policy in their respective states, they demonstrated how elected officials can use the report to effect real, systemic change. The project partners that made up the Steering Committee have been the core strength of the Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project . CSG staff are immensely grateful to the staff of these organiza- tions: the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF); Association of State Corrections Administrators (ASCA);the Pretrial Services Resource Center (PSRC); the Na- tional Association of State Mental Health Program Di- rectors (NASMHPD); the Bazelon Center for MentalHealth Law; and the Center for Behavioral Health, Jus- tice, and Public Policy. At PERF, Martha Plotkin and Melissa Reuland's experience with similar projects and reports always pro- vided the group with a bedrock of strategic expertise. Under Bob Glover's stalwart leadership at NASMHPD,Bill Emmet incorporated the diverse and passionate per- spectives of the mental health community into the re- port so deftly that many in the project almost forgot whatan impossible assignment he had been handed. Fred Osher patiently educated the group about mental illness, the complexities of the mental health system, and thestate of mental health research, and everyone always enjoyed learning from him. Alan Henry and John Clark of PSRC accomplished a feat essential to the credibilityof the project, maintaining the confidence of perennial adversaries\u2014prosecutors and defense attorneys\u2014in the project's process and the final report. Chris Koyanagiconsistently (but always constructively) challenged the group to make the report one that respected people withAcknowledgments mental illness. And George Vose and John Blackmore of ASCA made sure the Steering Committee never lost sight of the realities that confront corrections and community corrections practitioners\u2014a primary target audience forthe report. CSG and the project partners are enormously in- debted to the members of the law enforcement, courts,corrections, and mental health advisory boards, who are listed earlier in this report. They each volunteered, over the course of just 18 months, hundreds of hours from theirextremely busy schedules. Reviewing draft after draft of the report and crisscrossing the country for meetings, they contributed expertise, ideas, and suggestions about howto improve the response to people with mental illness who come into contact with the criminal justice system. Although not individually endorsed, the recommenda-tions and policy statements are based on their visions for better criminal justice and mental health systems. No one person in the country knows more about mental illness, co-occurring substance abuse disorders, and the criminal justice system than Hank Steadman of the GAINS Center. His careful review of early drafts ofthis report, and his thoughtful comments about how to make it better, improved the Consensus Project report dramatically. An initiative of the scope and complexity of the Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project never gets past the concept phase without considerablefunding support. Indeed, a large, diverse group of fed- eral and private grantmakers made this project possible. Officials from the Office of Justice Programs in the U.S.Department of Justice (specifically the Bureau of Jus- tice Assistance, the Corrections Program Office, and the Office of Victims of Crime) and the Center for MentalHealth Services in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services demonstrated how thefederal government can effectively partner with policymakers at the state and local levels. Program of- ficers from nearly a half-dozen private foundations\u2014thevan Ameringen Foundation, the Melville Charitable Trust, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Open Society Institute\u2014took a significant risk at the early stage of this project; their investments and votes of confidence made it pos-vii Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectsible for federal agencies to provide the resources to com- plete the initiative. CSG staff also thank Pfizer, Inc. and Eli Lilly, Inc. for their support of the Consensus Project . CSG staff are grateful to Dan Sprague, the Execu- tive Director of CSG, John Mountjoy, CSG's Chief Policy Analyst, and the Justice and Public Safety Task Force,for allowing and supporting a regional office to coordi- nate a national initiative. CSG staff would also like to give special thanks to Alan Sokolow, the director of the Eastern Office of CSG. From the beginning\u2014when it was not at all apparent that federal agencies and private foundations would pro-vide funding support to offset many (but far from all) of the expenses that the project incurred\u2014he put the re- sources of the office behind the initiative. And in theimmediate aftermath of the destruction of CSG's office in the World Trade Center, Alan made temporary office space and other resources available to ensure that theproject would continue without any disruption. That com- mitment to the project, and the faith he showed in his staff, was extraordinary and cannot be overstated. Finally, CSG staff and the project partners thank the many criminal justice and mental health profession- als who work daily to provide a better quality of life topeople in their communities. It is for them that this re- port has been written. Their commitment to providing the best possible services to people with mental illnesswill save us from the enormous costs\u2014in human lives and community resources\u2014we all assume when their needs are not met.viii Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project1. denotes attendance at the first advisory board meeting 2. denotes attendance at the second advisory board meeting3. denotes attendance at the third advisory board meeting See Appendix D: Project History / Methodology for further explanation of advisory boards.Sheriff John Wesley Anderson El Paso County, CO1 Senator Ginny Burdick Chair Joint Interim Judiciary Committee, OR3 Steve Chaney Commander of ProfessionalDevelopment UnitState Police, Corsentino Pueblo County Sheriff's Department,CO 2,3 Captain Gary E.

Each year, ten million people are booked into U.S. jails; studies indicatethat rates of serious mental illness among these individuals are at least threeto four times higher than the rates of serious mental illness in the generalpopulation. Because of sensational headlines and high-profile incidents, many mem- bers of the public and some policymakers assume, incorrectly, that the vastmajority of people who are in prison or jail and have a mental illness havecommitted serious, violent crimes. In fact, a large number of people with men-tal illness in prison (and especially in jail) have been incarcerated because theydisplayed in public the symptoms of untreated mental illness. Experiencingdelusions, immobilized by depression, or suffering other consequences of inad-equate treatment, many of these individuals have struggled, at times hero-ically, to fend off symptoms of mental illness. Providers in the mental healthsystem have been either too overwhelmed or too frustrated to help some ofthese individuals, who typically have a history of being denied treatment orrefusing it altogether. Whereas some of these individuals have no family, others have exhausted the resources or the patience (and often both) of their loved ones. Often, familymembers, fearful for their safety or because they are simply out of options, askthe police to intervene. In other cases, concerned members of the communityalert law enforcement about situations such as these: a woman shouting ob-scenities at shoppers on Main Street; an unkempt man in the park makingthreatening gestures and urinating in public. Many times, police officers ontheir patrols encounter individuals with mental illness in various states of pub-lic intoxication. These are individuals who have attempted to self-medicateusing alcohol or any illegal substance they could obtain. There are also cases in which a person with a mental illness commits a serious, violent crime, making his or her incarceration necessary and appropri-ate. Still, almost all of these individuals will reenter the community, and thejustice system has the legal obligation (and the obligation to the public) to pre-pare these individuals for a safe and successful transition to the community.xiii Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectGiven the dimensions and complexity of this issue, the demands upon the criminal justice system to respond to this problem are overwhelming. Policedepartments dedicate thousands of hours each year transporting people withmental illness to hospitals and community mental health centers where staffoften have to turn away the individual or quickly return him or her to the streets.Jails and prisons are swollen with people suffering some form of mental illness;on any given day, the Los Angeles County Jail holds more people with mentalillness than any state hospital or mental health institution in the United States. Most troubling about the criminal justice system's response in many com- munities to people with mental illness is the toll it exacts on people's lives. Lawenforcement officers' encounters with people with mental illness sometimes endin violence, including the use of lethal force. Although rare, police shootings domore than end the life of one individual. Such incidents also have a profoundimpact on the consumer's family, the police officer, and the general community.When they are incarcerated, people with untreated mental illness are espe-cially vulnerable to assault or other forms of intimidation by predatory inmates.In prisons and jails, which tend to be environments that exacerbate the symp-toms of mental illness, inmates with mental illness are at especial risk of harm-ing themselves or others. Once they return to the community, people withmental illness learn that providers already overwhelmed with clientele are some-times reluctant to treat someone with a criminal record. Origins of the Problem The origins of the problem are complex and largely beyond the scope of this report. During the last 35 years, the mental health system has undergonetremendous change. Once based exclusively on institutional care and isolation,the system has shifted its emphasis almost entirely to the provision of commu-nity-based support for individuals with mental illness. This public policy shifthas benefited millions of people, effecting the successful integration of manypeople with active or past diagnoses of mental illness into the community. Manyclients of the mental health system, however, have difficulty obtaining access tomental health services. Overlooked, turned away, or intimidated by the mentalhealth system, many individuals with mental illness end up disconnected fromcommunity supports. The absence of affordable housing and the crisis in publichousing exacerbates the problem; most studies estimate that at least 20 to 25percent of the single, adult homeless population have a serious mental illness. Not surprisingly, officials in the criminal justice system have encountered people with mental illness with increasing frequency. Calls for crackdowns onquality-of-life crimes and offenses such as the possession of illegal substanceshave netted many people with mental illness, especially those with co-occur-ring substance abuse disorders. Ill equipped to provide the comprehensive ar-xiv Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectray of services that these individuals need, corrections administrators often watch the health of people with mental illness deteriorate further, promptingbehavior and disciplinary infractions that only prolong their involvement in thecriminal justice system. II ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE / MENTAL HEALTH CONSENSUS PROJECT The Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project is a unique effort to define the measures that state legislators, law enforcement officials, pros-ecutors, defense attorneys, judges, corrections administrators, community cor-rections officials, and victim advocates, mental health advocates, consumers,state mental health directors, and community-based providers agree will im-prove the response to people with mental illness who are in contact (or at highrisk of involvement) with the criminal justice system. The target audience of the Consensus Project Report is those individuals who can be characterized as agents of change: state policymakers who canhave a broad systemic impact on the problem and an array of practitioners andadvocates who can shape a community's response to the problem. Legislators,policymakers, practitioners, and advocates can champion the detailed recom-mendations in the report knowing that each has been developed and approvedby experts from an extraordinarily diverse range of perspectives who work inand administer the department, agencies, and organizations trying every dayto address the needs of people with mental illness involved (or at risk of in-volvement with) the criminal justice system. The Consensus Project Report addresses the entire criminal justice con- tinuum, and it recognizes that actions taken by law enforcement, the courts, orcorrections have ramifications for the entire criminal justice system. The re-port also recognizes that people with mental illness who are involved with thecriminal justice system live in or return to communities, each of which hasdistinct issues, challenges, assets, and potential solutions to enable people withmental illness to avoid or minimize involvement with the criminal justice sys-tem. The report provides 46 policy statements that can serve as a guide or prompt an initiative to improve the criminal justice system's response to people withmental illness. Following each policy statement is a series of more specificrecommendations that highlight the practical steps that should be taken toimplement the policy. Woven into the discussion of each recommendation areexamples of programs, policies, or elements of state statutes that illustrate oneor more jurisdiction's attempt to implement a particular policy statement. WhileExecutive Summaryxv Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectpromising, many of these initiatives are so new that they have yet to be evalu- ated to certify their impact on individuals and systems. Still, they demonstratehow partnerships and resourcefulness can be successfully replicated or tailoredto the unique needs of a variety of communities. These examples should alsohelp communities to build on the achievements without duplicating the fail-ures or inefficiencies of others. State and local government officials and community leaders can use these policy statements, recommendations, and examples to get beyond discussing the issue and to begin developing initiatives that will address the problem. III. CONSENSUS PROJECT POLICY STATEMENTS The policy statements in the Consensus Project Report reflect that\u2014from a person's first involvement with the mental health system to initial contact withlaw enforcement, to pretrial issues, adjudication, and sentencing, to incarcera-tion and re-entry\u2014there are numerous opportunities for an agent of change tofocus his or her efforts to improve the response to people with mental illnesswho come in contact with criminal justice system. These policy statements aresummarized in the chart below. The first half of this chart corresponds to Part One of the report. These policy statements explain the opportunities available to practitioners in thecriminal justice and mental health systems to identify a person who has a men-tal illness and to react in way that both recognizes the individual's needs andcivil liberties and promotes public safety and accountability. In addition, thesepolicy statements summarize elements of programs and policies that wouldenable law enforcement, court officials, corrections administrators, and mentalhealth providers to provide access to effective treatment and services and tomaintain the individual on a path toward recovery. Policy statements describing the overarching themes (Part Two) of the re- port appear in the second half of the chart below. They reflect that the recipesfor implementing each of the policy statements in part one of the report call formany of the same ingredients: collaboration, training, evaluations, and an ef-fective mental health system. The policy statements concerning collaboration recognize that neither the criminal justice system nor the mental health system can, on its own, imple-ment many of the recommendations in the report. For example, law enforce-ment officials need information about and access to mental health resources torespond effectively to individuals with mental illness in the community. Tomake informed decisions at pretrial hearings, adjudication, and sentencing,court officials need some information about an individual's mental illness. Cor-xvi Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectrections and community corrections administrators should be able to tap a clinician's expertise when evaluating whether a person eligible for parole meetsthe criteria for release. The chapter regarding training calls for criminal justice practitioners to become familiar with the signs and symptoms of mental illness, the appropri-ateness of various responses, and the resources and organization of their localmental health system. Similarly, the implementation of many of the recom-mendations throughout the report depends on mental health clinicians and ser-vice providers who understand the criminal justice system and are willing tolook beyond the stigma associated with a criminal record. Successful implementation of the policy statements throughout the report requires the delivery of mental health services to individuals who have com-plex needs and a long history of unsuccessful engagement in the community-based mental health system. The chapter concerning an effective mental healthsystem discusses the need for mental health services that are accessible, easyto navigate, culturally competent, and integrated; treatment provided shouldadhere to an evidence base. A community mental health system that does notmeet these criteria is unlikely to maintain an individual with mental illnessengaged in treatment, and thus will quickly cause criminal justice officials tolose confidence in the community's capacity to support people with mental ill-ness. The last set of policy statement in the following chart recognize that mea- suring the outcomes of programs designed to improve the response to peoplewith mental illness involved in the criminal justice system is also of paramountimportance. Program administrators must monitor the impact of a new initia-tive. Such information is essential to determine whether a program or policy issuccessful and how it can be improved. It also facilitates continued support forpromising initiatives.Executive Summaryxvii Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectReport Chapter EVENT/ISSUE POLICY STATEMENT Number POLICY STATEMENT Involvement with the Mental Health System Involvement with the Mental Health System 1 Improve availability of and access to comprehensive, individualized services when and where they are most needed to enable people with mental illness to maintain meaningful community membership and avoid inappropriate criminal justice involvement.

USING THE REPORT AND NEXT STEPS The Consensus Project Report should be used as a compendium of ideas that will help individuals identify and frame practices and programs that willimprove the response to people with mental illness who are in contact with\u2014orat risk of becoming involved with\u2014the criminal justice system. Deciding where to start\u2014especially when familiar with the existing ob- stacles to improving the systems\u2014is difficult. In more than one community,reform efforts have been derailed before getting underway because those in-volved could not decide where to begin. Similarly, attempting to implementmany, if not all, of the policy statements in this report could overwhelm a com-munity. The single most significant common denominator shared among commu- nities that have successfully improved the criminal justice and mental healthsystems' response to people with mental illness is that each started with somedegree of cooperation between at least two key stakeholders\u2014one from the crimi-nal justice system and the other from the mental health system. Indeed, the Consensus Project report reflects, on a national level, the value of substantive, bipartisan, cross-system dialogue regarding mental health is-sues as they relate to the criminal justice system. At a minimum, such discus-sions should be replicated in communities across the country. Where thosediscussions have already begun, agents of change should capitalize on the win-dow of opportunity that now exists. The lives of people with mental illness,their loved ones, and the health and safety of communities in general dependon it.Executive SummaryThe Criminal Justice/ Mental Health Consensus Project2 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecthe Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project is a broad-based, na- tional effort to improve the response to people with mental illness who come into contact (or are at risk of coming into contact) with the criminal justice system. This report pro- vides policymakers, practitioners, advocates, andothers determined to address this issue with an array of options and ideas, many of which have emerged in communities across the country. This report has a broad target audience best characterized as \"agents of change.\" Defined as awide range of leaders in communities and states,change agents may be state elected officials such aslegislators or appointed administrators and theirstaffs who can consider and address the broad policyissues that have profound implications at the com-munity level. Because this is a community prob-lem, however, the change agents must also includea wide range of community players, starting withthose most closely affected by the problem. Theycan use the recommendations found in this reportIntroduction to strengthen community structures, and they canwork with policymakers to ensure that solutionsthey craft are practical and effective. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this re- port is that it reflects a consensus among the stake-holders in the criminal justice and mental healthsystem. Police professionals, district attorneys, pub-lic defenders, judges, state corrections directors andjail administrators, community corrections officials,state mental health directors, local mental healthand substance abuse treatment providers, clinicians,crime victims, consumers, mental health advocates,and others have all had input into the report. Leg-islators, policymakers, practitioners, and otheragents of change can champion and implement thedetailed recommendations in this report knowingthat each has been developed and approved by ex-perts from an extraordinarily diverse range of per-spectives who work in and administer the depart-ments, agencies, and organizations trying every dayto address the needs of people with mental illnessin the criminal justice system. T3 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectWhat, exactly, is the problem? How did it de- velop? Who can fix it? What can they do? Andwhere do they start? This report addresses thesequestions. State and local government officials andcommunity leaders can use the policy statementsprovided in this report to get beyond discussing theissue and to begin developing initiatives that willaddress the problem. Furthermore, the report en-ables agents of change to cite programs and prac-tices that demonstrate that there are in fact juris-dictions that have already taken steps to implementa particular policy statement. Having all of this information in one document, which reflects countless hours of counsel from over100 of the most respected criminal justice and men-tal health practitioners and policymakers in theUnited States, is unprecedented. While this reportby itself cannot change a community or system, itis an extraordinary resource in the hands of a per-son committed to improving the criminal justicesystem's response to people with mental illness.4 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction The Problem THE PROBLEM People with mental illness are significantly overrepresented among the segment of the population in contact with the criminal justice system. Approxi-mately 5 percent of the U.S. population has a serious mental illness. 1 The U.S. Department of Justice reported in 1999, however, that about 16 percent of thepopulation in prison or jail has a serious mental illness. 2 Of the 10 million people booked into U.S. jails in 1997, at least 700,000 had a serious mentalillness; approximately three-quarters of those individuals had a co-occurringsubstance abuse disorder. 3 A study conducted in New York State found that men involved in the public mental health system over a five-year period werefour times as likely to be incarcerated as men in the general population; forwomen, the ratio was six to one. 4 Impact of the Problem on People and Systems How elected officials and the public understand mental illness as it relates to the criminal justice system often is informed by newspaper and televisionheadlines, which typically focus only on the most egregious manifestations ofthe problem: a screwdriver-wielding woman with mental illness shot dead byofficers who subsequently tell of being frightened and confused themselves; acrime victim outraged that, before assaulting her, a person with a history ofuntreated mental illness bounced between community mental health centers,state hospitals, and the local jail. Although these tragedies sometimes drive policymaking, they are not the cases involving mental illness most familiar to police officers, prosecutors, de-fense attorneys, judges, corrections administrators, parole and probation offic-ers, and other criminal justice personnel. These criminal justice practitionersare all too familiar with the following scenarios: \u0093A police officer returns countless times to a house or street corner in response to a call for assistance involving the same person with a his-tory of mental illness; each time, the officer is unable to link the personto treatment. \u0093Month after month, a prosecutor charges the same person with com-mitting a different public nuisance crime, and, each time, the defen-dant with mental illness pleads guilty to time served. 1.

Ditton, Mental Health Treatment of Inmates and Probationers , Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Depart- ment of Justice, July 1999. The prevalence statistic for mental illness in U.S. jails and prisons was gatheredthrough a combination of inmate self-reporting and mental health treatment history. Inmates in the sample qualified as having a mental illness if they met one of the following twocriteria: \"They reported a current mental or emotional condition, or they reported an overnight stay in a mental hospital or treat- ment program.\" To account for inmate underreporting of theirmental health problems, admission to a mental hospital was in- cluded as a measure of mental illness. Ten percent of inmates reported a current mental condition and an additional six percentdid not report a condition but had stayed overnight in a mental hospital or treatment program. 3.

Cor-rections officials' job is to keep these inmates alive, even if that meansisolating them in administrative segregation with no outside contact forweeks on end. When the release date comes around, freedom for manyprisoners is only temporary, unless they are among the few for whomreentry has meant planning and linkage with community supports. \u0093A parole officer already struggling with an overwhelming caseload isassigned an individual with mental illness released from prison; theofficer receives only limited support from the community-based mentalhealth program. The parolee is rearrested and returned to prison whenhe commits a new crime\u2014urinating on a street corner and making lewdgestures to frightened people passing by\u2014displaying in public the symp-toms of his untreated mental illness. Each of these situations frustrates criminal justice officials; they know they are failing the person who suffers from mental illness and his or her loved ones.Encounters between people with mental illness and law enforcement sometimesend in violence, jeopardizing the safety of consumers and officers. Once incar-cerated, people with mental illness become especially vulnerable to assault orother forms of intimidation by predatory inmates. 5 People with mental illness also tend to decompensate in prisons and jails\u2014environments that exacerbatethe symptoms of mental illness\u2014and there they are at especial risk of harmingthemselves or others. Upon their return to the communities they left behindduring their incarceration, they discover that their criminal records have, inmany cases, made it even harder to obtain access to treatment. Criminal justice officials may lose sight, however, of the lives these indi- viduals lead. These are sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, who struggledaily to fend off symptoms of mental illness. Without adequate treatment, theirdisease may disable them significantly. Some experience delusions and may beconvinced that strangers are planning to attack them. In other cases, depres-sion immobilizes them; overcome with a sense of hopelessness, their physicalstrength deteriorates. Many of them are people who've spent years trying tomask torments or hallucinations with alcohol or any street drug they couldscrape together enough money to buy and now are dependent on these sub-stances to avoid withdrawal states and further decompensation. Often, their 4. Judith F . Cox, Pamela C. Morschauser, Steven Banks, James L.

This study used data fromthe mental health and criminal justice systems of 25 upstateNew York counties. The study defines individuals who have been in the public mental health system as having been in a state-run psychiatric inpatient facility or a local psychiat-ric inpatient facility, or having received mental health ser- vices from a local, general hospital using Medicaid cover- age. Incarceration was defined as having spent at leastone night in jail during the five-year study period.5.

The Impact of the Men- tally Ill on the Criminal Justice System . 107th Congress, Septem- ber 21, 20016 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction The Problem exhausted families have run out of the funds and emotional resources to take care of them. Sometimes, when the criminal justice and mental health systems let some- one with mental illness fall through the cracks, a stranger is harmed and justi-fiably motivated to demand accountability from the person with the mentalillness and the public health system that failed. More often, when a personwith a mental illness does assault someone, the victim is a family member,friend, or acquaintance. 6 Whether relatives or strangers, the victims are usu- ally left to make sense of the baffling interface between the criminal justicesystem and the mental health system. 7 The current situation not only exacts a significant toll on the lives of people with mental illness, their families, and the community in general, it also threat-ens to overwhelm the criminal justice system. Police departments dedicatethousands of hours each year transporting people with mental illness to hospi-tals and community mental health centers where staff often are unable to ad-mit the individual or quickly return him to the streets. Judges, prosecutors,and defense attorneys race through backlogged dockets, disposing of most casesin minutes, but find that the symptoms and behaviors of the growing numbersof defendants with mental illness who appear in their courtrooms cannot beprocessed as quickly. On any given day, the Los Angeles County Jail holds asmany as 3,300 individuals with mental illness\u2014more than any state hospital ormental health institution in the United States. 8 Without adequate planning to transition inmates with mental illness back into the community, many willquickly return to jail or prison; recidivism rates for inmates with mental illnesscan reach over 70 percent in some jurisdictions. 9 Every criminal justice professional would agree that the system has inher- ited a problem of enormous scope and complexity. Police, courts, and correc-tions officials feel they're boxed in. Resources are stretched to the limit: they'retight on money and even tighter on time. Under the circumstances, many havetried to find a way to serve people with mental illness more efficiently. Butwith limited options and resources, especially in rural areas, many criminaljustice practitioners are frustrated because they know what they're doing isn'tenough. 6. Ditton, Mental Health and Treatment , 4. More than 60 percent of the victims of violent crimes committed by state prisoners with mental illness were known to the of-fenders. 7. People with mental illness who themselves are the victims of a crime are a notable subset of this population.While especially in need of support services, they in par- ticular suffer from insufficient coordination between crimi- nal justice and mental health systems. Although somerecommendations in this report address this population, the issue of victims with mental illness is generally beyond the scope of this report.8.

September 21 20017 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectOrigins of the Problem Understanding why this problem has become so acute in recent years re- quires some familiarity with the dramatic shifts in mental health and criminaljustice policy over the course of recent decades. Few institutions have attempted so complete a change over the previous 35 years as has the nation's public mental health system. Once based exclu-sively on institutional care and isolation, the system has shifted its emphasisalmost entirely to the provision of community-based support for individuals withmental illness. In 1955, state mental hospital populations peaked at a combined559,000 people; in 1999 this number totaled fewer than 80,000. 10 There are many reasons for this change; fiscal reality, political realignment, philosophicalshifts, and medical advances, in no particular order, have all played a part. Theseforces and others have converged to create a reality that few could have envi-sioned when the Community Mental Health Centers Act was signed into law in1964. 11 For many clients who utilize this system, successful community integra- tion has indeed been achieved. Reliable data on the success of community men-tal health are difficult to find, but anecdotal experience shows that many peoplewith active or past diagnoses of mental illness live and work \"normally\" in com-munities across the country. Their very success in achieving recovery helpsthem to mix unremarkably with their families, neighbors, and coworkers. The mental health system today has powerful and effective medications and rehabilitation models with which to work. The professionals in the systemknow much about how to meet the needs of the people it is meant to serve. Theproblem comes, however, in the ability of the system's intended clientele toaccess its services and, often, in the system's ability to make these servicesaccessible. The existing mental health system bypasses, overlooks, or turns awayfar too many potential clients. Many people the system might serve are toodisabled, fearful, or deluded to make and keep appointments at mental healthcenters. Others simply never make contact and are camped under highway over-passes, huddled on heating grates, or shuffling with grocery carts on city streets. The lack of affordable, practicable housing options for individuals with mental illness compounds the difficulty of providing successful treatment. With-out housing that is integrated with mental health, substance abuse, employ- subjects (72 percent) were rearrested. 10. T.A. Kupers, Prison Madness: The Mental Health Crisis Behind Bars and What We Must Do About It , San Francisco, Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1999. 11. The public, the media, and even some in the crimi- nal justice and mental health system, suggest that there isa causal connection between the dramatic reduction in the number of people in mental health institutions and the extraordinary growth of the prison and jail population.Some present two straight-line graphs to illustrate the point, implying that the very same people who used to bein mental health institutions are now in prison or jail. In fact, no study has proven that there has been a transition of this population from one institution to another. Indeed,while the gross number of people with mental illness incar- cerated has increased significantly in recent years, there is no evidence that the percentage of people in prison or jail who have a mental illness is any greater than it was 35 years ago when the Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed. See Henry J. Steadman et al., \"The Impact of State Mental Hospital Deinstitutionalization on United States8 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction The Problem ment, and other services, many people with mental illness end up homeless, disconnected from community supports, and thus more likely to decompensateand become involved with the criminal justice system. Most studies estimatethat at least 20 to 25 percent of the single adult homeless population suffersfrom some severe and persistent mental illness. 12 It is against this backdrop that officials in the criminal justice system have in recent years encountered people with mental illness with increasing frequency.Because of sensational news headlines or other sources that stigmatize mentalillness, some criminal justice professionals may be prone to making the incor-rect assumption\u2014which most of the public makes\u2014that mental illness by defi-nition incorporates violent behavior. 13 They may respond to situations on the street, in a courtroom, or at a parole board hearing on the basis of common buterroneous perceptions. In such instances, police, judges, and releasing authori-ties may be especially wary about releasing people with mental illness into thecommunity. Compounding the problems stemming from the stigma associated with mental illness, changes to criminal justice policies during the course of the lasttwo decades have prolonged the involvement of people with mental illness inthe criminal justice system. For example, in response to community or govern-ment leaders' demands to increase quality of life and to reduce crime and fear ofcrime, many police departments have instituted \"zero tolerance\" policies, ar-resting people committing offenses such as loitering, urinating in public, anddisturbing the peace. 17 Many individuals netted as a result of these tactics were people demonstrating in public the symptoms of untreated mental illness.The majority of these people also have a co-occurring substance abuse problem.As legislatures have increased the length of prison sentences (and frequentlymade them mandatory) for the possession or sale of some illegal substances,growing numbers of people with mental illness have been incarcerated\u2014and forlonger periods of time. Already overcrowded and overburdened, prisons and jails typically are without the resources to ensure the availability of effective mental health treat-ment and appropriate medications. In these cases, a person with mental illnessis likely to decompensate, exacerbating the symptoms of his or her mental ill- Prison Populations, 1968-1978,\" Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology 75:2, 1984, pp. 474-90. 12.

The results of severalrecent, large-scale researchprojects conclude that only aweak statistical association be-tween mental disorder and vio-lence exists. 14 Serious violence by people with major mental dis-orders appears concentrated in asmall fraction of the total num-ber, and especially among thosewho use alcohol and other drugsand those without access to ef-fective services. 15 Indeed, the vast majority of people with men-tal illness are not violent; theyare more likely to be victims ofcrime than they are likely to harmothers. 169 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectness. As a result, the person may act out and fail to follow prison rules, which in turn extends the period of incarceration for the individual. For these reasons,people with mental illness tend to stay in jail or prison considerably longer thanother general population inmates. For example, on Riker's Island, New YorkCity's largest jail, the average stay for all inmates is 42 days, but it is 215 daysfor people with mental illness. 18 Inmates with a mental illness who leave prison or jail are typically pro- vided with just a short (two weeks or less) supply of medications and enoughmoney to take a one-way trip on public transportation. Without housing, link-age to a community-based mental health treatment program, or other muchneeded services, the person typically returns to the type of behavior that origi-nally contributed to his or her incarceration. REASONS FOR HOPE The good news is that the urgency of the problem has bred numerous work- able options\u2014within a framework of limited resources\u2014in many communitiesacross the country. These efforts span the criminal justice continuum, preced-ing arrest and continuing past incarceration and the individual's reentry intothe community, and their success is often a function of the creation of partner-ships, especially between the criminal justice and mental health systems. Byforming partnerships police officers on the street, booking officers in the sta-tions, jailers, judges, public defenders, prosecutors, probation officers, prisonadministrators, and parole officers have created service and diversion optionsthat support their public safety functions, and, at the same time, ensure appro-priate care of people with mental illness who come into their systems. Alongwith mental health providers, these partnerships may also include housingagency officials, substance abuse treatment providers, business owners, fami-lies, and people who themselves have a mental illness. Identifying and engag-ing others with a stake in the problem builds a support network for its solution.Partnerships create a framework for moving forward. They help identify com-munity strengths and resources as well as deficits and needs. Most important, Clinical Psychology 66:3, 1998, 493-99.. 15. Ibid. 16. Virginia Hiday, Marvin S.

September 21 200110 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction How to Use this Report perhaps, a community partnership becomes a single voice that demands atten- tion and appeals convincingly for assistance needed to solve the problem. The extent to which a partnership at the community level changes systems depends on the extent to which leaders emerge at the state level. State legisla-tures raise and appropriate money. They write laws that affect who gets intothe criminal justice system and how they are treated. Public mental healthsystems are administered and funded at the state level, so decisions made thereaffect every community statewide. If the criminal justice system's encounterswith people who have mental illness are to be changed, community partnersand state policymakers must work together. This report should be exception-ally helpful in that regard. HOW TO USE THIS REPORT This report comprises 46 policy statements, each of which can serve as a guiding principle or as the underpinning of an initiative to improve the crimi-nal justice system's response to a person with mental illness. Each policy state-ment is followed by a series of recommendations\u2014lettered statements in bold text\u2014highlighting the steps that should be taken to implement the correspond-ing policy. The policy statements and recommendations will help agents ofchange to focus their efforts on particular aspects of the interaction betweenindividuals with mental illness and the criminal justice system. Woven into the discussion of each recommendation are examples of pro- grams, policies, or elements of state statutes that illustrate one or morejurisdiction's attempt to implement a particular policy. By highlighting certainapproaches, however, the report is not promoting them as \"best practices.\" Theyare simply efforts that involve partnerships, resourcefulness, or even longtimepractices for other communities to consider. (Programs, policies, and statuteshighlighted in the text are, with some exceptions, described in more detail inAppendix B: Program Examples Cited in the Report.) Just as this report recog-nizes that each person with mental illness is unique, the report's authors under-stand that communities, their problems, and potential solutions vary consider-ably across the country. What works in one community may not be a perfect fitfor its neighbor, let alone for a community halfway across the continent. In-deed, this report emphasizes that each community must find its own solutionsto these complex and interwoven problems. The practices and approaches cho-sen for examples in this report are themselves continuing to evolve and adapt tochanging community conditions. The Target Population Policy statements in this report address individuals whose behav-ior\u2014not diagnosis alone\u2014reflectssome type of severe or seriousmental illness. In addition, thetarget population for this projectincludes individuals who exhibitsymptoms of brain injury, mentalillness relating to aging (i.e., de-mentia), coexisting developmen-tal disability, or co-occurring sub-stance abuse problems. excludes indi-viduals who exhibit symptoms ofcharacter disorder, developmen-tal disability, or substance abuse only. The age of the target population is adult, with two exceptions.Recommendations that deal withlocal law enforcement contem-plate juveniles whose age is of-ten not immediately apparent toan officer. In addition, those rec- ommendations developed for cor- rections administrators targetadults as well as juveniles incar-cerated in adult correctional fa-cilities. (The situation involvingjuveniles with mental illness whocome into contact with the crimi-nal justice system is no less se-rious and in need of policy-makers' attention than those prob-lems regarding adults with men-tal illness who come into contactwith the criminal justice system.Nevertheless, the systems thatdeal with the two age populationsare distinct, and there were notsufficient resources available inthis project to evaluate the prob-lems regarding both adults andjuveniles.)11 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project19.

There are some terms,however, that appear throughout the document, and warrant ex-planation up front. 19 co-occurring disorders. The term co-occurring disorders used throughout this manuscript refers to the combination of asubstance use disorder with a non-addictive mental disorder.Although there may be other \"co-morbid\" conditions, especiallyin those with co-occurring disorders (e.g. HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis,or diabetes), because of the high frequency that addictive be-havior occurs in individuals with mental disorders, co-occurring disorders are extremely relevant to this report. Other frequentlyused terms for this condition include; dual diagnosis, MICA(mentally ill substance ab user), and CAMI (c hemical abuse and mental illness). diversion. There are two distinct definitions that apply to the usage of the word in the text. The first, and most prevalent,means removing someone from the traditional track or expectedprocess of the criminal justice system; police diversion (or pre-booking diversion) means that the person is not taken into cus-tody but either taken home, to some treatment or support sys-tem, or simply released in lieu of charging the person with acrime. Jail diversion means a judicial decision that pretrial re-lease or probation is more appropriate then incarceration. In Chapter 3: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing, how- ever, there is a narrower definition employed, usually called \"pre-trial diversion\". This term of art describes a process wherebyprosecutors\u2014and only prosecutors\u2014may decide that bringingthe full force of the justice process to bear in a particular in-stance is not warranted. This can occur for a number of rea-sons; the prosecutor might decide that since the defendant is afirst-time offender and the charge is minor, it is simply not worththe systems time and resources to prosecute. Or the prosecutormight feel that having an offender go through the system woulddo the person more harm than good and society would, in theend, pay the price. Usually when this second definition is used, there is a program that the defendant enters as part of a contract entered into be-tween the defendant and the prosecutor. The defendant agreesto comply with certain conditions on his behavior for a fixedperiod of time; the state agrees to drop the charges if the defen-dant is successful. jails and prisons. Jails are usually defined as the facility of incarceration that is used primarily for people awaiting trial andfor those sentenced to short-usually one year or less-terms ofincarceration. Jails are typically run by the county. The averagelength of stay in jails is brief, measured in days rather than months or years, when compared with prisons. In most instances it isdifficult to predict how long an individual will remain in jail, sincemany are there simply because they have not yet been able tomake bail. Jails over the period of a year will have a much highernumber of discrete individuals entering and leaving the facilitythan do prisons. Unlike jails, prisons are state-operated and typically hold only those persons sentenced to over a year. Unlike jails, where thereis a mix of pretrial and sentenced persons in the population, allpeople entering prison have fixed sentences defining how longthey will remain incarcerated. The average lengths of stay inprison is always measured in years. The inmate with a mental illness in a jail is there for a short period of time, is exposed to large numbers of inmates comingand going, is rarely able to become involved in an effective treat-ment protocol since their stay is likely to be short, and mayhave little understanding of why they are incarcerated, all con-tributing to a high level of stress and anxiety. The prison in-mate on the other hand has time to develop a pattern for hisdays and usually has access to treatment for his illness. On theother hand, he will likely be incarcerated for years and will facenumerous difficulties in adjusting to the outside world whenfinally released. mental health.

Serious Mental Illness (SMI). A term defined by federal regulations that generally applies to mental disorders that inter-fere with some area of social functioning. Severe and Persistent Mental Illness (SPMI). About half of those with serious mental illness were identified as beingeven more seriously affected, with diagnoses that includes schizo-phrenia, severe depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, andobsessive-compulsive disorder. Approximately 5.4 percent ofthe adult population is affected by SMI while roughly 2.6 percentof the population is affected with SPMI.12 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction Getting Started The policy statements in the report are divided into two parts. Part One is organized according to events on the criminal justice continuum that providesignificant opportunities to change the course of involvement a person withmental illness might have with the criminal justice system. 20 The first event (and the corresponding policy statement) addresses the obligation of the mentalhealth system to minimize the frequency with which a person with mental ill-ness comes into contact with police. Subsequent policy statements describeoptions that should be available and policies that should be in place for lawenforcement, courts, corrections, and community corrections officials encoun-tering people with mental illness. Four themes recur throughout the first part of the report: 1) improving collaboration; 2) training staff; 3) building an effective mental health system ;and 4) measuring and evaluating outcomes. The policy statements in Part Twoof the report are organized according to these overarching themes. About the Target Population The policy statements and recommendations for implementation in this report contemplate a broad spectrum of the population with mental illness incontact with the criminal justice system. The report identifies approaches for addressing issues related to the inap- propriate involvement of people with mental illness with the criminal justicesystem. It does not, however, set out to exonerate all people with mental illnessof any wrongdoing, nor does it intend to insulate them from the consequences oftheir actions. Some people with mental illness may commit crimes for whichthey, like anyone else, should be arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned. In these,as in all serious criminal cases, prosecutors, judges, and juries should considerall available evidence and decide accordingly. With this in mind, this reportUnderstanding the Target Population Every person with mental illness who comes into contact with thecriminal justice system is insome way unique. Many of thereport's recommendations arebased on this premise. The re-port also recognizes that the vastmajority of people with mental ill-ness function appropriately in thecommunity and commit nocrimes. Just the same, somegeneralizations can be madeabout the people with mental ill-ness who are the focus of thisreport. They frequently are thepoorest and most disabled citi-zens in the community. 22 Many are homeless or inadequatelyhoused. 23 In many communities, they are overwhelmingly peopleof color. 24 They face multiple stig- mas, especially if they have his-tories of criminal justice involve-ment overlaid on their historiesof mental illness. In many cases,they are detained or arrested foractions over which they have littlechoice or control, at least at themoment of apprehension. Themajority uses and abuses streetdrugs or alcohol. Many have re-ceived little or no treatment fortheir mental illness. 20. This report does not attempt to discuss every event along the criminal justice continuum. Rather, specific events are discussed for which there is opportunity to change thetypical interaction between a person with mental illness and the criminal justice system. 21. People who are found not competent to stand trial (and the process by which this occurs) are not the focus of this report. Although the public and some policymakers may be most familiar with cases involving pleas of notguilty by reason of insanity (or under new state laws, a conviction of \"guilty but insane\"), these cases in fact rep- resent a very small fraction of the overall number ofpeople with mental illness who come into contact with the criminal justice system. A 1996 study of the Baltimore Circuit Court estimated that of 60,432 indictments filedduring one year, only eight defendants (.013 percent) ulti- mately pleaded not criminally responsible. All eight pleas were uncontested by the state. Jeffrey S. Janofsky,Mitchell H. Dunn, Erik J. Roskes, Jonathan K.

Ibid. Though only approximately 5 percent of individu- als with severe mental illness are believed to be homeless, Ditton found that 30 percent of jail inmates with mental illness and 20 percent of state prison inmates with mentalillness reported living in a shelter in the 12 months prior to arrest; see also note 12. 24. One 1997 survey estimates that nearly 35 percent of the individuals receiving some form of mental health treat- ment (inpatient, residential, outpatient, etc.) are either black or Latino. Laura J.

Col-lectively, they provide a comprehensive vision for the criminal justiceand mental health systems' response to people with mental illness.To appreciate this vision (and the range of measures that exist tobegin to address the problem) and to inform an agent of change'sdecision of where to start, reading the entire report\u2014regardless ofthe reader's area of expertise\u2014is essential. Unless efforts in a jurisdiction to improve the response to people with mental illness who are in contact with criminal justice systemare already well-advanced, simply becoming familiar with the report'sorganization and the target population will not make it clear whichpolicy statement to implement first. In fact, each policy statement isa possibility for an agent of change to consider; no single one is anessential first step to initiating change. It will be tempting for some readers to focus only on the imple- mentation of those policy statements over which they have the mustinfluence. Police professionals, for example, will likely gravitate to-ward those policy statements that address law enforcement's contactwith people with mental illness. Prosecutors may quickly fast-for-ward to Policy Statement 9: Prosecutorial Review of Charges. Although focusing the application of the report in a community to a limited number of policy statements, at least at the outset, isprobably advisable, readers should not overlook a central message ofthis document: actions that law enforcement, courts, or correctionsofficials take have ramifications for the entire criminal justice sys-tem. For example, how a police officer responds to an incident in-volving a person with a mental illness informs the decision that a 25.

Information available at: www.thresholds.org.How Can We Afford these Programs? State and local government officials will likely be wary of implementing many of the policystatements in this report, which may appearto hinge on the infusion of new federal, state,or local funds. Practitioners, policy-makers, and advocates, however, should notallow such concerns to stifle plans for newprograms, policies, and legislation. As indicated earlier in the introduction, the resources that the criminal justice and men-tal health systems currently allocate to ar-rest, hospitalize, prosecute, and incarceratepeople with mental illness who are in contactwith the criminal justice system is stagger-ing. For example, officials in King County,Washington determined that, over the courseof one year, 20 individuals were repeatedlyhospitalized, jailed, or admitted to detoxifica-tion centers, costing the county approximately$1.1 million. 25 Experience in Chicago, Illinois is one of themany examples that demonstrate that an ef-fective program can have a dramatic impacton jail and hospital expenditures. Staff fromthe Thresholds Jail Program, which providescase management for people with mental ill-ness released from jail, calculated the num-ber of days that 30 people who had beenthrough the program were incarcerated and/or hospitalized in the year after their partici-pation in the program. In total, the 30 indi-viduals spent approximately 2,200 days lessin jail (at $70/day) than they had during theyear preceding their participation in Thresh-olds. These same 30 people also spent about2,100 fewer days (at $500/day) in hospi-tals. 26 Although this significant savings in jail and hospital days (which, on paper, equalsabout $1.1 million) is not necessarily real-ized in reduced budget costs to any agency,it does effect a vastly improved use of re-sources for the jail and area hospitals. Many of the examples cited in this report have demonstrated a reduction in jail andhospital days for people with mental illnesswho had formerly cycled among various in-stitutions. These jail, prison, and hospitalbeds are among the most expensive re-sources available to the criminal justice andpublic health systems. In sum, when itcomes to people with mental illness and thecriminal justice system, policymakers simplycan't afford not to do business differently.14 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction Getting Started prosecutor makes in charging the defendant, which, in turn, is an important factor a judge will take into account when setting bail. Corrections administra-tors rely on information obtained during the pretrial phase and at sentencing todevelop a treatment plan while the inmate is incarcerated; reports regardingthe extent to which such a plan is successful inform community correctionsauthorities' release decisions and plans for supervision of a person with mentalillness released to the community. Considering the implementation of the policy statements that, on their face, appear to address the mental health system only is also essential. Just ascriminal justice professionals must appreciate a system-wide response to theproblem, so must they appreciate what needs to happen for the mental healthsystem to be accessible and effective . A community mental health system that does not meet these two criteria is unlikely to successfully engage an individualwith mental illness in treatment, and thus will quickly cause criminal justiceofficials to lose confidence in the community's capacity to support people withmental illness. Policymakers (such as legislators or county executives) whose authority spans many or all of recommendations in the report, will wonder which policy state-ment to implement first. For them and other agents of change, deciding where to start\u2014especially when familiar with the existing obstacles to improving thesystems\u2014can be difficult. In more than one community, reform efforts havebeen derailed before really getting under way because those involved could notdecide where to begin. Similarly, attempting to implement many or all of thepolicy statements in this report at once could overwhelm a community. Aside from differences in the size and nature of the jurisdictions where the problem plays out, there is great variability in the history, politics, resources,and leadership of each community. These are the factors that typically steeragents of change to distinct policy statements. The single, most significant common denominator shared among commu- nities that have successfully improved the criminal justice and mental healthsystems' response to people with mental illness is that each started with somedegree of cooperation between at least two key stakeholders\u2014one from thecriminal justice system and the other from the mental health system. Accord-ingly, deciding where to begin will depend on the people brought together toaddress the problem and the resources available to them in their community. In sum, sparking a dialogue and cultivating a relationship between crimi- nal justice and mental health stakeholders is, for those communities wheresuch collaboration does not already exist, where the agent of change shouldstart. Similarly, criminal justice or mental health professionals should avoidforging ahead with the implementation of a particular policy statement with-15 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectout first ensuring that their action plan has taken into account the implications for the entire criminal justice and mental health systems. For these reasons, getting started translates into facilitating communica- tion and building cooperation among criminal justice and mental health stake-holders. A precedent for such cooperation and communication that involvescriminal justice or mental health stakeholders exists in nearly every commu-nity. Indeed, policymakers and practitioners typically appreciate the value ofcollaboration, and they invariably have some experience seeding or maintain-ing an effort that depends on two or more organizations working together. Still, effecting collaboration between the criminal justice and mental health systems can be particularly vexing. Accordingly, the remainder of this intro-duction reviews important issues to consider for communities where represen-tatives of the two systems have yet to begin working together or where suchefforts have stalled. Recognizing the Complexities of the Mental Health System Exploratory discussions with stakeholders in the mental health system will, sooner or later, focus on their capacity to make mental health servicesavailable to those who need them most. Before an agent of change reaches outto representatives of the mental health system, it is essential that he or sheappreciate how the mental health system works. As mentioned earlier, the advent of new treatments and service system models is, in many ways, revolutionizing the mental health system. No lessdramatic has been the change in orientation from grim acceptance of the sup-posed irreversibility of the decline associated with mental illness that charac-terized all thinking about the condition just a few decades ago to the burgeon-ing belief in recovery today expressed by researchers, clinicians, advocates,families, and\u2014most of all\u2014consumers. Recognition that people with mentalillness can and do get better has given hope to many individuals. It is also chang-ing the way people think and talk about mental illness and thus altered thecourse of policy. With a foundation of hope and recovery, the system sees reintegration into the community as perhaps its highest priority. Clinical decisions, funding struc-tures, and other incentives are aligned in many places to direct people withmental illness toward community integration. Administrators, advocates, con-sumers, and experts see hospitalization as a costly alternative residing at thefar end of a continuum that should include a rich offering of community-basedinterventions. Agreement in the field dissolves, however, when stakeholdersdiscuss where to turn when mental health treatment systems have failed tosuccessfully engage an individual in treatment. Conflicting views on involun-\"Remarkable treatments exist, and that's good. Yetmany people\u2014too manypeople\u2014remain untreated.Some end up addicted todrugs or alcohol. Some endup on the streets, homeless.Others end up in our jails,our prisons, our juveniledetention facilities.\" PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH Source: Remarks by the Presi- dent on Mental Health, April 29, 2002. University of New Mexico Continu-ing Education Conference Center Albuquerque, New Mexico16 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction Getting Started tary commitment illustrate this tension. Some see involuntary inpatient or out- patient treatment as the ultimate intrusion, a dehumanizing deprivation of rightsto be avoided at all costs. Others hail involuntary treatments as necessary andlifesaving tools that must be employed when an individual's judgment is im-paired. Most in the field feel torn and seek a balance that respects both realities. The trend away from hospitalization and the embrace of recovery have led to a new view of the place of control in mental health treatment. Just as lawsand policies in effect in most states steer mental health clients toward treat-ment in the \"least restrictive setting,\" so do treatment professionals speak ofensuring patients the greatest possible degree of control over their own treat-ment choices. In recent years, mental health advocates and professionals havereexamined the use of coercive measures in mental health treatment settings.Many practitioners have worked hard, for example, to reduce the use of re-straints and punitive seclusion in clinical settings, recognizing that they haveno therapeutic value and can only be justified when physical safety is at issue,and laws and regulations have been rewritten to reflect this new understand-ing. Appreciating the mental health system's views regarding coercion may beparticularly difficult for someone working in the criminal justice system, wherecoercion is inherent at every juncture to ensure people obey laws and followrules. Yet, the use\u2014and perceived use\u2014of coercion has become the subject ofmuch concern and debate within the mental health community. Most of therecommendations offered in this report address issues that arise when peoplewith mental illness are in contact with\u2014or are under control of\u2014the criminaljustice system, and they reflect the powers at that system's disposal. By thesame token, the report takes into account the mental health system's valuesand largely steers away from making recommendations that would apply coer-cive measures to people with mental illness on whom the criminal justice sys-tem has no hold. In addition to understanding key values of the mental health system, an agent of change should become familiar with its complex organizational struc-ture. Understanding how a system is organized largely depends on learninghow it is funded. When it comes to the mental health system, this can be a truechallenge. No rational organization chart can possibly be drawn that accu-rately depicts the administration and delivery of mental health services in thiscountry. In contrast to the criminal justice system, which has a fairly straight-forward structure, the mental health system draws revenue from a dizzyingvariety of sources: Medicaid, Medicare, state general revenue funds, localmatches, federal Mental Health Block Grants (grants administered by three ormore federal agencies), and patient fees, just to name those most common. Insome states, funds are funneled through managed-care frameworks. In others,17 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectcounties present an additional level of administration. \"System,\" indeed, may be a misnomer for what is often a patchwork of programs, services, and complexfunding structures. Solutions to many of the problems encountered by the criminal justice sys- tem might logically be found in the mental health system. Sadly, the mentalhealth system in too many places has been too beset by internal challenges andlack of support to address some of the most visible signs of its failure. For thepublic mental health system to assist the criminal justice system in addressingthe needs of people with mental illness, policymakers and community changeagents will need to ensure that it has sufficient resources and public support. Getting Criminal Justice and Mental Health Stakeholders to the Table In some jurisdictions, the greatest challenge to initiating successful cross- system collaboration is simply getting prospective partners to the table. Often,successfully assembling key leaders in the jurisdiction depends on the stake-holders appreciating what the improved collaboration can produce. Benefits likely to appeal to key leaders in the mental health and criminal justice system include the following: \u0093Improve the lives of people with mental illness and reduce the frequency of their contact with the criminal justice system \u0093Enhance public safety \u0093Use criminal justice resources more efficiently \u0093Improve the safety of line staff and of the environment in which theywork \u0093Reduce taxpayer expenditures \u0093Increase public confidence in the justice system \u0093Gain access to resources \u0093Enlist allies capable of attracting support from policymakers previouslyunmoved by the need to bolster the mental health system. In addition to these gains, collaborative discussions will themselves increase understanding and reduce the assignment of blame. Tight budgets and growingproblems have led to friction among criminal justice practitioners, mental healthprofessionals, and advocates in many communities. Bringing all parties togetherto address the problems can be painful, but it is the only way to engage inproblem solving effectively. 27. California Board of Corrections, Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program: Annual Report June 2000, Available at: www.bdcorr.ca.gov/cppd/miocrg/ miocrg_publications/miocrg_publications.htm18 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIntroduction Getting Started There are concrete means of eliciting commitments from stakeholders to work together. Making funding support contingent on such cooperation is oneway. For example, in California, the legislature sought to foster a collaborativeresponse to the inappropriate involvement of individuals with mental illnesswith the criminal justice system by establishing crime reduction grants. Toreceive these grants, counties must create a diverse strategy committee to de-velop a comprehensive plan of cost-effective measures to reduce crime and thecriminal justice costs associated with individuals with mental illness. 27 Legislation also can prompt joint ventures through the establishment of task forces, which bring together all relevant stakeholders and develop a foun-dation for future cross-system partnerships to improve the criminal justicesystem's response to people with mental illness. An increasing number of statelegislatures (and in some cases governors) have taken such steps. For example, in Colorado, following several independent studies of mental illness in the criminal justice population, the state general assembly created atask force to examine how people with mental illness in the criminal justicesystem are treated. This task force consisted of more than two dozen members,including representatives from the judicial system, the corrections system, lo-cal law enforcement, mental health services, the legal community, consumers,and family members of consumers. The general assembly also established a six-member legislative oversight committee that monitors the work of the taskforce and submits annual reports, including legislative proposals. 28 Sometimes opportunities to engage potential partners and to form a core group of prospective partners emerge from a high-visibility incident. A well-publicized tragedy involving a person with a mental illness and the criminaljustice system often generates an atmosphere of crisis, in which elected officialsfeel pressured to promote quick solutions, which are likely to overlook complex,effective responses. Accordingly, decision makers should use such incidents tostimulate follow-up responses that are long term and thoughtful. To that end,in the wake of such tragedies, community and government leaders should en-sure that organizations begin discussions about working together more closely. A tragedy in Seminole County, Florida, in 1998 prompted such a response. A deputy in the sheriff's office was shot and killed as he approached the resi-dence of Alan Singletary, who had a history of mental illness and whose familyhad for years sought help for him. After a 13-hour standoff, Singletary was alsokilled. This tragic incident highlighted many of the deficiencies of SeminoleCounty's mental health delivery systems that are common to many communi-ties: inadequate coordination of services, lack of resources, and insufficientinformation available to officers in the field and at the scene of a crisis. In 28. The task force was subsequently instructed to exam- ine ways to improve the treatment of persons with mental illness who are detained in pretrial detention facilities. Thetask force was also instructed to examine the treatment ofmentally ill individuals in the juvenile justice system. See www.state.co.u s/gov_dir/le g_dir/lcsstaff/2001/ comsched/01MICJSsched.htm#committee19 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectresponse, the sheriff established a task force that meets monthly to discuss system coordination issues as well as potential legislative proposals. The taskforce includes the state attorney, the public defender, probation officials, theSeminole Community Mental Health Center, representatives of the judiciaryand the County Commission, and other various stakeholders. The slain deputy'swidow, Linda Gregory, and Alan Singletary's sister, Alice Petree, also serve onthis task force. Defining the Scope of the Problem(s) Once a core group of stakeholders has made a commitment to improve the criminal justice and mental health systems' response to individuals with mentalillness, they need to identify and focus their shared objectives. Leaders of suc-cessful partnerships state time and again that, long after launching their jointventure, reminding each other of the mission that originally focused the initia-tive has enabled them to overcome disagreements or missteps that subsequentlythreatened the collaboration. In defining the problem, stakeholders may agree on a limited number of discrete goals, and the problem-solving approach may require a partnershipbetween just two organizations. For example, in Connecticut, the court and theDepartment of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) focused theirattention on the inability of judges to obtain a mental health assessment of adefendant or to gain access to mental health treatment for the defendant in atimely manner. (In attempting to address the problem independently, judgeswere ordering an examination for competency to stand trial, which resulted inthe hospitalization of the defendant for a minimum of three weeks.) The part-nership between the judiciary and the DMHAS led to the deployment of mentalhealth clinicians to each court to conduct on-site assessments shortly after ar-rest and to arrange for treatment in the community as a condition of pretrialrelease. In some cases, agents of change may determine that the circumstances call for a coalition comprising a diverse group of stakeholders spanning much of thecriminal justice and mental health systems. Such a coalition may be necessarywhen the core group of stakeholders establishes that the problem is large inscope and requires multiple responses. In other cases, leaders in the commu-nity may have succeeded in narrowly defining the problem, but they recognizethat potential responses (or the issue itself) are controversial and certain todraw the attention of the media. In this event, a broad coalition ensures diversesupport for an initiative that could attract criticism.20 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectThe success of such groups depends, in part, on the number of stakeholders involved and on the diversity of perspectives\u2014including representatives of crimi-nal justice and mental health entities from state and local government, privatemental health professionals, victims, advocates, and consumers and their fami-lies\u2014committed to the coalition's success. Conducting a Community Audit A community audit will enable criminal justice officials to identify the men- tal health system representatives in their jurisdiction\u2014including large and smallservice providers and those that serve isolated, ethnic, or low-income communi-ties. In conducting this audit, partners should also identify providers outside ofthe mental health community who deliver services to some of the same clients.Drug treatment providers and low-income housing administrators are two ex-amples. Good sources for conducting the audit include larger mental health clear- inghouses or providers, the Internet, the yellow pages, the news media, and staffwithin the criminal justice agency. Criminal justice officials should also contactagencies and organizations of which they are members, officers, board members,or trustees. The audit should apply a snowball approach, where identified con-tacts are asked to contribute names of additional relevant stakeholders. In addition to leads identified during the local audit, organizations with a national perspective, including national membership associations, can providesome additional valuable referrals. Ensuring the Investment of the Principals Whether part of a collaborative effort between just two organizations or a member of a broad-based coalition, each organization should be represented bythe chief executive or his or her designee. Involvement by the principals sig-nals to their subordinates and other stakeholders that the organization is com-mitted to the initiative. The chief executive for a police department (chief, sheriff, or public safety director), the courts (presiding judge), the prosecutor's office (district attorney),the local jail, or another criminal justice entity is likely to be fairly obvious. Thelead individual in mental health circles, however, may be less apparent. Agentsof change should turn to existing cross sections of mental health organizations,such as county-level mental health planning committees, for assistance in iden-tifying an appropriate leader in the mental health community.Introduction Getting Started21 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectNEXT STEPS With a coalition in place and the principals invested in improving the crimi- nal justice system's response to people with mental illness a window of opportu-nity now exists. Capitalizing on this momentum is essential. In this regard, thesubsequent chapters of this report can be extremely helpful. They provide athorough discussion of the opportunities available to law enforcement profes-sionals, court officials, corrections administrators, and mental health providersto identify and respond appropriately to people with mental illness.Part ONE:Select Events on the Criminal Justice Continuum24 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectThe following section of the report presents policy statements cor-responding to various events on the criminal justice continuum. The reportdoes not address every possible event onthe continuum. Instead, particular eventswere selected because of the opportunityeach presents to improve the response topeople with mental illness who are in con-tact with (or at risk of coming in contactwith) the criminal justice system.The flowchart on the next page serves as a useful guide when reading part one.Each event addressed in the report appearson the flowchart in a blue bubble and ispreceded by an Arabic numeral. Eventsthat appear in clear bubbles are not spe-cifically addressed in the report (e.g., ac-quittal).

They believe that if many of the people withmental illness received the services they needed,they would not end up under arrest, in jail, or fac-ing charges in court. Mental health advocates, ser-vice providers, and administrators do not necessar-ily disagree. Like their counterparts in the criminaljustice system, they believe that the ideal mecha-nism to prevent people with mental illness fromentering the criminal justice system is the mentalhealth system itself\u2014if it can be counted on to func-tion effectively. They also know that in most placesthe current system is overwhelmed and perform-ing this preventive function poorly. Policy Statement 1 and the recommendations that follow describe the role that should be playedInvolvement with the Mental Health System by the mental health system should play in help- ing people with mental illness avoid inappropriatecontact with the criminal justice system. For themost part, they reflect general principles and donot delve into areas of detail similar to those foundelsewhere in the report. Readers may knowwhether the services described in this section areavailable in their communities; if large numbers ofpeople with mental illness are in contact with thecriminal justice system, it is likely that necessaryservices are lacking. Chapter VII contains a comprehensive exami- nation of the elements of an effective mental healthsystem, upon which implementation of many of thepolicy statements throughout the report depend.CHAPTER I L27 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project28 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aInvolvement with the Mental Health System POLICY STATEMENT #1 Improve availability of and access to comprehensive, individualized services when and where they are most needed to enable people withmental illness to maintain meaningful community membership andavoid inappropriate criminal justice involvement. There are communities across the country where appropriate and necessary mental health ser-vices were never developed, have closed down, orfor some other reason are not available. In large cit-ies, the wait for an appointment with a mental healthprofessional may be measured in months, while insmall rural communities the responsible agency maybe based in a town many miles across the county. Ineither case, it cannot be said that mental health ser-vices are available when or where they are mostneeded. To be effective, services must meet the imme- diate needs of those who seek them. They must becomprehensive, meaning they must be prepared to1 address the full range of issues presented by an in-dividual with mental illness. They must also be flex-ible enough to be tailored to each person who entersthe system. In highlighting the need for improvedaccess to mental health services, advocates, provid-ers, and others in the mental health field frequentlyuse these two phrases. On first glance, these termsmay appear to be contradictory, but the two conceptscan be entirely complementary. A \"no wrong door\" policy addresses the critical need to engage peoplein care while a \"single point of entry\" is a mecha-nism for integrating services in response to anindividual's complex needs. (See sidebars on the fol-lowing pages for more on the concepts.) Provide user-friendly entry to the mental health system for those who need services. It is sometimes said that the mental health system has many doors\u2014and all of them are closed. To address this problem of access, some systems havefound it most effective to designate a single agency as the \"gatekeeper\" or con- troller of entry to the system. Depending on such variables as geography and governmental structure, gatekeepers can take many forms. In some states, forChapter I: Involvement with the Mental Health System Policy Statement 1: Involvement with the Mental Health System29 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectexample, a county-based system may be structured so that a single multiservice agency is responsible for all mental health services. By virtue of its \"franchise,\" it becomes responsible for gatekeeping as well as for providing services. In other states, multiple agencies may provide services, but one may be desig-nated as the point of entry, with responsibility for linking each client to those services appropriate to his or her needs. There are many manifestations of this concept, but the organizing idea is to make entrance into the system as user-friendly as possible. This kind of arrangement encourages service integration, cuts down on conflicts and redundancies, and promotes more efficient use of resources. Mostof all, it works to create a pathway through the system that, ideally, delivers to each client the mix of services that best meets his or her needs. Example: New York State Office of Mental Health The New York State Office of Mental Health has asked local governments in the state to establish a single point of entry (SPOE) system covering case management and hous-ing services. Intended to coordinate services for individuals with multiple needs, theSPOE system is intended to allow communities to build on the strengths of theirexisting systems. In addition to the primary purpose of coordinating and integratingservices, SPOE provides a platform from which improved data collection can take place, leading to identification of performance indicators for evaluating system outcomes. Expand priority service definitions to include more people with mental illness who are at risk of criminal justice involvement orwho have histories of criminal justice involvement. One way many states have limited the potential cost of mental health services is by identifying and defining a priority population for those services and then targeting resources to that population. Only by meeting the priority population definition can one access mental health services in most states.Usually, the priority population has been defined by such characteristics as diagnosis and functional limitation, which in theory translate easily to a hier- archy of need. Sometimes, however, focusing services on a priority populationhas a perverse ancillary effect. The complicated diagnostic picture of many of those who are homeless and/or coming into contact with the criminal justice system at times pushes the boundaries of existing priority population defini-tions. Where financial or capacity pressures are straining the system, people with complex problems are sometimes screened out in favor of those who \"only\" have a mental illness that clearly fits within the priority definition. Policymakers and providers need to address the questions of who falls within the priority service population and what to do for those people with serious problems who do not fit established priority categories. It is importantthat policymakers recognize not just the growing potential of science, medicine, and rehabilitative services, but also their limits. A thorough understanding of these dynamics is difficult for policymakers to achieve, not the least because this is an area in which change is occurring very rapidly. As science and mentalb\"Without better mental health care, better part- nerships and an improved focus in criminal justice,we can expect unaccept- able outcomes to prisons; increased recidivism of persons with mental ill-nesses to the criminal justice system; and de- layed or lack of neededmental health treatment.\" MIKE HOGAN Director, OhioDepartment of MentalHealth and Chair, NewFreedom Commission onMental Health Source: U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary, The Impact of the Mentally Ill on the Criminal Justice System . September 21 200130 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecthealth practices advance, policymakers will need to keep pace so that our sys- tems are not\u2014as they are in so many states today\u2014artifacts of a time when far less was known about mental illness and the treatments available for it. One way to ensure that resources are available to serve people with com- plex problems who have typically been overlooked by the mental health system and thus are at risk of involvement with the criminal justice system is simply to identify them as a priority population and place them first in line for servicesinstead of last. To do this would mean targeting resources that do not now go to this population. It is a very complicated task to find funding from a variety of federal and state sources for the comprehensive treatment this population islikely to need. Because practice in many places has been to ignore this popula- tion and therefore to avoid grappling with the difficulties involved with treat- ing them, expansion of the priority service definition will need to be closelymonitored for effectiveness as well as such unintended consequences as the deprioritizing of other needy groups. Indeed, the possible consequence of expanding the priority population that most alarms advocates, consumers, and many others with a stake in the sys- tem is that services for people with mental illness who are law-abiding, adher- ent to treatment, and in many ways less obvious to those outside the systemwill fall in priority or even be supplanted by those for the \"criminal justice\" population. With mandates to serve more difficult patients and no increase in overall mental health system resources, this is one very possible outcome. It isan outcome to be avoided because this law-abiding population, easier to serve though they may be, has been less apparent precisely because the system has worked effectively for them. Example: Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration In developing services for people with mental illness who have been in county jails, Maryland's Mental Hygiene Administration, the state's public mental health authority,arrived at the assumption that one population was being served, regardless of anindividual's history of incarceration. Such issues as treatment for mental illness orsubstance abuse as well as the need for housing were substantially the same for thosewho had been jailed as they were for others in the mental health system. By automati-cally including people with mental illness and histories of jail time in the prioritypopulation, Mental Hygiene Administration officials found they were able to deliverservices more effectively, while at the same time reducing recidivism to local jails. Improve access to appropriate services by people with mental ill- ness who are at risk of criminal justice involvement . People with mental illness do not always seek treatment in the same way someone suffering from acute physical pain might. Sometimes they don't know where to turn for help, or perhaps they don't realize they need it. In fact, some-cChapter I: Involvement with the Mental Health System Policy Statement 1: Involvement with the Mental Health System No Wrong Door No wrong door refers to a service system that welcomes people inneed wherever they try to gainaccess. Persons with mental ill-ness often have a broad array ofassociated health, social service,and support needs. Not knowingthe mission of an agency or therelationship between agencies,they may present different pro-viders with any one of a numberof concerns. \"No wrong door\"policies commit all service agen-cies to respond to the individual'sstated and assessed needsthrough either direct service orlinkage to appropriate programs,as opposed to sending the per-son from one agency to anotheruntil he is able to establish a con-nection with the system. Manypeople with mental illness lackthe capacity to navigate the com-plicated array of services or theymay feel rejected in their effortsto obtain help. Discouraged, theysimply drop out of the system andjoin the ranks of untreated, home-less people with mental illnesswho come into frequent contactwith the criminal justice system.A no wrong door policy acceptsthat the first step toward success-ful mental health care is engag-ing the individual. 1 1. See National GAINS Center, Courage to Change: A Guide for Communities to Create Integrated Services for People with Co-Occurring Disorders in the Justice System , December, 1999, p. 1231 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecttimes they actively avoid it. For this reason, providers of mental health services must be creative and opportunistic in their approach to some who are in need of treatment. For many, the mental health system is invisible and unknown. A person who shows signs of a mental illness may have no idea where to call for informa- tion or treatment. More shockingly, family doctors and other professionals in the community may be unfamiliar with local mental health agencies. Mentalhealth providers need to maintain and improve community contacts so that finding help is an easily navigated process. Referrals from other agencies\u2014 housing and homeless assistance agencies or substance abuse treatment anddetox centers, for example\u2014should be welcomed by mental health providers. Rather than apply rigorous screening so that all but a few are excluded from the system, mental health providers should actively seek out cases. To serve acommunity effectively, public mental health agencies should be as visible and active as any health care resource. When the affected individual doesn't realize help is needed, a family mem- ber or someone else in the community may reach out to a provider agency. In such instances, the agency should be responsive. If the individual will not go to the agency's intake facility, outreach staff from the agency should visit the per-son wherever he or she is and, if appropriate, they should be able to access acute care hospital beds or crisis intervention services. Similarly, if the person is homeless or without apparent social support, agency staff should make ef-forts\u2014repeated, if necessary\u2014to engage him or her in a setting where that individual is most comfortable. For outreach to be effective, it must be done in a culturally appropriate manner. Certainly, an outreach specialist must be able to use the individual's primary language. Yet, as has been increasingly understood throughout the mental health system, cultural competency involves the ability to listen to eachindividual and pick up cues that are culturally based. By meeting an individual's needs in a culturally sensitive manner, providers significantly increase the like- lihood that that person will accept and continue services. Identify specific needs of individuals with mental illness who are at risk of criminal justice involvement or who have histories ofcriminal justice involvement and match services to those needs. Each individual has needs that are particular to him or her. While the central need may be treatment for serious mental illness, other needs are fre-quently associated with it, including treatment for alcohol or substance abuse; treatment for HIV/AIDS or other illnesses or disorders; affordable housing; in- come assistance; and/or employment services. Not all needs are immediatelyevident, so a full assessment should be undertaken. This may certainly be fo- cused on the need for mental health treatment and services, but it should by no means be limited exclusively to that arena. The use of illicit substances by adSingle Point of Entry A single point of entry is a mechanism for ensuring an indi-vidual gets the appropriate rangeof services. The \"single point ofentry\" system accepts the burdenof integrating services rather thenplacing that burden on the indi-vidual. It places responsibilitywith a designated agency to over-see each client's movementsthrough the different services andprograms available in a givencommunity. The care that personneeds can then be coordinated,even when more than one agencyis involved in providing it. Anindividual with multiple needswho seeks care in a communitywith a \"no wrong door\" policy maybe referred to a \"single point ofentry.\"32 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectperson with mental illness markedly increases his or her risk of contact with the criminal justice system and must be assessed. The presence or absence of various supports in a person's life should always be thoroughly understood by treatment providers who are designing treatment plans. Similarly, as much aspossible should be learned about the individual's history of treatment and in- carceration. Not only will knowledge of this history be helpful in gaining a broad understanding of a person's condition and status, it could help in forging linkswith past or even current providers who can offer further insight useful in treat- ment. In building a person's history, mental health professionals should also try to learn whether or not the subject has been the victim of physical or sexualabuse. Understanding this part of a person's history can help immeasurably in designing effective services for that person. Mental health treatment interventions are most effective when they are tailored to an individual's particular needs. It is clear that provider agencies must be staffed and organized to provide multiple interrelated services to the individuals they serve. For example, mental health agencies in many placeshave added staff expertise in the social supports needed by many clients with serious mental illness precisely so that services tailored to meet those needs can be offered. Substance abuse expertise is needed to address the large per-centage of persons with co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disor- ders. By providing an array of services that can be tailored to each individual's needs, agencies are more likely to keep clients engaged, enabling many to de-velop the skills or contacts necessary for them to live successfully in the com- munity. Ideally, the public mental health system should function as part of a broader public health system that identifies problems in their early stages and takes steps to prevent their exacerbation. To do this effectively, the system must in- clude a full array of services, including linkage with community resources tra-ditionally seen as residing outside the mental health system. A community in which a full range of services is not available will find itself facing preventable problems, evident in the numbers of encounters between people with mentalillness and components of the criminal justice system. When clients find the services they receive to be helpful and meaningful, they are far more likely to continue them. For many people with mental illness,developing this sense of connection is extremely important. Because individu- ally tailored services lead to more sustained engagement in mental health treat- ment, they are a critical link in preventing inappropriate criminal justice in-volvement. A person with mental illness needs to gain access to appropriate services repeatedly. Services are successful only if they are sustained over time. A pro-vider agency's role, therefore, does not end with identifying services and provid- ing referrals. Success of an intervention often rests on the level of support pro- vided to a person with mental illness who is striving to follow his or her treatmentplan. For the difficult-to-engage person who is most at risk for criminal justice involvement, this kind of support can often be quite intensive. Frequently, itChapter I: Involvement with the Mental Health System Policy Statement 1: Involvement with the Mental Health System33 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmeans repeated outreach to the individual, often through such treatment mod- els as Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) or intensive case management. For very ill individuals, it can mean access to acute care and inpatient services when needed. And it cannot be emphasized enough that such support must gowell beyond purely treatment-related needs to supports such as housing, em- ployment or education assistance, and transportation\u2014supports that will en- hance the likelihood of a person living successfully in the community. Draw funding for mental health services from a variety of public sources. Delivery of comprehensive mental health services at the community level requires a significant investment of public resources. Effective community men-tal health service providers have learned that they must draw from a variety of sources if they are to offer a full spectrum of services. As discussed later in this document, funding for mental health treatment and associated supports in atypical community may come from several different federal agencies, state gen- eral fund allocations, and local tax levies. Resourceful administrators have learned how to use scant state and local funds to leverage money from other sources and to maximize revenues from federal programs such as Medicaid. They look to the U.S. Department of Hous- ing and Urban Development for funds to provide housing for their clients, andthey try to join federal block grant funds for mental health and substance abuse treatment with other sources in order to provide integrated services for co- occurring substance abuse and mental disorders. Even the most artful admin-istrators at the provider, county, or state system levels have difficulty matching resources to need. While agencies and systems survive by identifying and tap- ping a range of sources, the inescapable conclusion is that funding limitationsin many communities prevent the public mental health system from making a full range of effective services available. Broad implementation of the kinds of comprehensive, individualized ser- vices briefly described in this section\u2014services that have been successfully imple- mented in some communities around the country\u2014will result in fewer people with mental illness coming into contact with the criminal justice system. Provi-sion of necessary treatments and supports is the most effective \"precontact\" diversion from the criminal justice system for people with mental illness.e34 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectaw enforcement engaged in today's community policing efforts inevitably provide citizens with services that gowell beyond enforcing laws or main- taining public safety and order. Police are first- line, around-the-clock, emergency responders, me-diators, referral agents, counselors, youth mentors, crime prevention actors, and much more. Among their growing responsibilities have been respond-ing to people with mental illness. All too often, in- dividuals' inadequately treated mental illness is manifested in ways that can result in their contactwith police\u2014sometimes with tragic results. What may begin as a call from a business owner to \"do something\" about the unkempt youngman pacing in front of his store, or community de- mands to keep individuals from sleeping on park benches\u2014to the more extreme 9-1-1 report from afrightened caller that his or her loved one is threat- ening to hurt someone, or him-or-herself\u2014will prompt a police response that can result in myriadoutcomes. Officers on patrol will themselves en- counter those who seem to be in crisis or are in violation of some \"quality-of-life\" law, such as uri-nating in public or sleeping in doorways. How po-Contact with Law Enforcement lice respond to such individuals can have a tremen- dous impact on how encounters will be resolved and on what future these individuals can expect. Many sections of this report focus on partner- ships among criminal justice agencies, as well as between police and mental health professionals.Those partnerships may, indeed, have the greatest impact on police than on any other component of the criminal justice system. For it is police who willoften provide the first contact with the criminal justice system for people with mental illness. Their actions and perceptions will often determinewhether the individual will find much-needed treat- ment, continue in his or her current situation, or face the problems detailed in later sections that areinherent in a criminal justice system ill prepared to meet the needs of people with mental illness. Police response at this critical first encounter will be shaped by whether they perceive a person's mental illness as a factor in the call for service; their knowledge of de-escalation techniques at the scene;and their understanding of when the nature of the crime necessitates criminal justice action or whether it is better to engage appropriate alterna-CHAPTER II L35 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecttive resources. These and other decisions involve complex skills, knowledge, and other factors ad- dressed in this chapter. But police simply cannotachieve meaningful reforms alone, no matter how well trained. They will need the kind of commu- nity-based mental health improvements, partner-ships, and support outlined in this report if they are to have any success at all. As mentioned earlier, it is the most sensational incidents, in which a person with mental illness kills an officer or citizen or is killed by police, that seem to shape policy, even though they are not themajority of cases that police see. In no way does this report minimize the importance of officer and public safety\u2014they are of paramount importance.In fact, the policies outlined in this report are in- tended to prevent critical incidents through effec- tive, earlier interventions. It also acknowledgesthose cases in which arrest is very appropriate, as with serious crimes. In those cases, the offender should be in the criminal justice system. This chap-ter, however, focuses most on what current policy often misses: the overwhelming number of cases in which minor nuisance crimes are largely the re-sult of an individual's inadequately treated mental illness (and often co-occurring drug/alcohol abuse). These result in large drains on police resources,and often without any long-term solutions, for po- lice, people with mental illness, or crime victims. This report is meant to address some of those gapswith practical guidelines for police professionals. The following sections acknowledge that po- lice cannot be diagnosticians or pseudo-mentalhealth professionals\u2014but they can help stabilize a situation, work to keep all involved parties safe (in- cluding responding officers), make effective refer-rals when appropriate, and improve the lives of people with mental illnesses and their loved ones by keeping them out of a system ill equipped to meettheir needs. The policy statements and recommen- dations for implementation are meant to be tailored to the unique needs and resources of a communityand police agency. They were developed to make more efficient and effective use of police resources. Most of all, they are designed to support all thosepolice personnel who want to do the right thing, as part of their commitment to treat all citizens with dignity and fairness and to serve all members of their community.36 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aRequest for Police Service POLICY STATEMENT #2 Provide dispatchers with tools to determine whether mental illness may be a factor in a call for service and to use that information todispatch the call to the appropriate responder. Requests for police service generally come in one of two ways: through a personal contact with anofficer who happens to be near the scene or througha call to the department. This section concerns callsthat are made to law enforcement agencies andhandled by a dispatcher. The dispatcher is respon-sible for gathering information about the situationand dispatching the call to a patrol officer. The dis-patch function can be managed by the police depart-ment alone or through a system shared with otheremergency services.2 While some law enforcement agencies will not have the power to affect dispatch policy directly, dueto constraints such as shared dispatch, they may beable to change procedures through dispatcher train-ing and memoranda of understanding between thepolice and dispatch service. The following recom-mendations address important dispatch protocolsthat should include policies for information gather-ing regarding whether mental illness is a factor inthe call and the potential for violence, and using ap-propriate language when dispatching calls. 1 Provide dispatchers with questions that help determine whether mental illness is relevant to the call for service. Determining that mental illness is a factor in a call for service is an essen- tial first step to providing appropriate police response. The person with a men-tal illness may be a crime victim, an offender, a witness, or involved in a mentalhealth crisis. Dispatchers should use standardized questions to aid the infor-mation-gathering process. These questions can appear on the computer screenor be provided in booklet format. These questions should also assess, when 1. Law enforcement agencies should document informa- tion about mental illness only when it is relevant to the encounter. Agencies should not develop databases that con- tain information about all people with mental illness intheir community.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 2: Request for Police Service37 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectpossible, if co-occurring disorders (especially involving substance abuse) or other issues are relevant to the call for service. Departments should collaborate withmental health providers to determine the appropriate questions dispatchersshould ask callers. Example: Pinellas County (FL) Police Department Communica tions center personnel at Pinellas County Police Department receive train- ing from the Mental Health Commission of Pinellas County on interacting with callerswho may have mental illness. This training ensures that dispatchers are able toidentify characteristics of mental illness and better inform responding officers. Example: Houston (TX) Police Department The Houston Police Department provides specialized training to its dispatchers to enable call takers to determine if the call involves a person with mental illness. Thisprogram has been combined with officer training to significantly reduce the timebetween the call for service and the officer arrival at the scene and to decrease theaverage time that people with mental illness spend in police custody. Provide dispatchers with tools that determine whether the situa- tion involves violence or weapons. As in all calls, dispatchers should gather information to assess safety is- sues that the responding officer might encounter, including whether weaponsare involved, whether the person poses a danger, if the person with mentalillness is at risk of being victimized, and whether there is a history of violence.To further facilitate effective information gathering, some departments \"flag\"certain locations in the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system. These flagsappear when a repeat call for service is made to that location. The dispatcherthen reads the text of the \"flag\" when dispatching the call to provide additionalinformation to the responding officers. These flags are placed only on those call locations that pose a particular threat or unresolved problem, such as potentialfor violence or as a repeat location. Personnel are designated to review theseflags periodically to ensure a need for each flag remains. Example: Baltimore County (MD) Police Department In the Baltimore County Police Department, supervisors make written requests to the communications center to place a flag on certain locations where police have re- sponded to repeat calls for service or where there is a significant potential for vio-lence\u2014as determined by knowledge of weapons in the home, previous reports ofviolence, or other information. These flags are used for a wide variety of calls, not just those related to mental health issues.b38 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProvide dispatchers with a flowchart to facilitate dispatch of the call to designated personnel. Dispatchers should be given a flowchart that states clearly who should respond when calls for service may involve people with mental illnesses. Dis-patchers should provide all of the essential information to the appropriate re-sponding officer, including whether mental illness may be a factor, so that offic-ers are able to respond effectively to a call for service. Use designated codes and appropriate language when dispatching the call. Some agencies use a code system when dispatching calls for service over the radio, others use what is called \"plain speech,\" and still others use a combi-nation of the two. Some may be concerned that information broadcast over theradio violates the privacy of the person who is the subject of the call and whomay have a mental illness. The police department does have an obligation,however, to provide officers with meaningful information on the type of call towhich he or she is responding as a means of protecting the safety of both theofficer and the consumer. To reduce possible harm that could come to the per-son who is the subject of the call, dispatchers and officers should avoid the useof slang terms and use only designated codes and/or appropriate language whencommunicating over the radio. Department personnel should concentrate ondescribing the person's behavior rather than guessing at a diagnosis or using alabel that carries with it stigma and potentially misleading information.c dChapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 2: Request for Police Service39 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project40 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectOn-Scene Assessment POLICY STATEMENT #3 Develop procedures that require officers to determine whether men- tal illness is a factor in the incident and whether a serious crime hasbeen committed\u2014while ensuring the safety of all involved parties. The police encounter people with mental illness of all ages in five general situations: as a victim of acrime; as a witness to a crime; as the subject of anuisance call; as a possible offender; and as a dan-ger to themselves or others. It is also true that theperson with a mental illness may fall into more thanone category at a time. It is critical for the officerwho responds to the scene to recognize whethermental illness may be a factor in the incident, andto what extent, before deciding which response isbest. Several different approaches have been devel- oped to enable officers to effectively assess situa-tions involving people with mental illnesses thatboth reduce their contacts with the criminal justicesystem and ensure on-scene safety. The safety of allinvolved parties\u2014the victim, person with mentalillness, family members, bystanders and, police\u2014isof paramount importance. The desired outcome ofthese contacts should be problem resolution thatentails fair and dignified treatment of people withmental illness. The first step for law enforcement in develop- ing protocols is to learn about successful approachesadopted by other law enforcement agencies. A groupof key stakeholders should be designated as a plan-3 ning group to investigate and assess the differentresponses so that community leaders can developresponse protocols that meet the unique needs ofthe community. (For more information on these com-mittees, see the discussion in this report's Introduc-tion as well as Chapter VI: Improving Collaboration.)Planning groups can accomplish this research andinvestigation using a variety of sources, includingreviewing the literature; speaking with other lawenforcement agencies about their promising ap-proaches and any barriers to their success; or at-tending the training of a department that employs aresponse that could be effective in their community. Approaches to consider include the following. They may be adapted to the specific needs of a com-munity. \u0093Crisis Intervention Team (CIT). The CIT approach employs specially trained uniformedofficers to act as primary or secondary re-sponders to every call in which mental illnessis a factor. Ideally, officers are chosen to par-ticipate based on their willingness to enhanceservices to people with mental illness withinthe community. CIT officers are available foreach shift to provide assistance to consumersand their families and to facilitate emergencymental health assessments.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 3: On-Scene Assessment41 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION a Stabilize the scene using deescalation techniques appropriate for people with mental illness. Officers should approach and interact with people who may have mental illness with a calm, non-threatening manner, while also protecting the safety ofall involved. Several de-escalation techniques (see Table 1) have been shown toassist in calming a person who is not rational or who is experiencing an emo-tional crisis. Most people with mental illness are not violent, but for their own safety and the safety of others officers should be aware that some people with mental\u0093Comprehensive Advanced Response. This response model can be described as a tra-ditional response modified by mandating ad-vanced, 40-hour training for all officers withinthe department. Some of the departments thatuse this approach address responses to peoplewith mental illness as part of their trainingand responses to \"special populations.\" \u0093Mental health professionals who co-re-spond. Some law enforcement agencies hire licensed mental health workers as secondaryresponders. These civilians serve in units thatare either located in the police department\u2014where civilian workers are under the chief'ssupervision\u2014or reside outside the depart-ment because staffing is shared with othercounty or city mental health providers. Thesecivilian workers may either ride along withofficers in special teams or respond whencalled by an officer after the scene has beensecured for various crisis calls, including thoseinvolving people with mental illness. The ci-vilian employees are responsible for develop-ing relationships with community-based or-ganizations and finding available serviceswithin the community. \u0093Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) co-responders.Generally, Mobile Crisis Teams are composedof civilian personnel employed by mentalhealth organizations, who are licensed men-tal health professionals. For an effective, saferesponse, MCTs should act only as secondary responders who are called out once the scenehas been secured by law enforcement. Lawenforcement officers call MCTs if it is believedthat there is a person involved who may be adanger to him- or herself or others, or if theperson needs services. Also, in some jurisdic-tions, if no crime has been committed, MCTscan provide transport to a mental health fa-cility (if it appears the person might meet thecriteria for civil commitment) or other services(such as counseling or drug treatment). MCTpersonnel are knowledgeable about criteriafor involuntary commitment, bring extensiveinformation to the scene, and are able to pro-vide follow-up services. Regardless of the particular approach chosen, the officers must ensure the following: stabilize thescene; recognize signs or symptoms of mental ill-ness; determine whether a serious crime has beencommitted; consult with personnel who have men-tal health expertise; and, when indicated, determinewhether the person might meet the criteria for emer-gency evaluation. Once these determinations havebeen made, the responders must decide what, if any,action should follow. (See Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response; also Policy Statement 28: Trainingfor Law Enforcement Personnel).42 Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectOfficers should do the following: \u0093Remain calm and avoid overreacting. \u0093Provide or obtain on-scene emergency aid when treatment of an injury is urgent. \u0093Follow procedures indicated on medical alert bracelets ornecklaces. \u0093Indicate a willingness to understand and help. \u0093Speak simply and briefly, and move slowly. \u0093Remove distractions, upsetting influences, and disruptivepeople from the scene. \u0093Understand that a rational discussion may not take place. \u0093Recognize that the person may be overwhelmed bysensations, thoughts, frightening beliefs, sounds(\"voices\"), or the environment. \u0093Be friendly, patient, accepting, and encouraging, butremain firm and professional. \u0093Be aware that a uniform, gun, and handcuffs may frightenthe person with mental illness, and reassure the personthat no harm is intended. \u0093Recognize and acknowledge that a person's delusional orhallucinatory experience is real to him or her. \u0093Announce actions before initiating them. \u0093Gather information from family or bystanders. \u0093If the person is experiencing a psychiatric crisis, ask thata representative of a local mental health organizationrespond to the scene.Officers should not do the following: \u0093Move suddenly, giving rapid orders or shouting. \u0093Force discussion. \u0093Maintain direct, continuous eye contact. \u0093Touch the person (unless essential to safety). \u0093Crowd the person or move into his or her zone of comfort. \u0093Express anger, impatience, or irritation. \u0093Assume that a person who does not respond cannot hear. \u0093Use inf lammatory delusional or hallucinatory statements. \u0093Mislead the person to believe that officers on the scenethink or feel the way the person does. illness who are agitated and possibly deluded or paranoid may act erratically, sometimes violently. If the person is acting erratically, but not directly threat-ening any other person or him-or herself, such an individual should be giventime to calm down. Violent outbursts are usually of short duration. It is betterthat the officer spend 15 or 20 minutes waiting and talking than to spend fiveminutes struggling to subdue the person.Table 1. Deescalation TechniquesChapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 3: On-Scene Assessment \"I try to be as calm as I can around police, but I can't always. Just the sight of a police officerscares me to this day.\" CAROL TRAXLER consumer Source: Serious Mental Ill- nesses and the People Who Are Affected By Them: An Educational Videotape for Law Enforcement Officers , 1992, Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Rhode Island43 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRecognize signs or symptoms that may indicate that mental illness is a factor in the incident. The officer responding to the scene is not expected to diagnose any specific mental illness but is expected to recognize symptoms that may indicate thatmental illness is a factor in the incident. Symptoms of different mental illnesses include, but are not limited to, those listed in Table 2. Many of these symptoms represent internal, emotional states that are not readily observable from out-ward appearances, though they may become noticeable in conversation with the individual. In addition to the symptoms outlined in Table 2, some specific types of behavior may also be signs of mental illness. These behaviors can include se- vere changes in behavior, unusual or bizarre mannerisms, hostility or distrust, one-sided conversations, confused or nonsensical verbal communication. Offic-ers may also notice inappropriate behavior, such as wearing layers of clothing in the summer. It should be noted that these behaviors can also be associated with cultural and personality differences, other medical conditions, drug or al-cohol abuse, or reactions to very stressful situations. As such, the presence of these behaviors should not be treated as conclusive proof of mental illness. They are provided only as a framework to aid those police officers who must under-b \u0093Loss of memory/disorientation. Temporary or permanent memory losses may be symptoms of adisturbance. This is not the common forgetting ofeveryday things, but rather the failure to remember theday, year, where one is, or other obvious personalinformation. \u0093Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. They can cause a person to view the world from aunique or peculiar perspective. The individual will oftenfocus on persecution (e.g., believes others are trying toharm him or her) or grandeur (person believes he or sheis God, very wealthy, a famous person, or possesses aspecial talent or beauty). \u0093Depression. Depression involves deep feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or uselessness. \u0093Hallucinations. It is not unusual for some people with mental illness to hear voices, or to see, smell, taste, orfeel imaginary things. The person experiences events thathave no objective source, but that are nonetheless real tohim or her. The most common hallucinations involveseeing or hearing things but can involve any of the senses (e.g., a person may feel bugs crawling on his or her body; smell gas that is being used to kill him or her; taste poison in his or her food; hear voices telling him or her to do something; or see visions of God, the dead, or horrible things). \u0093Manic behavior. Mania involves accelerated thinking and speaking or hyperactivity with no apparent need forsleep and sometimes accompanied by delusions ofgrandeur. \u0093Anxiety. Feelings of anxiety are intense and seemingly unfounded. The person is in a state of panic or fright;may have trembling hands, dry mouth, or sweaty palms; or may be \"frozen\" with fear. \u0093Incoherence. A person may have difficulty expressing him-or herself clearly and exhibit disconnected ideas orthought patterns. \u0093Response. People with mental illness may process information more slowly than expected.Table 2. Signs and Symptoms of Mental Illness44 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectstand what questions to ask and to decide what services, resources, or support are needed to resolve the cause of the incident. Officers should obtain addi- tional information at the scene from family, friends, or health professionals who are familiar with the individual's behavior. Officers should be aware that substance abuse disorders can mimic many mental disorders; substance use can mask many mental disorders; and some somatic disorders, such as diabetes or Parkinson's, may seem to be mental and/ or substance abuse disorders. To complicate matters, the co-occurrence of men-tal illness and substance abuse is also quite common (see Policy Statement 37: Co-occurring disorders). Due to the complexity of this diagnostic task, it will often be impossible for law enforcement officers to distinguish mental illnessfrom substance abuse disorders. The officer who has observed unusual or er- ratic behavior should bring the individual to an assessment site that is capable of making an accurate determination of its cause. Studies have shown that the potential for violence increases considerably when people with mental illnesses use alcohol or drugs. 2 For this reason, offic- ers should be observant and note any signs (e.g., bottles, drug paraphernalia) ofsubstance or alcohol use. At the same time, maintenance of a calm demeanor and use of de-escalation techniques can help to prevent violent behavior. Officers will need to attend to the medication needs of some individuals with mental illness. If the encounter lasts for some time, or a person is beingdetained, people with mental illnesses may need access to their medication. Officers must follow departmental rules for verifying that any pills or capsules the person is carrying are prescribed, or to obtain the needed medication, sothat they may authorize the individual to continue the prescribed treatment. Police officers should be aware that some medications that treat mental illnesses have side effects that may also require attention. For example, medi-cations may cause tremors, nausea, extreme lethargy, confusion, dry mouth, constipation, or diarrhea. Police officers should attend to needs for water, food, and access to toilet facilities. It is important not to mistake these side effects as evidence of alcohol or drug use. Determine whether a serious crime has been committed. No individual should be arrested for behavioral manifestations of mental illness that are not criminal in nature. Arrest is generally appropriate when a felony has been committed or when the person has outstanding warrants. Ar- rest is also appropriate in cases in which the officer would normally make anarrest if the person did not have a mental illness, and if the current signs of mental illness are minor or not related to the violation. In cases where the person with a mental illness has come to the attention of the police because of behaviors that result from the mental illness or nui-c 2. H. Steadman et al., \"Violence by People Discharged from Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Facilities,\" pp. 393-401.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement 3: On-Scene Assessment45 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectsance violations, officers should engage referral mechanisms to mental health services and supports to address the mental illness in lieu of arresting the indi- vidual and engaging the criminal justice system. (See Policy Statement 4: On- Scene Response, for more on referral mechanisms.) Consult personnel with expertise in mental illness to enhance suc- cessful incident management. On-scene expertise in mental illnesses and their manifestations is critical to effective incident management. This expertise can be provided by primaryor secondary on-scene responders who are specially trained police officers or mental health professionals. The following examples highlight the ways that departments around the country have chosen to include this type of expertise. As described previously, these include Crisis Intervention Teams (CITs), the comprehensive advanced approach, mental health professionals who corespond, and Mobile Crisis Teams(MCTs). The basic difference in these models is whether expertise is provided by police officers who are trained extensively in mental health issues, or by mental health professionals who either co-respond with law enforcement orrespond after the scene has been secured. While mental health professionals are likely more knowledgeable than patrol officers about involuntary commit- ment laws and bring additional, perhaps confidential, data to the scene, theyare not always available. (See Policy Statement 25: Sharing Information for more on agreements between mental health and criminal justice agencies.) Examples of approaches that use specially trained police officers to supply on-scene expertise\u2014either as a special team or as the whole department\u2014follow: Crisis Intervention Team Example: Memphis (TN) Police Department In a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) approach found in the Memphis Police Depart- ment, uniformed officers, specially trained in mental health issues, act as primary orsecondary responders to every call involving people with mental illnesses. CIT officersare available on every shift and are also available to mental health clients (consum-ers) and their families. The Albuquerque, New Mexico, Police Department, The Roanoke, Virginia, Police Department and the Houston, Texas, Police Department are amongnumerous agencies across the country that have also adopted the CIT approach. Comprehensive Advanced Response Example: Athens-Clarke County (GA) Police Department In a comprehensive response, the Athens-Clarke County Police Department decided that its small size precluded the formation of a specialized team to respond to callsfor service involving people with mental illness. Accordingly, the department decidedthat every officer would attend the advanced 40-hour crisis intervention training andthus be able to respond appropriately to these calls.d\"Each time a person with mental illness is killed by police it has tragic conse- quences for everyone in-volved\u2014the person with mental illness, their loved ones, and the police of-ficer. Improving law enforcement's knowledge and skills in responding toindividuals with mental illness can prevent many of these deaths.\" CHIEF ROBERT OLSON Minneapolis, MN46 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectMental health professionals who co-respond Example: Birmingham (AL) Police Department The Birmingham Police Department uses a Community Service Officer (CSO) Unit, which is attached to the Patrol Division. The unit is composed of social workers whorespond directly to an incident location when requested by an officer. They serve avariety of populations, including people with mental illness. The CSOs are also certi-fied law enforcement academy trainers and work closely with community groups andother components of the criminal justice system. Example: Long Beach (CA) Mental Evaluation Team In this program, a patrol officer from Long Beach Police Department is accompanied by a clinician to respond ten hours a day, seven days a week, to calls for serviceinvolving people with mental illness. The clinician provides on-scene assessment ofthe individual's mental health needs and ensures admission into a mental healthfacility, if necessary. This approach prevents unnecessary incarceration of peoplewith mental illnesses. Example: San Diego County (CA) Sheriff's Office The Psychiatric Emergency Response Team (PERT) approach used by the San Diego County Sheriff's Office pairs a licensed mental health clinician with an officer ordeputy in a marked car to respond to situations determined by the dispatcher oranother officer to involve a person suspected of having a mental illness that is a factorin the incident. These teams conduct mental health assessments and process refer-rals to county providers if appropriate. Mobile Crisis Team Example: Anne Arundel County (MD) Police Department The Anne Arundel County Police Department has arranged for access to a team of crisis workers from a local mental health center that works seven days a week. Theresponding officer must determine if a Mobile Crisis Team is warranted at the sceneand will call accordingly. There are several important differences between the approaches that in- volve mental health professionals. One main difference is how the mental health professional is paid and supervised, usually either through the police depart-ment or through the county mental health agency. For example, in Birming- ham the social worker is located in the police department and is under the direct supervision of the chief, while in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, themobile crisis team members are paid by a mental health organization. Another difference is whether the mental health agent works in a team with the officer, or responds as a separate unit. An additional distinction is whether the civilianworkers respond to a variety of calls for service beyond those involving people with mental illnesses, such as domestic violence. Yet, in all models, the mental health professional is responsible for understanding community resources andfinding services within the community.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 3: On-Scene Assessment47 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSuccessful incident management is often dependent on information about the person's current and past behavior. If it is not possible to obtain this infor- mation from the person with mental illness or a responding professional, some- times it can be obtained at the scene from those who are close to the person, andwho are familiar with the situation and with the person's history. In those rare events when a person's life or the life of a bystander is in jeopardy, in addition to following standard crisis procedures, law enforcementshould also formally call on specially trained mental health professionals for assistance in resolving the critical incident. (See Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response, for more information on handling critical incidents.) Law enforce-ment personnel should protect the confidentiality of medical or mental health information to avoid disclosures (see Policy Statement 25: Sharing Informa- tion) and should follow protocols for written documentation provided in Policy Statement 5: Incident Documentation. Determine, when warranted, whether the person may meet the state criteria for emergency evaluation. The criteria for emergency evaluation are similar from state to state, al- though there is some variation in how they are interpreted. It is not the role of the police officer to make the sole determination that a person should be com- mitted. However, being familiar with the criteria will help officers decide whetherto detain the person and transport him or her for an emergency mental evalua- tion. This is not an arrest. Officers should be alert to the behaviors, actions, and speech of the person so that they can determine whether specific indicators of the criteria apply. Officers should also familiarize themselves with state law concerning emergency evaluation. Most patients who receive inpatient or outpatient services for mental ill- ness do so voluntarily. That is, when presented with their options\u2014including the possibility of involuntary commitment\u2014they choose to enter a hospital or to follow a course of outpatient treatment suggested by treatment profession-als. In fact, in some states you cannot commit someone who is willing to admit him- or herself voluntarily. For a significant minority, however, there are times when involuntary commitment becomes the only available avenue to servicesand the surest way to ensure the safety of the person involved. Involuntary commitment involves deprivation of personal freedom and can be an indignity to the person being committed. In addition, it requires the participation of nu-merous professionals (including the certifying doctor, attorneys representing both the accepting facility and the patient, and a judge). For these reasons and the simple reality that commitment takes considerable time, in the majority ofcases most clinicians will seek to offer voluntary admission to services before considering involuntary commitment.e48 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectEvery state has a law that provides a clear path for those cases in which a person must be involuntarily committed to treatment. While the laws vary to some degree, they all attempt to define circumstances under which a person's unsupervised presence in the community poses a risk by reason of his or hermental illness. In almost all cases, it is the likelihood of a person's dangerous- ness to self or to others that is the primary trigger for involuntary commitment. In several states, the mental health law also includes language defining what isbroadly known as the \"gravely disabled\" criterion, which is meant to cover in- stances in which a person's well-being is threatened by inattention to personal safety, failure to eat, exposure to extreme or dangerous conditions, or otherevidence that he or she is in imminent danger if left untreated. Some state statutes also note a \"need for treatment\" or likelihood that a person will benefit from treatment as one of many criteria for commitment. Additionally, the lawscovering involuntary commitment are subject to interpretation and, it should be noted, continued debate within the mental health community. Traditionally, the treatment to which a person is involuntarily committed is provided in a secure inpatient facility. State law generally charges the de- partment of mental health or its equivalent with regulating facilities to which involuntary commitment is possible. Not all hospitals are licensed to receiveinvoluntary patients (although this does not always restrict their ability to con- duct emergency evaluations). In addition, reimbursement issues may limit ad- mission to some hospitals. It is important for law enforcement officers andothers who might become involved in involuntary commitment proceedings to know which facilities are able to admit involuntary patients. In some states, involuntary commitment to outpatient services is also pos- sible under the law. As with involuntary inpatient commitment, there is consid- erable controversy within the mental health community with regard to the ac- ceptable purposes and uses of this option. There is also considerable variabilityin the manner in which outpatient commitment is utilized. Not only do states have different standards in the law, but judges and doctors can and do differ widely in their understanding and use of discretion regarding the appropriate-ness of invoking outpatient commitment provisions. To avoid the adversarial dynamics of involuntary commitment, in some instances crisis teams may consider the use of alternative dispute resolution(ADR). Crisis teams should consider including personnel trained in ADR tech- niques who can attempt to resolve conflicts short of involuntary intervention. Many people with mental illness today have some broad understanding of involuntary commitment laws and of the rights they have under those laws. More broadly, many who have been in treatment have learned to understand their illness, to monitor their symptoms, and, ideally, to manage their condi-tion. Patient education is a significant component of treatment in some mental health agencies. Some consumers have arranged to provide information to emer- gency responders (e.g., through wallet cards) on whom to contact in the event ofa crisis. Officers should be aware that someone with a mental illness who is expressing a preference for particular actions, medications, or modes of treat-Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 3: On-Scene Assessment49 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectment may be speaking from experience. The person's requests should be re- layed to any treatment professional called to the scene or consulted in follow-up to an incident. \"Advance directives\" are legal mechanisms by which a patient's preference for particular medications or treatment alternatives can be expressed prior to a crisis, much as many in the general population execute \"living wills\" or other legal documents outlining their wishes should medical crises leave them un-able to express themselves in this way. Officers should be familiar with this mechanism and should be aware of the possibility that a person with mental illness may wish to follow the steps outlined in his or her advance directive. Incases where the advance directive is followed, the person with mental illness may more readily agree to become engaged in services, thereby eliminating the need for involuntary commitment.50 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectOn-Scene Response POLICY STATEMENT #4 Establish written protocols that enable officers to implement an ap- propriate response based on the nature of the incident, the behavior of the person with mental illness, and available resources. This section discusses the appropriate disposi- tion options chosen by the officer based on the na-ture of the situation as determined in the assess-ment phase\u2014including the behavior of the personwith mental illness, established protocols, and theavailability of community resources. The availability of community resources is de- pendent on a complex set of circumstances. For ex-ample, the advent of managed care and otherchanges in the broader health care system, as wellas in the delivery of mental health services, haveresulted in hospital consolidation, the shift to am-bulatory care, and changes in emergency room pro-cedures in almost every community in the country.In many places, practices in place just a few yearsago no longer apply today. Due to factors well be-yond the control of mental health services, it can bedifficult to admit patients to a hospital or other medi-cal facility. For this reason, law enforcement offic-ers and others should stay abreast of how mentalhealth services are delivered in their community. Spurred by the new health care realities, men- tal health service providers in many communitieshave developed protocols intended to ensure thatappropriate professionals see emergency psychiat-ric patients in a timely manner. Models differ among4 communities due to numerous factors, but the mosteffective approaches seem to share certain charac-teristics, such as having staff who can respondquickly and make an assessment of the needs of eachperson who comes to them. In rural settings, where hospitals or treatment centers may be located far from some communities,officers face challenges related to time and travel,in addition to the obstacle of identifying appropri-ate resources for someone they believe needs treat-ment. Increasingly, communities are using technol-ogy\u2014\"telemedicine\"\u2014for initial assessments.Alternatively, communities rely on general healthcare practitioners or lesser credentialed profession-als to provide these assessments, which, while notideal, may be the only means available with currentsystem and resource constraints. Still, there aremany instances in which long distances need to betraveled in order to connect a person in need of treat-ment with appropriate services. Generally, law en-forcement agencies are called on for transportationin these cases. (See Policy Statement 18: Develop-ment of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs,and Classification / Housing Decisions, for more ontelemedicine.)Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response51 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aThe range of response options should always include the option of disengagement when the per-son is not a danger to him or herself or to othersand has not committed a serious crime. Disengage-ment from police contact should not be interpretedto mean that no assistance is offered. What it canbe interpreted to mean is that officers can and shouldprovide referrals to appropriate mental health ser-vices and supports in such instances. Departments should be aware that the simple presence of a law enforcement officer implies a cer-tain amount of power\u2014many people interpret what-ever an officer says as something they must do. Officers should make clear that it is voluntary for people with mental illnesses\u2014those who are not adanger or have not committed a serious crime\u2014tofollow their suggestions for referral and treatment. True problem solvers will help the person with men-tal illness overcome such barriers to initial treat-ment as transportation problems or fear of travel-ing alone. The following recommendations suggest ways to facilitate the appropriate disposition for the fullrange of people with mental illness who may en-counter the police. The sections recommend proce-dures that enhance emergency evaluations, promotereferral to support services, provide information tovictims and families, and facilitate transportationand detention when necessary. Detailed policy rec-ommendations on report writing and other incidentdocumentation procedures are included in PolicyStatement 5: Incident Documentation. Institute a flowchart that matches hypothetical situations with dis- position options. Because calls involving people with mental illness can be influenced by a wide array of variables, a clearly articulated flowchart is a good way to enhanceofficer response to people with mental illness. A flowchart such as the one inFigure 1 helps officers decide what options are best suited to each situationthey encounter. In order to develop such a tool, people involved in each point ofthe system should identify the different response options available for eachtype of scenario typically encountered by responding officers. Figure 1 shows a sample flowchart that might be used by a Crisis Inter- vention Team combined with a Mobile Crisis Team, an admittedly rare but ef-fective response approach. The chart depicts multiple situations and next stepsrecommended for each. A flowchart helps clarify when diversion from the criminal justice system is appropriate and when it is not. For example, in the rare event that the threatof violence exists, a flowchart developed by the individual department can rein-force the decision as to when treatment providers and police can address theproblem or when other special response teams should be called in. This refer-ence can assist in determining appropriate levels of response (which do notinclude SWAT teams unless absolutely necessary) that are based on the likelysuccess of de-escalation techniques and accurate assessments of threat.52 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectFigure 1: Sample Flowchart for Responding to People with Mental Illnesses*Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response *This chart reflects responses of a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) combined with a Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) and concerns situa- tions involving people with mental illness who are the subject of the call for service.

It is critical for a successful diversion program to have a place where re- sponders can take people with mental illness who require emergency evalua-tions. The most common difficulty encountered by police is the lack of availablefacility space or long waiting times for intake procedures. Consumers with co-occurring disorders or additional special needs may not seem to fit any accessrequirements. Agreements between law enforcement and mental health facili-ties can result in designated centers for drop off, procedures at the center thatshorten the wait for police referrals, and coordinated efforts to identify avail-able beds and hard-to-access services (such as for co-occurring disorders) froma wide range of options. Given the difficulties in sorting out whether a person'ssymptoms are due only to mental illness or to substance abuse, these facilitiesmust have the capacity to work with both disorders. Example: Memphis (TN) Police Department A key element to success for the Memphis Police Department has been the relation- ships developed with the mental health community. For example, the local psychiatricemergency room agreed to provide emergency evaluations to all people with mentalillness brought in by the police. The hospital also assumes immediate responsibilityfor assessment and referral\u2014to either community-based or inpatient treatment at thelocal state hospital\u2014while officers return to police service in as little as 15 minutes. Example: Florence (AL) Police Department The Florence Police department liaison, with the help and support of the chief, nego- tiated an agreement with the director of the local emergency room to \"fast track\"medical assessments conducted on people with mental illnesses who were brought inby police. These assessments now take less than 30 minutes. Example: Anne Arundel County (MD) Mental Health Facility In Anne Arundel County, Maryland, the county mental health facility maintains a countywide bed registry to assist law enforcement in easily locating an available bed. Example: Seattle (WA) Crisis Intervention Team Crisis Intervention Team officers from the Seattle Police Department may transport individuals who appear to have a mental illness to a Crisis Triage Unit at a Seattle-area hospital. King County health care providers developed the unit, which is open 24hours a day, 7 days a week to respond to people in crisis. Long drives to mental health facilities may remain the rule in rural areas, but it is possible for officers to be assured that the effort will be worthwhile. Forinstance, telemedicine gives officers and psychiatrists or other mental healthprofessionals an opportunity to ensure that preliminary assessments are per-b54 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectformed in a timely manner. These preliminary assessments help to guard against transportation that is ultimately unnecessary, and they ensure that proper ar-rangements are made to receive the individual. Ensure that comprehensive emergency psychiatric services are available to law enforcement agencies for around-the-clock intake,24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In most communities today, there are a limited number of clearly desig- nated emergency intake centers\u2014perhaps just one. Each intake center shouldhave staff on hand or on call that can respond quickly and make an assessmentof the needs of each person who comes to them. It is less important where theintake center is\u2014in a hospital or in a community mental health center, for ex-ample\u2014than that the staff at the center be informed of what resources arecurrently available and have the authority to place the individual in the appro-priate services. Investing staff with these \"gatekeeper\" functions is very impor-tant both for ensuring a smooth and rapid \"hand-off,\" and for coordinated fol-low-up\u2014whatever form it may take. Most important for police, of course, isthat mental health staff be able to rapidly assume responsibility for an indi-vidual brought to them so that the officer can resume his or her duties. Additionally, the community mental health center in some communities may operate an on-site emergency intake service only during business hours.Police and others would use the center at those times. After hours, the emer-gency intake service may shift to a local hospital, providing mental health work-ers with medical backup and laboratory services. In many settings, the mentalhealth workers at the hospital also answer the overnight emergency telephonecalls coming into the mental health center and thus have a sense of the demandfor services. If services are lacking, mental health, police, and other criminaljustice system professionals should lobby with consumer advocates for properappropriations for such facilities. In any setting, it is important that mental health workers be dedicated to emergency services, instead of being called away to treat accident victims orothers coming to the emergency room for nonpsychiatric reasons. In many set-tings, it should be noted, the staff on hand may not include a psychiatrist. In allcases, however, a psychiatrist must be on call and available on short notice. Example: The Providence Center (RI) In Providence, Rhode Island, the Pro vidence Center, a comm unity-based, non-profit mental health provider, maintains an emergency services center at its main treatmentsite that operates during extended business hours, Monday through Friday. Duringother hours, emergency services are provided at a nearby hospital, where a ProvidenceCenter employee answers the emergency telephone line and makes on-site assess-ments of individuals who come to the hospital or are transported by police or others.cChapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response \"If you don't have appro- priate access to treatment and services, the only option that most law en-forcement officers have in most situations is the county jail\" MAJOR SAM COCHRAN Coordinator, MemphisCrisis InterventionTeam, TN Source: \"Memphis Police Look to Help, Not Lock Up, MentallyIll.\" June 8, 1999, available at:www.cnn.com/health/9906/08/mental.health55 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectErratic behavior can be caused by drugs or alcohol and other medical con- ditions as well as by a mental illness. While police may suspect the cause oferratic behavior, the actual factors may not be known for days or weeks. It istherefore important for the receiving mental health staff to be knowledgeableabout the distinctions between mental illness, other medical conditions, anddrug or alcohol involvement. The intake staff must have access to laboratoryservices and other diagnostic technology to accurately assess detainees' needsfor treatment. Easy access to emergency medical care is similarly important.Staff must also be able to connect with needed drug and alcohol services and/orprofessionals with the ability to treat substance abuse and mental illness si-multaneously if such services are called for (see Policy Statement 1: Involve-ment With Mental Health System). Staff at the intake center must also be able to determine whether the indi- vidual meets criteria for involuntary commitment and, more important, be au-thorized to take appropriate steps in the event that commitment is warranted. When the person with mental illness does not meet the criteria for invol- untary commitment, it is especially important that law enforcement and staffat the intake center identify some short-term housing options for those who arehomeless. Without a linkage to some type of housing, the police are likely toencounter the person on the streets not long after dropping him off at the in-take center. Programs that make short-term housing available for individualswho do not meet the criteria for involuntary commitment should also work toconnect clients with long-term housing opportunities. Example: Baltimore Crisis Response, Inc. (BCRI), Baltimore City (MD) Baltimore Crisis Response, Inc. (BCRI) manages mental health crisis beds within Baltimore City that are available on a voluntary basis to individuals who do not meetcriteria for involuntary admission to a hospital and have not been charged with acrime that requires detainment. BCRI staff work closely with emergency rooms, theBaltimore Police Department, and mental health agencies to afford access to thesebeds as a form of pre-booking diversion. BCRI case managers work with individualsadmitted to the mental health crisis facility to connect them to long-term housing andother services. The type of insurance coverage an individual has can affect efforts to gain access to emergency psychiatric services. Private insurance, especially, may begoverned by \"medical necessity\" criteria that can be interpreted to exclude some-one with mental illness from emergency admission to some hospitals. Publiclyfunded mental health centers may be excluded from preferred provider listsdeveloped by private insurers, which in some instances can complicate or eveneliminate the possibility of admission. If an individual is an active Medicaid orMedicare patient, admission is still likely to be governed by some level of man-aged care admission criteria. While many hospitals and mental health centersreceive funds allowing them to accept uninsured individuals, the absence of56 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectany coverage complicates admission and, at a minimum, can cause further de- lays. None of these insurance issues are unique to mental health service deliv-ery, but when they arise in instances involving someone who is psychotic ordeeply suspicious they can stand between that person and the services he orshe needs. Formalize agreements between law enforcement and mental health partners participating in protocols. Chapter V: Improving Collaboration, discusses the importance of formal agreements between the criminal justice system and mental health system com-ponents on the roles and responsibilities of each partner. The following check-list outlines particular areas of such agreements that are specific to the con-cerns of law enforcement and mental health professionals when developingagreements. (See Policy Statement 26: Institutionalizing the Partnership, formore on elements of successful agreements.) \u0093What emergency detention authority do officers have and how will cus- todial transfer occur? It must include protections for taking the personinto custody and provide liability protection as long as they are in cus-tody. Partners will need to know what existing authority (local laws,indemnity clauses, and state statutes) may impact rights and obliga-tions. \u0093What information can be shared under what circumstances? Confiden-tiality provisions for verbal or document exchange should address whatwill happen when information is included in either police or mentalhealth reports that relates to an ongoing criminal investigation or to amental health treatment plan. (See Policy Statement 25: Sharing Infor-mation.) \u0093How do law enforcement officers make the determination whether ornot to place a person with mental illnesses in custody for transport to amental health facility? It is important to specify rules based on how theperson gets to the facility\u2014in custody or voluntarily. \u0093When does responsibility actually shift from the on-scene responder toa mental health professional? (This could be at the scene, by phone, in awaiting room, etc.) There must be clarification of the point at which theresponsibility to provide services transfers from one entity to the other. \u0093What intervention (such as an advocacy service) is available when aperson suspected of having a mental illness is being held in a holdingcell and is in need of services but who does not qualify for emergencyevaluation? \u0093What liability protection is in place? Liability suits are related to prac-tice, custom, policy, or accepted standards of care. The premise underliability law is that an officer cannot be sued for general duty to protectsomeone from being victimized, injured, or killed. However, if througha partnership a law enforcement agency creates a new special duty thatdChapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response57 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectit is later unable to fulfill, departments and/or officers can be held li- able. Law enforcement counsel should consider whether any agreementcreates a new special duty to the individual that would create liability ifbreached. Each party should be held liable for its own agents' actions. Ifthe memorandum of understanding (MOU) is carefully structured, abreach resulting in litigation would not focus on it being a joint venturewith shared liability. \u0093What are the budgetary considerations? Cost or funding responsibili-ties must be addressed. Ensure that mental health services and supports are available forevery person in need. Ideally, any person brought to a mental health provider by police officers will be someone already known to the system or will be able to easily fit intoexisting services. Unfortunately, such cases appear to be more the exception than the rule. Perhaps because people who are not already engaged in the sys- tem come into contact with the police more frequently than others who aresuccessfully engaged in treatment, they face a number of obstacles in entering the system. Because contact with police may, in fact, turn out to be a person's introduction to the mental health system, it is important that the system's doorbe open at this critical juncture and engagement not be made more difficult by bureaucratic concerns. Establishing protocols that allow a case to be opened or reopened smoothly can help with this process. An important test of the partnership between police and mental health providers is the ability of officers and providers to agree on who needs mentalhealth services. If police officers bring an individual they perceive to be in need to a provider, they expect the provider to offer appropriate services to that indi- vidual. Mental health providers must respect the observations and judgmentsof police officers charged with making quick decisions in the field. By the same token, police officers must respect the assessment of mental health providers about which cases they are able to address and which cases are beyond theircapacities. If the law enforcement and provider agencies have not worked to- gether before, it may take a period of trial and error for a balance to be struck. The important thing is for police and providers to ensure that they will learn asthey go along and that every effort will be made to meet each individual's needs in the process. There must also be an understanding that if an individual's needs cannot be met, there is a shared plan for getting those resources estab-lished. Even with appropriate training, police officers will occasionally seek ser- vices for someone who cannot be helped by the local mental health provider. Itis important in such instances, however, that providers not simply turn the individual away or leave him or her under the responsibility of the police. Pro- tocols should be developed that delineate how police and providers should worktogether to find some assistance for the individual, even if it is not in the men- tal health system.e58 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectOne source of assistance for people with mental illness is peer support programs. Several types of peer groups exist to help consumers, including Drop- In Centers, Warmlines, and Clubhouses. \"Drop-in centers\" are informal social and recreational programs that serve as information clearinghouses and meet-ing locations for other peer support groups, including 12-step groups. Tradi- tionally, people with mental illness fill staff positions. \"Warmlines\" are tele- phone support systems staffed by consumers trained to listen empathetically,provide information about appropriate resources, and act as a link to needed or desired supports and services. Warmline staff does not provide suicide inter- vention or crisis intervention, but they are trained to recognize the need toengage the more critical support offered by a suicide hotline. The staff also makes outgoing calls, contacting consumers who have asked to be called regu- larly to stay connected to a support system. \"Clubhouses\" are collaborativeefforts between professionally trained staff and consumers who provide voca- tional support and prepare consumers to enter into or return to the workforce. In many instances, law enforcement officers may deliver a person with a mental illness to a mental health provider only to discover that any of a number of complicating factors may make it difficult to connect that person with appro- priate services. For example, the provider will want to determine whether theperson has insurance or qualifies for Medicaid or other benefits or entitlements. Similarly, the person may have more than one diagnosis or display no interest in receiving services. In these instances, too, protocols must be in place to en-sure the delivery of appropriate services or responses. In some communities, ACT programs have been put in place or adapted to provide or arrange for comprehensive treatment and supports for people withmental illness whose behavior has brought them to the attention of law en- forcement. The concentrated individual attention that characterizes the ACT model can provide assurance that a person in need will receive appropriateservices. In other instances, it may be that clinical services aren't needed, and the most effective connection can be made with peer services, either at a drop- in center or through individual contact with a peer counselor who is trustedbecause of the shared experience of mental illness. Regardless of the model used, mental health providers should take steps to ensure thorough follow-up for any individual who is brought to them undermutually agreed conditions by law enforcement authorities. Follow up may help stop the cycle of repeated involvement with the criminal justice system, while offering mental health providers a ready barometer of conditions and situa-tions that receive police attention. \"Follow-up\" in this case means, at a mini- mum, a thorough examination, which may result in a referral to a more appro- priate provider. The protocols developed to ensure services must also include acomponent that allows providers and police to regularly assess the appropri- ateness of referrals. In addition, each participating agency should designate a liaison to work with counterparts to resolve problems.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response59 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Anne Arundel County (MD) Mobile Crisis Team The Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) approach is successful in Anne Arundel County be- cause the MCT is connected to a local clinic, emergency shelter beds, and an In-HomeIntervention Team. The MCT has the resources to ensure that people with mental illnesses get the intervention necessary. The Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Police Depart-ment is among other agencies using a similar approach. Ensure that specially trained mental health professionals are avail- able to respond to scenes involving barricaded or suicidal suspects. To respond as appropriately as possible in the incidences of barricaded subjects or violent situations, effective communication must exist between po- lice, special responders and department negotiators. While agencies are oftenunder pressure to resolve situations quickly, it is often the best approach to allow time for communication to work in these crisis situations. Hostage nego- tiators will likely be called to a scene when initial efforts by responding officersto resolve a critical incident have failed. The effective resolution of these encounters is also dependent on the in- volvement of specially selected and trained mental health professionals whohave expertise in crisis negotiation and familiarity with police operations. State- level mental health agencies will likely know of individuals suited to this role. These mental health professionals will be able to assist law enforcement inunderstanding the motivation for the incident, which is critical to defusing the situation. Provide information to victims with mental illness and their fami- lies to help prevent revictimization and increase understanding ofcriminal justice procedures. Research has shown that people with mental illness, like many people with disabilities, are at a greater risk for victimization. 3 People with mental illnesses have been shown to be vulnerable to sexual assault as well as other violentcrimes. 4 These crimes are also disproportionately unreported, probably be- cause these victims fear reprisals or retribution from their abusers for coming forward or fear the police won't believe them. People with mental illness who have been victimized repeatedly may con- fuse events in their reports to law enforcement. This confusion does not negate their victimization and the importance of investigating the crime. In fact, peoplewith mental illness may experience the trauma of victimization more acutely than other victims, partly because it triggers memories of past abuse. This history of abuse is relevant to case investigation and should be explored.f g 3. Virginia Hiday et al., \"Criminal Victimization of Persons with Severe Mental Illness,\" pp . 62-68; also J.A. Marley and S. violence happens to people with mentalillness: Disclosing victimization,\" of Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectUnfortunately, when victims with mental illness do report their crimes, they are frequently viewed as unreliable witnesses and their cases are often dropped. Law enforcement must become more aware of the complexities of work- ing with victims who have mental illness and should collaborate with theirmental health partners to increase the reliability of evidence. These profes- sionals can help law enforcement sort out these complex issues and improve case outcomes. Resources for responding to crime victims who have disabilitiescan be obtained through the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime. 5 Law enforcement agencies should provide information to these victims about available services that can help reduce their vulnerability and promote positivecontacts with the criminal justice system agents who can inform them of case progress. Law enforcement can also work with consumers and their advocates to conduct crime prevention outreach. Inform affected third parties, including victims, minors and the elderly, about what to expect and what community resources areavailable. Affected third parties can include victims, family members, employers, or others who share a home or part of their lives with people with mental illness.As in other similar situations, these individuals need a variety of supports and may look to law enforcement for help in accessing resources. In particular, victims (who may also be family members) should be apprised of the course ofaction to be taken by law enforcement and mental health agencies, and what they can expect the outcomes of the actions to be. They should also be made aware of national resources for victim assistance, including the National Orga-nization for Victim Assistance, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the Office for Victims of Crime. In many instances, families try to maintain normalcy when dealing with one of their own who has a mental illness. It may be that the incident resulting in police involvement is the first public acknowledgment of mental illness in the home. Or it may be that the incident is the first manifestation that hasclarified mental illness as a problem. In any case, the incident may represent the first time the family has reached out for help and thus the first opportunity for necessary supports to be made available to them. It is important, therefore,for police officers and mental health workers to be knowledgeable about the full range of resources that are available for families and others close to the af- fected person. For example, police departments and their mental health partners can provide information on peer supports, such as consumer-managed neighbor- hood projects, drop-in centers, and warmlines, which offer nonemergency sup-port to consumers by telephone. Regional NAMI affiliate organizations, com-h 5. C.G. Tyiska, \"Working at: www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/publica- tions/factshts/disable.htm .Chapter II: Contact Enforcement Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response61 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmunity chapters of the Depressive and Manic Depressive Association, and local United Way organizations are all good resources for peer support and services. Families may also contact statewide consumer-managed organizations, an ex- ample of which is the Tennessee Mental Health Consumer Network. If police have been called to a home as a result of a threat or threatening action, they should be able to inform family members in the home on ways to protect themselves. Even in instances where the individual is placed in treat-ment, voluntarily or involuntarily, it can usually be expected that he or she will be at liberty in the community within perhaps a matter of days. Families should be made aware of the process for obtaining a protective order, the associatedrisks and benefits, as well as what to expect should the order be obtained and violated by the ill family member. In many instances, of course, members of the family may represent classes given special status or protection under the law. Children of a person with men- tal illness, for example, may be subject to actions taken by the child protection authorities intended to remove them from the risk of harm. If elderly individu-als or spouses have been threatened or harmed, police may be required by law to arrest the individual family member or to notify other authorities. (It should be noted that mental health workers who uncover evidence of elderly, spousal,or child abuse may also be obligated under the law to notify certain authorities.) Families that report and deal with incidents have great need for support. They may feel isolated and not know where they can turn for information thatwill help them provide the best care for their relative and for themselves. It is helpful for police to be aware of the resources available to assist families in these situations, such as NAMI. However, it is essential that mental healthproviders be prepared to provide complete information on support and educa- tion resources to families. In some places, mental health agencies provide classes or resource centers stocked with information for families. More generally, community mental health providers rely on separate nonprofit organizations to provide information and support. Most commonly, these local organizations are affiliated with such pre-viously cited national organizations as NAMI, the National Mental Health As- sociation, or the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association and are able to offer information and programs developed by these organizations . By meeting and communicating with others who have been through similar situations, families are able to learn skills that will help them to be effective advocates for themselves and for their relatives. Law enforcement agencies should work with their mental health partners to prepare packets of information on available community-based resources for people with mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders and for their fami-lies. These packets should accommodate the full range of cultures and lan- guages present in the community.62 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Community Mental Health Centers Community mental health center s in many communities have prepared packets of information for families of clients receiving emergency services. These packets in-clude information about the services the center provides, the rights of patients, pay-ment options, and materials from the local NAMI affiliate and the statewide MentalHealth Association. In addition, counselors who meet the families in these initialencounters encourage the families to make contact with one of the organizations,taking time to allay their concerns about privacy, shame, and cost. The organizations,in turn, provide useful information, including Web addresses, book lists, schedules ofclasses or events, local contact information, as well as descriptions and contact infor-mation for area provider agencies. Disengage or transport the person to the appropriate facility with the least restrictive restraint possible. Depending on the nature of the response chosen, officers will either leave the person at the scene, transport the person to a mental health facility, trans- port the person to their home or to the home of a friend or family member, ortransport the person to a detention facility. If police are requested to transport the person to the mental health facility for a voluntary admission, this is service, not a custodial transport. In general, police can take a person with mental illness into custody, only (1) when the individual has committed a crime; (2) the individual is at significant risk of causing harm to self or others and meets the state's criteria for involuntaryemergency evaluation; or (3) in response to a court order or directive of a men- tal health or medical practitioner who has legal authority to commit a person to a mental health facility. Before agencies revise policies on custodial and noncustodial transfer of people with mental illness, pertinent laws and liability issues should be ex- plored. However, it is possible to decrease stigma and enhance the dignity of people with mental illness during the transport process. Example: Washington, D.C., Police Department A Washington, D.C., policy states that if the responding officer is asked to transport someone for voluntary admission and the officer deems the person to be nonviolent,the officer can provide transport to the facility without handcuffs. If a person's behavior poses an imminent risk of serious harm to self or others, officers may need to take reasonable steps to physically restrain the person. If time permits, guidance from a mental health professional should be sought about the best restraint methods for the person and situation. Unlessthere is immediate danger to the individual, others, or officers, responding of- ficers should move slowly and allow the person time to calm down in an effort to gain voluntary cooperation before resorting to physical restraints.iChapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 4: On-Scene Response63 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIn some communities, police are able to call mental health staff to handle transport. Often known as mobile crisis teams, these mental health units are able to assume responsibility for the individual in question on the scene, allow- ing officers to return to patrol. Example: Montgomery County (MD) Police Department In Montgomery County, Maryland, the Police Department's Crisis Intervention Team works closely with the county mental health agency's Crisis Response Team. In manyinstances, the Crisis Response Team is called to the scene by the CIT, allowing policeofficers to transfer responsibility for an individual without accompanying that personto a mental health intake center or hospital emergency room. Conduct suicide screening for all people with mental illness who are detained for a short time in a police lock-up or jail. Depending upon the jurisdiction, a person taken into custody for a crimi- nal offense is brought either to a police holding facility or to the local jail pend- ing the initial appearance in court. While this stay in custody awaiting thecourt appearance is usually brief\u2014in most instances less than 24 hours\u2014it can be a vital time for a person with mental illness. Research has shown that most suicides that occur in custody take place within the first 24 hours. 6 In addition, the behavior that led to the arrest may be the manifestation of an individual experiencing a mental health crisis. As a result, intake procedures into these facilities should screen for a risk of suicide and assess the need for emergency psychiatric evaluation. Staff should also be trained in suicide prevention and crisis management procedures. These screening procedures are for the purpose of providing appropriate treatment,not for gathering evidence for a criminal proceeding. Agency staff should also note that people with mental illness may need access to their medication. Offic- ers must follow departmental rules for verifying that any pills or capsules theperson is carrying are prescribed, or to obtain the needed medication, so that they may authorize the individual to continue the prescribed treatment should they be detained. As mentioned earlier, police officers should be aware that some medica- tions that treat mental illness have side effects that may require attention. For example, medications may cause tremors, nausea, extreme lethargy, confusion,dry mouth, constipation, or diarrhea. Police officers should attend to needs for water, food, and access to toilet facilities. It is important not to mistake these side effects as evidence of alcohol or drug abuse. (See Policy Statement 13: In-take at County / Municipal Detention Facility, for more information on intake procedures.)j 6. L.M. Hayes, Prison Suicide: An Overview and Guide to Prevention, National Institute of Corrections, 1995, available at: www.nicic.org/pubs/1995/012475.pdf64 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIncident Documentation POLICY STATEMENT #5 Document accurately police contacts with people whose mental ill- ness was a factor in an incident to promote accountability and to en-hance service delivery. While not all contacts with the public result in documentation, law enforcement agencies do collectinformation about most of their encounters with thepublic at several points: when the call comes in to the agency; when the officer clears the call and re- turns to service; when an official report is filed; andwhen supplemental reports are submitted. Manyagencies maintain sophisticated computerized sys-tems, while others rely on more traditional paper-based systems. Regardless of the level of sophisti-cation, however, it is critical that data be reliable, accurate, and consistently entered. When the call comes in to the agency dispatch, some agencies use a Computer Aided Dispatch(CAD) system that maintains important data ele-ments on all calls for service. These systems keeptrack of calls based on their geographic location, and can show numbers and types of calls over time. When the officer has completed the call, he or shecontacts the dispatcher to clear the call and can up-date the nature of the call at that time. Althoughnot all departments have a CAD system, all do main-tain some system for tracking calls for service. Many agencies also maintain additional com- puterized data systems, often called Records Man-agement Systems, or RMS, which capture informa-tion submitted on incident or arrest reports. Thesedata may be used by police to manage a great deal5 of information about contacts with the police, up toand including arrest. These data are analyzed todetect crime patterns and evaluate the police re-sponse. Supplemental reports for particular types of incidents may also be maintained in computer- ized formats, or in file cabinets, depending on thequantity of the information and its intended use. Law enforcement agencies must consistently and accurately document their contacts with peoplewho have mental illness, just as they should for allencounters\u2014for consumers' protection and to pro- vide better law enforcement service. Just as infor- mation has certain benefits, however, it also hasrisks to the consumer and his or her family. Forthis reason, privacy laws protect personal medicalinformation, including information about a person'smental health, and limit the occasions when a medi- cal professional can share that information without consent. A full discussion of protected informationand its disclosure is provided in Policy Statement25: Sharing Information. The recommendations in this section address how law enforcement should capture data and un- der what circumstances. Ultimately, departments that develop effective internal information-manage-ment systems will depend less on mental health sys-tem information protected by privacy laws and bebetter prepared to address the needs of people with mental illness in the long term.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 5: Incident Documentation65 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION a Capture information related to mental illness consistently in calls- for-service data. Regardless of agency size, law enforcement agencies should use special numerical codes when storing data to indicate when mental illness was a factorin the call for service. 7 Smaller departments may document incidences using index cards while some larger departments may use computer equipment. Insmaller jurisdictions without advanced Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) sys-tems, dispatchers must be specially trained to collect detailed information thatcan be stored in location files or similar data sources. Officers should also be required to update this numerical code when clear- ing the call to change the nature of the call if they determine that mental illnessis an issue. For example, if an officer is called for a noise complaint and finds aman having a psychotic episode who is a danger to himself, the call should becleared to reflect this new information. If the officer determines that mentalillness is not a factor in a call that was dispatched as such, he or she should also denote that change for dispatch. Many CAD systems have only one field that captures the type of call and officers are asked to pick the most relevant code. Agencies will need to provideguidance to officers as to how and when to prioritize the mental illness as thecritical feature of the call. By using appropriate clearance codes in the CADsystem, law enforcement agencies can track information (such as repeat callsinvolving a person with mental illness) and assess agency responses. Some departments also choose to place \"flags\" on certain locations in the CAD system (see Policy Statement 2: Request for Police Service). These flagsappear when repeated calls for service are made to that location. The dispatcherthen reads the text of the flag when dispatching the call to provide additionalinformation to the responding officers. These flags are placed only on those call locations that pose a particular concern, such as potential for violence or as arepeat location. Personnel are designated to review these flags periodically tomake sure the flags continue to reflect current issues or problems. Example: Baltimore County (MD) Police Department In the Baltimore County Police Department, supervisors make written requests to the communications center to place a flag on certain locations where police have made repeated calls or where there has been a history of weapons use or violence. Theseflags are used for a wide variety of calls, not just those related to mental healthproblems. 7. Law enforcement agencies should only document infor- mation about mental illness when it is relevant to the en- counter. Agencies should not develop databases that con-66 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectCollect information related to mental illness accurately in police reports and supplemental forms, focusing on observable behavior. Although information about a person's mental illness on written police re- ports is important for accuracy and to clarify officers' response choices, it hasthe potential to influence criminal case outcomes negatively. For that reason,care must be taken in the way that information pertaining to mental illness isdocumented. Most important, officers should be trained to concentrate on documenting observable behavior, not pseudo-diagnoses or damaging slang. For example, reports should never include a box stating that a person is mentally ill, butcould instead list indicators of mental illness involved (see Policy Statement 3:On-Scene Assessment, for examples of indicators of mental illness). Report forms should also allow room for officers to include their own obser- vations. However, officers should not draw conclusions in their observationsabout what they believe has caused the behavior, such as that the person is \"offhis meds,\" without supporting information. Whenever possible, local mentalhealth professionals should participate in training officers about the type ofinformation to be included in a report based on federal, state, and local laws.Confidential information shared by mental health professionals should not bedocumented in police reports. Departments may also want to consider using supplemental forms that capture additional information about police contacts with people with mentalillnesses. These forms should not become part of the charging documents andshould be kept confidential. This documentation can provide information aboutthe nature of the problem, mental health resources that were accessed, and theway police responded. This information will be helpful to internal decision-making processes, such as the allocation of resources, but will not be part of theindividual's arrest record. Example: Memphis (TN) Crisis Intervention Team The CIT approaches used around the country employ a report form that is completed by the responding CIT officer and maintained by the coordinator for review and track-ing. Memphis, Tennessee, and Montgomery County, Maryland, Police Departmentsuse such a form to document incident specifics such as the living arrangement of theperson, the use of restraints, and the disposition chosen. Police observations related to a person's mental illness are also collected on commitment forms, which in many jurisdictions give only two lines to reportobservations. Commitment forms must be useful for police, which means shortand fast, but they should have sufficient space to record observations that wouldbe useful to mental health providers. These forms are used to indicate probablecause for emergency holds of individuals thought likely to meet criteria for in-voluntary commitment and will be presented to judges during civil commit-bChapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 5: Incident Documentation \"In terms of information, law enforcement needs to know enough to resolve the situation and keeppeople safe, but some of the detail and nuance are better kept confidential. Iflaw enforcement has cer- tain information, it can stigmatize the person withmental illness, and that can stay with the person for a long time.\" CHIEF CHARLES MOOSEMontgomery CountyPolice Department, MD67 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectment proceedings. Often, police officers have had the best opportunity to ob- serve behaviors that may indicate need for involuntary treatment, so an accu-rate and professional description in such instances is important. Document information relating to a person's mental illness only when that information is relevant to the incident. Officers should document information about mental illness only when that illness is relevant to the police contact. For example, a suspect may have de-pression that is not relevant to the crime he or she is accused of. Similarly, forsome victims of crime who have a mental illness, that illness is not relevant tothe situation and thus should not be recorded.c68 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aPolice Response Evaluation POLICY STATEMENT #6 Collaborate with mental health partners to reduce the need for subse- quent contacts between people with mental illness and law enforce- ment. An important goal of any police response is to ensure that people with mental illness are wellserved by the services that are brought to bear andthat approaches being implemented have the effectof reducing contacts with the criminal justice sys-tem. The way to assess how well services are work-ing involves doing two things: consulting with ser-6 vice providers to evaluate referral mechanisms andidentifying individuals who continue to come intocontact with the police. It is important when con-ducting any kind of assessment for the participantsto have clearly articulated the program goals. Chap-ter V: Improving Collaboration and Chapter VIII:Evaluating Outcomes also address these topics.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement Policy Statement 6: Police Response Evaluation Consult with service providers to evaluate rates of success in en- gaging people referred by the police. Law enforcement agencies should consult with service providers (includ- ing those who focus on minors and victims) to gather information on the out-come of the police referrals. It is important, as always, that private informationabout the individuals seeking treatment be kept confidential. Consulting withproviders serves as an evaluation tool to assess whether services were madeavailable and accessed following encounters with law enforcement. Agenciesshould examine in-house protocols to ensure that referrals were made and toidentify other resource issues. This consultation can be conducted during routine partnership meetings where police and mental health practitioners review data they have collected.It is very important that these data be presented in the aggregate rather than69 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectfor each individual.8 For example, the law enforcement representative can pro- vide the number of people who were referred for services, which can be com-pared to the mental health representatives' notes on how many people con-tacted the service. In this way, confidentiality is maintained, yet problems withthe protocol can be examined. Analyze police data to identify individuals who have repeat con- tacts with law enforcement and collaborate with mental healthpartners to develop long-term solutions. A proactive approach is fundamental to the philosophy of community polic- ing. This involves identifying problem situations and working with communitypartners to craft long-term solutions. \"Problem\" situations involving people withmental illness are those that result in repeat calls to the police. These situationsmay not be resolved by existing protocols, may escalate in seriousness, and re-quire a more in-depth look into the underlying causes of the problem. To identify these cases, agencies must review internal databases designed to capture information on situations involving people with mental illness. Asmentioned previously, some departments review CAD system data to reveallocations that previously have involved violence or that result in frequent callsfor service. Other agencies review supplemental data forms collected by crisisintervention teams. Once the case has been identified, law enforcement personnel should work closely with their mental health partners to identify the precise nature of theproblem and the possible causes. 9 Together police and mental health providers can then determine a course of action to help the person avoid further contactswith the police. It is always preferable for mental health personnel to conductfollow-up visits, should they be required, although some departments have paireda mental health professional with an officer who is not in uniform. Example: Anne Arundel County (MD) Mobile Crisis Team Mental health professionals from the Mobile Crisis Team in Anne Arundel County provide follow up for people with mental illness who have come in contact with locallaw enforcement.b 8. This does not preclude police involvement in problem- solving teams, when requested to do so by mental health partners. 9. Many law enforcement agencies around the country use the Scanning Analysis Response and Assessment (SARA) model of problem solving. For more information about theSARA model, see Goldstein, Herman, Problem-Oriented Policing , McGraw Hill, Inc., New York, 1990; also M. Reuland, C.S. Brito, and L. Carroll (Eds.), Solving Crimeand Disorder Problems: Current Issues, Police Strategies and Organizational Tactics, Police Executive Research Fo- rum, Washington, DC, 2001.70 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectCONCLUSION Those in law enforcement are continually bombarded with demands from constituents who want their concerns to be given top priority, mandated train-ing, new resources, or revised protocols. Officers and other police personnel arefrustrated with repeat calls for service that have no satisfactory resolution foranyone involved. They want to address problems before they escalate into con-frontations that can have deadly consequences. They want to use their re-sources effectively and efficiently. At the end of the day, they want to improvethe lives of people who struggle with mental illness as well as all those touchedby the consequences of unmet mental health needs. It is for them that thissection has been written. Police are frequently the only 24-hour service providers citizens in a com- munity know to contact for help. Many police departments lack the resourcesor mental health networks to reduce the costs\u2014in human lives, quality of life,and dollars. It is hoped that this report will assist them in finding more imme-diate help to divert those who are better served by the mental health system,without threat to public safety. For those individuals whose needs continue togo unmet, there is still hope that the reforms suggested in the following sec-tions on courts and corrections will prevent them from cycling back to the streets,no better off than when they started. These subsequent chapters, in addition to the chapters in Part Two: Overarching Themes, will help police professionals and others fully understandhow the actions of one component of the criminal justice system can so signifi-cantly affect others. The report presents creative strategies for collaborationand propose the kind of mutual support that can convince policymakers to makethe reforms that each of them has unsuccessfully pressed for individually.Chapter II: Contact with Law Enforcement71 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectPretrial Issues, Adjudication, and SentencingCHAPTER III n jurisdictions where the law enforce- ment recommendations presented in the previous chapter are imple- mented, a great many people with mental illness who are currently brought to the court system for possible criminal prosecution will instead be diverted to an appropriate placement inthe mental health system. For those who are re- ferred for prosecution, the following policy state- ments and recommendations describe improve-ments courts can make that will assure that justice is served while meeting the needs of people with mental illness. The extent to which these improvements can be made depends upon the level of services cur- rently available in a jurisdiction. These policy state-ments and recommendations are written with two assumptions. The first is that the policy statements and recommendations contained elsewhere in thisdocument pertaining to enhancements to mental health services are implemented (see Chapter I: Involvement with the Mental Health system andChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System). It would be counterproductive forthe court to enhance its referral capacities with no enhancements to existing mental health services. The second assumption is that the jurisdiction pro- vides such services as early appointment of defensecounsel; a victim assistance office; pretrial diver- sion through the prosecutor's office; and a pretrial services program that provides information and op-tions to the court at the initial bail-setting hearing. Many jurisdictions do have all these services, and should be well positioned to take immediate advan-tage of the recommendations outlined here. Many other jurisdictions lack one or all of these services. Even in such jurisdictions, it would be possible toimplement incremental change that could still have a dramatic impact on how the criminal justice sys- tem responds to people with mental illness. The text includes many examples of initiatives jurisdictions have taken to improve the processing of people with mental illness through the courts.The inclusion of these examples is not meant to imply that jurisdictions need expensive new initia- tives to make improvements. In many instances,simple adjustments to existing procedures can be very effective.I73 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSeveral of the events discussed in this chap- ter\u2014appointment of counsel, consultation with vic- tims, prosecutorial review of charges, and pretrial release/detention hearing\u2014all occur early in the lifeof a criminal court case. There is, however, no single process employed in all jurisdictions for when a criminal case is filed in court. In some, the defen-dant is appointed an attorney even before the pros- ecutor has reviewed the charges, or the two occur simultaneously. In others, the appointment of coun-sel does not occur until much later in the process. In some, the pretrial release/detention hearing oc- curs well before either appointment of counsel orprosecutorial review of charges. In yet others, con- tact with victims occurs even before any of these steps. The appointment of counsel is presented herefirst since so much of what is being recommended in this document depends on consent of the indi- vidual for the release of mental health information,and because consent should not be sought without first offering the person access to an attorney.74 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aAppointment of Counsel POLICY STATEMENT #7 Make defense attorneys aware of the following: (a) the mental health condition, history and needs of their clients as early as possible inthe court process; (b) the current availability of quality mental healthresources in the community; and (c) current legislation and case lawthat might affect the use of mental health information in the resolu-tion of their client's case. When a case is filed in court an inquiry is typi- cally made regarding the defendant's financial abil-ity to retain an attorney. If the defendant is foundto be indigent, an attorney is provided. If the defen-dant is found to have sufficient financial resources,he or she is responsible for hiring his or her ownattorney. Not surprisingly, most defendants in crimi-nal cases are appointed counsel because they arefound to be indigent. The unique role that defense counsel plays for his or her client\u2014spokesperson, translator, and courtchampion\u2014becomes even more important when theclient suffers from a mental illness. There are threekey issues\u2014all defense related\u2014addressed in thispolicy statement. First, it is important that defense7 counsel have speedy access to existing mental healthinformation about the defendant. Information col-lected by law enforcement, pretrial services andother justice agencies, or from family membersshould be made available to the defense as soon asthey are assigned or agree to represent a client.Second, attorneys have a responsibility to knowabout the mental health resources in the commu-nity\u2014both their quality and their availability\u2014thatmight be appropriate for clients with mental healthissues, both pre- and post-adjudication. Third, thepolicy statement underscores the affirmative obli-gation of attorneys to be current as to laws that couldaffect their clients who have mental illness. Ensure that defense counsel can identify the mental health status of their clients as soon as possible after appointment. The American Bar Association Standards Relating to Providing Defense Services state, \"Counsel should be provided to the accused as soon as feasibleChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 7: Appointment of Counsel \"Defense attorneys are often ill-equipped to repre-sent people with mental illness. Training about mental illness and mentalhealth resources in the community is a key means of ensuring that defen-dants with mental illness receive the best possible representation.\" JO-ANN WALLACE Vice President & ChiefCounsel for DefenderAssociation Source: Personal correspondence75 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectand, in any event, after custody begins, at appearance before a committing mag- istrate, or when charges are filed, whichever occurs earliest.\"1 One of the first actions of defense counsel after appointment should be to identify those clientswith severe mental illness. This can be done by interviewing the defendant,and reviewing the police report and the information obtained by the pretrialservices program. At least one state, Georgia, has a statute that allows defenseattorneys access to state mental health records with the consent of the client. It can also be done by listening to family members or others who may be in a position to provide useful information about the mental health status of theclient. Attorneys should be careful, however, not to divulge information about aclient's mental health status to any of these parties without first obtaining theconsent of the client. Example: Public Defender's Office, Hamilton County (OH) In Hamilton County, a defense attorney is assigned to the case as soon as it is deter- mined that the defendant may have a mental illness and the case is continued to aspecial afternoon calendar. The defense counsel consults with the defendant before aclinical assessment is conducted by a mental health clinician. The mental health system should work with the defense counsel to assure that counsel has all the information needed to effectively represent a client. Ensure that defense counsel can identify alternatives to incarcera- tion in appropriate cases for their clients with mental illness. In some jurisdictions it falls to a pretrial services program to identify and track programs in the community that could be used for referrals of defen-dants, and to probation departments to do the same for post-conviction alterna-tives. This recommendation calls for the defense to be equally familiar withmental health resources in the local community. Defense counsel should knowprogram admission criteria and requirements; required lengths of stay; confi-dentiality rules imposed by the program; clinical capabilities; availability; andcosts. Finally, defense counsel should be aware of the qualitative performanceof such programs. Obtaining this knowledge may require access by defenders to expert ser- vices. In many jurisdictions, the public defender's office has staff who assistattorneys in finding appropriate alternatives. Example: Public Defender's Office, King County (WA) In King County, social workers are assigned to the public defender's office to help defense attorneys identify and develop mental health treatment alternatives to incar-ceration for defendants with mental illness.b 1. American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Jus- tice: Providing Defense Services, 3rd Edition, Washington, D.C., 1992, Standard 5-6.1, Initial Provision of Counsel.\"Defense attorneys aren't thinking about me as anindividual who has a men-tal illness. ...They arethinking about the short-term of this case. If theyknew more about mentalillness, they would dothings differently.\" CONSUMER Source: Derek Denckla and Greg Berman, Rethinking the Revolving Door: A Look at Mental Illness in the Courts , New York, Center for Court Innovation. 2001.76 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIn other jurisdictions\u2014particularly small jurisdictions\u2014defenders may have very limited resources. Yet even then, at least one state has taken on theresponsibility of providing expert services to defenders in all parts of the state. Example: Georgia Indigent Defense Counsel In Georgia, much of the information regarding alternatives to incarceration for people with mental illness is catalogued by the Georgia Indigent Defense Counsel (GIDC),which serves as an information resource center for defense attorneys throughout thestate. The GIDC provides defense a ttorneys with seminars and publications address- ing the special needs of clients with mental illness. The GIDC is also available todefense counsel for telephone consultation on individual cases. Develop materials and training programs that cover recent legal holdings that might affect the client with a mental illness. Defense counsel representing persons with mental illness must carefully consider how mental health information may potentially be used\u2014not just inthe instant circumstance but in future hearings involving the client as well.Counsel must also be aware of the potential ramifications of actions being con-sidered. For example, advising a defendant to plead not guilty by reason ofinsanity to a relatively minor offense could expose the defendant to more exten-sive loss of liberty than in simply pleading guilty. (See Policy Statement 29:Training for Court Personnel.) Make resources available to the family members and friends of people with mental illness to help them navigate the criminal jus-tice system. When a person with mental illness becomes involved in the criminal jus- tice system, his or her family, friends, mental health service providers, andother advocates may want to help in a variety of ways. Family members maywant to inform the defense attorney about the defendant's mental health his-tory, to advocate for the defendant's placement in a particular treatment pro-gram, or generally to help their loved one navigate the criminal justice system.Advocates in some communities have developed resources for such situations. Example: When a Person with Mental Illness is Arrested: How to Help , Urban Justice Center, New York City (NY) Staff at the Urban Justice Center's Mental Health Project have developed a practical handbook for supporters of people with mental illness who have become involved inthe criminal justice system. The handbook provides general information about thecriminal justice process (arrest, arraignment, meeting with counsel), relevant stat-utes, and advice for advocates on wor king with defense attorneys, as well as informa- tion specific to the New York City criminal justice system.Determining What Is in the Client's Best Interests A defense attorney representing a defendant with a mental illnesscan face difficult decisions in try-ing to determine what advice tothe defendant would be in thedefendant's best interests. On theone hand, the attorney has anobligation to reduce thedefendant's possible exposure tosanctioning by the criminal jus-tice system by removing him orher as quickly as possible fromits jurisdiction. To that end, theattorney may believe that the bestresolution of a case where theevidence is strong is a quick pleaof guilty and acceptance of ashort jail term, perhaps evencredit for any time served, andmay make that recommendationto the court. On the other hand,the attorney may recognize thatthe defendant will continue to berearrested if his or her mentalhealth needs are not addressedand that having a criminal recordmay make it more difficult for thedefendant to obtain a job and toreceive such services as publichousing. In that sense, the attor-ney may advise that the bestcourse of action is to try to getthe defendant accepted into a pre-trial diversion program where heor she would be under the super-vision of the criminal justice sys-tem while in mental health treat-ment, and where charges wouldbe dropped upon successfulcompletion. There are no right or wrong an- swers to this issue. Defense at-torneys should present all pos-sible consequences to theirclients when discussing optionsfor the resolution of the case. c dChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 7: Appointment of Counsel77 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project78 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aConsultation with Victim POLICY STATEMENT #8 Educate individuals who have been victimized by a defendant with a mental illness, or their survivors, about mental illness and how thecriminal justice system deals with defendants with mental illness. Victims in most jurisdictions have constitu- tional or statutorily defined rights. Generally, theseinvolve the right to be informed of key events in theprocessing of the case, including charging decisions,plea agreements, and release decisions. 2 Prosecutors or their agents have traditionally played a key role in the provision of victim supportservices, including explaining the often complexcourt processes to the victims of crime. This provi-sion of support\u2014explanations and education\u2014be-gins as the charges are reviewed and filed, and goeson throughout the court process. It is important tostress that the victim of a crime committed by a per-son with a mental illness has no more rights than8 any other victim in a similar situation, but may havemore needs. When the mental health status of theaccused is relevant to the processing of the criminalcase, the pain of the victim can be exacerbated bythe even more confusing jargon, procedures, deci-sions, and even dispositions that might arise in theprosecution of that person. It must be kept in mind that most crimes com- mitted by people with mental illness are minor, andmay involve no victim. Victims' issues, in general,are most relevant where the crime is a serious one,involving harm or risk of harm to the victim. Therecommendation that follows is meant to addressthese types of crimes. Assure that victim assistance offices have the expertise to meet the special needs of people who have been victimized by someonewith a severe mental illness. In recent years, great strides have been made in recognizing that victims of crime need assistance understanding both the legal process involved in the 2. See www.ncvc.org for more on statutes concerning victims rights.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing tion with Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project3. There are a number of different ways that victims can gain access to these services. The law enforcement agency investigating the crime should have referral information tovictims' services. Listings for such services may appear in the telephone directory under either the local prosecutor's or the sheriff's office. These offices may also have websites with information on how to access these services. The federal government also has taken steps to expand the availability of victims' services with the establishment ofthe Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) within the Office of Justice Programs of the U.S. Department of Justice. OVC provides funding to state and local victim assistance pro-grams. Information about OVC is available at: www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/ 4. While many of these offices are administratively lo- cated in the prosecutor's office, they can also be found in the local department of corrections, sheriff's department, police department, or probation office.prosecution of their case and their rights as victims. Many jurisdictions have established victim assistance offices that provide services to victims of crime,usually violent crimes. 3 Staff from these offices typically act as a link between the prosecutor and victims, keep victims apprised of the status of the case,explain the court process to victims, and escort victims to court hearings. 4 This recommendation addresses how offices that provide victim assistance can bet-ter address the needs of persons who have been victimized by someone with amental illness. Information In cases where the accused person suffers from a mental illness the victim needs to be aware of the ways in which the criminal justice and mental healthsystems converge. Defendants with a mental illness may be subject to differentlegal procedures, such as a competency screening to determine their ability tounderstand the charges and their fitness to stand trial. In addition, victimsmay know little about mental illness\u2014its causes, its impact on behavior, andhow best to treat it. Providing such information should be viewed not as mini-mizing the victimization experienced, but as help for victims in understandingwhy they were victimized\u2014an important part of the healing process. Confidentiality versus the Right to Know The rights of victims to be informed about what is going on with their case must be balanced, however, against the medical privacy rights of the personwith mental illness. It may be difficult for victims to understand that the pri-vacy rights of the person who victimized them outweigh their rights to informa-tion. There are actions that should be taken, though, to assure that victimsreceive all the information to which they are entitled. Victims should be in-formed immediately and as a matter of routine of any actions taken that be-come part of the public record. These would include when the defendant isbeing released, whether on pretrial diversion, pretrial release, or as part of asentence, with the condition to participate in mental health treatment; when acompetency screening has been ordered; or when the defendant enters a plea ofnot guilty by reason of insanity. In the overwhelming majority of victimizations caused by people with men- tal illness, however, releasing mental health information to the victim will not\"When someone is victim- ized by an individual withmental illness they have ahuge learning curve. Ex-plaining to victims how thecriminal justice systemworks and what theirrights are is one of ourjobs. It gets really compli-cated for us to explain therole of the mental healthsystem. We as advocatesoften don't understandhow two Consensus Project5. Victims of Mentally Ill Offenders: Helping Family Caregivers and Strangers At Risk of Assault, New York University, Ehrenkranz School of Social Work's InstituteAgainst Violence, December 2000.be an issue because the victim is already aware of the situation. It is estimated that 85 percent of those victimized by a person with a mental illness are eitherfamily or friends of the perpetrator. 5 These victims need assistance at yet an- other level. A typical reaction of a loved one who has been victimized by aperson with mental illness is to try to obtain help for that person. After per-haps experiencing numerous victimizations without pressing criminal charges,these victims ultimately may turn to the criminal justice system out of fear orfrustration. When doing so, they may feel torn by being the complaining wit-ness against a loved one. When they wish to do so, they should be advised onsuch issues as how to contact the defendant's attorney, how to assist in gettinga signed consent to the release of the defendant's mental health information,and who to contact in the jail to make sure that the defendant is receiving his orher medications. They may also require additional supportive services to helpresolve issues of guilt in reporting their loved one. In short, in addition to the general role of victim assistance to explain how the criminal justice system works and what victims' legal rights are, when thealleged perpetrator has a mental illness victim assistance should also be pre-pared to do the following: \u0093explain the causes of mental illness and the impact it can have on a person's behavior; \u0093explain how the mental health system works, including confidentialityrequirements; \u0093define terminology that the victim may encounter, such as \"competency,\"\"mental health court,\" and \"Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity;\" and \u0093help family members or others who have been victimized by a loved onewith mental illness deal with issues of guilt.Victims with Mental Illness It is important to note that, con- trary to the public perception thatpeople with mental illness aremore likely to commit violentcrimes, studies show that indi-viduals with mental illness areactually more likely to be the vic-tims of violent crimes than peoplewithout mental illness. Thoughthis issue is, in large part, be-yond the scope of this report, vic-tims' assistance offices shouldconsider developing the expertiseto meet the special needs of vic-tims who have mental illness.These crime victims often face avariety of challenges, includinglow employment, lack of afford-able housing, and substanceabuse. 6 6. Hiday et al., \"Criminal Victimization of Persons with Severe Mental Illness.\"Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProsecutorial Review of Charges POLICY STATEMENT #9 Maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through pretrial di- version in appropriate cases involving people with a mental illness. As the representative of the state, the prosecu- tor is responsible for ensuring that criminal casesare resolved in the best interests of justice. 7 The best interests of justice can sometimes be served byextending to the individual the opportunity to ad-dress issues that may have led to the commission ofthe alleged offense without prosecuting the indi-vidual. When the case involves a minor offense orfirst-time offender, the prosecutor has the author-ity in many jurisdictions to provide that opportu-nity through pretrial diversion. Authorizing which defendants will be offered pretrial diversion rests with the prosecutor and isaddressed on a case-by-case basis in accordance withthe laws of the jurisdiction authorizing diversion.Unlike the pretrial release/detention decision dis-cussed in Policy Statement 11, the decision ofwhether to offer the defendant the opportunity to9 participate in a pretrial diversion program is at thediscretion of the prosecutor. Prosecutors typicallyrely on a number of criteria, including the potentialdanger to the community, the nature of the offense,the defendant's prior criminal record, and the wishesof the victim, in reaching a diversion decision. Whenfaced with a defendant with a mental illness, pros-ecutors should also look at the relationship betweenthe defendant's mental condition, whether the de-fendant was receiving adequate community treat-ment, and the behavior that led to the arrest. Highlighting diversion programs designed es- pecially for people with mental illness by no meanssuggests that these individuals should not have thesame access to any diversion programs that areavailable in a jurisdiction to a person without men-tal illness. 7. \"The prosecutor must seek justice. In doing so there is a need to balance the interests of all members of soci- ety, but when the balance cannot be struck in an individual case, the interest of society is paramount for the prosecu- tor,\" (emphasis in the original). National District Attor- neys Association, National Prosecution Standards , Com- mentary to Standard 1, p. 11.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 9: Prosecutorial Review of Charges83 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aDiversion Defined8 The use of the term \"diversion\" here employs the definitionspelled out in the Diversion Stan-dards of the National Associationof Pretrial Services Agencies.\"[A] dispositional practice is con-sidered diversion if: (1) it offerspersons charged with criminaloffenses alternatives to tradi-tional criminal justice or juvenilejustice proceedings; and (2) itpermits participation by the ac-cused only on a voluntary basis;and (3) it occurs no sooner thanthe filing of formal charges andno later than a final adjudicationof guilt; and (4) it results in adismissal of charges, or itsequivalent, if the divertee suc-cessfully completes the diversionprocess.\"Provide sufficient dispositional opportunities for people with men- tal illness for prosecutors to employ early in the court process. The crux of this recommendation is the need for more dispositional diver- sion programs for individuals with mental illness who come in contact with thecriminal justice system. Pretrial diversion programs have been in existence inmany jurisdictions for decades, serving mostly first-time offenders or thosecharged with minor offenses. The earliest diversion programs were based onthe recognition that the justice process itself could be harmful\u2014in some in-stances, criminogenic\u2014and that for certain types of defendants, \"diverting\" themfrom the traditional process into a rehabilitative program and holding theircharge in abeyance would reduce the likelihood of recidivism. 9 This same recognition surfaces when considering the person with a mental illness who ischarged with a crime. There are jurisdictions that provide pretrial diversion opportunities spe- cifically for defendants with mental illness. Example: Mental Health Diversion Program, Jefferson County (KY) In Jefferson County, the Mental Health Diversion Program serves nonviolent defen- dants charged with either misdemeanors or felonies who suffer from chronic mentalillness and have a history of treatment for mental illness. Defendants who are placedin pretrial diversion undergo intensive treatment for a period of six months to oneyear. Upon successful completion, the charges are dismissed. Several jurisdictions have been developing models for community prosecu- tion, in which prosecutors reach out to the community to seek input and assis-tance in both preventing and responding to crime. Community prosecutionmay be an effective vehicle for expanding the opportunities for diverting fromprosecution people with mental illness. Ensure that the defense and the mental health community work together to provide, in appropriate cases, mental health informa-tion to the prosecutor for use in pretrial diversion decisions. When an arresting officer brings a case to the prosecutor's office, a pros- ecutor screens the case to determine whether to file criminal charges, and, if so,which charges. 10 The police report, which describes the circumstances that led 8. National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies, Performance Standards and Goals for Pretrial Release and Diversion, August 1995, p. 1. 9. For an excellent review of the early years of diversion programming, see John P . Bellassai, \"Pretrial Diversion: The First Decade in Retrospect,\" The Pretrial Services An- nual Journal 1, 1978, pp. 14-41.10. According to t he standards of the National District Attorneys Association, prosecutors should exercise that discretion using several criteria, including the strength of the evidence against the accused and the agreement of thevictim to cooperate. Two other criteria are undue hardship caused to the accused and the availability of suitable diver- sion and rehabilitative programs. National District Attor-neys Association, National Prosecution Standards , 1990.b84 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectto the arrest of the individual, might note any overt behaviors that are indica- tors of mental illness. (See Policy Statement 5: Incident Documentation.) Thatreport usually is made available to prosecutors very early in the life of the case\u2014sometimes within hours of arrest. Often, however, prosecutors may have noindication of possible mental health issues when reviewing the arrest informa-tion. The arrestee may not have exhibited symptoms of mental illness at thetime of the incident, or the officer may have believed that the person was underthe influence of drugs or alcohol. Without such information, the prosecutorcannot consider special accommodations that the defendant might need to besuccessful in pretrial diversion or any specialized mental health diversion pro-gram that might be appropriate. Procedures have been implemented in somejurisdictions to gather mental health information for the pretrial diversion de-cision. Example: Pretrial Services Program, Pima County (AZ) In Pima County, the prosecutor uses information collected by the pretrial services program for the pretrial release hearing to identify misdemeanor defendants who havea mental illness and who might be candidates for pretrial diversion. Those placed inthe diversion program undergo a 180-day treatment program. Charges are dismissedupon successful completion of the program; prosecution resumes if the program isnot completed. In this example and others like it, the defendant has given prior written consent for the release of mental health information for the purpose of deter-mining possible placement in a pretrial diversion program. The consent shouldbe provided only after the defendant has consulted with his or her attorney.(See Policy Statement 7: Appointment of Counsel, for more on consent issues.)The consent provided should be in writing and explicitly specify what informa-tion the defendant is consenting to have released, who is being authorized tomake the release, the parties to whom the information will be released, and thepurposes for which the information is to be used. Finally, the release of mentalhealth information should be consistent with all applicable confidentiality andethical requirements, as well as conforming to the principle that the informa-tion released is the minimum necessary to make an informed pretrial diversiondecision. All information collected through this process should also be madeavailable to the defense attorney.Identifying the Sources of Mental Health Informationfor Court Officials A key issue in the release of mental health information tocriminal justice officials, regard-less of the decision point, is iden-tifying all the sources of this in-formation in individual cases.This can be problematic, espe-cially in larger jurisdictions wherethe individual may have receivedservices at a number of differentlocations, or where the individualis transient, moving from one ju-risdiction to another. Ideally, theindividual's most recent clinicianshould have as up-to-date a his-tory as exists. Identifying the correct source of information requires that the in-dividual cooperate, supplying thename of the attending clinicianand providing consent to contactthe clinician. In cases where the individual has no prior history of receiving men-tal health services it may benecessary to have an assessmentconducted by a mental health cli-nician before a decision \u2014 pre-trial diversion, pretrial release,adjudication, or sentencing \u2014 ismade. In such instances, the in-cident that led to the arrest mayhave been the individual's firstindication that he or she may havea serious mental illness.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 9: Prosecutorial Review of Charges85 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExpand the options available in rural areas to provide mental health services for people with mental illness who might becandidates for pretrial diversion. The opportunities for identifying or establishing the resources that would provide the range of options discussed here are much greater inurban and suburban areas than they are in rural areas. In fact, in manyrural areas there may be no options at all. The chief problem that ruralareas encounter as it relates to viable options for those with mental ill-ness who are in the criminal justice system is the lack of mental healthprofessionals. For example, more than half of the 3,075 counties in theUnited States\u2014all of them rural\u2014have no practicing psychiatrists, psy-chologists, or psychiatric social workers. 11 The mobile units that law enforcement and mental health officials have teamed up in recent years to institute in many urban jurisdictionsmay hold clues for developing a model for options that can be used bycourts to develop release alternatives in rural jurisdictions. These unitsare designed to respond rapidly to a person in a mental health crisis sothat an arrest is avoided and the person is taken to an appropriate men-tal health facility. In rural areas, such mobile units may provide the courtswith alternatives by bringing mental health treatment resources to thosewho need it. It may also be useful to make greater use of telemedicine, inwhich mental health professionals are available to conduct private tele-phone consultations with mental health patients from a remote location. 11.

National Rural Health Policy: Recommenda- tions from the First Eight Years of the National Advi- sory Committee on Rural Health , Rockville, MD: Of-Availability of Mental Health Treatment as an Option to Courtsin Rural Areas The federal government has been at- tempting to address the shortage ofhealth care workers in rural areas since1987, when the National Advisory Com-mittee on Rural Health (NACRH) was es- tablished within the Department ofHealth and Human Services (HHS) toseek solutions to health care problemsin rural areas. The committee has madeseveral recommendations, such as: in-crease the awareness of health care op-portunities in rural areas and ensure thatstudents are academically prepared totake advantage of these opportunities;and create incentives for health carepractitioners to practice there. Such in-centives include financial support forstudents who will commit to service inrural areas, enhancement of Medicarereimbursements for rural providers, andgranting tax credits to providers whoserve rural areas. Many of these rec-ommendations have been followed andhave brought some relief to the health care shortages in rural areas. 12 The U.S. Department of Justice, currently through its Bureau of Justice Assistance,also provides block grant funding to thestates. In the past, block grant fundscould be used for a number of differentpurposes, including to address alterna-tives to detention for those who pose nodanger to the community. 13 HHS has sought to address the mentalhealth needs of rural residents throughthe Mental Health Block Grant program,which provides funding to states to im- prove access to mental health services. 14 More than $350 million is allocated to this program annually. In order to re-ceive their block grant funds, states mustsubmit plans to address the mentalhealth needs of various state subpopu-lations, including those who live in ru- ral areas. 15 State and local officials should work to- gether to ensure a coordinated use ofblock grant funds from the Departmentsof Justice and HHS to address the men-tal health treatment needs of people whohave been charged with criminal offensesin rural areas.fice of Rural Health Policy, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1997. 13.

Once the prosecutor agrees to offer the defen- dant the opportunity to participate in pretrial di-version, the defendant is interviewed by a repre-sentative of the pretrial diversion program todetermine the most appropriate conditions of diver-sion. These pretrial diversion programs, which alsomonitor compliance with diversion conditions, falladministratively either within the office of the pros-ecutor or report to the prosecutor. A defendant should be informed of the specific program requirements, length of program duration,and sanctions for noncompliance. Because peoplewith mental illnesses, in many instances, will havedifficulty understanding this information and fol-10 lowing through on their requirements, extra care isrequired to ensure that these defendants report forinitial intake into the appropriate service and con-tinue their participation. Pretrial diversion programs that serve people with mental illness should recognize that this popu-lation often presents a range of problems that shouldbe addressed in an integrated fashion. They mayneed assistance in locating affordable housing, inhandling their finances, in traveling back and forthto diversion program appointments, or in obtainingemployment or job training. All pretrial diversionprograms that serve people with mental illnessshould be designed to address these problems. Ensure that interview protocols used by pretrial diversion staff on defendants with mental illness include questions to identify thosewith co-occurring substance abuse disorders. One way to assist defendants with mental illness in complying with condi- tions of pretrial diversion is to recognize that the majority also suffer from co-occurring substance abuse problems. According to several studies, rates of bothmental health and substance abuse disorders are significantly higher in crimi-Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 10: Modification of Pretrial Diversion Conditions87 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectnal justice populations than in the general population.16 Individuals with co- occurring disorders present unique challenges that must be addressed by themental health and substance abuse treatment communities. Individuals withco-occurring disorders, when compared to individuals with a single disorder,have heightened psychosocial difficulty, including an increased likelihood ofproblems with finances, social roles, education, housing, transportation, andmarital stability. 17 In addition, people with co-occurring disorders experience more psychotic symptoms, have more severe depression and suicidality, havehigher rates of incarceration, have more difficulty with daily living skills, aremore noncompliant with treatment regimens, and are high service utilizers. 18 Design pretrial diversion conditions to address individual issues presented by each defendant. Conditions of pretrial diversion should be the least restrictive necessary and reasonably calculated to accomplish the goal of pretrial diversion, which isto reduce the likelihood that the person will recidivate. When a defendant iscurrently in mental health treatment and the treatment is helpful, it should bea requirement that he or she continue treatment as a condition of diversion. Ifthe defendant expresses significant concern regarding the usefulness of thattreatment, a mental health consultation may be needed to determine whetherthere are better alternatives available. When the defendant is not currently intreatment, an assessment should be conducted by a qualified mental healthprofessional to determine the most appropriate treatment for the defendant,and then a referral should be made to begin that treatment. This assessmentshould be conducted on an outpatient basis. Those with co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disorders should receive integrated treatment. Barriers to specialized treatment for thispopulation include differing mental health and substance abuse treatment phi-losophies and practices, policies that exclude active substance abusers frommental health treatment, policies that exclude persons with active psychosis orother symptoms of mental illness from receiving substance abuse treatment,and separate local, state, and federal funding streams for mental health andsubstance abuse treatment. 16.

Identification of those with co-occurring disor-ders should be occur in the early stages of criminal justice processing. Research indicates that an integrated model of treatment is most effective for people with co-occurring mental and substance abuse disorders. 19 That is, both the mental disorder and substance abuse disorder are treated in the sameservice setting, using cross-trained staff proficient in both mental health andsubstance abuse disorder therapy. Too often, co-occurring disorders are treatedsequentially \u2014 individuals receive treatment in one system first (either mentalhealth or substance abuse) followed by treatment in the other\u2014or concurrently\u2014that is, individuals receive both mental health and substance abuse treatmentat the same time, but with different therapists or at different agencies. In bothof these models, the burden of coordinating or integrating treatment lies withthe client. (See Policy Statement 37: Co-occurring Disorders.) Boundary spanners\u2014people who act as liaisons to bridge mental health, substance abuse and criminal justice systems\u2014should be knowledgeable aboutboth mental health and substance abuse disorders and provide such informa-tion to the courts. (See Policy Statement 26: Institutionalizing the Partnership,for more on boundary spanners.) Example: Drug Court, Lane County (OR) In Lane County, a mental health specialist trained to deal with co-occurring disorders is assigned to the jurisdiction's drug court in the dual role of case manager and courtliaison to assist with people with co-occurring disorders who are placed in the drugcourt. Develop guidelines on compliance and termination policies regard- ing defendants with pretrial diversion conditions that recognize theneeds and capabilities of people with mental illness. The National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies (NAPSA) has stan- dards for pretrial diversion that should prove useful in developing complianceand termination policies for defendants with mental illness who are placed indiversion programs. 20 Those standards state that diversion conditions should be clearly written in a service plan signed by the defendant and the diversionprogram representative. \"Knowing exactly what is expected will decrease thelikelihood of a participant's being unsuccessful in treatment.\" 21 The service plan should also detail what actions could be taken in response to theparticipant's failure to comply with the conditions. The diversion program rep-c 19. The National GAINS Center, Treatment of people with co-occurring disorders in the justice system , Delmar, New York, The National GAINS Center, 2000.20.

Ibid., Commentary to Standard 4.1, p. 20.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 10: Modification of Pretrial Diversion Conditions89 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectresentative should explore any noncompliance with diversion conditions to de- termine whether the violation was willful, was a symptom of the mental illness,or was an indication of the need to change the treatment plan. It must berecognized that decompensation and other setbacks are common occurrencesfor people under treatment for mental illness as the attending mental healthclinician seeks the most appropriate treatment. Defendants who are terminated for unsuccessfully completing the program should have their cases returned, without prejudice, to the regular court calen-dar. Defendants should also be allowed to withdraw from diversion and havethe prosecution of their cases resumed without prejudice.90 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aPretrial Release/Detention Hearing POLICY STATEMENT #11 Maximize the use of pretrial release options in appropriate cases of defendants with mental illness so that no person is detained pretrialsolely for the lack of information or options to address the person'smental illness. Usually within a day of arrest, a defendant will appear in court where a judge or magistrate willdetermine whether or not the defendant should bereleased pending adjudication of the case, and if sounder what conditions. In making that decision,the judicial officer weighs the risks posed by the de-fendant to fail to appear in court and the potentialthreat to the community's safety if the defendant ifreleased. Judges, like any decision maker, seek to make informed decisions and to have a range of options attheir disposal. Armed with the kind of informationoutlined below and improved options, the courts11 should be in a position to minimize the unnecessarypretrial detention of people with mental illness. This is not to suggest that people with mental illness should never be detained. It is particularlyimportant, though, that mental illness itself not beused as a reason to detain a defendant in a casewhere a defendant with no mental illness facingsimilar charges and with a similar criminal recordwould likely be released. In such cases where thecriminal charges do not warrant detention and thejudge's primary concern is the defendant's mentalillness, facilitating access to services should be con-sidered instead of resorting to criminal detention. Facilitate the release of mental health information where appropri- ate for use at the pretrial release hearing. Both mental health and criminal justice officials are bound by professional codes of ethics that define the doctor-patient, lawyer-client relationship. Com-munications between mental health providers and their clients, or attorneysand their clients, are protected from disclosure unless the client specificallyChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 11: Pretrial Release/Detention Hearing91 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectprovides written consent for the release of information.22 As in cases where pretrial diversion is being considered, the written consent should explicitly statewhat information the defendant is consenting to release, who is being autho-rized to make the release, the parties to whom the information will be released,and the purpose to which the information is to be used. Recognizing that theprivacy rights of the individual with a mental illness must be balanced againstthe needs of the court to have all the information that might be relevant toassessing the defendant's risks to public safety and of failure to appear in court,the information released should be the minimum necessary to make an informedpretrial release decision. (See Policy Statement 25: Sharing Information, formore in-depth recommendations on information sharing.) For the pretrial release decision, the defendant is under no obligation to provide the court with any private information, including mental health status.In many instances, though, it is in the defendant's best interests to do so sinceit might facilitate his or her release and allow for the continuation of existingtreatment. Seeking consent for the release of information from an individualwho may have a mental illness, however, must be done with extreme cautionbecause the mental illness may impair the person's ability to give informedconsent. If the individual has provided consent to the release of the information, the next step is to gain access to that information. Jurisdictions have takendifferent approaches to obtaining mental health information for the pretrialrelease hearing. Example: Connecticut Mental Health Center Mental health staff from the Connecticut Mental Health Center receive each day a list from the court of all individuals just arr ested that they cr oss-refer ence with their database to see who is currently in their system. Staff then interview the defendantand, in coordination with the public defender's and the pretrial services offices, de-velop a plan for release. This plan is then submitted to the court. Two other issues that must be addressed in a discussion of obtaining men- tal health information are the ethical guidelines of mental health professionalsand the timeliness of receiving that information. Mental health clinicians areprohibited from conducting a mental health assessment before the defendanthas had an attorney assigned and has consulted with the attorney. Jurisdic-tions have addressed these ethical guidelines in a way that allows for a timelyassessment of a defendant's mental health status. 22. Every state has either statutory or regulatory provi- sions that specify the confidentiality guidelines for the pro- tection of mental health information, although the statesvary greatly in the protections that are provided. Given the variance in state protections and concern about the growing ease of electronically exchanging private health information,in 1996 Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (P .L. 104-191), which,among other things, directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to establish regulations for the protec- tion of all medical, including mental health, information.Those regulations, which supercede state laws that provide less protections, became effective on April 14, 2001. The regulations permit access to and dissemination of mentalhealth information as outlined here.92 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Public Defender's Office, Broward County (FL) In Broward County, where mental health clinicians conduct an assessment before the pretrial release hearing, the clinicians are on the staff of the public defender's office.This expedites the process of conducting a mental health assessment while ensuringthat the client has received appropriate consultation with an attorney. It is also important to respect established boundaries when court and mental health professionals work together in these ways. Mental health cliniciansshould not make recommendations regarding whether the defendant should bereleased pretrial; they should limit their presentation to the court to thedefendant's mental health condition, history, and needs and how those needscan be addressed. Ensure that a neutral entity is available to provide the pretrial re- lease decision making officer with all the information relevant tothat decision, including mental health status, and with viable op-tions to address any identified mental health issues. According to American Bar Association Standards, every jurisdiction should establish a neutral entity that gathers all the historical information that isrelevant for the pretrial release decision. 23 In many jurisdictions, there is no designated agency that conducts these functions, particularly in nonmetropolitanareas. In those jurisdictions, the judicial officer presiding at the pretrial re-lease hearing typically receives information directly from the defendant, fromthe arresting law enforcement agency, and, if present, from prosecution anddefense. In many other jurisdictions, pretrial services programs or their functional equivalent provide this information. When these programs interview a defen-dant, it is standard practice to inform the defendant of the purpose of the inter-view, how the information will be used, and of the defendant's right to refuse toanswer any or all of the questions. The scope of services provided by theseagencies, including the populations that they target, the information that theygather, and the options that they provide to the court, vary greatly across juris-dictions. Since jurisdictions vary so widely in the mechanisms used to obtain and disseminate information relevant to pretrial release decision making, it is notpossible to recommend a single approach to providing the court with thedefendant's mental health information. However, several principles should befollowed. First, jurisdictions should have some neutral entity that provides thepretrial release decision-making officer with all the information relevant to thatdecision. Second, defendants should be advised that they have the right tob 23. American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice, Chapter 10: Pretrial Release Standards, American Bar Association, 1989.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 11: Pretrial Release/Detention Hearing93 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectspeak with an attorney before answering any questions, and that they have the right to refuse to answer any questions. Third, the neutral entity should pro-vide the judicial officer with viable options to address identified mental healthissues. In its interview with the defendant, the neutral entity should ask whether the defendant has any mental health problems and whether he or she has everbeen treated, either inpatient or outpatient, for a mental health problem. Theentity should recognize, however, that a history of mental health treatment isnot necessarily an indicator of higher risk of failure to appear or rearrest. Forexample, if a defendant reported having received mental health counseling af-ter a traumatic event in the past, this information may not be relevant to thepretrial release decision and the interviewer should use discretion in recordingthat information. The interviewer should note behavior, such as the defendantseeing things or hearing voices that are not apparent to the interviewer. In some instances, the pretrial interviewer will be unable to conduct an interview with the defendant because the defendant's mental condition pre-cludes communication. This situation often can be resolved quickly once thedefendant is reconnected with his or her mental health caseworker. Example: Data Link Project, Maricopa County (AZ) As part of the Maricopa County Data Link Project, the local behavioral health authority receives an automated list of every person booked into the local jail. The computer atthe health authority seeks matches from the jail list with the list of more than 12,000clients who receive mental health services in the area. When a match is found, theperson's caseworker is notified and can intervene quickly to see that the person isreceiving proper medications while in jail and to assist in discharge planning. The discussion thus far makes an assumption about people who have been referred to the courts by law enforcement and who have been identified\u2014byobservations of third parties, from the results of a mental health screen, or bythe person's own statements\u2014as possibly suffering from mental illness. Theassumption is that the person has a history with the mental health system andwill direct court officials to the source of information about that history. Inmany cases, however, the incident that led to the instant arrest may have beenthe first manifestation of a mental illness. In other cases, the person may havehad a history with the mental health system, but either out of mental impair-ment, deliberate deception, or a simple refusal to respond did not divulge thathistory when asked about it. A particular problem arises for the pretrial release decision maker when a person is arrested on a charge that involves violence\u2014even if just a simpleassault\u2014and there are clear indications that the person may be suffering froma mental illness, but the person denies any current or past mental health treat-ment. The person might also have no prior record of arrests or convictions that94 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectcould guide the pretrial release decision maker, who is required to weigh risk of future violence in making a release decision. The best course of action may beto have the court order a mental health assessment by a qualified mental healthprofessional. That assessment should confirm whether there are mental healthissues, including past police contacts with the defendant, that resulted in refer-rals to mental health facilities in lieu of arrest. Example: Pretrial Program, Hamilton County (OH) In Hamilton County, pretrial program staff team up with mental health professionals to have an assessment completed by a mental health clinician prior to the initialpretrial release hearing. All defendants who are identified by the pretrial servicesprogram during its early morning interviews as having possible mental health issuesare then placed on an afternoon calendar for their pretrial release hearing. Theprogram alerts the court's Psychiatric Clinic, and a clinician from that office conductsthe assessment before the afternoon hearing. This approach provides an assessmentby a trained mental health clinician with the results reported to the pretrial releasedecision maker without having to continue the case to another day. Ensure that interview protocols used by pretrial services staff also include questions to identify those with co-occurring substanceabuse disorders. This issue was described in the discussion earlier of pretrial diversion, and that discussion applies here. It is of even more importance, though, that screen-ing by pretrial services staff for co-occurring disorders be conducted for thepretrial release/detention decision. While pretrial diversion may be offered toonly a small percentage of persons with mental illness who have been arrested,all of them must have a pretrial release/detention hearing. (See Policy State-ment 10: Modification of Pretrial Diversion Conditions and Policy Statement37: Co-occurring Disorders.) Ensure that at the initial hearing defense counsel are prepared to offer, in appropriate cases, an alternative to pretrial detention fordefendants with mental illness. Inherent in this recommendation is the support for the American Bar Association's call for defense to be present at the initial appearance of all defen-dants. The initial appearance is a critical juncture in all cases for all defen-dants. As stated by the American Bar Association, \"[D]eterminations made inthe course of first-appearance proceedings are the most important in the crimi-nal process for many defendants.\" But the circumstances are hardly ideal:\"Regrettably, these vital decisions often are reached under circumstances thatwould not be tolerated at trial. Courtrooms often are noisy and overcrowded,c dChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Release/Detention Hearing95 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectcases are...treated hurriedly, and the entire process is motivated by the single aim of 'moving the calendar.\" And as for the defendants, \"...they are likely to beconfused, exhausted, and frightened, particularly if they have had no earlierexperience with the criminal justice system.\" 24 Some defense attorneys have taken steps to be prepared. Example: Public Defender's Office, Honolulu (HI) In Honolulu, by the time a defendant with mental illness appears in court at the initial hearing, usually the morning after arrest, the public defender will have discussed arelease plan with the defendant and the mental health staff who work out of the jail. One important issue that should be addressed in the context of the pretrial release decision is the release status of defendants who have been ordered toundergo a competency examination. The American Bar Association recommendsthat a defendant \"otherwise entitled to pretrial release\" should not be detainedsolely for the purpose of conducting the competency examination. According tothe ABA, confinement for competency evaluation and pretrial release are twoseparate issues that courts should consider and rule on separately. 25 Ensure that mental health information presented to the presiding judicial officer at the pretrial release/detention hearing is limitedto an indication of whether the defendant has a mental illness,and, if so, options for addressing it in the pretrial release decision. Mental health information is relevant to the pretrial release decision. 26 Therefore, a defendant's mental health status should be reported to the judicial officer making a pretrial release decision\u2014with the consent of the defendant.It is sufficient in most cases to report the information that there are mentalhealth issues. Example: Jail Diversion Project, Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services Under a program run by the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, mental health clinicians conduct assessments of defendants with mentalillness prior to the initial appearance in court. These clinicians are employed by theDepartment of Mental Health, and not the courts. The only information that theyprovide to the court is a treatment plan. The nature of the illness and any diagnosesare kept confidential. If the client agrees to allow the clinician to share more informa-tion with the court, it is sometimes easier to prepare a treatment plan. 24. American Bar Association, Pretrial Release Stan- dards, Commentary to Standard 10-4.2(a), 1988. 25. American Bar Association, Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards , Standard 7-4.3 and accompanying com- mentary. 26. In 34 states and the District of Columbia, and in the federal system, the judicial officer is required to assess two types of risks: that the defendant will fail to appear in court and that the defendant will pose a risk to the safetyof the community. In the remaining jurisdictions, only the risk of flight is examined. John Clark and D. Alan Henry,e \"The Pretrial Release Decision,\" Judicature 81:2, Septem- ber/October 1997. Most state statutes require the judicial officer to consider a number of factors in assessing theserisks, including: the nature of the current charge; strength of the evidence; prior criminal history; prior record of ap- pearance in court; current probation, parole, or pretrialrelease status at the time of arrest; ties to the community; and the defendant's character, reputation, and mental con- dition. John Goldkamp, \"Danger and Detention: A SecondGeneration of Bail Reform,\" Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology , Northwestern University School of Law, 76:1, 1985.96 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectEstablish programs that provide judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys with options to address the mental health needs ofpeople with mental illness. Providing judicial officers with a defendant's mental health information at the pretrial release/detention hearing without presenting options to addressthe mental health needs of defendants would likely lead to more unnecessarypretrial detention of those with mental illness. Information and options mustgo hand-in-hand. Options that might be used include assertive community treat-ment or intensive case management; a rehabilitation program that offers assis-tance in finding, getting, and keeping housing, employment, and benefits; crisisresidential services; and inpatient treatment. For the reasons noted earlier inthe pretrial diversion discussion, it is also important that pretrial release op-tions include a range of integrated services, including housing, financial assis-tance, transportation assistance, and employment counseling, and address theneeds of defendants with co-occurring substance abuse and mental health dis-orders. A specialized mental health program that is designed to meet the needs of people with serious mental illness who have come in contact with the criminaljustice system can address this broad array of options. Example: Community Support Program, Milwaukee (WI) In Milwaukee, the Community Support Program (CSP) of the Wisconsin Correctional Service screens defendants identified at the pretrial release hearing as having pos-sible mental health problems. If released with conditions, CSP develops an individu-alized treatment plan and assigns a caseworker to monitor the day-to-day implemen-tation of the plan. Within CSP there are housing specialists available to assist thosewith housing needs, and medical and pharmacy services to prescribe and administermedications. The program also has the capability to offer financial services to help clients obtain and maintain both private and public health benefits. It is also important to ensure that the treatment resources are available in the jurisdiction whenever needed. Example: Pretrial Services, Tulsa County (OK) In Tulsa County, the Tulsa Pretrial Services works closely with the local mental hospi- tal, which is next door to the jail, to ensure that both inpatient and outpatient treatmentis available.fChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 11: Pretrial Release/Detention Hearing \"The ability to monitor people on release status islimited, especially for lowlevel crimes. Many ofthese people need closesupervision, which is justnot available. Appropriatehousing oftentimes is im-possible. Without and propersupervision, housingprograms are willing toaccept individuals withcriminal charges and men-tal health problems. Theresult is that the defen-dant stays in jail.\" HON. MICHAEL D. SCHRUNKDistrict Attor ney, Multnomah County, OR Source: U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary, The Impact of the Mentally Ill on the Criminal Justice System , September 21 200197 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectg Design pretrial release conditions to address individual risks and needs posed by each defendant. An important principle that should be followed in imposing conditions of pretrial release, particularly on the population of those suffering from mentalillness, is that the conditions be the least restrictive necessary to ensure thesafety of the public and appearance in court. Overburdening defendants withmental illness with extraneous conditions of release raises the possibility thatthey will be unable to handle them and will fail to meet their requirements. Expand the options available in rural areas to provide mental health services for people with mental illness who are chargedwith a criminal offense. Many pretrial services practitioners in rural jurisdictions admit that the typical action taken at a pretrial release hearing involving a defendant withmental illness is that a money bond is set. Few, if any, options exist for thoserequiring attention to their mental illness, and judges believe that they have noalternatives but to set a money bond. Most often that bond is unattainable forthe defendant, who then spends the next several weeks or months in jail whilethe case is adjudicated. This is an outcome that satisfies no one\u2014judge, pros-ecution, defense, or defendant. In fact, the person with mental illness in alllikelihood will decompensate quickly. As noted in the discussion of expandingpretrial diversion options in rural areas, a possible approach to expanding mentalhealth resources may be with the use of mobile units and telemedicine. (SeePolicy Statement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs,and Classification / Housing Decisions, for more on telemedicine.)h98 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectModification of Pretrial Release Conditions POLICY STATEMENT #12 Assist defendants with mental illness who are released pretrial in complying with conditions of pretrial release. Once conditions of pretrial release are set by the court they are monitored by a pretrial servicesprogram. If the defendant fails to comply with theconditions, the program notifies the court, afterwhich the court can revoke the release, modify theconditions, or issue a warning to the defendant. Conditions of pretrial release are set for the purpose of minimizing risks that the defendant willpresent a danger to the community or fail to appearin court. Defendants with a mental illness may haveparticular difficulty in understanding and fulfillingthose conditions. In addition, an individual withmental illness who has been detained in jail\u2014evenfor a very brief period following an arrest\u2014can facetremendous obstacles upon his or her release. Inmany instances, the greatest challenge is to find asuitable, affordable place to live, or to identify a fam-ily member or friend with whom to reside. Other12 challenges may include reestablishing eligibility fordisability benefits under the federal SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI), Social Security DisabilityInsurance (SSDI), or Medicaid programs, gettingback to work or other meaningful daytime activity,and establishing a connection with a provider ofmental health services to ensure that appropriatetreatment and support are provided in the commu-nity. Another challenge upon release may be thatjail time has interrupted treatment or has alteredthe medication regimen, which may cause some post-release difficulties and adjustments. Thus, it is inthe interests of both the defendant and the courtthat assistance be given to defendants in meetingthe conditions of release. In addition, under theAmericans with Disabilities Act, it may be requiredthat people with mental illness be given the assis-tance they need to comply with pretrial release con-ditions.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 12: Modification of Pretrial Release Conditions99 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION a Streamline administrative procedures to ensure that federal and state benefits are reinstated immediately after a person with men-tal illness is released from jail. People with mental illness who are unable to afford private insurance to help pay for treatment costs may be eligible for Medicaid. (See Policy State-ment 13: Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility, for more on detain-ees' Medicaid and Social Security eligibility.) Develop guidelines on compliance and termination policies regard- ing defendants with pretrial release conditions. Placing court-ordered mental health conditions of pretrial release on those with mental illness must be accompanied by the ability to monitor compliancewith those conditions. The judge and the defense attorney should make clear tothe defendant the consequences for violating release conditions. The responsesto condition violations should reflect the nature of the violation and should,unless the violations are severe, gradually escalate before imposition of theultimate response\u2014revocation of release. It is important to have a written understanding regarding compliance and termination policies. When a court orders a defendant to enroll in or maintaintreatment, whether it be for a mental illness, or for drug or alcohol abuse, def-erence must be paid to the treating clinician regarding the status of the personin treatment. Decompensation itself should not be considered a violation andthe first response to noncompliance should be an attempt to adjust the treat-ment. Thus, the clinician or treatment program must assess the client's compli-ance with the order to participate in treatment on a case-by-case basis. How-ever, the treatment program should provide the court and the referring agencywith written guidelines outlining its general policy for determining whether aclient is in compliance and when it is time to both successfully and unsuccess-fully terminate a client from treatment. When a violation of a pretrial release condition has been alleged, the court should hold a hearing looking into the circumstances of the alleged violationbefore taking action on the violation. Such circumstances should include at-tempts by the defendant to comply; reasons cited for noncompliance; and thenature of the violation. The court should consider that people with mentalillness commonly experience relapses while in treatment, and that finding themost appropriate treatment is often a matter of trial and error for the treatingb100 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectclinician. Before imposing punitive sanctions for noncompliance, the court should conclude that the defendant was capable of complying but chose not to. Given the difficulties that defendants with mental illness may have in com- plying with conditions of pretrial release, it may be beneficial to have speciallytrained staff from pretrial release and diversion programs be responsible forsupervising defendants with mental illness. Example: Pretrial Services Program, Bernalillo County (NM) In Bernalillo County, New Mexico, a team of three specialists from the pretrial services program supervises defendants with a mental health condition of release. Thesespecialists work closely with a Forensic Case Manager who facilitates client treatmentand acts as liaison between treatment services and the criminal justice system. To protect the therapeutic/treatment relationship, mental health treatment programs should not report compliance and terminations directly to the court,but through the referring court entity\u2014the pretrial services program or thepretrial diversion program. In most cases, it would be sufficient to providecompliance information in summary form. An exception would be if staff of thetreatment program became aware of a specific threat that the client may pose.In that instance, the professional guidelines of the clinician should dictate themost appropriate method of response.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 12: Modification of Pretrial Release Conditions101 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project102 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION aIntake at County / Municipal Detention Facility POLICY STATEMENT #13 Ensure that the mechanisms are in place to provide for screening and identification of mental illness, crisis intervention and short-termtreatment, and discharge planning for defendants with mental illnesswho are held in jail pending the adjudication of their cases. Defendants not released at the pretrial release/ detention hearing are booked into jail pending theposting of bail or the adjudication of the charges.Being jailed after arrest is a particularly criticalperiod of time for a person with mental illness be-cause the stress of incarceration can significantlyraise the risk of decompensation. There are severalimportant services that should be provided whilethe defendant is in custody, including identifyingthose detainees with mental health problems; ad-dressing any immediate concerns about their men-13 tal health; attending to their mental health needswhile in custody; and planning for their transitionback to the community. Many of the recommendations below, while es- pecially relevant to pretrial detainees, also apply tosentenced inmates, whether they are in jail or inprison. For a thorough review of the issues thatshould be addressed when a person with mental ill-ness is incarcerated, see Chapter 4: Incarcerationand Re-entry. Screen all detainees for mental illness upon arrival at the facility. This recommendation calls for screening to be conducted on all detainees, regardless of their known history of mental illness and their presenting ap-pearance. (See Policy Statement 17: Intake at Correctional Facility for Sen-tenced Inmates, for a more thorough discussion of screening procedures.) In the majority of jails, staff immediately screen new admissions for basic issues that might affect housing assignment and safety, but many of thesescreens fail to address mental health issues. The screening should occur at thepoint of intake, before placement in a housing area. The screening should bedone using a standardized instrument developed under the direction of a quali-Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 13: Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility103 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectfied mental health professional. Booking staff should receive training in how to use the instrument and interpret the results. Several states, including Colo-rado and Montana, have statutes that require administrators of detention fa-cilities to mandate screening for mental illness at the time of intake. In Mon-tana, the screening is intended to identify misdemeanants who could be divertedfrom the detention facility into mental health services. When the screen shows possible indications of mental illness, the screen- ing officer should arrange for a more thorough examination by a qualified men-tal health professional. Some jurisdictions have developed a multitiered ap-proach to identifying people with mental illness. Example: Screening, Summit County (OH) Jail The Summit County jail has a thr ee-tiered approach tha t includes the initial screening by the booking officer, a cognitive function e xamination by a mental health worker, followed by an evaluation by a clinical psychologist. Jails should also ensure that the screening protocol includes identification of suicide risk. Given the high rates of suicide in jail when compared to thoseoccurring in the general population, it is important that great care be taken inidentifying those at risk of suicide. Example: Suicide Screening Initiative, Montgomery County (MD) Detention Center In Montgomery County, detained inmates are sc reened at three points of intake using the same set of seven questions: at central processing, upon institutional intake, andas part of medical screening. When an inmate is first processed through the CentralProcessing Unit, an officer completes the Suicide Screening Form, comprising sevenitems relating to current suicidal ideation and past history of suicidal/self-destruc-tive behavior. There are specific questions regarding mental health history and cur-rent psychiatric treatment. When inmates are processed through intake, the sameform is completed a second time. Inmates answer the questions a third time whennurses at medical intake use the same questionnaire. The document first used atCentral Processing follows the inmate throughout this process. If an inmate answersaffirmatively to any of the questions at any point along this three-part process, areferral is generated to mental health services, who then conduct an assessment. Example: Suicide Prevention Screening Guidelines Tool (SPSG), New York State New York State has developed a Suicide Prevention Screening Guidelines (SPSG) tool that is used in all local lockups, county jails, and state prisons throughout the state.SPSG was developed and approved by the New York Commission of Correction andthe Office of Mental Health and has been validated through numerous research projects.It consists of a structured interview conducted during the booking process by bookingofficers, and examines risk factors from past behavior, the inmate's current situation,and mental status. If there are indications that the inmate may be suicidal, thebooking officer contacts the shift commander for immediate intervention, who ar-ranges for increased supervision of the individual.\"Building internal jail men- tal health programs at theexpense of communitybased treatment justdoesn't make sense. Weneed to help people withmental illness in theircommunities, not waituntil they arrive in jail toprovide adequate treat-ment.\" WALLENSTEIN MontgomeryCounty Department Personal correspondence104 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectWhen resources do not allow for a timely, comprehensive, in-house follow- up assessment to a screen, such as may be the case in rural or remote settingsand small facilities, creative alternatives should be found. These might includecontracting for services with community mental health, or making provisionfor interns at local universities who might be available to conduct assessmentson site on a part-time basis. Another option is telepsychiatry, where a qualifiedmental health professional is able to interview and examine the detainee throughthe use of telephone or closed-circuit television. (See Policy Statement 18:Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/ Housing Decisions, for examples of telepsychiatry and electronic communica-tion arrangements in use in Texas and Alaska.) When a delay in providing afollow-up assessment in unavoidable, jail personnel must provide adequate su-pervision to ensure the physical safety of an inmate at risk of suicide untilprofessional mental health services can be provided. Individuals admitted to jail facilities may be withdrawing from a psycho- active drug, including both illicit substances and psychotropic medication. It isimportant that an observation period extend through the first 72 hours of de-tention and that the screening protocol be repeated if the detainee's behaviorindicates the possibility of post-acute withdrawal or mental decompensation.Jail medical staff should also keep in mind that many psychotropic medica-tions, particularly ones that are used in injectible forms, can take several weeksto clear a patient's system. Intake screeners and anyone reviewing medicalrecords should look for indications of such long-lasting drugs and take steps toensure that suicide screening and prevention measures are extended over sev-eral weeks in appropriate circumstances. This is particularly important in jailsthat have a limited pharmacy and may change the type of drug or form of ad-ministration. Work with mental health service providers, pretrial service provid- ers, and other partners to identify individuals in jail who may beeligible for diversion from the criminal justice system. The admission of an individual with mental illness into a county or mu- nicipal detention facility presents an opportunity to determine whether contin-ued involvement with the criminal justice system is the most appropriate strat-egy to address that individual's situation. Once a detainee has been identifiedas having a mental illness, corrections officials can work with pretrial serviceprograms, mental health service providers, and other partners to determinewhether the detainee may be eligible for programs that provide an alternativeto further detention. Some states, such as Montana, have passed legislationSteps in Suicide Prevention27 Eight essential steps for an in- stitution suicide prevention plan: (1) Training of correctional staff, who are the primaryobservers of behavior whenmental health staff are un-available; (2) Immediate screening at in- take and ongoing assess-ment; (3) Communication between transport officer and correc-tions officer, facility staffand mental health staff, andfacility staff and inmate; (4) Placement in housing ap- propriate to the situation,emphasizing use of generalpopulation settings insteadof isolation; (5) Establishing appropriate levels of supervision, in-cluding close and constantobservation; (6) Rapid and correct response to suicide attempts; (7) Reporting of suicide at- tempts throughout the chainof command; and (8) Follow-up and administra- tive review, including to the effects ofcritical incidents on staffstress. 27.

Many programs use detention facilities as the first point of contact to iden- tify a person with mental illness who may be eligible for diversion. Jail admin-istrators who work closely with such programs will help individuals who wouldbe better served by diversion from the criminal justice system while at the sametime freeing jail beds for more appropriate purposes. It is essential that pro-grams providing alternatives to further involvement with the criminal justicesystem for individuals with mental illness consider the multiple needs of theseindividuals, especially the need for adequate housing (see Policy Statement 38:Housing). Example: Thresholds Psychiatric Reha bilitation Centers J ail Program, Cook County (IL) The Thresholds Psychiatric Rehabilitation Centers Jail Program in Cook County pro- vides intensive case management for individuals with mental illness who have be-come involved in the criminal justice system. Thresholds case managers work withindividuals while they are still in jail, even accompanying them to court and oftenhelping secure their early release. Once released, the case manager helps the indi-viduals access mental health services, find employment, and locate housing. ThresholdJail Program members, as the program's clients are called, are usually housed insingle-occupancy rooms in local hotels. Thresholds has developed relationships withlandlords, guarantees the rent payment, and provides 24-hour on-call case managersin case of a crisis situation. Though Thresholds owns some 30 group homes and tenapartment houses, community and local government opposition prevents them fromusing these resources to house most individuals with mental illness who have beenreleased from jail. Facilitate the release of information to assist in the identification of need. While important in identifying people who might have a mental illness, a screen conducted at booking depends exclusively upon inmate self-reporting.Yet detainees, and particularly those with mental illness, are often unreliablereporters of factual information. It is important, therefore, to obtain informa-tion about a detainee that can shed light on his or her mental health historyand help the facility to make appropriate decisions regarding classification andto ensure that those currently in treatment continue to receive it while in cus-tody. In many instances the arresting officers may have input into classifica-tion decisions. Several jails have also developed ways to alert the mental health commu- nity when a mental health client has been arrested so that mental health canrespond immediately to the situation.c\"If I had gotten into this [jail treatment] program inthe beginning, thingscould have been different...I always wanted to excel,to do something good...Idon't like the way my lifehas turned out, but I havethe option to be someone.\" LEON consumer Source: William Branigan and Leef Smith, \"Mentally Ill Need Care, Find Prison,\" Washington Post, Sunday, November 25, Sec- tion A, p. 1106 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Cook County (IL) Jail Through an automated information system, the Cook County Jail electronically trans- fers its jail census on a daily basis to mental health clinics in the Chicago area. Clinicstaff review the lists to see if they can identify any of their clients. The goal is tonotify these clinics when one of their clients is in custody to aid in the continuation oftreatment while in custody. Example: Montgomery County (MD) Detention Center The county detention center in Montgomery County each day posts the names of detainees who have entered the facility in the previous 24 hours, ensuring that a copyof the list is available to local mental health providers. Providers recognizing namesof current or past clients on the detention center list may then, without breachingconfidentiality, contact mental health staff at the detention center with information,including diagnosis and medication, that might help the detention center provideappropriate services or make decisions regarding placement or diversion. (See alsoMaricopa County Data Link Project, Policy Statement 11: Pretrial Release / Detention Hearing.) Another way to facilitate the release of mental health information is to encourage individuals who are at risk of being arrested to provide their clinicianwith prior consent to discuss their mental health needs with jail officials if anarrest and detention occurs. (See Policy Statement 25: Sharing Information.) Families can also provide more comprehensive information about the mental health history of a jail detainee. They should be encouraged to share any infor-mation that will result in delivery of appropriate mental health treatment inthe jail setting. Ensure that the capability exists to provide immediate crisis inter- vention and short term treatment. People arriving at a jail may be in an active psychotic state or may decom- pensate to such a condition during the period of confinement. Jail staff musthave the resources that they need to intervene effectively with detainees expe-riencing a crisis. The American Psychiatric Association has offered the follow-ing recommendations regarding crisis intervention in jails: \u0093Training of jail staff to recognize crisis situations; \u0093Around-the-clock availability of mental health professionals to provide evaluations; \u0093A special housing area for those requiring medical supervision; and \u0093Around-the-clock availability of a psychiatrist to prescribe emergencymedications.d 28. In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), the Supreme Court addressed the medical needs of prisoners in the context of the Eighth Amendment. The court held that de-liberate indifference to serious medical needs is prohibited \"whether the indifference is manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs or by prisonguards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medi- cal care or intentionally interfering with the treatment onceprescribed. Regardless of how evidenced, deliberate indif- ference to a prisoner's serious illness or injury states a [claim under the Constitution.] Id. at 104-105.\"A prisonermust provide evidence of \"acts or omissions sufficiently harmful\" to show deliberate indifference in order to bring an Eighth Amendment claim. Since Estelle, the Supreme Court has only refined the \"de- liberate indifference\" standard once. In 1994 the CourtChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 13: Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility107 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Summit County (OH) Jail At the jail in Summit County, one corrections officer is designated as the crisis inter- vention specialist and receives 40 hours of training each year from the jail's mentalhealth coordinator. The capability must also exist to meet the treatment needs of detainees. In larger jails, separate mental health units may be available. Often, however,there can be waiting periods to get into such a unit. In smaller jails, such unitsare typically not available, and the most severely ill inmates may need to betransferred to a state hospital or other secure facility. Regardless of where theindividual is housed, there can be great benefit to ensuring that the clinicianwho was attending the individual before arrest continues to monitor the person'streatment while in custody. Facilitate a detainee's continued use of a medication prescribed prior to his or her admission into the jail. Inmates are usually prohibited from bringing their own medications into jail. Owing to formulary restrictions, prohibitive costs, limited inventories, or acombination of these factors, however, correctional health officials are oftenunable to fill a prescription prepared by a doctor outside the facility. Accord-ingly, the effect of the medications that detainees are taking at the time of theirincarceration is likely to wear off soon after their arrival at the jail. The detainee'scondition is thus likely to deteriorate, and he or she may commit disciplinaryinfractions that will lengthen his or her stay in jail. Increasingly, offenders with mental illness are brought to jails with pre- scriptions for the newer, and considerably more expensive, psychotropic medi-cations. In many cases, when facilities provide for the continuation of treat-ment, they substitute the medications the inmate has been taking with one ontheir formulary and readily available in their own pharmacy. In some states, correctional health officials are required to adhere to the formulary, even if it is limited. Such policies can have negative consequencesfor inmates for whom medications on the formulary are either ineffective orcause harmful side effects. When a particular medication prescribed by a psy-chiatrist is not on an institution's formulary, corrections administrators shouldensure that a mechanism is in place to enable access to the medication within24 hours. 28e said that deliberate indifference \". . . [lies] somewhere between the poles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledge at the other,\"(Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 1994). The Court affirmed an \"adequacy\" standard statingthat \"prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter and medical care.\" (id. at 833), but went on to emphasize that \"deliberate indiffer- ence\" requires a culpable state of mind. Federal District Courts (the trial court in the federal system) may interpret\"adequate\" with wide discretion.

The prac-tice of switching medications can be particularly ineffective because many psy-chiatric medications take weeks to build up to therapeutic levels. Commondrug interactions between different medications prescribed for the same prob-lem can exacerbate the delay before the new medication becomes effective andcan create serious medical risks for patients, and potential problems for the jailstaff, if both medications are present in a patient's system at the same time. Community mental health programs and service providers should be in- volved in medication issues for recently arrested and detained defendants. Theycan serve as a resource for detention-based health care officials in determiningdetainee medication needs, possibly assisting facilities with limited formular-ies to obtain and share the costs for less commonly prescribed and more expen-sive medications, if they are required for the detainee's well-being. Suspend (as opposed to terminate) Medicaid benefits upon the detainee's admission to the facility to ensure swift restoration ofthe health coverage upon the detainee's release. 29 Enrolling a person who is eligible for Medicaid in this federal benefit pro- gram is a time-consuming process. Reinstating someone in Medicaid aftertheir benefits have been terminated can take anywhere from 14 to 45 days (andsometimes longer), depending on the state. 30 Accordingly, when a detainee with mental illness enters jail, and he or she is already enrolled in Medicaid,staff should do everything possible to maintain that person's enrollment in theprogram. Suspending, instead of terminating, the detainee's enrollment inMedicaid enables staff to effect the reinstatement of the benefits immediatelyupon release, guaranteeing the individual access to the treatment and medica-tions likely to keep him or her from coming into contact with the criminal jus-tice system again. A myth in many corrections, mental health, and public health agencies is that federal regulations require states to terminate a person's enrollment inMedicaid once he or she is incarcerated. In fact, federal law does not requirestates to terminate inmates' eligibility, and inmates may remain on the Medic-aid rolls even though the services provided in jail are not covered. According tothe US Secretary of Health and Human Services, \"Federal policy permits, butdoes not require states to use administrative measures that include temporaryUnderstanding Federal Benefits Several federal benefit programs are particularly relevant forpeople with mental illness whowill be released from a correc-tions facility: Supplemental Se-curity Income disabilitybenefits; Social Assistancefor Needy (TANF); FoodStamps; and Veterans Benefits.Understanding who is eligible toparticipate in these programs andhow they qualify is extremelycomplex. Appendix C, a reprintof a policy brief that the BazelonCenter for Mental Health Lawpublished, explains these pro-gram rules. The recommendations in Policy Statement 13 addresses onlythose pretrial detainees who areenrolled in Medicaid immediatelyprior to their incarceration. Manydetainees with mental illness areeligible for Medicaid but, for avariety of reasons, were not en-rolled when they were admittedto jail. An essential componentof planning the return of theseinmates to the community is en-suring that they have some formof health coverage to continuetheir treatment plans after theirrelease. Similarly, jail staffshould facilitate inmates' accessto other relevant federal and statebenefit programs. The policiesand procedures that should be inplace to accomplish this for jaildetainees are equally relevant tosentenced inmates, and they aretherefore addressed in PolicyStatement 21: Development ofTransition Plan. f 29. Much of this recommendation and the commentary below draws on an extremely useful and comprehensive review of jail detainees' Medicaid eligibility published by the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. Bazelon Centerfor Mental Health Law, Finding the Key to Successful Tran- sition from Jail to the Community: An Explanation of Fed- eral Medicaid and Disability Program Rules , March 2001. 30. Ibid.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 13: Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility109 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectsuspending an eligible individual.\" 31 Thus, determining when a detainee's enrollment in Medicaid should be terminated is, in some important respects, atthe discretion of the state. 32 Given these parameters, jail administrators should work with appropriate state and local social security administrators and state Medicaid administra-tors to develop policies and procedures to prevent the unnecessary terminationof detainees who enter the facility on Medicaid. Ideally, for those detaineeseligible for Medicaid by virtue of their enrollment in the Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI) program, authorities should terminate a detainee's Medicaid cov-erage only when SSI eligibility is terminated. (This occurs after 12 consecutivemonths of SSI suspension.) Example: Interim Incarceration Disenrollment Policy, Lane County (OR) Officials in Lane County have confronted the barriers and disruption in continuity of care for people detained for a short time in jails. At the behest of the county, the stateadopted the Interim Incarceration Disenrollment Policy. This policy specifies thatindividuals cannot be disenrolled from their health plan during their first 14 days ofincarceration, during which the state makes the Medicaid payments. In addition, LaneCounty officials developed a relationship with the local application-processing agencyfor Medicaid and Social Security Insurance. Now, the application process for thoseindividuals who did not have benefits prior to incarceration or whose incarcerationperiod lasts longer than 14 days can begin while the detainee is still in custody. When a detainee whose participation in Medicaid has been suspended, corrections administrators should work with health officials to authorize im-mediate coverage of the detainee upon his or her release. While the confirma-tion of a released detainee's qualification of Medicaid is pending, federal rulespermit the reinstatement of the benefits for six months. (This reinstatementmay be terminated before six months have expired if state officials determinebeforehand that the individual is no longer eligible for Medicaid). In thosecases where a released detainee's benefits are reinstated, and the person's quali-fication for Medicaid is subsequently confirmed, officials should ensure thatservices already delivered are billed, retroactively, to the federal government. Commence discharge planning at the time of booking and continue the process throughout the period of detention. One reality for jail staff attempting to address the mental health needs of pretrial detainees is that a detainee may be released at any time with little orno warning to jail staff\u2014 the detainee may post the bail or plead guilty and besentenced to time served, or the prosecutor may dismiss the charges. Giveng 31. See October 11, 2001 letter from Tommy Thompson, Secretary, US Department of Health and Human Services, to Congressman Charlie Rangel, confirming earlier written statements from DHHS Secretary Donna Shalala, April 6,2000.32. The Council of State Governments conducted a sur- vey of state Medicaid agencies in 2001. All but one of the states responded. Each reported that they had a policy of terminating a person's enrollment in Medicaid upon his orher incarceration. Collie Brown, \"Jailing the Mentally Ill,\" State Government News , April 2001, p. 28.110 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectthis situation, it is of little surprise that recidivism rates among people with mental illness released from jail are exceptionally high.33 Thus, it is important that planning for the ultimate discharge of the individual be an ongoing processduring the time the individual is detained. Such planning should include ar-ranging for services immediately upon release; ensuring that there is no dis-ruption in medications made available to the individual; and assisting withother needs, such as housing, food, clothing, and transportation. Example: Discharge Planning, Fairfax County (VA) Jail Discharge planning at the Fairfax County Jail is the responsibility of Offender Aid and Restoration (OAR), a nonprofit organization. OAR staff conduct weekly meetings withthe jail's psychiatrist to set plans for release for all inmates with serious mentalillness, and provide emergency services for those released before a plan is completed.Staff of OAR carry caseloads, and the same case manager works with an inmate withmental illness from the time of booking through discharge. Example: Case Management Services for Pretrial and Sentenced Offend- ers, Hampshire County (MA) Jail At the Hampshire County jail, all inmates, regardless of whether they have a mental illness, are assigned case managers, who have a typical caseload of approximatelythirty detainees. Inmate treatment needs are assessed at intake, and the case man-ager then provides individual counseling, meets with the family, and makes referrals to appropriate resources both inside and outside the facility. Assignment of sen-tenced and pretrial inmates to a case manager facilitates the process from intakethrough discharge planning (and reentry, if applicable). A high level of contact be-tween the client and the case manager ensures that inmates have access to servicesand that they do not slip through the cracks. 34 One of the most pressing problems facing individuals with mental illness who have become involved in the criminal justice system is the lack of afford-able housing. Housing for people with mental illness should be directly linkedto other services, including mental health and substance abuse treatment, lifeskills, and job training. This model of \"supportive housing\" has been shown tohave significantly higher retention rates than housing alone or housing that isnot directly linked to services. 35 Long-term housing is crucial for helping indi- viduals with mental illness maintain stability and avoid involvement in thecriminal justice system. (See Policy Statement 38: Housing.) 33. Lois A. Ventura, Charlene A. Cassel, Joseph E.

The MCCJTPhas been widely recognized for impressive cross-system collaboration, focus on co-occurring disorders, transitional case management services, and attention to long-term housing needs. A $5.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing andUrban Development, complemented by matching local funds, allows MCCJTP casemanagers to help offenders with mental illness who qualify as homeless to become eligible for Shelter Care Plus housing funds. 36 Local service providers participating in MCCJTP support Shelter Care Plus recipients with vocational training, substanceabuse treatment, and life-skills training to ensure that these individuals have accessto meaningful daytime activity. Example: Conditional Community Release Program, Maricopa County (AZ) Adult Probation Department The Maricopa County Adult Probation Department has instituted a program called the Conditional Community Release Program, which is geared toward early jail release of offenders with mental health issues and provides appropriate treatment in the com-munity at a reduced cost. This program utilizes a contract psychiatrist, probationofficer, surveillance officer, and intake specialist to identify, diagnose, and superviseoffenders with mental illness. Once referred, the inmate is evaluated within 72 hours by an intake specialist. If appropriate, the inmate is admitted to the program and jailrelease planning is undertaken. The psychiatrist will see the person in jail in order toensure continuity of care once released, and the probation officer will see the client tocomplete all necessary paperwork. Once released, the probationer may be placed in a housing facility funded by Adult Probation, or released to their home if appropriate. While in the community, the clientis supervised by the probation officer and surveillance officer, and seen by the psy-chiatrist for follow-up treatment if not enrolled in community treatment. Using con-tracts with a local medical services agency, medication is provided at a reduced costand necessary psychological testing is performed. The program is 45 days in length, at whic h time the client is transferred back to his or her original probation officer, or referred to a specialized mental health caseload. Inthe event the client is not stabilized psyc hiatrically, the county will continue to serve the client until this is accomplished. 36. The McKinney Act of 1987 is the major federal hous- ing program to support people who are homeless. This act defines a homeless individual as (1) \"an individual wholacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and (2) an individual who has a primary nighttime resi- dence that is\u2014a) a supervised publicly or privately oper-ated shelter designed to provide temporary living accom- modations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill); b) an institu-tion that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or c) a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regularsleeping accommodation for human beings.\" Technically, individuals coming out of detention facilities are not con- sidered homeless until they have spent one night in a shel-ter or similar location. See www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/ homeless/rulesandregs/laws/index.cfm112 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectAdjudication POLICY STATEMENT #14 Maximize the availability and use of dispositional alternatives in appropriate cases of people with mental illness. A criminal case can be adjudicated in several ways\u2014the charges can be dismissed, the defendantcan plead guilty or be found guilty in a trial, or the defendant can be found not guilty. The law provides several dispositional alternatives specifically forpeople with mental illness\u2014 i.e., incompetent to stand trial, not guilty by reason of insanity, guilty but insane. 37 This document does not make any recommendations regarding how these dispositions are used or the frequency of their use.38 Rather, the document addresses other dispo- sitional alternatives to conviction and sentencing that are available under the law. Although known by different names, these alternatives are generallyreferred to as \"adjudication withheld\" or \"deferred adjudication.\" Earlier, the pretrial diversion decision of the prosecutor was addressed. Under the pretrial di- version alternative, the prosecutor decides to hold the charges in abeyance while the defendant under-goes a program intervention. If successful, the charges are dismissed. If not, the case is placed on a court calendar for prosecution. The distinction14 between that alternative and those discussed hereis that in this instance it is a judicial, rather thanprosecutorial, exercise of discretion. There are variations in how jurisdictions make these alternatives available. For example, underFlorida law, the court can withhold adjudication \"if it appears to the court...that the defendant is not likely again to engage in a criminal course of con-duct and that the ends of justice and the welfare of society do not require that the defendant presently suffer the penalty imposed by law.\" The court thenorders the defendant to participate in what is called a \"community control\" program. If the defendant successfully completes the program there is no con-viction. Texas law has a \"deferred adjudication\" pro- vision. Under this provision, once the defendant en- ters a guilty plea, the judge may defer the proceedingswithout entering the adjudication of guilt and order the defendant to abide by certain conditions if the judge finds that doing so \"is in the best interests ofthe victim.\" If the defendant successfully completes supervision, the charges are dismissed. 37. Some jurisdictions have replaced the \"Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity\" dispo- sition with \"Guilty but Insane,\" or some similar variation. 38. For a discussion of these dispositions, see: American Bar Association, ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards , 1989. Cases in whic h defendants plead Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity often receive significant publicity, which encourages the public impression that these pleas are commonly used. In actuality, use of the NotGuilty By Reason of Insanity plea is extremely rare. One study in Baltimore City ofthe circuit and district courts found that of 60,432 indictments filed during one year, only eight defendants (.013 percent) ultimately pleaded not criminally responsible. All eight pleas were uncontested by the state. Jeffery S. Janofsky, Mitchell H. Dunn, ErikJ. Roskes, Jonathan K. Briskin, and Maj-Stina Lunstrum Rudolph, \"Insanity Defense Pleas in Baltimore City: An Analysis of Outcome,\" American Journal of Psychiatry 153:11, November 1996, pp. 1464-68 .Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 14: Adjudication113 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION a Provide sufficient dispositional alternatives for defendants with men- tal illness for courts to employ at any stage of the court process. At least one jurisdiction has established a dispositional alternative for people charged with serious offenses. Example: The Nathaniel Project, Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services (CASES), New York City (NY) The Nathaniel Project in New York, NY, run by the Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services, is a two-year intensive case management and communitysupervision alternative-to-incarceration program for prison-bound defendants withserious mental illness. The program targets defendants who have been indicted on afelony, including violent offenses, most of whom are homeless and suffer from co-occurring substance abuse disorders. Forensic Clinical Coordinators, who are masterslevel mental health professionals and have expertise in negotiating the criminal jus-tice system, create a comprehensive plan for community treatment. Starting workwith participants prior to release, the project creates a seamless transition to commu-nity care. Once released, program participants are closely monitored and engaged inappropriate supervised community-based housing and treatment. Participants arerequired to attend periodic court progress dates. Charges are dismissed upon suc-cessful completion of the program. Key to the success of individuals with mental illness who are diverted from jail or prison under the Nathaniel Project is their linkage to both temporaryand long-term housing. The Nathaniel Project has developed relationshipswith housing providers to ensure that their clients will have shelter upon theirrelease. Housing stabilizes the individual's life and enables the case managerto strengthen his or her relationship with the person with mental illness. Hous-ing for individuals with mental illness should be integrated with support ser-vices including mental health, substance abuse, employment, and others. Intensive case management is crucial in helping clients locate and flourish in supportive housing. Even when housing and services are integrated in asupportive model, many clients may need assistance in availing themselves ofthose services. A dedicated case manager, with small enough caseloads to de-vote significant energy to each client, is integral to making supportive housing,and diversion in general, a success. The mental health courts that have been initiated in some jurisdictions often use dispositional alternatives. These courts focus specifically on casesinvolving defendants with mental illness, usually targeting only those chargedwith minor offenses. In some, the charges are dismissed upon successful comple-tion of the program. In others, the defendant is required to plead guilty as acondition of participation but receives consideration at sentencing if the pro-gram is successfully completed.114 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectMental health courts vary greatly in the procedures that they employ, making it difficult to define \"mental health court\" or to present a mental healthcourt model. It has been noted that \"[a]ny similarities among current mentalhealth courts occur more or less by chance at the implementation level andstem mostly from mirror-imaging by new jurisdictions seeking to replicate re-cently visited mental health courts or to duplicate drug courts.\" 39 Some have argued against several elements of specialized mental health courts, includingrequiring the defendant to plead guilty first as a condition of participation, andrequiring the defendant to spend a significant period of time under court super-vision for a charge that might otherwise bring a very short sentence. 40 Others have argued that mental health courts can be defined as \"almost any effort bythe courts to better address the needs of persons with serious mental illnesswho engage with the criminal justice system.\" 41 Using that definition, the policy statements and recommendations pre- sented in this document represent a model that does not necessarily require aspecialized court and does not limit the population of those allowed to partici-pate. Rather, the model envisions an integration of efforts into existing courtpractices to balance the needs of people with mental illness who are chargedwith a criminal offense with the needs of the courts to process the criminalcase. If jurisdictions choose, however, to implement specialized mental healthcourts, then all parties, including the judge, prosecution, and defense, shouldreceive training on available treatment resources and on how to choose whichprogram or service is appropriate for each defendant. Furthermore, it is impor-tant that courts work closely with the relevant mental health professionals toensure that treatment plans developed in the court are successfully fulfilled(see Policy Statement 29: Training for Court Personnel.) Facilitate the release of mental health information where appropri- ate for use in a dispositional alternative. When a case reaches a point where a judge is considering a dispositional alternative, it is likely that some information about the defendant's mental healthstatus will be available in the case file. This might include observations of thearresting officer as recorded in the police report and the information providedfor the pretrial release/detention hearing. If the defendant's competency wascalled into question, there may be a report in the file from a mental healthclinician on the defendant's mental health status. Several states have statutesb 39.

TOMAR MASON Superior Court Judge,County of San Francisco,CA Source: Interview, January 11, 2002, Washington, DC.115 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectthat specifically allow for the disclosure of mental health records in court. In Georgia, records can be disclosed in response to a valid subpoena. In Illinois, astatute allows for the disclosure of mental health records once the recipient ofmental health services introduces his or her mental condition as an element ofthe claim or defense. Since a dispositional alternative will in many cases be a favorable outcome for the defendant, the defense attorney should carefully discuss with the defen-dant the advantages and disadvantages of the possible alternative before thedefendant agrees to the release of any additional mental health information tothe court. In some cases, the defense attorney may find it advantageous torequest an assessment of the defendant and provide the full results to the courtto facilitate a decision to offer a dispositional alternative. In these cases, re-lease of the information would be with the consent of the defendant. (See PolicyStatement 25: Sharing Information.) Example: Mental Health Court, Broward County (FL) For possible placement in the Broward County Mental Health Court, public defenders will often ask for an assessment that includes a listing of any medications that thedefendant is taking, possible dia gnosis, famil y support, social support, housing, and substance abuse issues. The assessment is done with the consent of the defendant.116 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONSentencing POLICY STATEMENT #15 Maximize the use of sentencing options in appropriate cases for of- fenders with mental illness. Several options are available to the court at sentencing. Generally, they can range from settinga fine, placing the offender on probation for a speci-fied period, or imposing a period of incarceration injail or prison. As the recommendations presentedunder the previous court events are implemented,by the time a case reaches the sentencing stage theremay be information in the court file about thedefendant's mental health status. The recommen-dations presented below describe how to build on15 that information to ensure that the sentencing courthas all the information it needs to make an informedsentencing decision. Consistent with earlier discus-sions, no offender with mental illness should be sen-tenced to incarceration in jail or prison due solely tothe lack of information or options to address themental illness. In addition, the court should neverenhance a sentence solely because of the offender'smental illness. Rather, the sentence should be basedon the behavior that brought the offender into court. Ensure that the capacity exists to complete presentence investiga- tion reports in cases where there are indications that the offendermay have a mental illness. The presentence investigation (PSI) report, prepared by the probation of- fice, provides the sentencing judge with information about the offender so thatan informed, individualized sentencing decision can be made. According to ABAstandards, the court should order a PSI when it \"lacks sufficient information toperform its sentencing responsibilities,\" or upon the motion of either the pros-ecution or defense. 42 In Washington, state law requires the court to order a 42. American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice: Sentencing , 3rd Edition, 1994, Standard 18-5.2,Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 15: Sentencing117 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectpresentence report before imposing a sentence when the court determines that the defendant may have a mental illness. A PSI can better inform the court of individual case nuances to be consid- ered in ordering case-specific conditions of probation. The information pre-sented in the PSI report should be neutral; that is, it should include both miti-gating and aggravating factors. According to the American Probation and ParoleAssociation (APPA), the PSI should cover the following items: \u0093a description of the offense and circumstances surrounding it; \u0093a description of the status of any victim, including the impact of the crime on the victim; \u0093the offender's complete prior criminal record; \u0093the offender's including family status and residence his-tory; \u0093the offender's educational background and employment history; and \u0093the offender's medical history.43 The ABA standards state that PSIs should not become part of the public record. Distribution of the reports should be limited to the sentencing court,the prosecution and defense, and to the entity (i.e., probation, jail, or prison)that will be responsible for supervising the offender. 44 Many states have stat- utes or court rules that specify that the contents of presentence reports, includ-ing any mental health information, are confidential and may be disclosed onlyto the court, prosecution, and defense. Most states permit the disclosure oftheir reports to correctional institutions that will be housing the offenders foruse in classification. 45 Facilitate the release of mental health information for use at the sentencing hearing. As noted earlier, communications between mental health providers and their clients are protected from disclosure without written consent from theclient authorizing the release of information. Furthermore, the offender hasthe right to refuse to answer any or all of the questions asked by the probationofficer during a PSI interview and offenders with a mental illness need to un-derstand this right. Refusing to cooperate with a PSI interview, however, maybe counterproductive, so the offender should obtain guidance from the defenseattorney on how to proceed before the presentence investigation begins. It is the obligation of the probation officer conducting the PSI to verify information contained in the report. As a result, if the offender indicates that available at: www.appa-net.org. 43. Position Statement of the American Probation and Parole Association.44. American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice: Sentencing , Standar d 18-5.6.b118 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecthe or she is in mental health treatment, the probation officer must verify that with the treatment program. To do so, the offender must authorize the releaseof information to the probation officer. The probation officer and defense coun-sel should work together to assure that necessary written consents have beensigned. The information the probation officer receives from a treatment pro-gram should include the offender's diagnosis, treatment recommendations ofthe attending clinician, and progress with treatment. When an individual's mental illness is already known, these reports should include information about any diagnosis that has been made, current and pasttreatment, and the resources available in the community that can help the of-fender refrain from engaging in the same or similar conduct that led to thearrest. At least one jurisdiction assigns specially trained probation officers tothese tasks. Example: Probation Department, Orange County (CA) In Orange County, probation officers specializing in mental health cases develop indi- vidualized integrated service plans and present them in the PSI that can includesocial services, housing, and medication as well as treatment for those with co-occur-ring mental health and substance abuse problems. Have a complete assessment conducted by a mental health clini- cian before sentencing when the mental health information con-tained in the pre-sentence investigation report is insufficient tomake an informed sentencing decision. The capacity to have that assessment done in a timely manner by a quali- fied professional should be available. The assessment should be conducted onan outpatient basis whenever possible. An inpatient assessment should be nec-essary only when the person poses too great a risk of injury to others or to himor herself, or of failure to report to court or to the assessment. In determiningwhether such risks exist, the judge should consult the prosecutor, defense at-torney, probation officer, and any available mental health records. Ensure that interview protocols used by probation staff with of- fenders with mental illness include questions that enable staff toidentify those with co-occurring substance abuse disorders. Just as identifying those with co-occurring disorders is important for other decisions in the court process, it should also be done at sentencing. See thediscussions on this topic under Policy Statement 10: Modification of PretrialDiversion Conditions and Policy Statement 11: Pretrial Release/Detention Hear-ing (also Policy Statement 29: Training for Court Personnel).dcChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 15: Sentencing \"The access to information will always be a provoca-tive issue.

WILLIAM DRESSELPresident, NationalJudicial College Source: Interview, January 11, 2002, Washington, DC.119 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectEstablish programs that provide judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys with options to address the mental health needs of theoffender. Those people with mental illness who have been in pretrial detention throughout the processing of the case, assuming that the recommendations in-cluded in Chapter 4: Incarceration and Reentry of this document have beenimplemented, would have received mental health services while in jail. It iscommon for misdemeanants who have not been released pretrial (either by ju-dicial decision or for inability to meet bail) to be found guilty of a crime and to besentenced to time served. At this point, they will be released from custody andneed have no more involvement with the criminal justice system regarding thatparticular offense. It is important that some discharge planning have beenundertaken for such offenders, to ensure that their release will lead to a suc-cessful reintegration in the community with appropriate treatment and ser-vices. Without such discharge planning, the likelihood of their returning to thecriminal justice system in short order is greatly increased. Some of those who have been on pretrial release while the case was being adjudicated, assuming the implementation of the recommendations in this sec-tion, would have mental health conditions attached to their release. As a start,the same options that exist for the pretrial release decision should also exist forthe sentencing decision. Additionally, once the individual has been convicted,the court has more authority to order mental health treatment. Example: Project Link, Monroe County (NY) In Monroe County, Project Link has developed a close working relationship with the probation department to identify offenders most in need of mental health services. Ithas a mobile treatment team, consisting of a psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, and fiveculturally diverse case workers, that is available 24 hours a day to focus on 40 of themost serious cases. Before ordering treatment as a condition of the sentence, the judge should, as specified in ABA sentencing standards, determine that the offender \"willparticipate in and benefit from\" the treatment program. 46 The judge should also determine whether the offender needs mental health services. Expand the sentencing options available in rural areas to provide mental health services for people with mental illness. (See Policy Statement 10: Modification of Pretrial Diversion Conditions and Policy Statement 11: Pretrial Release/Detention Hearing, for more on thistopic.)e f 45. See, for example, Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 703.120 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONModification of Conditions of Probation/ Supervised Release POLICY STATEMENT #16 Assist offenders with mental illness in complying with conditions of probation. If the offender is placed on probation with con- ditions, those conditions are supervised by a proba-tion officer. If the probationer fails to comply withthe conditions, the probation officer notifies thecourt. The court can revoke the probation, modifythe conditions, or issue a warning. Many of the same issues that were discussed under the Modification of Pretrial Release Condi-tions pertain here as well, including assisting theoffender in getting reconnected to treatment and tofinancial and housing support after a period of in-carceration, and establishing accountability in com-plying with the terms of release. There is an impor-16 tant distinction, though, that has implications fortreatment planning. Once the person has been con-victed and sentenced, the length of time that theoffender will be under supervision is known at theoutset\u2014six months, one year, 18 months, etc. Whilein the pretrial status, however, the duration of su-pervision lasts only as long as the case lasts, whichcannot be known when the release conditions areset. This distinction makes it easier for mentalhealth staff to develop an appropriate treatmentplan for individuals who are on probation as opposedto those on pretrial release. Develop probation conditions that are realistic and address the relevant individual issues presented by the offender. Typically, when a judge sentences an offender to probation, the order may read that the offender is to participate in treatment, whether drug, alcohol, ormental health. It is up to the probation officer to identify the most appropriatetreatment program for the offender, and then to monitor the offender's compli-ance. The key to successfully designing conditions of probation is to identifyfirst the offender's individual needs and then identify the services in the com-Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 16: Modification of Conditions of Probation/Supervised Release121 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmunity that can meet those needs. The information contained in the presen- tence investigation report, in addition to information taken at probation intake,should be very useful in identifying the needs of the individual offender. Streamline administrative procedures to ensure that federal and state benefits are reinstated immediately after a person with men- tal illness is released from jail. In instances when the person was on pretrial release while the case was pending there should have been no disruption in the receipt of benefits. Whenthe person was held in jail pretrial, however, or where there was a split sen-tence\u2014i.e., 30 days in jail followed by two years probation\u2014benefits would haveto be reinstated very soon after release so that the offender can begin to complywith the probation conditions. Probation officers should identify benefits forwhich an offender is eligible and assist the offender with the application orreinstatement process. (See Policy Statement 13: Intake at County / MunicipalDetention Facility, for more on federal and state benefits.) Assign offenders with mental health conditions on probation to probation officers with specialized training and small caseloads. Most probation officers carry very high caseloads, making it very difficult to provide close supervision. Offenders with mental illness recidivate at a higherrate than those without mental illnesses, and they often do so within the firstmonths of release. Close supervision by probation officers, including the timeto attend to the individual needs of offenders with mental illness, will help toensure compliance with conditions of release, and help to reduce recidivism. Itis also important that these offenders be assigned to probation officers whohave been specially trained to address the needs of offenders with mental ill-ness. Such an approach has been used with success in at least one jurisdiction. Example: Adult Probation Department, Cook County (IL) The Mental Health Unit of the Cook County, Illinois, Adult Probation Department is comprised of probation officers with a background in mental health. These officersare qualified to perform the following functions: \u0093conduct clinical assessments \u0093make referrals \u0093develop supervision plans \u0093monitor compliance with probation conditions, medication requirements, andother treatment objectivesb cRejection of Court- Referred Clients One important issue that should be addressed in any discussionof court referrals to mental healthprograms is the rejection of cli-ents by programs that have re-strictive admission criteria. Acommon frustration for courts isto identify a person with mentalhealth needs, consult its inven-tory of programs, and be unableto find a program that, becauseof the person's charge, treatmenthistory, or lack of insurance, iswilling to accept the person. (SeePolicy Statement 1: Involvementwith the Mental Health System.)One strategy to address this is-sue is the development of writ-ten agreements between the re-ferring entity and mental health agencies. 47 (See Policy State- ment 26: Institutionalizing the Partnership, for more on writtenagreements between criminal jus-tice and mental health partners.) 46.

Mental health providers whose clients are on probation, while being care- ful not to become monitors of compliance, can also assist the individual to un-derstand the consequences of their behavior in terms of sanctions and can builda collaborative relationship with the specialized probation officers that can ben-efit the individual. In this way, the probation officer can have more confidencewhen making decisions on how to respond to violations. For example, the of-ficer and the provider can meet jointly with the individual to identify barriersto compliance and to make changes in the treatment plan or probation rules asnecessary. Develop guidelines on compliance and violation policies regarding offenders with mental illness. It is important to establish incentives for probationers with mental illness to comply with conditions. Such incentives could include reducing the frequencyof reporting after a period of compliance. Example: Adult Probation Department, Cook County (IL) The Mental Health Unit of the Cook County Adult Probation Department has three phases, each lasting a minimum of three months. The first phase is the most restric-tive. Advancement to the next phases is contingent upon the probationer's compli-ance. Once advanced to a less restrictive phase, the probationer can be returned tothe previous phase for noncompliance. Upon successful completion of all three phases,the probationer is placed in the standard probation supervision program for the re-mainder of his or her term. Probation officers should be prepared to respond to offenders with mental illness who violate the conditions of probation in a way that recognizes that theviolation may be a function of the offender's illness but that also holds the of-fender accountable. When a probationer commits a technical violation\u2014forexample, failure to report to treatment\u2014probation officers should employ agraduated scheme of responses before employing the most serious response,that is, revocation of release. State law in Washington provides that, when anoffender with a mental illness violates a condition of a release that involvesfailure to undergo mental status evaluation or treatment, the community cor-rections officer must consult with the treatment provider before taking actionon the violation. Responding to minor technical violations early may obviatethe need for revocation and may prevent more serious violations, such asreoffending. In developing intermediate responses, criminal justice officialsshould establish written agreements with mental health treatment programsdChapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing Policy Statement 16: Modification of Conditions of Probation/Supervised Release \"You want [defendants] to think about the conse-quences\u2014stay on track,you get a messup, their not right to pun-ish them then.\" CONSUMER Derek Denckla and Greg Berman, Rethinking the Revolving Door: A Look at Mental Illness in the Courts.123 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectas to actions that will be taken for failure to participate in treatment. When a probationer's mental condition decompensates while under probation supervi-sion, a more appropriate response would be to modify the treatment plan ratherthan to seek the revocation of probation. At least one jurisdiction has developed a program that seeks to prevent a probation revocation by offering intensive treatment rather than incarcerationfor those who violate probation conditions. Example: The Nathaniel Project, Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services (CASES), New York City (NY) Among the groups targeted by the Nathaniel Project in New York, New York, (men- tioned earlier) run by the Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services,are offenders with mental illness who have violated conditions of probation. Casemanagers are clinically trained professionals with caseloads of only ten. Staff assist participants in obtaining medication, housing, and other services, i.e., day treatment,psychosocial clubhouse, vocational training, and job placement. (See Policy State- ment 14: Adjudication, for more on The Nathaniel Project.)Rearrest on New Charges It is not uncommon for people under supervision for a currentcharge\u2014whether pretrial diver-sion, pretrial release, or proba-tion\u2014to be rearrested on a newcharge. A person with mental ill-ness who is released from cus-tody may need time to stabilizeand rearrests may result duringperiods of decompensation..When rearrests occur, courtsshould treat them as they wouldother violations of the conditionsof supervision, weighing the se-riousness of the rearrest charge,and the person's compliance withother conditions of supervision.A rearrest on a new offenseshould not in and of itself be areason for denying pretrial re-lease in the new case or for re-voking release in the first case.124 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectCONCLUSION Leaders in jurisdictions able to implement the changes proposed in this chapter (along with those offered in the two preceding chapters, Involvementwith the Mental Health System and Contact with Law Enforcement) will havegone a long way toward ensuring that persons with mental illness that come incontact with the criminal justice system will be treated fairly and appropri-ately. Improved collaboration with mental health providers, access to appropri-ate information, and increased awareness about mental illness will better pre-pare the courts to determine the proper resolution of cases involving defendantswith mental illness. Sometimes, justice will be best served through diversionprograms that help individuals with mental illness obtain treatment and sup-port services. Many defendants with mental illness, however, will eventuallybe incarcerated. The next chapter, Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry, focuses on an area of the criminal justice system that is too often overlooked\u2014corrections.Correctional institutions are the ultimate destination for many individuals withmental illness who become involved with the criminal justice system; in manyways, they have become the country's new mental health institutions. It is important for officials who focus on pretrial issues, adjudication, and sentencing to become familiar with the policies and programs that need to be inplace to identify, treat, and prepare for release people with mental illness whoare incarcerated. These are the issues that the subsequent set of policy state-ments address.Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudication and Sentencing125 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIncarceration and ReentryCHAPTER IV OOne of the most dramatic public policy shifts (some refer to it as a \"social experiment\") during the last three decades in the United States has been the unprecedented increase of the number of people who are incarcerated. The na- tional prison population grew by nearly six-foldbetween 1970 and 2000 and the combined prison and jail population in 2000 was 1.9 million. 1 Ap- proximately 10 million people are booked into U.S.jails each year. 2 The extraordinary growth of prison and jail systems has presented enormous challenges to cor-rections administrators. Of these challenges, few, if any, are more formidable than operating a com- prehensive mental health service delivery systemfor inmates. Increasing budgetary pressures on corrections systems make this challenge especially daunting. Estimates regarding the number ofpeople with mental illness in prison or jail vary. The US Department of Justice reported in 1999 that about 16 percent have a mental illness. 3 Like the policy statements in the preceding chapters, the following policy statements do not suggest that people with mental illness should not be held accountable for their behavior. Indeed,given the crime they committed, it is appropriate and necessary for some people with mental illness to be incarcerated. The policy statements in this chapter adhere to the principle that identifying inmates with men- tal illness, treating them, and preparing them forrelease is good corrections policy. And it is the right thing to do. It improves corrections administra- tors' ability to protect people with mental illnesswhile they are incarcerated, to maintain calm en- vironments in the facilities, and to promote staff safety. Perhaps most importantly, the vast major- 1. The Sentencing Project, State Sentencing and Corrections Policy in an Era of Fiscal Restraint , available at: www.sentencingproject.org. 2.

Ditton, Mental Health and Treatment , p. 1127 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project 127ity of people in prison or jail will ultimately re-en- ter the community. Screening inmates for mental illness, delivering effective services, providing ap- propriate housing, and developing a comprehensivetreatment plan improve the likelihood that an in- mate with mental illness will return to the com- munity (and to his or her loved ones) healthy andsafely. The policy statements in this chapter go be- yond what should happen when a person with men-tal illness is incarcerated. They also address the role of community corrections officials in monitor- ing and assisting people with mental illness whoare released from prison or jail under some form of supervision. Furthermore, they review the pivotal role of the mental health system in maintainingthe person on a path toward recovery once the per- son is released.128 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectReceiving and Intake of Sentenced Inmates POLICY STATEMENT #17 Develop a consistent approach to screen sentenced inmates for men- tal illness upon admission to state prison or jail facilities and makereferrals, as appropriate, for follow-up assessment and/or evalua-tions. Every correctional system has procedures in place to receive a sentenced inmate admitted to an institution. These intake procedures typically are used for inmates who arrive at the institution from a detention facility immediately following their sen- tencing or for inmates who have been transferred from a different institution. Recommendations under this policy statement explain how corrections administrators can ensure that each sentenced offender entering the institu- tion is screened for potential mental illness. These recommendations include the following: the key elements of a screening instrument and its admin- istration; procedures to follow up on the results; and protocols for evaluating its effectiveness. Typically, when institutional intake staff receive inmates, they fingerprint them, conduct a medical exam, and review a host of issues in order to make decisions about classification, housing, and other programmatic or special needs. Determining whether the inmate needs mental health services should be a critical component of the inmate book- ing and receiving process. Immediately upon the inmate's arrival at the facility, it is especially im- portant for staff to determine whether the inmate has any suicidal tendencies or poses a danger to self or others, and whether he or she is taking psycho- tropic medication.17 Not adequately screening inmates to determine the possible existence of a mental illness jeopardizes the safety of personnel and inmates alike. Identify- ing and addressing mental illness among inmates will minimize the likelihood of an offender's risk of hurting him-or herself or others. It may also mini- mize the incidence of hospitalization, assaults on officers or other inmates, or other incidents that may generate considerable harm and costs. Responding to mental illness at a late stage requires the most expensive and intensive level of mental health care as well as collateral costs such as lost personnel time, overtime, and compensatory time when officers are injured. In addition, with a consistent, system-wide ap- proach in place for identifying inmates with mental illness, correctional administrators are able to com- pile the data needed to understand the scope of mental illness within their institutions. This, in turn, enhances their ability to project the future mental health needs of their agencies and communicate to policymakers the changing needs of prisoners. Some correctional administrators fear that a mental health screening process may overstate the mental health needs of the inmate population, and thus generate excessively expensive use of mental health services. Aside from identifying those indi-Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 17: Receiving and Intake of Sentenced Inmates129 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONviduals who are of immediate concern and who should receive urgent attention, however, a prop- erly designed and implemented screening function during the receiving and intake process only sug- gests when there may be a potential mental health problem that should be further assessed. It serves as a form of triage, ensuring a cost-effective use of resources. Screening alone is not intended to pro- vide a diagnosis or determine the need for services or medication. Implementation recommendations contained here are consistent with the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Task Force for Psychiatric Ser- vices in Jails and Prisons, which, since 1990, has developed guidelines for the delivery of mental health services in jails and prisons. Consistent with the APA, recommendations under this policy state- ment recognize the varying levels of services pro- vided upon admissions:4 \u0093Receiving Mental Health Screening.

As a result of the above, the APA advises, pro- fessional clinicians would then conduct the follow-ing: \u0093Comprehensive Mental Health Evalu- ation. A face-to-face interview of the pa- tient and a review of all reasonably avail-able health care records and collateralinformation. It includes a diagnostic formu-lation and, at least, an initial treatment plan. 4.

The purpose of a screening instrument is to identify inmates with mental illness immediately upon their arrival at the institution and to prompt referralfor further assessment of those inmates' mental health needs. 5 Screening in- struments typically are paper-and-pencil forms that may be completed by the inmate or used as a structured interview protocol by any trained staff person.It should take no longer than 10 to 15 minutes to conduct a screening. There are no validated instruments for mental health screening in adult populations. Most correctional settings use a series of questions that seek in- 5.

Ibid., p. 40.130 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectformation on past psychiatric services or current medications. Systematic at- tention to current psychiatric symptomatology is often cursory. The New YorkState Office of Mental Health has developed Suicide Prevention Screening Guide- lines that have face validity as a screening measure for suicide, and the state trains its correctional staff in the application of this tool. 6 Recognizing the need for a reliable screening tool, the National Institute of Justice has recently funded research at the University of Maryland to develop and test a nine-item Brief Jail Mental Health Screen. Correctional settings inMaryland and New York are participating in this study. Until a validated in- strument emerges, correctional administrators should work with their mental health staff to ensure questions are asked early on in the process that are sen-sitive to critical mental health issues. The discussion that follows addresses other issues essential in an effective screening instrument. Self-assessment should never entirely replace critical observations by staff. Use of a self-administered intake screening instrument does not absolve cor- rectional or clinical staff of the responsibility to query and observe for mental illness at the time of intake. Training staff for such responsibilities is essential.(See Policy Statement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel.) In general, when an effective screening instrument is implemented prop- erly, staff will more often incorrectly identify someone as exhibiting signs orsymptoms of mental illness than overlook someone who truly has a mental illness. Erring on the side of caution at the outset increases the likelihood that high-risk cases are discovered; only a relatively small percentage of mentalhealth assessments are conducted when they are not needed. A useful screen will send a significant percentage of inmates (perhaps as many as 25 percent) forward for a more comprehensive evaluation. Example: Screening Instrument, Oregon Department of Corrections In Oregon, staff administer a group-led pen-and-pencil instrument to all offenders admitted at the time of intake. This instrument generally identifies 30 percent of thepopulation as having a mental illness. When this 30 percent are referred for profes-sional assessment, the percentage assessed as having a significant mental illness isreduced to 17 percent. 7 A screening instrument should use an objective scoring system. Many jurisdictions use a straightforward numeric scoring system, resulting in a \"redflag\" or \"green flag\" determination of the possible presence of a mental illness. Though effective screening instruments currently in use vary considerably, each tool must address the following: suicidality; depression; use of narcotic drugsand hospitalization for psychiatric problems; trauma history; and the use of any medications prescribed for a mental illness. Substance abuse greatly influences symptoms of mental illness. For this reason, and because the majority of people with mental illness who are incar- 6.

Subsequent assessments shouldallow clinicians to observe the individual in a drug-free state over time in order to separate the causes and effects of substance abuse on mental health. Ideally, the intake process would be seamless, incorporating health screen- ing, mental health screening, classification procedures, and other protocols. This process could be captured in a single, integrated instrument, such as the one being developed by the University of Maryland. In some states, properly trained correctional officers\u2014especially those with close and sustained contact with inmates during the first few days of incarcera- tion\u2014serve as initial, informal screeners. They may be in the best position toobserve behavior and to identify signs and symptoms of mental illness, particu- larly when such symptoms emerge several days after intake. Although this measure may seem inefficient, given the screening that mental health staff willperform later, such redundancy is in fact cost-efficient; it effectively narrows the pool of inmates who receive a professional assessment to those who are most likely to have a mental illness. Ensure consistency of screening protocols within correctional sys- tem by using the same screening instrument at all facilities state-wide and training facility staff in their use. In many correctional systems, a different mental health screening instru- ment is employed at each prison in the system. Such variation among the pris-ons is complicated and compounded by the procedures in use at county jails, where staff at each facility typically employ a distinct instrument and process (if one is used at all) to screen inmates for mental illness. Although it may be achallenge, particularly in states with an elaborate network of independent county jails, state officials should require the use of the same screening and assess- ment instruments and protocols at all correctional facilities in the state. TheAmerican Psychiatric Association recommends standardizing mental health screening procedures and instruments so that the responses can be documented in a consistent fashion. 9 Uniformity in screening procedures has numerous advantages. It can pro- vide valuable information about the impact of transfers, the incidence of in- mate decompensation, and identify trends occurring over time. It also enablesstate correctional systems to collect data needed to inform research and evalu- ations and to support legislative advocacy and public education. To achieve uniformity, directors of state departments of corrections may be able to issue an administrative order. In other states, however, leadership from mental health 8.

APA, Psychiatric Services in Jails and Prisons , p. 41.Co-occurring Disorders in Prison In 2001, at the request of the Pennsylvania Office of MentalHealth and Substance Abuse, thePennsylvania Department of Cor-rections assembled data on themental health and treatment sta-tus of its inmate population inall Pennsylvania state prisonsover a four-year period. The datarevealed that 90 percent of theinmate population had an issuewith substance use, of which theyestimated about 75 percent hada substance abuse problem seri-ous enough to warrant treatment.Concurrently, about 15 percent ofthe total Pennsylvania inmatepopulation had a mental disorder.Of the 15 percent of inmates withmental health disorders, 90 per-cent also had a substance useissue and an estimated 75 per-cent warranted drug and alcoholtreatment. These data were con- sistent over four consecutive years. 88888 This prevalence of in- mates with co-occurring disordersis certainly not unique to Penn-sylvania. Although this chapter of the re- port does not assume that an in-mate with a mental illness has aco-occurring substance abusedisorder, it does recognize thatthe assessment, housing, pro-gram, treatment, case manage-ment, and habilitation needs ofinmates with mental illness mustaddress substance abuse issuesas well if they are to be effec-tive.b132 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectagencies or statewide legislative advocacy may be necessary, especially when county government officials are unwilling to assume the financial implications of implementing such an order. Example: Screening Instrument, New York State Office of Mental Health In an attempt to encourage uniformity of mental health screening, assessment, and referral procedures, the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) has beendeveloping model policies and instruments for use in New York's county and munici-pal jails. First, in 1985, OMH developed and field-tested a suicide screening protocolfor use in the jails. The New York State Commission of Correction, which accreditsand oversees the development of new technology for jails and prisons in the state,adopted the suicide screening protocol and now requires all county jails and peniten-tiaries and state prisons to employ it. More recently, OMH, in association with the Ne w York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS), has been involved in sponsoring jail validationstudies of two receiving screening instruments developed by the Nathan Kline Insti-tute for Psychiatric Research for use in community settings. One, the \"MINI Screen,\"was designed to identify individuals with substance abuse problems who are receivingservices in community mental health settings. The second, the \"DALI Screen,\" wasdesigned to identify individuals with mental health problems who are receiving treat-ment in substance abuse settings. 10 At the time of publication of this report, the jail validation study involving 400 newly admitted detainees and offenders at New YorkState county jails had just gotten under way. In states and localities where correctional institutions are located at con- siderable distance from one another, some jurisdictions have relied on informa- tion technology to ensure consistent screening and assessment methods. Example: Suicide Screening Initiative, Alaska Department of Corrections There are 13 correctional facilities and pretrial facilities in Alaska, a state where geography and low population density present particular challenges. To ensure con-sistent, comprehensive inmate mental health screening, the Alaska Department ofCorrections has developed a screening tool that trained, nonmedical staff can down-load, administer, and return completed almost immediately to the department's cen-tral office using handheld personal desk assistants or Palm Pilots. Mental healthprofessionals in the central office can then make assessments and recommend orinitiate appropriate interventions, if needed. The Palm Pilot serves not only as an electronic means of keeping medical records, but as a platform for the entire manag ement information system. All clinicians perform the same, standardized exam on the Palm Pilot. The information is then uploaded toa statewide computer network and becomes available for printing of medical files.The system makes it possible to generate information in summary and/or aggregateform, thereby facilitating quality assurance and research. As is the case in many correctional facilities, Alaska's Suicide Screening Initiative relies exclusively on inmate self-reported information. It is impor-tant, however, to use sources other than the inmate alone to supplement self- reported mental health information. Self-reports are not always reliable, and 10. M.J. Alexander, \"Validating the MINI Screen for Men- tal Health Problems in Chemical Dependency Treatment Settings\" and \"Validating the DALI Screen for SubstanceAbuse in Mental Health Treatment Settings,\" The Nathan Kline Institute of the Center for the Study of Issues in Public Mental Health, Orangeburg, NY .Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 17: Recei ving and Intake of Sentenced Inmates133 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectthey rarely provide a complete picture of an inmate's mental health treatment history; sometimes, they also fail to shed light on co-occurring disorders. It isessential to obtain this information during the assessment phase, and it helps to inform decisions regarding classification and treatment plans. When the screening results in a \"red flag,\" staff should seek additional information, such as an existing treatment plan or information about medica- tions the inmate has been prescribed, from supplemental sources. For example, the mental health professional conducting the subsequent mental health as-sessment should review information and reports from other criminal justice staff, such as the pretrial investigator, the presentence investigator, and county/ municipal detention staff, who have previously had contact with the inmate.Reports from other criminal justice system personnel such as law enforcement or jail officials will provide details of mental health and behavioral issues perti- nent to the screening and evaluation process of the inmate. Additionally, statedepartments of correction may wish to consider gathering supplemental infor- mation from the local or county corrections authority. It might be advisable for states to require county jail officials to inform receiving state correctional au-thorities if a person has been receiving mental health services. Such informa- tion is not considered confidential, and may well prove to be critical for the health and well-being of inmates with mental illness. Staff should also obtain assessment and treatment history information from community mental health treatment providers. In at least some corrections systems, staff encourage the inmate to sign a release of records form, whichallows correctional staff including clinicians to obtain mental health records from previous treatment providers in the community. In other cases, staff at the corrections center request the assistance of community mental health offi-cials in cross-referencing the names of their clientele with the jail population (see Policy Statement 13: Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility). The individual charged with conducting the screening is most often the booking or receiving officer, intake nurse, or intake clinician; in general, any properly trained individual can administer a straightforward screening instru- ment and gather necessary information. As state mental health agencies be-come more involved in assisting, overseeing, and/or providing mental health services within the criminal justice system, professional credentialing and li- censing requirements are more likely to be consistently enforced when address-ing the needs of people with mental illness in correctional settings. A low-cost, high-quality solution involves making arrangements with educational institu- tions that can place graduate-level clinical psychology or social work studentinterns at facilities to conduct screening and assessment of inmates. The extent to which any of these staff implement the screening procedures effectively, however, depends in large part on whether they understand theirresponsibilities and execute them properly. In short, training on issues such as the screening protocol, the appropriate use of information gathered, confidenti- ality issues, and cultural and gender sensitivity is key. (See Policy Statement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel.)134 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectDevelop a system of triage to ensure that follow-up responses to the screening results reflect the immediacy of the inmate's needs. An effective screening tool should enable screeners to distinguish between inmates in need of immediate mental health attention and inmates currently on medication or in treatment who will require a complete assessment within24 hours of their screening. When staff members conducting the screenings determine that inmates are in need of immediate attention, they should ensure that these inmates are transferred to a specialty facility for 24-hour observa-tion and care or placed on suicide watch until more suitable arrangements can be made. They should also check whether there is any indication that the newly admitted inmate is currently taking psychotropic mediation and ensure that heor she receives it when ready for the next dose. Inmates who display significant mental health disorders should receive a professional mental health assessment as soon as possible after admission. TheAPA recommends that a brief mental health assessment for individuals who screen positive for mental illness should be conducted within 72 hours, with a provision for immediate evaluation in cases of increased urgency. 11 These brief assessments may be conducted by qualified health profession- als (e.g., general practitioner nurses or physicians) where specialty mental health staff are not available daily. After this brief assessment, the inmate should beplaced on a medication review protocol and scheduled for a full treatment plan review within 30 days. Evaluate periodically the effectiveness of the screening instrument employed, as well as the mental health assessment and mentalhealth evaluation protocols. Staff can implement various mechanisms at the facility level to ensure that the instrument and protocols are successfully identifying inmates who have significant mental health issues and following up appropriately: \u0093Inter-rater reliability review . Comparison of the outcomes of screen- ings conducted by different staff. \u0093Feedback from assessment results . Determination of the rates at which a positive screening successfully identified an inmate with men-tal health needs and the rates at which a positive screen incorrectlyflagged a mental illness or mental health problem. \u0093Interdisciplinary review. Interdisciplinary communication (i.e., among health and custody staff) about mental health screening issues. Another key element in evaluating the effectiveness of screening and re- ferrals is to determine the extent to which the screening instrument is sensi- 11. APA, Psychiatric Services in Jails and Prisons , p. 41.dcChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement ving Intake of Sentenced Inmates135 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecttive to cultural variations and that those who administer the process are sensi- tive to inherent cultural biases. Inmates with mental illness are disproportion-ately African American, Hispanic, and Native American. Given the reality, it is incumbent on those who oversee and carry out the care and supervision of de- fendants and offenders with mental illness to ensure that the procedures un-dertaken and the services provided are done so in a nondiscriminatory way, while at the same time are sensitive about and responsive to cultural and lin- guistic differences. Similarly, the growing number of women who have a men-tal illness and who come to the attention of the criminal justice system deserve gender-specific and gender-competent care and treatment. No matter how culturally competent or how culturally neutral a screening instrument may be, it will not substitute or supercede personnel's abilities when it comes to asking questions and making observations. It is critical that, in addition to training around the signs and symptoms of mental illness, specificsabout screening, and preliminary assessment protocols, staff need to be trained to move toward cultural competency. Conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation of every inmate flagged as having significant mental health issues during the pro-fessional mental health assessment process. A comprehensive mental health evaluation should include, at a minimum, the following: \u0093mental health history \u0093prior treatment \u0093medication history \u0093relevant psychosocial history (i.e., family, social, legal, relationships) \u0093functional assessment \u0093current situational stressors \u0093mental status examination \u0093current diagnosis \u0093relevant medical diagnoses \u0093current medication \u0093substance abuse status The evaluation should include a structured interview with inmates and a review of any available mental health records and collateral information, in- cluding behavioral observations by institutional staff. The evaluation should result in a diagnosis and a preliminary treatment plan. 12. See: www.georgetown.edu/research/gucdc/nccc/ index.html 13. T. Cross, B. Bazron, K. Dennis, M.

In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), the Supreme Court addressed the medical needs of prisoners in the context of the Eighth Amendment. The court held that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs is prohibited \"whether the indif- ference is manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs orby prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or inten- tionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed. Regardless of how evidenced,deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious illness or injury states a [claim under the Constitution.] Id. at 104-105.\" A prisoner m ust provide evidence of \"acts or omis- sions sufficiently harmful\" to show deliberate indifference in order to bring an Eighth Amendment claim.

In 1994 the Court said that deliberate indifference \"[lies] somewhere be-Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions POLICY STATEMENT #18 Use the results of the mental health assessment and evaluation to develop an individualized treatment, housing, and programming plan,and ensure that this information follows the inmate whenever he orshe is transferred to another facility. Correctional administrators should ensure that the results of the initial receiving mental healthscreening\u2014along with subsequent screenings, as-sessments, and evaluations\u2014inform the decisionsthat follow regarding housing, programming, andtreatment. Mental health screeners serve asgatekeepers who, in turn, must communicate effec-tively with correctional staff responsible for hous-ing and program decisions. Once mental health staff have determined the inmate has a mental illness, several decisions fol-low. Mental health staff must develop an individu-alized treatment plan that recognizes the specificneeds of each inmate. They also must work withcorrectional staff to determine the housing unit andprograms to which such persons should be assigned.Information about decisions made at one institutionmust be passed along to the staff at the institutionthat next receives the inmate.18 The first series of recommendations under this policy statement addresses the use of medicationsin correctional settings. The development over theprevious 15 years of new types of psychotropic medi-cations, has in-creased dramatically the prospects of recovery forpeople with mental illness. The prescription of medications, however, should be only one component\u2014not the central fo-cus\u2014of a treatment or case management plan. His-torically, staff at many correctional facilities haveoverrelied on the use of psychotropic medicationsand, in many cases, sedative-hypnotic medications,simply to pacify and to control inmates with mentalillness and others believed to be disruptive. Thisreveals a common prejudice about inmates withmental illness: they are noncompliant, difficult tomanage, violent, and otherwise undeserving of clini-cal attention or services. This is a view current clini-cal research and practice does not support.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions137 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION Include the most appropriate psychotherapeutic medications in prison and county correctional institution formularies. A growing body of clinical evidence shows the benefits of widespread ac- cess to the newer generation of medications (see Policy Statement 35: Evidence-Based Practices). Fewer people taking these medications require hospitaliza-tion or rehospitalization, yielding substantial cost savings. More people takingthem are able to enter the workforce and reduce their dependency on a widearray of social services. As the benefits of the newer medications have becomemore widely recognized the demand has increased, allaying concerns abouthigher costs. Newer medications, which are considerably more expensive than older medications, are not used as frequently in prisons and in jails as they are in thegeneral community. Using these newer medications in many instances, how-ever, is in fact cost-effective; their ability to increase the likelihood that theinmate will adhere to his treatment plan may offset, at least in the long term,the difference in cost between the two generations of medications. Correctional officials usually require that licensed staff in the jail or prison pharmacy fill prescriptions, including those for psychotropic medications, inaccordance with a departmentally prescribed formulary. Policies should defineprocedures that ensure a balance between the higher cost and the more desir-able results, including the lesser side effects of many of these new medications.At a minimum, pharmacies should maintain adequate stocks of the most com-monly prescribed psychotropic medications. These should not be limited to theleast expensive and generic brands. Sufficient supplies of newer medicationsthat have been prescribed by the psychiatrist for individual patients shouldalso be kept on hand. Furthermore, regardless of whether a particular medication is on the jail or prison formulary, there should be provision for obtaining any medicationthat a physician deems appropriate to prescribe. If the medication is not on theformulary, the physician should be able to order it as a special request andreceive it in a timely manner. 14 tween the poles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledge at the other\"(Farmer v.

Federal DistrictCourts (the trial court in the federal system) may interpret \"adequate\" with wide discretion.

See APA, Psy- chiatric Services in Jails and Prisons, p. 2138 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectDevelop and adopt jointly standardized clinical decision protocols (i.e., algorithms) that are based upon research conducted on a na-tional level . In order to ensure consistency in the application of psychotropic medica- tions, and to manage pharmacy costs, state correctional agency officials shouldwork with leaders in the mental health system to develop and adopt jointlystandardized clinical decision protocols (i.e., algorithms) that are based uponresearch conducted on a national level. Example: National Formulary, Federal Bureau of Prisons In an effort to deliver consistent and cost-effective medical care, the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) established theNational Formulary for the Bureau of Prisons. The committee's objectives are to en-sure that inmate medical care will be delivered consistently and cost-effectively as aresult of the formulary's implementation. Implementation of the formular y includes review of evidence-based scientific litera- ture for new and existing drugs and to determine their appropriate role in the Bureau'spharmacotherapeutic armamentarium. It is the committee's role, through the formu- lary, to stay current with BOP clinical treatment guidelines for medical and mentalhealth conditions, as well as reflect the generally accepted professional practices ofthe medical community at large. The committee meets and conducts reviews annually and is composed of pharma- cists and clinicians from the bureau and other institutions and includes the chiefphysician and chief psychiatrist; it is chaired by the chief pharmacist. Responsibili-ties include reviewing the formulary and updating it to be in line with evidence-basedmedicine; new drugs are reviewed by conducting literature searches and cost/benefitanalyses to determine whether the side effect of a given drug is worth the benefit of administering it. Example: University of Texas Medical Branch, Texas Department of Criminal Justice Beginning in 1995, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) developed policy and guidelines for facility-level providers to obtain nonformulary drugs for offendersin the custody of the Texas Department of Corrections. TDCJ has incorporated theprocedure for obtaining nonformulary drugs for inmates as part of the PharmacyPolicy and Procedure Manual. The prescribing physician must provide documentationin the offender's health record about what role the desired drug will have in theoffender's treatment plan ( e.g., diagnosis, special considerations) and also provide documentation confirming that no acceptable substitute is available on the formulary. Procedures and a flowchart have been developed to show the protocols for what hap- pens when such a request is made. Requests for nonformulary medication are made tothe clinical pharmacist assigned, who, in turn, evaluates the request by a review of information provided by the prescribing physician/psychiatrist and/or a review ofother relevant information including the target disease, previous medications used forthe indication, dosages, compliance allergies, diagnostic procedure, TDCJ DiseaseManagement guidelines, national standards and guidelines, and applicable scientificliterature.bChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions139 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice has evaluated the pr ogram through contin- ued monitoring of nonformulary requests and denials. The initiative is funded througha contract with the University of Texas Medical Branch/Correctional Managed Care toprovide mental health services for offenders in the TDCJ through the CorrectionalManaged Care Advisory Committee. Much progress has been made in the area of clinical informatics as a result of managed care initiatives that have moved into pharmacy services. Example: The Texas Medication Algorithm Project, Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation The Texas Medical Algorithm Project (TMAP) is a public and academic collaborative effort headed by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.TMAP is designed to improve the quality of care and achieve the best possible patientoutcome by establishing a treatment philosophy for medication management. TMAPdeveloped and instituted a set of algorithms to illustrate the order and method inwhich to use various psychotropic medications. The TMAP algorithms have beenadopted by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for use in the state's prisons. The ultimate goal of TMAP is to optimize patient outcomes with the underlying as- sumption that resources will be most optimally utilized. It is intended to develop andcontinuously update treatment algorithms and to train systems to apply these meth-ods to minimize emotional, physical, and financial burdens of mental disorders forclients, families, and health care systems. TMAP consists of four phases. During Phase 1, guidelines were developed through scientific evidence and expert clinical consensus, resulting in the development ofalgorithms for use of various psychotropic medications for three major psychiatricdisorders: schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Phase 2was the feasibility trial of the project and evaluated the suitability, applicability, andcosts of the algorithms. The third phase was a comparison of the clinical outcomesand economic costs of using these medication guidelines vs. traditional treatment/medication methods. The fourth and final phase is the implementation of TMAPthroughout clinics and hospitals of the Texas Department of Mental Health and Men-tal Retardation and is known as the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithms(TIMA). Collaboration for this project included public sector and academic partners,parent and family representatives, and mental health advocacy groups. 15 In order to ensure quality and objectivity, correctional agencies should en- list the services of a licensed pharmacist to review policies and procedures, andto assist in a review of the use of medications in the facilities. For example,there may be some instances when physicians prescribe the newer, more ex-pensive medications even though the older medications may achieve the samedesired clinical outcome. If replacement medications are considered, prescrib-ing physicians should keep in mind the potential impact of side effects associ-ated with switching medications. Checks and balances must be establishedand enforced to ensure that physicians are not overprescribing medicationsthat yield little additional salutary effect. 15. Graphic presentations of algorithms and explanatory physicians' manuals are available on the TMAP Web site: www.mhmr.state.tx.us/centraloffice/medicaldirector/ TMAPtoc.html .140 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRequire, at a minimum, that (1) mental health-specific case man- agement services and (2) effective, research-based behavioral andcounseling interventions accompany the use of medication. To ensure that mental health and correctional facilities staff members do not become overly dependent on medications alone to modify or to control in-mate behavior, mental health services should include an array of interventionsdesigned to meet the unique needs of inmates with mental illness. When inter-disciplinary teams work together to develop a treatment plan, the services de-livered are more likely to be balanced and tailored to the specific needs of theinmate Interventions that have proven to be effective in a correctional setting in- clude the following: \u0093cognitive-behavioral therapy, particularly those interventions that im- prove basic problem-solving skills and reduce maladaptive (criminal)thinking \u0093individual and group therapy that is skill \u0093independent living-skills training \u0093medication self-management \u0093relapse prevention \u0093physical exercise programs Example: Behavior Modification Treatment Level System, West Virginia Division of Corrections The West Virginia Division of Corrections has implemented a Behavior Modification Treatment Level System at the Mount Olive Correctional Complex. Mental health staffat the facility put this system in place to facilitate effective inmate management and toprovide an incentive for inmates placed in the Mental Health Unit (MHU) to achieve anappropriate functioning level. Programming is offered at various levels for some inmates who used to be locked down in their cells for 23 hours a day. Since the program has started there has beenonly one four-point restraint utilization, no cell extractions, and inmates that used tobe housed in single cells are now stabilized and socialized to be double bunked. Toincrease success, the warden was asked to forgo disciplinary infractions for inmatesreceiving mental health treatment on the unit. This approach has empowered mentalhealth staff to implement programming without having punitive restrictions. Criticalto this approach is the ability to select staff who are philosophically aligned with ahabilitation model as opposed to a punitive model. At most institutions, correctional staff members provide general case man- agement services. When inmates have a mental illness, however, they shouldbe assigned to case managers specially trained to understand the distinct ser-vice needs of this population.cChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions \"Effective treatment makes our prisons safer andeasier to manage. Prisonwardens are keenly awarethat inmates exhibitingsymptoms of mental ill-ness can cause unrest andtension in the generalpopulation.

All programs for inmates with mental illness should also address inmates with co-occurring substance abuse disorders. Over the past decade, virtuallyevery state department of corrections has implemented residential substanceabuse treatment programs within their prisons. Some of these programs spe-cialize in treating the dually diagnosed\u2014those with co-occurring substance abuseand mental health problems. These programs generally serve inmates whoseprimary problem is substance abuse, and whose mental health problems tendto be less severe but there are clearly examples of offenders with co-occurringdisorders whose mental illness is the primary concern. Some of these residen-tial programs are specifically designed for women\u2014a large percentage of whomare dually diagnosed\u2014with depression as the primary psychiatric diagnosis. 16 Key program components for co-occurring disorders include the following: an extended assessment period; transition into institution or community-based after-care facilities. Many programs use therapeutic community approaches thatare modified to provide greater individual counseling and support, less con-frontation, smaller staff caseloads, and cross-training of staff. 17 (See Policy Statement 37: Co-Occurring Disorders.) Example: Co-occurring Disorder Programs, Columbia River Correctional Institution (OR) In 1998, the Oregon DOC combined state and federal grant resources to create a system of four co-occurring disorder programs at a single institution (the ColumbiaRiver Correctional Institution). Two of these programs are for men, and two forwomen. One program for each gender is targeted at inmates whose problems are moreheavily weighted toward addiction and criminality, but who also have some mentalhealth problems (the Turning Point programs). Another two programs (again, one foreach gender) are designed to address the needs of offenders with serious and signifi-cant mental health problems who also have problems with addiction. Mental healthand substance abuse treatment in all four programs is provided in an integratedmanner, with much cross-pollination of ideas and information among supervisors andstaff of all four. 16.

This allows for fastand efficient communication be-tween planners and policymakersat the agency level, as well astreatment supervisors and treat-ment providers at the facilitylevel. Each year, the Oregon DOCbrings together its substanceabuse and mental health plannersand providers for a two-day \"in-tegration seminar,\" where mattersof mutual concern are consideredand year, theseminar focused on relapse pre-vention.142 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectFacilitate access to professional psychiatric services by using telepsychiatry in systems where inmates are distributed across alarge geographical area or in locations where there is a shortageof psychiatric service providers. Qualified, licensed mental health staff can be hard to come by in jails and prisons located in remote, rural areas. As a result, some jurisdictions, includ-ing some in Texas, have resorted to electronic communications as a means ofproviding professional, clinical services to such institutions. (See Policy State-ment Section 41: Workforce.) Example: Telemedicine, Texas Department of Criminal Justice Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) is responsible for providing medical care in the western portion of Texas to inmates in the Texas Department ofCriminal Justice and to juveniles in five Texas Youth Commission facilities. In 1994,TTUHSC began delivering health services to inmates via telecommunications technol-ogy. As of 2002, TTUHSC conducts approximatel y 2,000 prison telemedicine consulta- tions a year for the 33,000 inmates that are housed in the 26 prison units for whichTTUHSC is under contract. Approximately one-third of all telemedicine consultations are in telepsychiatry and telepsychology. This expansion has significantly reducedthe amount of time clinicians spend driving to distant prison sites. Psychotropic medications should be prescribed by, or in consultation with, a psychiatrist or other licensed mental health professional having training inpsychotropic medications and authority to prescribe them as determined by thestate. Given the shortage of psychiatrists, doctors who provide general healthcare, but who are not credentialed in psychiatry, are allowed to prescribe psy-chotropic medications for inmates with serious mental illness. It is essentialthat physicians who specialize in psychiatric medicine oversee mental healthtreatment, in addition to psychotropic medication prescription, administration,and monitoring. Review mental health services provided to ensure that they are evidenced-based. Like their counterparts in the community, mental health professionals working in correctional settings have access to a growing body of research docu-menting the effectiveness of certain interventions and the promise of others.Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that various service models have littleor no impact on the behavior or health of a person with mental illness. Toensure provision of the most effective possible services to people with mentalillnesses in prisons and jails, correctional mental health officials should stayabreast of the work of research efforts on evidence-based practices such as thoseconducted at the New Hampshire Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center andat the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directorse fChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions143 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project(NASMHPD) Research Institute.18 Researchers affiliated with these organiza- tions have identified services that have been shown in a variety of settings toprovide treatments and supports that will enhance the ability of a person withmental illness to live successfully in the community. (See Policy Statement 35:Evidence-Based Practices.) Ensure the cultural competency of all programs for inmates with mental illness. As stated earlier in this chapter, the majority of people incarcerated in the United States are African American or Latino. In some states, people of colormake up nearly 80 percent of the prison population. Cultural competency hasgenerally been shown to improve client receptiveness to services and counseloreffectiveness (see Policy Statement 40: Cultural Competency). Mental healthservices in correctional settings should recognize the effects of culture on allaspects of mental illness and, in order to treat inmates effectively, should orga-nize and design their approaches accordingly. In particular, clinicians and othercorrectional staff who are in routine contact with inmates with mental illnessshould receive training to enhance their \"cultural competency\" and their abilityto recognize and respond to the needs of people from different cultural back-grounds who come under their care or control. Provide mental health treatment and services that are gender-specific. Male and female inmates may have similar mental illnesses and custody levels, but their treatment plans, housing situations, and programming needswill be distinct. For example, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has found thathistories of trauma and abuse are particularly high among females in prisonand jail: more than 78 percent of female state prison inmates and more than 72percent of the female population in jail reported such histories. 19 In response, a growing number of jurisdictions have instituted programs intended to identify women who are victims of past abuse and to offer interven-tions that meet their specific needs. These programs provide training that helpscorrectional administrators and officers to understand the high prevalence oftrauma history among their inmates as well as the relationship between abuse,substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal behavior. The programs alsoinclude interventions that help inmates with histories of abuse to better under-stand their own situations, often through group meetings. 18. Available at: www.dartmouth.edu/dms/psychrc; www.nasmhpd.org 19. Ditton, Mental Health and Treatment , p. 6. Although the prevalence of histories of abuse is much higher among females than males, male inmates with mental illness were also significantly more likely than inmates without mentalillness to report a history of abuse. More than 32 percent of male state prison inmates and more than 30 percent of male jail inmates reported such histories, as comparedwith 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of male in- mates without mental illness. 20. Travis et al., From Prison to Home , p.14g h144 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: The TAMAR Project, Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration, Division of Special Populations The TAMAR (Tr auma, Addictions, Mental health, And Recovery) Project was initially piloted in one rural and two suburban counties in Maryland and has now spread to anumber of counties in the state. Its goal is to provide integrated services for womenwho typically have interrelated tr auma, substance abuse, and mental illness issues. Meeting in groups, the women are encouraged to share their stories with one anotherand to engage in therapeutic activities such as art therapy and journal writing. Oncereleased from jail, women in TAMAR are able to continue to meet in groups in thecommunity that pro vide continuing support. Recognize the distinct programming needs of special populations with mental illness, such as the elderly, the developmentally dis-abled, those with chronic medical problems, substance abusers,and sex offenders. Prisons have increasing numbers of inmates with mental illness who also are elderly, developmentally disabled, or sex offenders. The clinical needs, treat-ment approaches, strengths and deficits, and general goals of programs for in-mates in these groups differ significantly. Correctional administrators shouldensure that mental health programs and services provided to these special popu-lations are distinct from programs and services provided to other inmates withmental illness Some program approaches that serve sex offenders and those with devel- opmental disabilities may provide useful guidance for approaches for offenderswith co-occurring disorders. Example: Program for Inmates with Developmental Disa bilities, Texas Department of Criminal Justice This program was established to minimize the negative effects of incarceration on offenders who have developmental disabilities and to maximize the likelihood of theirsuccessful reintegration into the community. An Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) includesa physician or registered nurse, licensed or certified psychologist, social caseworker,vocational supervisor, social work supervisor, and rehabilitation aide. Occupationaltherapists and speech pathologists are included as necessary. The IDT performs aneeds assessment to determine what services are best suited to meet the needs of theindividual. A vocational evaluation is completed, which takes into account the inmate'sassets and limitations. Offenders with developmental disabilities are housed in theleast restrictive environment appropriate to their habilitation, treatment, and safetyand security needs. Available services include: medical care; psy educational programming; abuse treatment; treat- ment planning and monitoring; and continuity of care (transitional planning). Example: ASEND Program, Utah Department of Correction Since 1986, the Utah Department of Corrections has been operating the Advantage Program at the Utah State Prison to address the needs of offenders with an IQ belowiChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions145 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project70. In 1999, space was designated at the prison and new policies and procedures were implemented for an expanded program, called ASEND, operating in a segregatedliving unit. The ASEND Program provides prog ramming for those inma tes lacking the skills and knowledge to meet the standards of self-sufficiency and acceptable social responsi-bilities, not only in society but also within this institutional environment. The goal ofthe ASEND Program is to assist inmates to live successfully in the prison populationand to prepare for their eventual release to the community. The program comprises the following components: 1) a written individual habilitative plan; 2) an education program component; 3) a cognitive programming component; 4)an employment job readiness component; 5) modified behavior privilege matrix; 6)additional services coordination for inmates who have a mental illness, or who havesexual or drug abuse histories; 7) recreation and physical activities; 8) aftercare ser-vices; and 9) appropria te training and habilitative specialist status for block officers. Example: Sexual Offender Accountability and Responsibility (SOAR) Program, North Carolina Department of Corrections SOAR is a voluntary day treatment program for incarcerated sexual offenders referred by psychological staff from state prisons. Two program sessions are held each year,with a total of 72 offenders participating. Inmates are housed in a segregated unitwhile participating. Group therapy conducted by a program staff psychologist is theprimary mode of treatment. The program, which has been in existence since 1991, isrelatively inexpensive to operate ($7.16 per day per inmate) and has been demon-strated to be reasonably effective. The latest outcome study reported that by April2000, 302 of a total of 501 participants who had completed the program had beenreleased to the community. Of these 302 men, only 7, or 2.3 percent, had beenreturned to prison for a new sexual offense charge. This compares very favorably withthe return rate of general population inmates in North Carolina. According to a 1996study, 47 percent of all inmates leaving North Carolina prisons are reconvicted withinthree years. A youth SOAR program designed to serve offenders between the ages of16 and 21 is planned. Example: Sexual Offender Residential Treatment (SORT) Program, Virginia Department of Corrections SORT provides comprehensive assessment and treatment services for inmates who are a moderate to high risk for reoffense. The program operates in five phases: orien-tation; assessment; treatment readiness; treatment; and release planning. The pro-gram begins with the development of an indivi dualized treatment plan, then progresses through the participation by offenders in various psychoeducational groups, and, fi-nally, in a program of trea tment having the Trans-theor etical Model and Cognitive Behavioral Techniques as its basis. The release planning phase, which includes theparticipation of the offender's community supervision officer and family members, includes an evaluation of future needs and the identification of programs and provid-ers to address such needs.146 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectDevelop graduated housing options for inmates with mental illness that ensure the safety of staff and inmates and prepare inmates,when appropriate, for transition from specialized housing to gen-eral population units. Beyond general population beds, correctional administrators usually have few housing options, especially in overcrowded facilities, for inmates with men-tal illness. In those units, staff members generally are not trained adequatelyto address these inmates' needs. Inmates suffering from severe mental illnesswho are housed in general population, especially when their illness is undiag-nosed or untreated, often decompensate more quickly than they would in hous-ing designed and operated for inmates with mental illness. When inmates withmental illness in general housing decompensate they are likely to incur disci-plinary infractions, which in turn prompts their reassignment to segregationcells, where their mental health is likely to deteriorate still further and morerapidly. Centralized and noncentralized approaches to housing inmates with men- tal illness each have benefits and drawbacks. Generally, it is more cost-effi-cient to hold people with significant problems in specialized units at a centralfacility. On the other hand, decentralizing services provides greater adminis-trative flexibility. Furthermore, \"mainstreaming\" inmates who can safely behoused in the general population reduces the stigma associated with mentalillness. An ideal approach to this issue is to have both options available. Depend- ing upon the size of the system and facilities, correctional administrators shouldprovide separate residential services to inmates with serious mental illness, aswell as a range of counseling activities in day and outpatient levels of care.Several states have developed multilevel housing systems for inmates with se-rious mental illness. These include maximum-security medical units, step-down,post-acute housing, and transitional housing units. In order to make the most appropriate housing assignment for an inmate with mental illness, staff should first take into account the medical require-ments of the inmate, including concurrent nonpsychiatric conditions (e.g., HIV,TB, etc.). For example, inmates whose medical needs are within reasonablelimits, are medication compliant, and are responsive to supervision could likelybe assigned appropriately to general population units. Cross-discipline partici-pation on panels and committees that make decisions regarding the handling ofinmates with mental illness should be a standard practice. Correctional staff should reevaluate the housing assignments of inmates with mental illness routinely to ensure the assignment is properly serving theirchanging needs. Inmates assigned to a specific unit because of their mentalillness should be evaluated regularly for changes in their mental health needs.jChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions147 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProvide disciplinary hearing officers with the proper orientation and training to make informed decisions about offenders withmental illness. Custody and program staff, whether they are assigned to special housing units or to general population, should receive training in basic mental healthissues. In order to have an impact on problem inmates with mental illnessreceiving disciplinary actions due to their illness, it is recommended that hear-ing officers, and others involved in the work of disciplinary committees, alsoreceive this training. These officers should have discretion to consider the pres-ence of mental illness as a mitigating factor in imposing sanctions (see PolicyStatement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel). Ensure continuity of services when inmates are transferred to a different facility. When inmates are transferred to a new institution, it is critical that infor- mation regarding their mental illness and treatment history accompany them.When this information does not follow the transferred inmate, the receivingfacility must undertake the inefficient and expensive step of conducting an-other evaluation. Service delivery between the two institutions should also be seamless. Without continuity of care, an inmate's condition can worsen. Employing one of three mechanisms will enable corrections administra- tors to ensure that an inmate's mental health information will be forwarded toa receiving institution whenever he or she is transferred: \u0093Establish a central, computerized tracking system, which alerts the men- tal health case manager at the receiving institution that an inmate withmental health needs will be arriving at the facility; or \u0093Send with the inmate a summary form that alerts the mental healthcase manager at the receiving institution. When mental health infor-mation is not maintained in a system-wide database, staff will need toinclude in this form a clinical summary of assessment results and abrief description of treatment and services received at the previous in-stitution; or \u0093In jurisdictions that do not have a central computerized tracking sys-tem, the mental health record should accompany the inmates at thetime of their transfer. Example: Wisconsin's Health Transfer Summary Wisconsin's Health Transfer Summary, a form and protocol used to ensure continuity of care when inmates are transferred from one correctional facility to another, pertainsto transfers between county jails, between state prisons, and between county jails andstate prisons. In particular, the summary provides necessary information to healthcare providers and custodial staff at correctional facilities to ensure their properk l148 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectcare\u2014such as current health and mental health status; medications in use; and treatments\u2014while maintaining the confidentiality of inmate health care informationin compliance with state law. At the time of a transfer, the Health Transfer Summaryis prepared by a facility health care professional and delivered along with the inmateby the transportation officer assigned to transport the inmate to the receiving facility.If the transfer is completed at a time when the health care professional is not avail-able, the form is prepared and dispatched with alternative means within 24 hours. Once received, a health care professional at the receiving facility logs in the summary, notifies the sending facility that it has been received, and makes follow-up assess-ments, investigations, and requests for information concerning the inmate's healthcare status or condition as required. The summary is maintained in the inmate'smedical files as a confidential record following guidelines set forth in Wisconsin law.According to the statute , inmate consent for the transfer of his or her health care information between correctional facilities is not required. The statute also authorizesthe sharing of the inmate's complete health record, but specifically excludes the men-tal health information from being included when that complete record is shared. Theexclusion can be waived only with the inmate's consent. Confidentiality regulations designed to protect the privacy and rights of those receiving treatment for mental illness and substance abuse are often mis-interpreted, and, in some cases, such regulations unnecessarily impede the flowof information needed to ensure the quality and continuity of care for offenderswho are transferred between facilities. Mechanisms can be used that enablecorrectional agencies to share important and relevant information while main-taining an appropriate level of confidentiality for the inmate. Information shar-ing should be understood here as sharing between clinical treating providers attwo different sites, and not as sharing with administrative or other correctionalstaff. Clinical files (whatever form they take) should be sealed and opened onlyby qualified personnel who have appropriate training in confidentiality issues.Inmates who receive services for their mental illness should be encouraged toprovide written consent in order for agencies to release treatment records toanother program. Even when a statute allows sharing without consent, it isstill a good idea to obtain it. (See Policy Statement 25: Sharing Information.) It is particularly important to facilitate the transfer of records from jails and other facilities that are not operated by the state correctional agency. Simi-larly, state corrections directors should also consider developing memoranda ofagreement between state agencies, such as the agency for mental health ser-vices, to ensure the transfer of patient records when an individual who is beingserved in a state institution is transferred to a correctional facility. Corrections administrators and their counsel often have a difficult task in determining how federal and state statutes regarding the confidentiality of in-mate mental health information applies to inmates. State statues\u2014or admin-istrative regulations\u2014should be established to clarify how the information ofthis distinct population can be used.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions149 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIn addition, states should consider establishing statutes or administrative regulations that require the transfer of inmate mental health records betweenfacilities under the purview of the state correctional agency. In Arizona, a stat-ute requires transfer of records either prior to or at the time of the transfer; italso authorizes the records to be transferred between county and state facilities. Example: Duty to Deliver Medical Records, Arizona State Law Arizona state law requires the transfer of a prisoner's \"medical record file, including the prisoner's mental health file or a standardized medical record.\" The file must betransferred prior to or at the same time as transfer of the prisoner. This requirementapplies to all transfers between jail and state department of correction facilities. Louisiana takes this process a step further, allowing the correctional agency to obtain information from other state agencies, as necessary, while ensuringreasonable confidentiality protection. Example: Access to Records, Louisiana State Law Louisiana state statute gives the department of corrections access to \"information and records under the control of any state or local agency which are reasonably relatedto the rehabilitation of the individual.\" Access to such information may be obtained\"during the course of any investigation which the department of corrections is autho-rized by law to conduct or any investigation necessary to the rehabilitation of personsin the custody of the department of corrections .\" The statute also requires that all information obtained under this provision \"be held as confidential and not be dis- closed directly or indirectly to anyone except\" when required by statute. These examples illustrate how a state essentially can define the depart- ment, and/or the state as a whole, as a unified system of care, thus enablingmental health information to be freely passed between facilities and depart-ments as though they were part of a provider enterprise, as occurs in commu-nity health systems. Confidentiality assurances can be established simplythrough policies and procedures that are consistent with statutes. In cases where statutes do not provide for transfers across agencies, one solution would be for the agencies to enter into memoranda of agreement thatinclude Qualified Services Agreements (QSA). QSA 's are agreements between providers that allow for the release of confidential information between theagencies, while transferring responsibility for adherence to federal and stateconfidentiality regulations. Require appropriate staff to review mental health information re- ceived with the transferred inmate and to respond accordingly. Departmental policies and procedures should define what specific infor- mation is required at intake, who is responsible for reviewing and following upon obtaining complete mental health records, and what immediate services areto be provided. Time frames for conducting clinical review and approval ofm150 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmedications should be specified throughout the intake process. Lastly, the pro- cedures should specify a protocol for interinstitutional communication whenproper documentation does not accompany the inmate at the time of intake. Example: Statewide Weekly Mental Health Staff Teleconference, Arizona Department of Corrections By administrative order, the facility health services administrators and other relevant mental health professionals at the Department of Corrections' (DOC) Alhambra Be- havioral Health Treatment Facility, and all other correctional complexes and facilitiesteleconference every week to discuss the mental health treatment needs and issues ofinmates being referred to or from the Alhambra complex and other Arizona DOCfacilities and provide a forum for peer consultation on difficult cases. Identify appropriate technology and protocols for the development of an electronic patient records system. Several jurisdictions have developed electronic data systems to improve records management and facilitate the instant flow of clinical records. To en-sure a successful records transfer, electronic communication should be used inconjunction with the personal transfer of information between clinicians at theinstitutions. Officials should be mindful that most confidentiality regulationsapply equally to paper and electronic records (HIPAA regulations specificallycover electronic records), and thus develop their electronic information proto-cols accordingly. Example: Mental Health Record and Referral/Evaluation Systems, Michigan Department of Corrections The Health Management Information System (HMIS) is a computer-based manage- ment system, which contains health care data for persons incarcerated in Michigancorrectional institutions. Two mental health-related components of HMIS are the mentalhealth record system and the referral/ev aluation system. Staff from DOC Psychologi- cal Services and DCH Corrections Mental Health Program use these components. TheMental Health Record system enables mental health care services providers to sys-tematically identify and track prisoners with mental illness at different levels andunits within the correctional system. The re ferral and evalua tion system ensures the identification and tracking of prisoner referr als for evalua tions as well as the evalua- tion outcomes. Example: Process of Transmitting Mental Health Treatment Histories of Inmates When Transferred to Other Facilities, New Jersey Department of Corrections The New Jersey Department of Corrections uses an electronic medical record system that allows any professional health care practitioner within the Department to view anyinmate's health record at any time. When an inmate is transferred from one facility toanother, mental health professionals send an e-mail stating that the inmate has beentransferred and the health record can be immediately accessed. Case conferencesoccur on the more difficult management cases.nHealth Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) Federal Health Insurance Port- ability and Accessibility Act(HIPAA) regulations were promul-gated in final form in March 2002and are likely to have an impacton the way mental health infor-mation will be handled in the fu-ture. Not only are these regula-tions extremely complex, but legalexperts disagree on their ramifi-cations for prison and jail popu-lations. Correctional administra-tors and correctional healthofficials should work with theirlegal counsel to familiarize them-selves with these regulations andto consider their implications fortheir facilities.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Sta tement 18: Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions151 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Interagency Case Conferencing, New Jersey Department of Corrections When the New Jersey Department of Corrections participates in interagency transfers (e.g., between correctional and mental health agencies), it often organizes case con-ferences, in conjunction with the electronic transfer of data between the agencies, toenable clinicians from both sending and receiving institutions to meet to discuss anddevelop individual treatment plans. State mental health agencies recognize the benefits to be gained from the development of an integrated and automated patient records systems that isoperated system wide. The establishment of such a system is expensive, how-ever, and the work on such systems in most states is far from complete. Indeed,implementation of electronic patient record systems is inconsistent across localagencies, making it impossible for state mental health authorities to gathercomplete information or to realize the gains that could be reaped from a state-wide system. Additionally, seemingly simple problems such as the incorrectspelling of a patient 's name or an inaccurate social security number can create significant headaches for staff. In some states, efforts are under way to includestate correctional agencies in the development of electronic patient/inmate recordsystems.152 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONSubsequent Referral for Screening and Mental Health Evaluations POLICY STATEMENT #19 Identify individuals who\u2014despite not raising any flags during the screening and assessment process\u2014show symptoms of mental ill-ness after their intake into the facility, and ensure that appropriateaction is taken. Even when staff adhere to the most effective screening and assessment protocols, they may yetoverlook a small proportion of inmates with mentalillness that enter the facility. Some inmates, con- cerned about the stigma associated with mental ill- ness, may conceal symptoms of their disease. Inaddition, inmates may not present symptoms ofmental illness until they have been incarcerated forsome time. In other cases, an inmate's mental sta- tus can change dramatically during the course of incarceration. The prison experience itself, and theinevitable exposure to intimidation, isolation, sepa-ration from family, violence, and sometimes victim-ization can precipitate serious depression or suicidalthoughts.19 Furthermore, some inmates' symptoms may reappear as a result of change in medication, dis-continuation of a prescription, or noncompliancewith the treatment plan. In jails, offenders who are admitted directly from the streets are often under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs. Oncethey are detoxified, mental illness symptoms canappear\u2014sometimes several days later. While it would be valuable to conduct periodic mental health screenings on all general population inmates, this is costly and rarely done in most cor-rectional facilities. Nevertheless, there are severalmeasures correctional administrators and mentalhealth staff can implement, at relatively little cost,to identify these cases that may initially fall through the cracks. Reassesses periodically the mental health status of inmates who are at the highest risk of showing signs of mental illness. Correctional mental health staff should incorporate regular, informal mental health screening into existing practices without burdening the service deliverysystem. Corrections administrators should also consider establishing a systemChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 19: Subsequent Referral for Screening and Mental Health Evaluations153 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectto code the mental health status (and risk of exhibiting signs of mental illness) of all inmates. Example: Virginia Department of Corrections Since 1992, all inmates in the Virginia correctional system are periodically assessed and a deter mination is made as to their mental health status and mental health needs. The determination is alphanumerically coded and sorted by the least to the greatestneed for mental health services. The code is reviewed and, if necessary, updatedannually. The code is used for progr ammatic and institutional assignments, as well as for release planning and community supervision. Reassessing the mental health status of inmates enables corrections offi- cials to maintain accurate, current data regarding the demand for services within the prison system, and it facilitates a projection of the need for community-based mental health services for inmates approaching their release date. Conduct brief mental health assessments upon request of an in- mate or by referral from any staff person. Prisons and jails should have effective mechanisms to permit and encour- age inmates and detainees to self-refer for a confidential mental health assess-ment. Self-referral forms provided to inmates should be culturally sensitiveand, given the generally low reading level of inmate populations, easily under-standable. Institutional health staff might also consider instituting clinicalrounds at intake facilities. Example: Referral for Mental Health Services, Albany County (NY) Correctional Facility The Albany County Correctional Facility utilizes a mechanism whereby facility staff, correctional officers, medical staff, inmate service unit staff, and the inmates them-selves are able to put in requests for mental health contact. All written requests arefollowed up, and any inmate referred is seen face to face by a mental health staffmember. Minimize the stigma that staff and inmates may harbor regarding mental illness. Over the previous two decades, many corrections systems have success- fully educated staff about HIV and AIDS, about how the virus is transmittedand how it is treated. Correctional systems should undertake a similar publichealth education initiative regarding mental illness. (See Policy Statement 30:Training for Corrections Personnel; also Policy Statement 32: Educating theCommunity and Building Community Awareness and Policy Statement 43:Advocacy, for more on stigma.)b c154 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRelease Decision POLICY STATEMENT #20 Ensure that clinical expertise and familiarity with community-based mental health resources inform release decisions and determinationof conditions of release. Inmates typically are released from prison through one of the three following ways: \u0093statutorily mandated release to supervision; \u0093discretionary parole; or \u0093mandatory release at the completion of a sentence without supervision. Over the past two decades, numerous state leg- islatures have limited the discretion available toparole boards, or have eliminated discretionary pa-role altogether (see sidebar on following page). 20 A collateral consequence of limiting this discretion hasbeen to reduce the opportunity to tailor release con-ditions for inmates who have a mental illness. Inthose states where parole boards still have somediscretion, parole decision makers may be reluctantto exercise it when the potentially eligible inmatehas a mental illness. Parole board members' lack ofconfidence in community-based mental health ser-vices also contributes to their reluctance to releasefrom prison a person with mental illness. In theface of incomplete information, inadequate assess-ments, lack of confidence in community resourcesfor this population, misconceptions about mental ill-20 ness, or fear of a negative public response, paroleboard members may choose not to release the in-mate, thereby compelling him or her to serve themaximum sentence allowed by law. A study conducted in Pennsylvania illustrates this phenomenon. In 2000, 16 percent of allreleasees in Pennsylvania served their maximumsentence. For inmates with mental illness, however,27 percent served their maximum sentence; of thosediagnosed as having a serious mental illness, 50percent served their maximum sentence. Often,inmates with mental illness served their maximumsentence because they did not have an approvedparole housing plan, which was due to the lack ofhousing, mental health, and substance abuse ser-vices available in the community, especially in ru-ral areas. 21 Determining the level of risk that an offender poses to the community is one of the central respon-sibilities of parole board members in making theirdecision as to whether to release an offender andthe types of conditions of release that should be im-posed. Even in states that do not have a discretion-ary parole system, corrections departments often use 21.

These correctionsdepartments and releasing authorities, however,rarely take into account factors involving theperson's mental illness. The recommendations that follow describe how to address these obstacles that impede effective re-lease decision making: 1) the lack of professional,clinical expertise as part of the prerelease consider- ation process; 2) the lack of sufficient, reliable in-formation regarding the treatment history andneeds of the offender; and 3) the lack of sufficientcommunity-based resources and options for thispopulation. Develop guidelines regarding release decisions that address is- sues unique to inmates with mental illness, and consult with men-tal health professionals during the decision-making process. State statutes and administrative orders, usually in the form of structured parole release guidelines, generally frame the parole board members' decision-making process. Such guidelines typically address the general offender popu-lation only, however, without recognizing the special needs of offenders withmental illness. For example, a person whose mental illness is particularly seri-ous may have been unable to participate in job-training classes or other inmateprogramming opportunities that would improve the likelihood of the inmate'stimely release. Existing guidelines, however, typically emphasize participationin such programs as nearly essential for release. Many states are beginning to employ validated risk assessment instru- ments that can help guide their estimation of the potential risk offenders poseto the community upon release. As with structured parole release guidelines,however, employing risk assessment instruments designed for the general of-fender population may not adequately take into account the circumstances ofoffenders with mental illness. In fact, no known risk assessment instrumenthas been validated by research to predict accurately the nexus between mentalillness and risk. 22 Until corrections systems develop or replicate such an instrument, they should rely on mental health experts to evaluate the instruments they are cur-rently using to ensure that they take into account mental health issues appro-priately. In addition, releasing authorities should engage appropriate mentalhealth professionals to assess on a case-by-case basis offenders' mental healthand potential risk. At least four states (Washington, Florida, Kansas, and Ne-braska) require, by statute, evaluation of the mental health status of all in- 22. Polly Phipps and Gregg Gagliardi, Implementation of Washington's Dangerous Mentally Ill Offenders Law: Pre- liminary Findings , Olympia, WA: Washington Institute for Public Policy, March 2002, Appendix G.156 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmates prior to release to the community. Three of these states further require the development of individualized treatment plans and the identification of pro-grams and resources in the community to carry out such plans. Releasing authorities should enlist the support of a mental health profes- sional to assist in conducting the hearing, reviewing the inmate's medical his-tory within the institution, assessing the specific challenges he or she will facewhen returning to the community, and identifying community resources to helpaddress the offender's needs. Example: Pre-Release Risk Assessment, the National Parole Board of Canada The National Parole Board of Canada incorporates psychological and psychiatric as- sessments into its risk assessment procedure, when appropriate, for all offendersbeing considered for parole. Certain categories of offenders receive mandatoryprerelease psychological assessments, including those who have exhibited persistentor gratuitous violence or those serving indeterminate of life sentences. Offenders who have undergone treatment while incarcerated are required to have a post-treatmentreport completed by a psychologist, case manager, or program officer to address anychanges of risk. A supplemental prerelease assessment is required only if the post-treatment report is considered insufficient to address the offender's progress. Psychi-atric assessments are required for any offender with a life or indeterminate sentenceseeking parole. Other issues that the parole board considers include the effects ofany current medications prescribed, the risk if the medication is no longer used, andthe programs and interventions in the community that will help the offender have asuccessful reintegration. Example: Contract for Risk Assessment Services, Missouri Parole Board The Missouri Parole Board contracts for independent mental health assessment ser- vices to assist in identifying risk associated with the release of persons with mentalillness. The contract includes provision for the board to consult in person with psy-chiatrists when seeking information on particular cases, should they desire to do so. Develop protocols to share information and resources among pa- role agencies, departments of corrections, and mental health orga-nizations. The value of risk assessments for inmates with mental illness depends on the quality of information regarding an offender's mental illness and the assis-tance of a clinician to evaluate and interpret that information for a releasingauthority. Nevertheless, releasing authorities (especially parole boards) reportconsiderable difficulty in gaining access to this information or mental healthexpertise.Terms of Release Prior to the late 1970s, most pris- oners were offered conditional(i.e., supervised) release throughthe decisions of parole boardsthat assessed individual risk andtook into account behavior inprison. During the 1980s and1990s, parole fell out of favor andat least 40 states passed \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws intended tolessen the disparity between thesentence imposed and the timeactually served. In 1990, 39 per-cent of inmates were released viaparole board decisions; by 1998that fraction had dropped to 26percent. Inmates are increasinglylikely to leave prison after man-datory release, which is deter-mined by statute or sentencingguidelines, not panel or boarddecisions. From 1990 to 1998 therate of mandatory releases rosefrom 29 percent to 40 percent ofprisoners. In addition, the rateof unconditional release (i.e.,requiring no supervision) rosefrom 16 percent to 24 percent ofprisoners during the same period.Though parole has decreased inpopularity, in most states the pa-role reforms have not been retro-active, so many prisoners con-tinue to be eligible. Many statesalso continue to perform somekind of supervision of prisonreleasees. The term \"communitycorrections\" refers to the multiplesupervision strategies employedby different states including, butnot limited to, parole. 23 23. Travis et al., From Prison to Home , p.14.bChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 20: Release Decision157 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectParole officials typically rely on correctional health officials for informa- tion regarding an offender's mental health. Such information, however, is oftendated and incomplete. Mental health information from community-based treat-ment agencies and providers would provide releasing authorities with a greaterunderstanding of the inmate's mental health history. To that end, releasingauthorities should enter into agreements with mental health organizations toensure the confidential and appropriate sharing of information regarding aperson's mental illness. Several state parole boards have addressed these issues by collaborating with their counterparts in the state mental health agencies. Example: Memorandum of Understanding Between the New York State Office of Mental Health and New York State Division of Parole In 1994, the New York State Office of Mental Health and the New York State Division of Parole signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to identify and better servepeople with mental illness. The MOU enhanced coordination of mental health evalu-ations for the board of parole; increased discharge planning for inmates with seriousmental illness; implemented mental health training for parole officers; and estab-lished a Dedicated Parole Caseload initiative. Example: Multidisciplinary Team, Missouri Parole Board The Missouri Parole Board employs a specially trained staff person who sits on a team with institutional staff to develop a continued-care plan for inmates with mentalillness. The continued-care plan is holistic, addressing all areas of the offenders' lifeconnected to his/her success in the community. The program consists of both aninstitutional and a community release center phase. The institutional phase lasts forfour months and selected inmates spend two months in the community phase for acombined minimum of six months. The program is used by the parole board as a pre-release planning mechanism, as well as an alternative to revocation for those who areparole violators. Example: Forensic Mental Health Coordinating Council (UT) In 2002, the Utah legislature expanded the membership and scope of the Mental Health and Corrections Advisory Council and renamed it the Forensic Mental HealthCoordinating Council. The Forensic Mental Health Coordinating Council includes rep-resentatives from the Department of Human Services Division of Mental Health, theState Hospital, the Board of Pardons and Parole , the Attorney General's Office, Depart- ment of Corrections (DOC), Services fo r People with Disabilities, community mental health agencies, Division of Youth Corrections, and the state court administrator'soffice. The council was formed to develop policies for coordination between theDivision of Mental Health and the Department of Corrections, advise the DOC on carefor inmates with mental illness, promote interagency communication around issues ofmental illness and mental retardation, address civil commitment issues, and overseecoordination of services and placement options for particular individuals.158 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Texas Council on Offenders with Mental Impairments (TCOMI), Post-Release Aftercare The TCOMI's Continuity of Care (COC) program provides a pre- and postrelease after- care system for all offenders with special needs released from TDCJ jails and prisons.By identifying offenders prerelease who will need aftercare treatment, the chances fora more successful reintegration into the community are improved. When these offend-ers are identified prior to release, conditions may be imposed by the parole board or the courts that require mandatory participation in mental health treatment or othersimilar rehabilitative programs. TCOMI has set up a regionalized continuity of caresystem. Now, instead of a worker having to make repeated trips across the state, his/her counterpart in that area conducts the prerelease activities. This strategy is beingimplemented on a statewide basis. The majority of offenders released from TDCJfacilities are returned to communities where TCOMI and, in some cases, parole jointlyoperate community-based treatment programs. As a result, offender s are immediately enrolled in treatment services that are targeted exclusively for them, thus eliminatingservice delays. This approach, which was centrally developed but regionally imple-mented in association with community-based service providers, exemplifies what canbe accomplished when interagency partnerships and cooperation are established atboth the state and local levels. Establish special conditions of release that are realistic, relevant, and research-based to address the risks and needs of paroleeswith mental illness. Conditions of parole are the centerpiece of the release plan for a person reentering the community from prison under supervised release. It is essen-tial, especially when the parolee has a mental illness, that these conditions ofrelease be tailored to the risks and needs that the individual presents. A pa-rolee should not be set up for failure; the conditions of release must be realisticand enforceable. If the parolee has a mental illness, board members must con-firm that the services can be made available before imposing conditions of re-lease that require participation in certain community-based programs or treat-ment, and that the parolee can meet those conditions. While release conditions will vary depending on the risks/needs of the in- dividual parolee, outpatient and inpatient treatment, and methods to assurethat any necessary medications are taken should be requirements of any re-lease plan for parolees with mental illness. Example: Medically Recommended Intensive Supervision Program, Texas Parole Board The Texas Parole Board works in conjunction with the Texas Council on Offenders with Mental Impairments (TCOMI) to identify offenders who are eligible for the MedicallyRecommended Intensive Supervision Program. A special mental health panel, com-prised of three members, considers special release conditions for these offenders.The conditions are imposed when the board determines that a mental impairmentcontributed to the commission of the instant offense(s) or may adversely affect aparolee's potential for success after release. The components of the conditions callcChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 20: Release Decision \"Offenders with mental illness will likely fail at-tempts at community su-pervision unless the condi-tions of probation orparole placed on them arerealistic, research-sup-ported and relevant con-sidering their specificneeds and capacities.\" CARL WICKLUND Executive Director, American Probation andParole Association Source: Personal Correspondence, May 29, 2002159 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectfor the parolee to participate in psychological or psychiatric evaluation, participate in mental health treatment, and use medication as proscribed by the attending physicianor psychiatrist. In some jurisdictions, parole boards have the discretion to refer offenders with mental illness for assessment, treatment and hospitalization. State law inUtah authorizes the Utah Parole Board to place parolees with mental illness instate hospitals for treatment as a condition of release if deemed medically neces-sary. Access to income through a job or benefit program and to housing are other key factors that should be reflected in the conditions of release. (See PolicyStatement 36: Integration of Services and Policy Statement 38: Housing, forfurther discussion of employment and housing programs for people with men-tal illness.) Ensure that the releasing authority can identify and obtain access to community-based programs and resources adequate to supportthe treatment and successful community reintegration of paroleeswith mental illness and that such programs and resources areavailable in the communities to which parolees return. Lack of resources in the community is a major obstacle in addressing the special needs of this group of offenders. When asked, \"What community re-source is most lacking in regard to placing parolees back into the community?\"state parole directors polled in the year 2000 identified the inadequacy of ser-vices for people with mental illness. The two resources they identified mostfrequently\u2014 housing and licensed substance abuse treatment\u2014are key to suc-cessful community reintegration for parolees with mental illness. 24 For instance, paroling authorities are put in a difficult position when prerelease program staff at the prison recommend specific conditions of releasethat are difficult to implement or enforce, given limited resources available. Inthese situations, the releasing authority may be understandably reluctant toapprove the inmate's release. In some cases, the inmate's release is delayeddue to the lack of an appropriate placement plan until they have completedtheir sentence, causing them to return to the community without any struc-tured plan or supervision. Such delays serve neither the offender's treatmentneeds nor the interests of justice. Before placing an individual in the community, parole board members need to be assured that the services required for the successful reintegration of theoffender with mental illness are available in the communities to which theyreturn. Most jurisdictions engage staff or consultants to the parole board tod 24. Information gathered from an informal survey of state parole directors taken at the winter 2000 meeting of the Association of Paroling Authorities International, asreported by Gail Hughes, director, private correspondence, 2001.160 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectinvestigate and report to the board the existence and adequacy of local services. Boards need this assistance to help them know and understand the degree ofmental illness, needed elements of a release plan to the community, and alter-natives to revocation. Example: Forensic Community Re-entry and Reha bilitation f or Female Prison Inmates with Mental Illness, Mental Retardation, and Co-occurring Disorders, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Due to the lack of sufficient community-based mental health services and adequate housing, inmates with mental illness in Pennsylvania state prisons are significantlymore likely than other inmates to serve their maximum sentence. In response to thisproblem, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC) developed the ForensicCommunity R e-entry and Rehabilitation program, which is a collaborative effort be- tween the DOC, the, Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (PBPP), and thePennsylvania Community Providers Association (PCPA). The program will employ acommunity placement specialist to develop, in conjunction with the parole board and community-based providers, comprehensive transition plans and conduct follow up for program participants. When necessary, the program will provide transitional hous-ing for up to 60 days. Once the offender is paroled, the placement specialist willconduct follow up interviews with community-based providers to monitor the offender'sprogress. The program will be launched in May 2002. Train parole board members to increase their knowledge of the risks/needs of persons with mental illness and factors that miti-gate that risk so release decisions and special conditions can bedetermined appropriately. Parole board members should have some familiarity with the nature and types of mental illness, and how these disorders can be diagnosed and treated.Training curricula should be developed and, depending on the jurisdiction, tai-lored for individuals appointed to serve as parole board members, both for newappointees as well as on an annual or on-going basis for all members. (SeePolicy Statement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel, for discussion andexamples of training for parole boards and parole officers.)eChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 20: Release Decision161 Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project162 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectDevelopment of Transition Plan POLICY STATEMENT #21 Facilitate collaboration among corrections, community corrections, and mental health officials to effect the safe and seamless transitionof people with mental illness from prison to the community. This policy statement addresses transition plan- ning for sentenced inmates with mental illness whoare released from state prisons and county jails.These releasees include inmates with mental illness who will remain under some form of supervision by the criminal justice system and inmates with men-tal illness who complete their sentence while inprison or jail. (See Policy Statement 13: Intake atCounty / Municipal Detention Facility, for a discus- sion of transition planning issues unique to jail de- tainees.) Comprehensive transition planning is of para- mount importance\u2014especially when the inmate willfinish his or her sentence in prison and not be sub-ject to conditions of release. For inmates with men- tal illness, whose community adjustment issues are even more complex than inmates in the generalpopulation, the need for systemic discharge plan-ning is particularly crucial. For example, individu-als with mental illness leaving prison without suffi-cient supplies of medication, connections to mental health and other support services, and housing are almost certain to decompensate, which in turn willlikely result in behavior that constitutes a technicalviolation of release conditions or a new crime.21 Engaging the personnel and resources of insti- tutional corrections, community corrections, andcommunity mental health providers in developingand implementing comprehensive transition plans for offenders with mental illness can maximize the likelihood of a safe and successful transition to thecommunity. Release planning, in principle, canbegin upon intake. In practice, jurisdictions initiateand engage in prerelease planning at different times prior to the release date (e.g., one year, six months), and prerelease planning intensifies as the inmateapproaches the release date. The nature and function of discharge planning for inmates vary significantly depending uponwhether the individual is being released from a de- tention facility, a county penitentiary (following completion of a jail sentence at a county correctionalinstitution), or a state prison. 25 The extent of postrelease criminal justice supervision prescribedfor the inmate will determine the extent to which aplan can or will be developed collaboratively among criminal justice and mental health agency staff, as well as the possibility of treating the discharge plan as a condition of continued release. 25. In the case of the detainee, there is rarely any warning of the timing of his or her release, resulting in little or no criminal justice supervision following release. Oftentimes, the best that can be done is for the discharge planner to provide the de-tainee with referrals for use post-release. In such cases, the provision of ongoingcase management is unlikely. Issues related to release planning for pretrial defen- dants and defendants sentenced to time served are discussed in Policy Statement 13: Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 21: Development of Transition Plan163 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION Identify transition planners in each institution and charge them with coordinating a case management process, which incorporatesrepresentatives of institutional corrections, community correc-tions, social service agencies, and community-based mental healthproviders. The position charged with transition planning varies among corrections systems. In some jurisdictions, correctional staff provide both transition plan-ning and case management services. The most common arrangement is forprison staff to assume the lead role in transition planning, with some assis-tance from community corrections staff; once the inmate is released, commu-nity corrections staff assume the case management responsibilities. Regard-less of the specifics of the arrangement, collaboration between the variousagencies and service providers who will be involved in the release, supervision,treatment, and support of the releasee is essential to a successful transitionplanning process. Example: Forensic Transition Team, Massachusetts Department of Mental Health The Forensic Transition Team program was established in 1998 to provide transitional release planning services for offenders about to be released from correctional custody.The Forensic Transition Team conducts client interviews of inmates identified bymental health staff and coordinates appropriate community mental health resources.Team members work with offenders at least three months prior to their release, pro-viding them with case coordination and consultation to community providers for up tothree months after release to address any obstacles to client community adjustment.Arrangement of programs, treatments, and social support services is done in coordi-nation with criminal justice officials to address public safety concerns. The teamcollaborates both with institutional corrections authorities and with probation andparole officials to coordinate the linkages for offenders with mental illness to receivecommunity-based services upon release. The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health maintains a statewide database to track the progress of offenders served by the program, as well as to inform further program development and research efforts. 26 One particularly promising, albeit uncommon, strategy is to have the tran- sition planner working with the inmate during the last months of his or herincarceration continue as a case manager (coordinating the delivery of servicesand facilitating the person's compliance with conditions of release) after theoffender's release to the community. As part of such a strategy, community-based agency staff, who will eventually provide postrelease case management,can be brought into the institution to work with institutional-based dischargeplanners in devising and carrying out a comprehensive case management plan. 26. Stephanie W. Hartwell, Donna Haig Friedman, Karin Orr, \"From Correctional Custody to Community: The Mas- sachusetts Forensic Transition Program,\" New England Journal Public Policy , Spring/Summer, 2001, pp. 73-81.164 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Women's Discovery and Safe Release Programs, Rhode Island Department of Corrections The Women's Discovery Program is a voluntary substance abuse treatment program offered to all women incarcerated in Rhode Island state prisons. All inmates whospend at least 30 days in the Discovery Program are eligible for an additional compo-nent called Safe Release. The Safe Release Program provides mental health treatmentservices and specialized mental health discharge planning services to inmates withmental illness. Case managers from a local community-based mental health provider,the Providence Center, work with corrections staff to oversee the discharge planningfor these inmates as well as providing post-discharge case management services forup to one year, thus ensuring continuity of care. Regardless for whom the transition planner works, it is essential that he or she be required to coordinate a team of people who, collectively, represent the agencies and organizations whose support and assistance are essential to the successful implementation of the transition plan.27 These agencies usually include, at a minimum, corrections, parole (or releasing authority), mental health agencies, housing, employment, health and welfare agencies and private pro- viders of treatment and support services all have a part in the individual's life. The collective participation of representatives of the community in the de- velopment of treatment plan\u2014and their subsequent investment in its success\u2014 serves many purposes. First, it encourages coordination between local outpa-tient services and correctional facilities. Second, it promotes the mutualaccountability of correctional administrators and mental health treatment offi- cials for the treatment of offenders with mental illness. Third, it facilitates the sharing of important information regarding the treatment history of the indi-vidual and his or her progress following release. Missouri employs multidisciplinary teams to assess clients, plan interven- tions, and carry out services for parolees both in the institution and in the com- munity. Example: Multi-disciplinary Team, Missouri Parole Board The Missouri Parole Board has a staff person who sits on a team with institutional staff to develop a continued care plan for persons with mental illness. The continued- care plan is holistic in nature, addressing all areas of persons with mental illnessoffenders' life connected to his/her success in the community. Once planned, themultidisciplinary team oversees the parolee's progress and the delivery of services.The program consists of both an institutional and a community release center phase.The institutional phase lasts for four months and selected inmates spend two monthsin the community phase for a combined minimum of six months. The program isused by the parole board as a prerelease requirement as well as an alternative torevocation for those who are parole violators. 27. Individuals who are able to coordinate cross-systems activities such as transition planning are often referred to as boundary spanners. Boundary spanners must be able tounderstand and work within the different cultures, policies, and procedures of multiple areas (e.g., corrections, parole, and community mental health) and successfully bridge thegaps between different services systems that individualswith mental illness often fall through. For more on bound- ary spanners see Henry J. Steadman, \"Boundary Spanners: A Key Component for the Effective Interactions of the Jus-tice and Mental Health Systems,\" Law and Human Behav- ior 16:1, 1992, pp. 75-86.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Statement Development of Transition Plan165 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSuccessfully coordinating each of these teams and developing a transition plan that addresses the complex needs of people with criminal records who have a mental illness requires careful work and is extremely time consuming. Accordingly, the ratio of individuals conducting discharge planning and casemanagement services to releasees should be low, ideally with caseloads no higher than 20 releasees per supervision officer. Involve all relevant agents and individuals who will assist in carry- ing out the transition plan, including family members, in its devel-opment. If possible, all parties, including the inmate, should participate in a dis- charge planning meeting just prior to the inmate being released. This provides all parties with the opportunity to understand one another's roles and respon- sibilities set forth in the treatment and community integration plan, as well asto establish a working relationship to carry out the conditions of the arrange- ment. Ideally, family members should be part of this process. The offender or family may decline, however, especially if family members do not feel they are prepared to support the inmate upon his or her release. Take steps to ensure that the inmate's release from secure hous- ing to the community progresses in a gradual sequence of plannedsteps. Corrections systems have developed different approaches to ensure that an inmate's release into the community is gradual. In many state departmentsof correction, inmates nearing their statutorily mandated release date or those who have been granted a parole are assigned to prerelease programs. Some of these programs involve assignment to a prerelease housing unit either within aminimum-security unit or in a community-based setting (such as a halfway house). Correctional discharge planners assigned to these programs help makecommunity contacts and referrals for housing, employment, and services. Develop a transition plan that includes the inmate's assignment to a community-based provider whose resources and assets are con-sistent with the needs and strengths of the inmate. Transition planners' responsibilities include assessing offenders' needs and strengths and facilitating linkages to appropriate community-based services. Given the special needs of this population, transition planners need to be awareof what services are available in the jurisdictions they serve and which commu- nity-based mental health and habilitation services are necessary for the careand treatment of people with mental illness.b c d166 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectWhile institutional release planning staff reach out to identify resources in the community, it is equally important to establish a working relationship be-tween the offender and a community mental health provider prior to his or herrelease to ensure continuity of care. As discussed above, encouraging and fa-cilitating providers' access (\"in reach\") to the facility will foster community link-ages and increase the likelihood that the offender will be engaged and servedeffectively upon his/her release from the institution. Example: Dangerous Mentally Ill Offender Program (WA) In 1999 officials in Washington State enacted legislation regarding \"dangerous men- tally ill offenders\" released from Department of Corrections (DOC) facilities. Thestatute directed the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and DOC towork together to expedite financial and medical eligibility for the offender and estab-lish interagency teams for pre-release planning. The interagency planning teamsinclude DOC Risk Management Specialists, a community corrections officer, a repre-sentative of the relevant Regional Support Network (RSN), representatives of commu-nity-based mental health and substance abuse providers, family members, and law enforcement. The interagency team begins to develop comprehensive release plans atleast three months prior to release, including detailed plans for the 48 hours postrelease,service plans (housing, treatment, etc.), victim services, financial resources, andcommunity corrections information. Case managers, community-based mental health and chemical dependency providers, and community corrections officers visit theoffender where he or she is incarcerated, facilitating the development of relationshipsprior to release. The case management plan should include dates, times, and locations for follow-up appointments with community supervision agencies and for appoint- ments with treatment providers. Mental health case managers also can thenbe on hand to ensure that the releasee is engaged in the planned treatment and service programs and to monitor the initial delivery services. Since such a large proportion of offenders with mental illness also have histories of substance abuse, it is likely that the community transition and case management plan will also include provision for substance abuse treatment (see Policy Statement 17: Receiving and Intake of Sentenced Inmates, for moreon co-occurring disorder statistics in prisons; also Co-Occurring Disorders). Substance abuse treatment services may be provided at one site as part of a comprehensive program for dually diagnosed offenders. If substance abuse treat-ment is to be provided off site and/or by a separate agency, or if the releasee is to participate in 12-step or other community-based fellowship programs, the com- munity-based case manager should also make arrangements for the offender toreceive escort to initial meetings and appointments and ensure that engage- ment has occurred. Twelve-step fellowship programs, such as Alcoholics Anony- mous and Narcotics Anonymous, provide escort services as part of their regionalWorld Fellowship Networks. These organizations list local groups and fellow- ship networks in the white pages of regional phone books. At a minimum, discharge planners can facilitate case conferences that in- clude participating treatment and social service providers as well as the of-Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 21: Development of Transition Plan \"When I discovered that mentally ill inmates weredropped off in the middleof the night with two sub-way tokens and a few daysworth of medication, Ithought it was a joke. Af-ter all, what kind of sys-tem could be that apa-thetic to the needs of thementally ill and societyalike?\" KIM WEBDALE Victim Advocate, NY Source: U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary, The Impact of the Mentally Ill on the Criminal Justice System , September 21 2001167 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectfender. When face-to-face case conference is not feasible (for instance, due to prohibitive distances between the institution and the home community), it may be conducted as a teleconference. A number of jurisdictions recognize the im-portance of case conferencing, and have taken steps to make sure that it occurs. Integrate housing support services into the transition plan and provide releasees with mental illness an arrangement for safehousing or at a minimum, shelter. Adequate housing is the linchpin of successful reentry for offenders with mental illness. Housing, especially when it is combined with support services,provides a stable base from which individuals can access treatment in the cru-cial days immediately succeeding release. Every person with mental illnessleaving jail or prison should have in place an arrangement for safe housing (or,at the least, shelter). Unfortunately, locating suitable housing for their clients is one of the great- est challenges for discharge planners and community-based case managers (seePolicy Statement 38: Housing). They will need to know what type of housingarrangements are available in the communities they serve; how to make theappropriate connections between the offender and the landlord; and what pro-visions there are for indigents unable to pay the rent. Perhaps even more im-portant, the discharge planners and community case managers must know howto overcome explicit or implicit prejudices and exclusions based on either men-tal illness or criminal history. For example, individuals convicted of certainviolent, drug-related, or sex-related offenses are not eligible for federal housingsubsidies. 28 Transition planners are likely to encounter considerable resistance from private-sector individuals and agencies, and, to be effective, will have toassume the role of housing and social services advocate for the releasee. Atleast one jurisdiction is developing a program to address this crucial issue. Example: Parole Support and Treatment Program (PSTP), Project Renewal, New York City (NY) Project Renewal is a New York City based nonprofit that provides an array of services for individuals who are homeless and have mental illness and substance abuse prob-lems. The Parole Support and Treatment Program is a joint effort between ProjectRenewal, the New York State Office of Mental Health, and the New York State Divisionof Parole. The PSTP will provide 50 new units of transitional, supportive housing andintensive clinical services to newly released parolees who suffer from serious andpersistent mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorders. The programwill combine an \"ACT-like\" treatment team and 50 scattered-site supported transi- 28. Any offender who is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a state sex-offender program is ineli- gible for public, Section 8, and other federally assistedhousing. Similarly, anyone who has engaged in drug-re- lated, violent, or other criminal activity that would \"ad- versely affect the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoy-ment of the premises\" may be denied federal housingassistance. The decision to deny this assistance is based on how recent the conviction for these crimes. See Legal Action Center, \"Housing Laws Affecting Individuals with Criminal Convictions,\" available at: www.enterprisefoundation.org/model%20documents/ 1150.pdfe168 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecttional housing beds. During their time in transitional housing parolees will work with the clinical team to transition into permanent housing, ranging from community resi-dences to Section 8 apartments. All individuals with serious mental illness leaving jail or prison should be physically transported to their housing arrangement or shelter and providedwith a short-term supply of medication and a prescription (or provision) forlong-term supply. In such cases, the mental health agency assigned to providethe offender with community services is the appropriate agency to provide trans-port from the jail or prison to the place where the offender will reside. Make arrangements for at least a week's supply of important medications, along with refillable prescriptions, to be provided toinmates at the point of release. Offenders should have an adequate supply of essential psychotropic medi- cations upon their release. They should be given at least a seven-day supplyand prescriptions sufficient for the period up to when entitlements may reason-ably be expected to be reinstated, typically within 90 days after release to thecommunity. States that contract with private correctional health care provid-ers for the provision of institutional health care should include in their con-tracts a requirement that these extra medications are provided to dischargedinmates. Also, if it has not already been done by agents of the detention orcorrections authority, the community-based agency or case manager respon-sible for the released offender should take steps to reinstate the individual onMedicaid in order to pay for necessary medications. Develop a process to ensure that inmates eligible for public ben- efits receive them immediately upon their release. Community-based mental health providers are reluctant to provide ser- vices to people with criminal records for numerous reasons. Near or at the topof this list of reasons is this population's inability to pay for treatment. Stateand county government officials attempting to control the explosive growth ofhealth care expenditures routinely warn providers about delivering services toindividuals who ultimately do not qualify for federal benefits; providers will notreceive back-payments for the delivery of these services. Given the crushingdemand that they are attempting to accommodate, providers are understand-ably hesitant to deliver services to a person who does not have health insuranceand whose eligibility for public benefits is not immediately apparent. Corrections administrators and health officials can take several steps to facilitate inmates' participation in federal benefit programs (see Appendix C:Explanation of Federal Benefit Programs). First, state officials should requiregfChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 21: Development of Transition Plan \"If you have a schizo- phrenic walking thestreets, do you think thatperson can hold them-selves together until theirbenefits are reinstated?\" DAVE BRENNA Salt Lake Mental Health UT Source: Amy Joi Bryson, \"Jails of the mind: End incarceration brings end of meds\u2014and newproblems,\" Desert News , Sunday, May 19, 2002,169 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectcorrections staff to distribute to inmates information and application forms for all relevant federal and state benefit programs, including Medicaid; federal SSIand SSDI benefits; Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); foodstamps; veterans programs; and state general assistance. Staff should provideadditional assistance, and in general pay particular attention, to subsets of theinmate population with mental illness who are especially likely to qualify forbenefit programs, including those who meet the following criteria: 1) receivedfederal benefits at the time of incarceration; 2) have very low incomes, particu-larly those under age 21; 3) are veterans; or 3) are parents of children under 18and likely to be custodial parents upon release. Example: Partners Aftercare Network (SPAN), San Bernadino (CA) This initiative established a multi-ag ency team whose purpose is to link inmates with serious mental illness to needed mental health services upon their release from jail.The aftercare management team serves as a \"bridge\" between custody and commu-nity integration by providing, among other things, financial advocacy to assist clientsin obtaining Social Security and medical and other benefits. Second, appropriate authorities should establish a process through which the state Medicaid agency will accept applications from inmates while they arestill in custody and will process these applications in a timely manner to ensurethat those found potentially eligible are then able obtain access to the benefitsimmediately upon release. Corrections administrators must appreciate the dif-ficulty in timing a person's participation in benefit programs. Accordingly, cor-rections officials should inform local social security offices and the state Medic-aid agency as early as possible of the exact date of release of inmates who qualify,or may qualify, for benefits. Example: Medicaid Reenrollment for Inmates at Hamden County Correc- tional Center (MA) At Hamden County Correctional Center, discharge planning begins at least three months before an inmate's scheduled release. The mental health treatment division in the jailemploys one social worker who focuses on discharge planning for inmates with mentalillness. The discharge planner helps inmates to apply for Medicaid, SSI, Mass Health,and other appropriate entitlement programs. The goal is to have inmates consideredeligible for entitlement programs at the time of their release. In establishing this process, corrections administrators should work with local mental health authorities to arrive at an agreement regarding diagnosesof people who are disabled and therefore may be eligible for SSI (and, by exten-sion, Medicaid). Corrections administrators should also assist inmates in ap-plying for state identification cards, which will be provided upon the inmate'srelease. Without such proof of identification, it is nearly impossible for a per-son to avail him or herself of many benefits or services.Understanding Federal BenefitPrograms Several federal benefit programs are particularly relevant forpeople with mental illness whowill be released from a correc-tions facility: Supplemental Se-curity Income disabilitybenefits; Social (TANF); Veterans Benefits.Implementing the recommenda-tions under this policy statementrequires an understanding of whois eligible to participate in theseprograms and how they qualify.These complex issues are de-scribed in Appendix C, a reprintof a policy brief that the BazelonCenter for Mental Health Lawpublished. Recommendations re-garding Medicaid eligibility ofpretrial detainees who were en-rolled in Medicaid immediatelyprior to their incarceration appearin Policy Statement 13: Intake atCounty / Municipal DetentionCenter.170 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectNotify the victim before the offender is released from prison, con- sistent with the requirements of the state's law or constitution,prior to release. The vast majority of states have a statute or a constitutional amendment requiring that the victim be notified before the offender is released from prison. 29 Regardless of whether the inmate to be released has a mental illness, releasingauthorities and correctional staff must comply with victim notification require- ments. Efforts should be made through correctional crime victim specialists and community-based crime victim agencies to reach out to crime victims and in- form them of the pending release date of those who have victimized them, to educate them as to the decisions being made on behalf of the offender, and to provide them information about the measures being taken to ensure their safety. Monitor the inmate closely in the days approaching release and modify the discharge plan when appropriate. Successful implementation of the transition plan is usually contingent on the following: \u0093updated examinations, which closely reflect the status of the inmate's mental health and psychotropic medication requirements on or nearthe release date; \u0093cooperation among at least two agencies to enable representatives fromone agency to navigate another system credibly; and \u0093provision of a mental health status evaluation for the purpose of riskassessment and/or supervision. (See Policy Statement 19: SubsequentReferral for Screening and Mental Health Evaluation.) A mental health professional should conduct a mental health assessment of the inmate at a point just prior to release to ensure that the discharge plan is fully adequate to addressing the inmate's current needs and circumstances. If it is not, the mental health professional should work with the releasing author- ity to modify the discharge plan accordingly. Provide enhanced discharge planning, including extensive coordi- nation with the community treatment provider, to ensure continuedcase management for inmates with mental illness who will com-plete their sentence in prison. Approximately one out of every five sentenced inmates in the United States is released from a correctional facility without any continued community-based 29. See National Center for Victims of Crime, Crime Vic- tims Source Book , Section 3, Right to Notice.ih jChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 21: Development of Transition Plan \"Our treatment programs tell us that...the single issue that is an impedi-ment to the continuity ofcare is Medicaid eligibil-ity.\" GARY FIELD Administrator, Counseling and Treatment Services,Department of Corrections, OR Source: Interview, January 11, 2002171 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectsupervision.30 These inmates complete their sentence in prison because, through the abolition of parole and other measures, state law prohibits the release of an offender from prison before his sentence is completed or because releasing au- thorities denied the inmate's request for release. Due to disciplinary historiesand reluctance of authorities to release people with mental illness to the com- munity before their sentence has expired, issues discussed earlier in this re- port, the percentage of inmates with mental illness who complete their sentencewhile in prison is probably greater than the 20 percent figure that applies to all general population inmates. 31 (See Policy Statement 20: Release Decision.) Offenders with mental illness released to the community without commu- nity supervision are particularly difficult cases to manage, both because super- vision and participation in treatment and social service programs are completely voluntary and because many newly released offenders resist services and treat-ment. For those releasees who are unwilling to seek traditional mental health system services, an approach to consider is to link them to consumer-run pro- grams, like a drop-in center, or to create peer (i.e., individuals with mentalillness who has themselves once been incarcerated) contacts for outreach. Such programs or outreach provide contacts, appropriate socialization experiences, and can link individuals to services once they are ready. (See Policy Statement39: Consumer and Family Member Involvement.) Releasing authorities should strongly encourage offenders with mental ill- ness to continue services after release, as well as encourage the communitymental health programs as much as possible to conduct active monitoring and outreach to recently released offenders referred to them and otherwise attempt to provide such services. Absent criminal justice oversight and supervision, referral to community- based mental health case management and advocacy programs is perhaps the best recourse. Again, reaching out to community-based organizations and agen-cies that would serve this population and facilitating their access to the institu- tion/inmate prior to release will enhance the likelihood that an individual, upon release, would seek out services. It is also an attractive alternative to andadjunct of criminal justice supervision since community mental health case management services are often eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. (See Chap- ter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System, especially Policy State-ments 36, 37, and 39, for further discussion of mental health case management services.) 30.

Travis et al., From Prison to Home , p. 20.Modification of Conditions of Supervised Release POLICY STATEMENT #22 Monitor and facilitate compliance with conditions of release and re- spond swiftly and appropriately to violations of conditions of release. As explained earlier in this report, approxi- mately 80 percent of sentenced inmates are releasedunder some form of community supervision. 32 Suc- cessful completion of a period of community super-vision is particularly difficult for offenders withmental illness. The transition planning process de-scribed in the preceding policy statement often isnot in place, and people with mental illness who arereleased from prison sometimes wonder whetherthey have been set up to fail. They must find a men-tal health provider willing to deliver services to aperson who not only has a criminal record but whoalso is (often) without the resources to pay for treat-ment and has yet to demonstrate eligibility for Med-icaid. Oftentimes, when a provider does accept aparolee, the person with the criminal record learnsthat he must identify a second provider who willtreat his or her substance abuse problem. Offenders with mental illness recently released from prison also must find housing and, despite nothaving any savings or a paycheck, pay the firstmonth's rent in advance. Furthermore, to maintainsome form of public assistance, they need to dem-onstrate that they are actively seeking a job. Yet22 few employers are willing to hire anyone with acriminal record, and the stigma that surrounds men-tal illness compounds the problem. Overcomingthese obstacles to successful reintegration into thecommunity, while attempting to coordinate appoint-ments in a schedule already crowded with meetingswith a supervision officer, a mental health clinician,and a peer substance abuse support group is nearlyimpossible\u2014and especially so for someone withoutaccess to transportation. Not surprisingly, theseindividuals often return to the types of criminal be-havior that originally prompted their incarceration. Community corrections officers also feel like they have been presented with an impossible situa-tion. With caseloads sometimes reaching into thehundreds, supervision officers are without the timeor resources to facilitate an offender's compliancewith conditions of release. Furthermore, they areunable to observe the offender closely either to gainan improved understanding of the individual or tospot dangerous behavior. At the same time, parole administrators are under significant political pressure to hold paroleesaccountable for violations of conditions of releaseChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 22: Modification of Conditions of Supervised Release173 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONand to ensure that a parolee does not become a front- page news story. The absence of coherent policiesregarding parole revocation decisions for parole vio-lators who have a mental illness exacerbates theproblem. Given this situation, supervision officers often respond to any violation of supervision by recom-mending the reincarceration of the offender. Al-though in many cases these violations (\"technicalviolations\") do not constitute a new crime, they dem-onstrate behavior (e.g., homelessness, substanceabuse, lack of employment, or failure to take medi-cation) to a community corrections officer that indi-cates the releasee is returning to a lifestyle that, ifnot changed, will result in recidivism. As a result,many such parolees are returned to prison not for new offenses but rather for technical rule viola-tions\u2014such as missed appointments with a paroleofficer or testing positive for substance abuse. Recognizing the complexity of this task, and the extent to which supervision officers lack many ofthe resources they need to perform their responsi-bilities, the following recommendations for imple-mentation explain the value of tapping community-based resources such as mental health providers andfamily members. They also outline elements of acollaborative relationship among these entities, withthe aim of encouraging an offender with mental ill-ness to comply with conditions of release and to holdhim or her appropriately accountable. Assign small, specialized caseloads of parolees with mental ill- ness to parole officers who have received advanced training inmental health issues. As discussed in the preceding policy statement, people with mental illness released to the community usually have a long, complicated list of needs; moni-toring and facilitating the releasee's progress in the community is a complex,time-intensive responsibility. It is unrealistic to assume that, in their currentsituation, community corrections officers will have the time or the expertise todevote to all these cases. Specialized training for these supervision officers is essential (see Policy Statement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel). Supervision officers whoare trained and experienced in working with offenders with mental illness aremuch more likely to be attuned to available treatment options, signals of dis-tress, and signs of decompensation. Under these circumstances, supervisingofficers are much more likely to seek out and arrange revised treatment optionsand other relevant remedies in lieu of issuing a warrant and instituting viola-tion proceedings that would likely result in reincarceration. It is also worthnoting that parole officers who seek specialized training are especially inter-ested in working with this population and thus are likely to engage them in aparticularly constructive way.174 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Specialized Caseloads, New York State Division of Parole The New York State Division of Parole (DOP), in conjunction with the New York Office of Mental Health (OMH), has established specialized caseloads in certain metropoli-tan areas to service parolees with mental illness. Parole officers in this programreceive specialized training on mental illness and carry a reduced caseload of ap-proximately 25 cases. The specialized parole officers work with community mentalhealth agencies to link parolees to appropriate services. (See also Policy Statement20: Release Decision, for more on collaboration between the New York DOP and theNew York OMH.) Example: Special Management Unit, Connecticut Board of Parole The Connecticut Board of Parole has established a Special Management Unit to super- vise parolees requiring ongoing intensive supervision or specialized treatment. Theunit focuses primarily on supervision of paroled sex offenders but also works withparolees with severe mental illness. Special Management Unit parole officers receivetraining in supervision and in medical, and mental health issues and maintain acaseload of no more than 25 parolees. The unit emphasizes interaction betweentreatment providers and parole officers; officers participate in both group and one-on-one counseling sessions with offenders. Small, specialized caseloads can also enable community corrections offic- ers to develop effective working relationships with community service provid- ers. Mental health providers, whose time and resources are already spread thin, are often untrained on how to take into account the criminal history (andthe providers' obligations to the criminal justice system) of clients referred to them by the criminal justice system. (Training for mental health providers on working with criminal justice populations is essential to address this issue.See Policy Statement 31: Training for Mental Health Professionals.) Some community-based mental health providers, often citing liability concerns, ex- plicitly refuse to serve individuals with criminal histories. 33 (See Policy State- ment 1: Involvement with Mental Health System, for more on access to services and priority populations.) In rural jurisdictions, where there may not be enough offenders with men- tal illness to merit a specialized caseload, supervision officers at a minimum should receive orientation and training to monitor and assess offenders on their caseloads who have mental illness. Like their urban counterparts, they shouldbe prepared to make appropriate referrals in the event of new problems and/or technical violations rather than relying on revocation of parole. The availabil- ity of specialized services and resources for offenders in rural jurisdictions posesdifficult transportation issues. Rural jurisdictions may be able to establish spe- cial services, transportation, and supervision arrangements in facilitating col- laboration between criminal justice agencies and mental health service provid-ers or other social service providers for whom the parolee is a member of a shared population. contributed to the foundering of the Multnomah County pretrial diversion program. Information provided in private correspondence, May 7, 2002.33. According to Doug Bray, Court Administrator, Multnomah County, Oregon, community-based service pro- viders' refusal to serve individuals with criminal recordsChapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 22: Modification of Conditions of Supervised Release175 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectEncourage community corrections staff to conduct field supervi- sion and other monitoring responsibilities within the communities,homes, and community-based service programs where the relea-see spends most of his or her time. Supervision officers should maintain contact with ex-offenders in their com- munities rather than monitoring them remotely from a centralized office. Com-munity-based supervision enables the officer to monitor the offender more closely,thus improving the officer's familiarity with the unique obstacles that oftenimpede the released offender's compliance with the conditions of his/her re-lease. In addition, frequent contact with mental health treatment providersimproves supervision officers' understanding of these services. It can also helpthem ascertain whether mental health treatment providers are offering theservices needed. In addition to the benefits derived from close community monitoring of ex- offenders, there has been some recent success in community mapping. Follow-ing the example of crime mapping in law enforcement, some jurisdictions havebegun to use similar mapping techniques to identify specific districts and neigh-borhoods where significant numbers of ex-offenders are located. This informa-tion may be used to design community-based initiatives focusing on these neigh-borhoods. Such a technique might be used to identify clusters of offenders withmental illness who live in specific neighborhoods and where specialized fieldsupervision and mental health services might be located and deployed. Themapping function can be a collaborative effort as well between criminal justiceproviders and social service agencies, with the dual benefit of collaboration anda work product in the end useful to all parties involved. Work closely with mental health administrators and providers to ensure that parolees receive services and resources specified incommunity reintegration and supervision plans. The successful reintegration of offenders with mental illness back into the community depends, in large part, on their ability to obtain access to a range ofmental health and related services. Oftentimes, it is the lack of adequate mentalhealth resources\u2014within both correctional institutions and the community\u2014thatimpedes the decision to release offenders with mental illness who might other-wise be eligible for release. Those offenders with mental illness who are releasedto supervision are often required to maintain some level of mental health treat-ment. If mental health service providers do not make adequate services avail-able to the offender, he or she may be violated and unnecessarily reincarcerated.cb176 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectInstitutional corrections, parole boards, and community corrections agen- cies can encourage mental health agencies and providers to provide adequateservices through improved cross-system collaboration. The Texas Council onMentally Ill Offenders (Policy Statement 20) and the Washington DangerousMentally Ill Offender Program, and Massachusetts Forensic Transition Team(Policy Statement 21) all help community corrections agencies work togetherwith mental health service providers to ensure that offenders under commu-nity supervision receive the services that they need. The Rhode Island Fellow-ship Health Resources program is a similar model of collaboration between cor-rections and mental health providers. Example: Fellowship Community Reintegration Services (RI) Operated under contract with the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retarda- tion, and Hospitals by Fellowship Health Resources, a nonprofit agency, FellowshipCommunity Reintegra tion Services (CRS) provides discharge planning and advocacy for released offenders to ensure that they receive appropriate community placementsand services as well as assistance with applications for entitlements and any needededucation or employment referrals. Clients may be placed in any of a variety ofcommunity agencies, including residential substance abuse treatment facilities, or may be placed on home confinement with provisions made for service delivery. Fel-lowship CRS tracks its clients for one year postrelease to gather outcome data anddetermine the appropriateness of available placements. Ensure that released offenders are connected to a 24-hour crisis service. Crisis services provide community corrections officers with a quick inter- vention that enables them to respond effectively\u2014without depending onreincarceration exclusively\u2014to address technical violations, such as a missedappointment, of conditions of release. Correctional mental health profession-als maintain that this type of brief intervention during points of crisis will re-duce subsequent (and likely more serious) violations of conditions of supervisedrelease. 34 Establish protocols to share information between community su- pervision agencies and community mental health providers regard-ing compliance with conditions of release. For community corrections officers to develop confidence in a community- based service, they must trust that providers will inform them about behaviorthat constitutes violations of conditions of release. At the same time, providersed 34.

Yetwe tell a person in themost severe throes ofmental illness, 'we'll giveyou treatment if you firstthink your way there.'\" CARLA JACOBS Board Member, National Alliance forthe Mentally Ill Source: Los Angeles Times , Monday, A ugust 3, 1998177 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectdo not want to be in a position of monitoring a parolee's conditions of release; that would likely undermine their relationship with the client. Various jurisdictions have developed compromises between community corrections agencies and service providers, which enable both groups to adhereto their responsibilities. Typically, community corrections officers do not need or want detailed in- formation about the mental health treatment process. What they are mostinterested in are brief progress reports, and to be notified about behaviors thatviolate conditions of supervision. A transition plan should involve a writtenrelease from the offender, permitting mental health providers to share this in-formation with community corrections agencies. (See Policy Statement 25: Shar-ing Information.) Example: Forensic Transition Team, Massachusetts Department of Mental Health The Forensic Transition Team in Massachusetts ensures that offenders participating in the program sign a release that allows open communication between mental healthproviders and parole staff. No information is exchanged without a written releaseexcept as required under mandatory reporting statutes. Parole field-staff are ofteninvolved in a primary way with treating staff upon release. Occasionally they areinvited to case conferences or other gatherings of the treatment community to offeroversight on a case. In general, the parole officers are most interested in compliancewith treatment as part of the conditions of release. Develop a range of graduated sanctions to compel (and incentives to encourage) compliance with conditions of release. Community supervision staff members need to be prepared to address the needs of the offender with mental illness who may be unable to comply with thetraditional mandates of community supervision. Although reincarceration ofthe offender may be the most expedient response in the short run, it may not bethe best use of criminal justice resources or, in the long term, be the responsemost likely to prevent the person from reoffending. Absent new criminal be-havior by the probationer or parolee, alternative responses should be consid-ered. Incarceration should be reserved for those cases that represent a threatto public safety. To provide the most effective intermediate sanctions, criminal justice offi- cials should develop agreements with case management service providers, ad-vocacy organizations, specialized employment/vocational providers, crisis ser-vices, and mental health treatment programs to provide support for individualswith mental illness when problems arise. If a probationer or parolee with men-tal illness decompensates considerably after his or her release, increasing treat-ment should be considered prior to recommending the offender be returned tof178 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectcustody. Providing aggressive treatment may stabilize the offender's mental condition much more effectively and economically that reincarceration. Offenders with mental illness who are returned to the community may need more intensive services and supervision than originally planned prior totheir release, particularly in relation to their reaction to the stresses of return-ing to the community. An effective approach to violations of conditions of super-vision is to increase gradually the level of treatment intervention in combina-tion with a graduated series of predetermined responses (rather than violatingthem immediately upon the first technical violation). There should be someflexibility for the officer to use a reasonable level of discretion while maintain-ing program consistency. Agencies such as New York City's Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services (CASES) provide interagency case planning and man-agement services for \"special needs\" offenders, such as offenders with mentalillness, who are in jeopardy of parole revocation due to noncriminal violationsof conditions of community supervision. Example: Parole Restoration Project, Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services (CASES), New York City (NY) CASES recently developed the Parole Restoration Project for technical parole violators incarcerated in New York City jails whose parole status would otherwise be revoked.The project attempts to increase the number of special needs parole violators return-ing to parole community supervision instead of state prison. The project's clientsinclude substance abusers, people with a mental illness, people with co-occurringdisorders, and women. Project staff identify eligible participants, assess their treat-ment needs, link them to community-based service providers, gain support for thetreatment plan from parole field staff and assigned counsel, submit a comprehensivereport to the administrative law judge and the board of parole advocating for restitu-tion of parole under the recommended treatment program, and coordinate the releaseand monitoring of compliance. Other agencies, such as the Cook County, Illinois, Department of Adult Probation and the Maricopa County, Arizona, Probation Office, employ a gradu-ated ladder of sanctions and special, individualized services for probationers orparolees with special needs. Still others, like the Hawaii Paroling Authorityand the Kentucky Department of Corrections, offer a structured living environ-ment to parolees with mental illness where care, treatment, and housing areprovided. Incentives and positive reinforcement can also be useful tools in helping offenders with mental illness adhere to the conditions of their release. Example: Dangerous Mentally Ill Offender Program (WA) As part of the Dangerous Mentally Ill Offender legislation, Washington State appropri- ated additional funds to support the transition of offenders with mental illness backinto the community. Regional Support Networks, components of the Washingtonmental health system, have used a portion of these funds for incentives (such as newclothing) as a means to increasing compliance with treatment plans.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 22: Modification of Conditions of Supervised Release179 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project180 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectMaintaining Contact Between Individual and Mental Health System POLICY STATEMENT #23 Ensure that people with mental illness who are no longer under su- pervision of the criminal justice system maintain contact with mentalhealth services and supports for as long as is necessary. People with mental illness who come out of prison must have access to services they need to re-integrate into community settings successfully. Thepreceding policy statement discusses the importanceof collaboration between mental health and commu-nity corrections agencies in ensuring that individu-als with mental illness who are granted supervisedrelease receive appropriate mental health services.This policy statement addresses the role of the men-tal health system in providing services and supportfor individuals released from prison who are nolonger under continued supervision from the crimi-nal justice system. This group includes those whohave completed their sentence in prison or jail andare released without conditions as well as those whohave successfully met the conditions of release andare no longer under supervision in the community. Once offenders have completed the terms of their sentence or conditional release, ongoing moni-toring by and reporting to the criminal justice sys-tem is neither warranted nor justifiable. However,in light of the high recidivism rates of offenders withmental illness, it is crucial that the mental healthsystem maintain contact with individuals who havebeen incarcerated to prevent their renewed involve-ment with the criminal justice system.23 As is true of anyone with mental illness at- tempting to live independently in the community,offenders have basic needs for housing and supportsthat must be adequately met if reentry is to suc-ceed. By ensuring access to appropriate services andnecessary supports, especially housing, and by de-veloping and utilizing mechanisms to ensure ongo-ing contact, community mental health providers canplay an important role in successful community re-integration of former prisoners who have mental ill-ness. Community mental health providers must be attuned to the special needs and circumstances ofreleased offenders with mental illness and provideservices that enhance their ability to live indepen-dently. By identifying recently incarcerated clientswith mental illness as a \"special needs\" or \"priority\"population, community providers can develop treat-ment plans and provide services that ensure moni-toring and outreach to fit an individual's circum-stances. While services available to released offenders ultimately may not need to be more intensive thanthose available to other clients, mental health careproviders should be prepared to help these clientsmeet challenges related to the transition to commu-Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 23: Maintaining Contact Between Individual and Mental Health System181 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONnity life. Treatment and rehabilitative models such as Assertive Community Treatment should be em-ployed when appropriate to monitor the client's tran-sition and address problems that could lead to rear-rest and incarceration (see Policy Statement 35:Evidence-Based Practices, for more on AssertiveCommunity Treatment). Special attention shouldbe given from the outset to provision of rehabilita-tive services that will both address specific needsand help establish a routine for the released offenderattempting to grow accustomed to new freedom. Mental health providers have both an opportu- nity and an obligation when an offender with men-tal illness is released from prison. The opportunityarises from the fact that, unlike those people withmental illness with no prior criminal justice contactwho seek services, released offenders with mentalillness will have treatment histories and may haveadditional incentives to engage in care. Their crimi-nal histories and service provision while incarcer-ated are relevant to the mental health system in effectively designing an individual treatment plan.Whether an offender will be supervised in the com-munity or released unconditionally, communicationbetween the systems is key. (See Policy Statement20: Release Decision and Policy Statement 21: De-velopment of Transition Plan.) It is the providers' obligation to seize the op- portunity and to provide the services needed to en-sure that the released offender does not return tothe criminal justice system because services werenot available, accessible, or effective. For mentalhealth service providers to meet their obligation topeople with mental illness who are leaving prison,sufficient resources must be made available to fundeffective services and programs. Success in thisendeavor should result in a reduction in demandfor crisis services as well as in recidivism and theresultant drain on criminal justice resources. . (SeePolicy Statement 1: Involvement with the MentalHealth System.) Develop mechanisms to engage ex-offenders with mental illness who have been released to the community. Systems need to be in place to allow mental health and social service pro- viders to coordinate with correctional and law enforcement agencies prior toand following the release of people with mental illness from correctional facili-ties. At a minimum, this means that community service agencies should beinformed of the impending release of prisoners with histories of treatment formental illness while in prison who will not be under community supervision.Mental health service providers should then maintain records documenting con-tact and treatment subsequent to release. There is no reason for these recordsto differ in form or content from the records kept on contacts with any commu-nity client. Depending on the system configuration, a community reintegration pro- gram may require considerable spanning of both jurisdictional and systemicboundaries. Incentives should be created for the community providers to do\"inreach\" to the correctional setting and begin the process prior to release. Ex-offender contact information following release should be explicitly defined and182 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecta mechanism should be developed for locating individuals who do not keep their first scheduled appointment. The \"moment of release\" from prison is often a crucial juncture in an offender's transition back to life in the community. This is especially true foroffenders with mental illness; it is important that these individuals are con-nected as seamlessly as possible with housing and services. Mental healthproviders should be aware of the importance of the period immediately follow-ing a prisoner's release and work with corrections officials to develop transitionplans, even for individuals who will not be under community supervision, thatprovide detailed strategies for the first days after a prisoner's release. Respon-sibility to assume care of the individual between the time of release and thefirst outpatient appointment must be explicit. This initial period of reintegra-tion provides an opportunity for the mental health system to engage formerprisoners from day one. (See Policy Statement 21: Development of TransitionPlan.) Develop programs to provide appropriate levels of service and supports to ex-offenders with mental illness who have re-enteredthe community. Ex-offenders with mental illness return to the community burdened by a double stigma. The problems posed by their criminal history and mental healthcondition to finding housing and employment have already been discussed. Moresubtly, their status as ex-offenders with histories of mental health treatmentcan affect their social networks and family relationships as well, often leavingthem in the same social situation that led to their arrest in the first place. People with mental illness emerging from prison also frequently report particular discrimination on the part of the mental health service community.In many instances, mental health providers are reluctant to take on the per-ceived risks associated with clients who have criminal histories, especially ifthey include violence. 35 It is important that programs be developed to meet the specific needs of offenders with mental illness who are transitioning from prison to the commu-nity. Correctional settings have had the responsibility for screening and identi-fication of mental health issues as well as for providing treatment while incar-cerated. After those functions, the principle transition planning responsibilityis to establish linkages between the ex-offender and future community services.Working partnerships among probation, parole, the courts, neighborhood busi-nesses, community housing organizations, and service providers can provideb 35.35.35.35.35. Erik Roskes and Richard Feldman, \"A Collaborative Comm unity-Based Treatment Program for Offenders 50:1, 1999, pp. 1614- 19.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 23: Maintaining Contact Between Individual and Mental Health System183 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectopportunities for the released offender to participate in restorative and thera- peutic activities and community service projects. Transition planning is equallyimportant for individuals who will not be under community supervision as it isfor those who will have some conditions placed on their release. Programs serving released offenders need to develop a broad menu of ser- vices that can be matched to offender needs. The service array should includeattention to housing, health care, medications, case management, employment,income supports and entitlements, food and clothing, transportation, and childcare. The result should be a community-based mental health service and sup-port program that does not differ greatly from any intensely monitored commu-nity treatment program. If it is staffed by knowledgeable professionals and cli-ent-centered in its approach, it will best meet the needs of the released offenderswith mental illness it serves. Mental health staff need to be prepared to work with individuals who have been involved in the criminal justice system. This requires training that willhelp to overcome the stigma attached to incarceration, address the special needsof individuals who have been incarcerated, and promote appropriate coordina-tion with criminal justice agencies. (See Policy Statement 31: Training for MentalHealth Professionals.) Mental health service providers should also consider encouraging develop- ment of a system of peer support for ex-offenders with mental illness. Findingthat one is not alone in facing identifiable challenges associated with reentrycan itself be an important support for men and women with mental illness com-ing out of prison. Peer support of this nature provides a ready and acceptingsocial network, while those who have shared the experience can offer adviceand suggestions likely to be received positively by the reentering ex-offender.(See Policy Statement 39: Consumer and Family Member Involvement, formore on peer services.) Develop an understanding of the factors leading to community re- integration success or failure for clients with mental illness whohave been released from prison. Much is already known about the factors that affect a client's chances of establishing him or herself in the community upon release from prison. Forinstance, many clients have an immediate need for income-assistance, so re-establishment of benefits is an important step to be addressed at the earliestpossible opportunity. Similarly, safe, affordable, permanent housing is closelycorrelated with success in the community. For almost all persons with mentalillness leaving prison, addressing housing needs must be seen as a high priority.c184 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectMaintaining contact between the mental health system and individuals who have entered it from prison also provides opportunities for other factors tobe more clearly understood. It is important for the community provider to un-derstand the factors that led up to arrest. The planning of effective servicesinvolves attention to these matters to ensure services are delivered that reducethe likelihood of rearrest. Community providers must incorporate this under-standing into an individualized treatment plan. The needs of a mother who hasbeen incarcerated for crimes directly related to substance abuse will necessar-ily differ from those of a young male imprisoned on a personal assault convic-tion. It is important for any service provider to systematically evaluate its ap-proaches, and in this area especially it is necessary to build training curriculaon the experiences of those staff, clients, and families attempting to bridge theworlds of prison and mental health. In a well-functioning system, recognitionof individual needs will come with experience, and responsiveness will thusbecome more effective. Example: Massachusetts Forensic Transition Program, Massachusetts Department of Mental Health Operated by the Massachusetts Departme nt of Mental Health (DMH), the transition program is a statewide initiative that assists DMH-eligible preadjudicated and con-victed inmates. It provides tracking and release planning services. Program staffcollaborate with relevant departments, agencies, and vendors to facilitate the transi-tion of ex-offenders with mental illness into communities across the state. They workwith inmates with mental illness in correctional facilities at least three months beforerelease to coordinate relevant psychosocial and criminal information for the transitionand treatment planning process after release. Staff also provide case coordination andconsultation to community providers for up to three months after release to addressany immediate obstacles to client community adjustment. The Forensic TransitionProgram works with inmates who will be under community supervision as well asthose who have completed their sentence. 36 By maintaining contact with recently released offenders with mental ill- ness and providing effective services for them, community mental health pro-viders demonstrate their willingness and ability to perform an important publicsafety function. 36. Hartwell et al., pp. 73-81.Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reentry Policy Statement 23: Maintaining Contact Between Individual and Mental Health System185 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectPart TWO:Overarching Themes188 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectImproving CollaborationCHAPTER V People with mental illness who have become involved (or are at risk of becoming involved) with the crimi-nal justice system frequently have multiple needs that can be ad- dressed only through the collaborative efforts ofseveral agencies working within the constraints of diverse systems. The failure of these systems to connect effectively endangers lives, wastes money,and threatens public safety\u2014frustrating crime vic- tims, consumers, family members, and communi- ties in general. For these reasons, the policy statements and implementation recommendations in this report stress repeatedly the importance of agencies, de-partments, and organizations working together, across systems. In fact, many of the policy state- ments do not address a criminal justice or mentalhealth entity exclusively, but straddle the two sys- tems, requiring the systems to respond jointly. This report recognizes at the outset that an essential first step toward implementing any of the policy statements is to develop some degree of co- operation among stakeholders in the criminal jus- 1. Coalition-building experts stress the differences between coordination, coopera- tion, and collaboration, which reflect distinct degrees of commitment. In practice, however, these terms are used almost interchangeably. This report places a pre-mium on partnerships, while recognizing the oftentimes difficult-to-distinguish dif-tice and mental health systems. (See the section of the report's Introduction entitled \"Getting Started,\" which explores this point in detail.) But coopera-tion\u2014such as getting people to the table to define the problem and identify shared goals\u2014 is only a first step toward collaboration. Stakeholders needto get beyond informal handshake agreements largely dependent on personalities and unlikely to survive staff turnover or changes in leadership. Toensure the lasting, systemic change that this re- port contemplates, criminal justice and mental health policymakers will need to improve upon ini-tial cooperative efforts, begin to collaborate, and, ultimately, enter into partnerships . 1 The impetus for collaboration can come from a variety of sources. 2 Sometimes, it is a tragedy involving an individual with mental illness that forces representatives of the criminal justice andmental health systems to recognize the need for working together more closely. This was the case in Seminole County, Florida, where a tragic shoot-ing of a deputy by an individual with mental ill- ness sparked cooperation among various stakehold- ers, which in turn prompted the creation of a task ferences among coordination, cooperation, and collaboration. 2. A useful discussion of the elements of good coalition building, especially as they relate to the integration of criminal justice, mental health, and substance abusesystems, is provided in The Courage to Change: Communities to Create Integrated189 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectforce designed to improve system coordination. Legislatures can also be extremely powerful in encouraging improved collaboration to addressthe issue of individuals with mental illness in the criminal justice system. In 1998, the California Leg- islature established the Mentally Ill Offender CrimeReduction Grant (MIOCRG) Program. The pro- gram provided $50.6 million in grant monies for demonstration projects in 15 different counties that,collectively, target approximately 12,500 offenders with mental illness. 3 To be eligible for a demon- stration grant, the legislation requires counties toestablish a Strategy Committee comprising crimi- nal justice and mental health stakeholders. At the local level, the success of cross-system collaboration often depends on strong leadership from high-ranking officials in both the criminal jus- tice and mental health systems. These individu-als can bring participants to the table, deal with conflicts that arise, and generally ensure that the partnership can overcome the inherent difficultiesattendant to cross-system collaboration. One ex- ample of numerous such collaborative efforts is the Mental Health Coordinating Council in TravisCounty, Texas. The Coordinating Council is headed by the probate judge and includes representatives from the local mental health agency, emergencyservices, the sheriff's office, the police department, the county attorney's office, social workers, con- sumer advocacy groups, the state hospital and oth-ers. The council meets once monthly to address issues of common concern to the participants. The probate judge develops meeting agendas, facilitatesthe meetings, mediates conflicts, and helps clarify legal issues. 4 This report is replete with numerous, inspir- ing cases of stakeholders collaborating closely, across systems, and forming successful partner- ships. In these cases, the stakeholders have cleared initial barriers to cooperation and coalition build- ing, which are addressed in the introduction to this report. Furthermore, they have addressed threekey issues, reviewed in this section, to ensure the long-term viability of the collaboration: obtaining and managing the resources to sustain the initia-tive; establishing guidelines for information shar- ing; and institutionalizing the partnership.

Barbara Misle, assistant county attorney, Mental Health Division, Travis County, Texas, interview, April 18, 2002.190 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONObtaining and Sharing Resources POLICY STATEMENT # 24 Determine how the partners will make resources available to respond jointly to the problem identified. An essential first step for communities or states interested in addressing mental health issues asthey relate to the criminal justice system is to bringprospective partners to the table, define the prob-lem, and establish which individuals will shepherdthe partnership. After these issues have been re-solved, however, numerous decisions remain before24 the partnership can be launched. What will be thecosts (both direct and in-kind) of operating this jointventure? Where will these resources come from?How will they be administered? The following rec-ommendations serve as a guide to agents of changestruggling with these questions. Identify the number of clients whom the prospective partners, un- der the current system, are serving in parallel systems and deter-mine the nature of this overlap. Before the partners can develop a budget describing the costs of the joint venture, they will need to identify the number of people they will target and theneeds of those individuals. To that end, they should analyze how their clienteleoverlap and then quantify that overlap. For example, the courts may work withthe local mental health centers to identify a number of jail detainees who meetcriteria for pretrial release and, prior to being charged, were receiving mentalhealth services in the community. Example: Department of Community and Human Services, Crisis and Engagement Services, Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division, King County (WA) In an effort to lay the groundwork for collaboration between different service agencies, officials in King County collected data concerning the overlap between high utilizers ofChapter V: Improving Collaboration Policy Statement 24: Obtaining and Sharing Resources191 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project5. See \"Creating Integrated Service Systems for People with Co-Occurring Disorders Diverted from the Criminal Justice System: The King County Experience,\" The Na-tional GAINS Center for People with Co-Occurring Disor- ders in the Justice System, Summer 2000.substance abuse and mental health services and the jail population. By facilitating the cross-referencing of information between separate databases (with the appropriateprotections for the privacy of identifying information), the Division of Crisis andEngagement Services discovered that, in fact, many of the individuals who were spendingconsiderable time in substance abuse and mental health treatment facilities had alsobeen arrested and incarcerated in the county jail multiple times. Though these indi-viduals seemed to be benefiting very little from their involvement in these services,the cost of providing those services was high\u2014approximately $1.1 million for 20 individuals. Gathering this data helped officials throughout the mental health andcriminal justice systems in King County to better understand their shared clienteleand helped spur improved collaboration there. Share resources among organizations to ensure an effective and efficient response. Obtaining new dollars to support a partnership is difficult. Even when jurisdictions are successful in securing appropriations or a grant, this fundingassistance is unlikely to cover all of the costs associated with the initiative.Accordingly, the partnering organizations will need to review their existing re-sources to determine how they can be shared or shifted to make the partner-ship work. In many cases, staff, space, equipment, or expertise donated by oneor more of the partnering organizations is as good (if not better) than a contri-bution of actual dollars. Example: King County (WA) Partners in King County, Washington, each made considerable in-kind contributions to make their joint effort to develop a prebooking diversion program work. The SeattlePolice Department, without new staff or resources, identified more than 100 volun-teers from the existing ranks of the police force, who agreed to receive 40 hours ofspecialized training regarding people with mental illness, drug and alcohol problems,and developmental disabilities. Representatives of the treatment systems, consum-ers, and family members conducted the training, donating their time. For its part, the King County Hospital provided the space and part of the staffing required to reconfigurean existing psychiatric emergency room into a Crisis Triage Unit capable of managingpre-booking diversion referrals made by police officers. 5 Shift savings generated by the new response\u2014or a related initia- tive\u2014to the partnering organization in need of additional re-sources. When the criminal justice and mental health stakeholders begin to imple- ment a joint response to a segment of the population with mental illness incontact with the criminal justice system, the new approach is likely to generateb c\"I believe there must be alignment between themental health community,law enforcement, thecourts, and corrections ifwe are to have any abilityto deal with this ever spi-raling issue of mentalillness in our communi-ties. Collaboration at thelocal level can only en-hance problem solving.\" DAN CORSENTINO CO Source: Personal correspondence192 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectsome costs savings for the criminal justice partner. For example, a small study of 46 participants in Project Link in Monroe County, New York, found that thepartnership among various mental health organizations in the county and countygovernment officials reduced the mean number of jail days per month for theprogram participants from 9.1 to 2.1 and the mean number of hospital days permonth from 8.3 to 3. Based on per diem costs, this translates to a savings ofmore than $23,000 in jail costs and more than $155,000 in hospital costs for the46 program participants. 6 Partners should work together (ideally, before the costs savings are even realized) to redirect the resources saved to the organization or agency assum-ing the expense incurred by absorbing the additional clients. Moving fund bal-ances to different state or county agencies is usually complex, and it often re-quires the involvement of a state budget authority and the legislature. Example: Connecticut Jail Diversion Project In Connecticut, in 2000, the General Assembly authorized the statewide replication of a successful jail diversion pilot program based in New Haven. To provide the statemental health agency with the resources necessary to expand the program, legislatorsworked with the state corrections department (which also operates all facilities in thestate that house pretrial detainees), whose commissioner recognized that the expan-sion of the program would save a number of corrections beds and thus save theagency money. 7 The General Assembly, with the consent of the corrections commis- sioner, effected the shift of approximately $3.1 million from the corrections budget into the state mental health agency's budget.8 Partners may also decide to apply savings generated by another initiative to an effort regarding people with mental illness in contact with the criminaljustice system. Example: King County (WA) In King County, Washington, partners used savings generated from the managed care system to fund the diversion programs they developed. The managed care system,when held accountable to its stated goal of promoting increased client choice andindividualized and tailored care, can support jail diversion efforts. System integrationadvocates argued that a portion of the systems savings (\"fund balance\") generated bythe managed care model could be reinvested in services targeting those for whom themanaged care paradigm worked least well\u2014including people with co-occurring disor- ders involved in the justice system. This meant that fund balance dollars produced bythe managed care process could be applied to supplementing the staffing needed tocreate the hospital's Crisis Triage Unit and the mental health court. For services provided to custodial parents who qualify for Temporary As- sistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance or TANF-funded services,this entitlement may be an important resource. Generally speaking, TANF-funded services are more readily available than cash benefits, especially when 6. \"Prevention of Jail and Hospital Recidivism Among Persons With Severe Mental Illness: Project Link, Depart- ment of Psychiatry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NewYork,\" Psychiatric Services 50:11, November 1999, pp. 1477-80.7. In fact, the state corrections system was so short on bed space that they contracted with the Commonwealth of Virginia to house 500 inmates in that state. 8. Ellen Webber, director of the Connecticut Jail Diversion Project, interview, March 16, 2002.Chapter V: Improving Collaboration Policy Statement 24: Obtaining and Sharing Resources193 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectthe eligible recipient is or recently has been incarcerated. Tapping TANF funds facilitates state and local government officials' efforts to make services such ascase management, vocational rehabilitation, mental health and substance abusecounseling, and job training, search, and placement services available. Indeed,TANF funds have the potential to ease a financial burden for corrections bud-gets while putting little new strain on the mental health service budget. 9 Identify one of the partnering organizations\u2014or establish a new entity\u2014to serve as the locus for grants, new appropriations, andother resources contributed to the partnership. Deciding which of the partnering organizations will be the recipient of a new appropriation or the share of a grant can be a thorny and divisive process.In some cases, it may make sense for the partners to establish an independent,not-for-profit organization, with representatives from each of the partneringorganizations would help to govern, to receive and administer these funds. Example: PERT, Inc., San Diego County (CA) In San Diego County, in 1993, mental health and law enforcement professionals, con- sumers, and family members of consumers established a task force in response to several high-profile shootings of individuals with mental illness. The task force de-veloped a series of Psychiatric Emergency Response Teams (PERT) to improve theresponse of the criminal justice system to individuals with mental illness. County andstate agencies agreed to fund part of the initiative with a portion of the jurisdictions'share of federal block grant that the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Admin-istration administers. Members of the task force could not agree on which organiza-tion should receive the grant, so they formed an independent organization: \"PERT,Inc.\" PERT, Inc. supervises the PERT staff and coordinates billing for services ren-dered. The board for PERT, Inc. is made up in part by NAMI board members andboard members from the Community Research Foundation, the largest private, non-profit mental health service provider in the county.d 9.

Appropriate information sharing between men- tal health and criminal justice systems ensures thatcriminal justice officials make informed decisionsregarding a defendant or offender and that provid-ers meet the treatment needs of people with mentalillness in the criminal justice system. Nevertheless,line staff and policymakers alike often cite informa-tion-sharing restrictions as one of the biggest barri-ers to collaboration between mental health andcriminal justice system officials. Mental health pro-fessionals have legal and ethical obligations not todivulge clinical information without consent, unlesscertain conditions apply, including imposition of ajudge's order. Law enforcement officers and pros-ecutors concerned about safety issues, judges whomust make informed pretrial release and sentenc-ing decisions, and corrections officers charged withmaintaining safe institutions and providing consti-25 tutionally adequate levels of care are all looking forinformation that will help them in their duties. In fact, maintaining appropriate confidential- ity of a person's mental health records, deliveringeffective mental health services, and ensuring thesafety of the community and the victim are consis-tent goals. Moreover, partnerships exist in manyjurisdictions in which officials have overcome tradi-tional barriers to information sharing without en-dangering public safety, violating the ethics of pro-viders, or invading the privacy of the individual. Policy statements appearing elsewhere in this report include specific recommendations that ex-plain how information can be shared appropriatelywithin certain contexts. The recommendations be-low should serve as general guidelines regardinginformation sharing.Chapter V: Improving Collaboration Policy Statement 25: Sharing Information195 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project10. Indiana is an example of a state with such a statute. 11. See (42 U.S.Code \u00a7290dd-2).aRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION Ensure that mental health clinicians, law enforcement personnel, officers of the courts, and jail and corrections staff are familiarwith and abide by state and federal law and regulations governingthe transfer of mental health records and information. The laws of every state contain provisions that govern how mental health practitioners may share clinical information. While the statutes are not en-tirely consistent across state boundaries, they generally call for the patient toprovide written consent if information is to be shared beyond the immediateclinical team currently providing services. Mental health providers are gener-ally trained to take a conservative approach to information sharing, and forreasons tied to both ethics and liability many are reluctant to share clinicalinformation without consent. Indeed, licenses for some mental health profes-sions can be revoked if confidentiality rules are not observed. In some states,restrictions on the sharing of clinical information apply even when the patientis moving from one treatment setting to another. In most states provisions existthat allow for information to be shared in a health care emergency. Some stateshave specific provisions for sharing information with a law enforcement officeror agency if doing so, will benefit the patient. 10 Federal statute and regulations also cover the transfer of information re- garding treatment of someone for mental illness or a substance abuse disorder.Federal statute governing information related to substance abuse treatment ismore ironclad than counterpart provisions covering mental illness treatmentrecords. 11 Routine training for both mental health practitioners and criminal justice staff should include familiarization with laws and regulations covering confi-dentiality and the transfer of medical information. If possible, criminal justiceand mental health trainers should find or create training sessions or other fo-rums where issues of confidentiality and information transfer can be addressedin one place by staff from both fields with the goal of reaching a common under-standing of the applicable laws. Additionally, mental health agencies and criminal justice entities should examine internal polices to ensure that they reflect and encourage compliancewith relevant laws and regulations.\"The criminal justice sys- tem and the local andstate mental health sys-tems are not set up toshare information. Theyare set up to protect anindividual's constitutionaland statutory rights. Theadversarial system cur-rently in place is effectivein reaching resolution oncriminal cases. It is not avery effective system inresolving issues related tomentally ill defendants.\" HON. MICHAEL D. SCHRUNK District Attor ney, County, OR196 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectObtain an individual's specific, written consent before a mental health agency or provider shares his or her information with crimi-nal justice personnel, except when federal or state law (or a judi-cial order) supercedes. Deeply ingrained in the training and ethical code of mental health provid- ers is the principle that the individuals they treat have the right to determinewho is to know that they are in treatment and what that treatment consists of.For this reason, the first option whenever there is a request for information orreason for information to be shared is to ask the patient to provide consent. Inthe majority of cases, individuals will sign a form they understand will helpthem receive needed or continued treatment. Even in instances where the lawdoes not strictly require providers to obtain consent from a client for informa-tion to be transferred, the exercise can be an important way of demonstratinggoodwill and building trust between providers and between the provider andthe patient. 12 Written consent should be drafted in a way that indicates the purposes for which the requested information may be used, the period for which consent isvalid, and with whom it may be shared. (See Policy Statement 7: Appointmentof Counsel for more on the role of defense counsel in obtaining consent.) Limit access to mental health databases to authorized mental health personnel; provide information about an individual's mentalhealth status and treatment on a case-by-case basis only. In view of the confidentiality statutes and ethical standards already men- tioned, and recognizing the limitations of most mental health system databases,access to them should be limited. Mental health staff should be the only person-nel to access information maintained in mental health databases. Protocolsshould be put in place to ensure that information provided to clinical staff iskept confidential. By the same token, mental health staff should not present unreasonable roadblocks to information flow that can help law enforcement, courts, and cor-rections officials make informed decisions about individuals in their custody. Ifpossible, they should set up protocols that can enable an appropriate flow ofinformation to law enforcement, detention, and other criminal justice person-nel while preserving the confidentiality and right to privacy of individuals inthe system. Mental health systems in this country maintain databases for a variety of reasons. Some may hold clinical treatment information; many more are main-b c 12. At the same time, providers and criminal justice officials should exercise good judgment. In situations where consent is not required, there is no point in seeking it fromsomeone who is not likely to provide it.Chapter V: Improving Collaboration Policy Statement 25: Sharing Information197 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecttained exclusively for billing purposes. It should be noted that, currently, few databases can be counted on to provide comprehensive information about theindividuals treated in the system. The information usually sought by law en-forcement and jail officials, however, can be obtained by development of alter-native protocols or practices. (See Policy Statement 13: Intake at County / Mu-nicipal Detention Facility.) Ensure that mental health information shared is the minimum needed to address the intended recipient's needs. The nature of information that can be shared may be governed by state statute. In some places it may be limited to diagnosis, admission to or dischargefrom a treatment facility, and the name of any medication prescribed. For manypurposes, this limited information may suffice. On the other hand, there maywell be instances in which more information would be appropriate and helpfulin developing treatment plans for individuals whose needs are not immediatelyapparent or who have complex histories with a bearing on future treatmentdecisions. Ensure that information shared for the purpose of arranging appro- priate treatment not be used to jeopardize a person's rights incriminal proceedings. Information intended to help police or jail officials arrange for appropriate treatment for an individual with mental illness who has been arrested or is incustody may prove harmful if utilized by a prosecutor in criminal proceedings.It is not always in the best interests of an individual for his or her mentalillness diagnosis to be generally known. While mental illness may be an obvi-ous factor in many cases, it may not come to the fore immediately in others. Insuch cases, only the individual (and counsel) should determine whether it isappropriate to bring the fact of mental illness into the case. Encourage consumers to engage in advance planning that includes consent for mental health providers to share specified informationwith criminal justice authorities if necessary. One promising mechanism for allowing a consumer to decide whether and how much information should be divulged is through some form of advanceplanning. Some consumers now write psychiatric advance directives to governd e f198 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecttheir care when they become incompetent or when they are involuntarily hospi- talized. A more practical alternative for mental health/criminal justice part-nerships is a specific form of advance planning relating to any future contactswith the criminal justice system. Individuals who have had previous contactwith the law or individuals whose behaviors put them at significant risk shouldbe offered the opportunity through the mental health system to indicate con-sent for sharing of certain information. Especially important is the sharing ofthe name of their case manager or other provider who, once notified, can followup to ensure appropriate clinical treatment is furnished following the incident. Eliminate any reference to the identity of the person with mental illness when turning over information for research purposes or forsystemic assessments of criminal justice systems. There is no need for information collected and used for the purposes of research or data collected to assess the effectiveness of systems to retain iden-tifying information. Data such as name, address, phone number, birth date,social security number, and other information that clearly points to the specificindividual should be redacted before such databases are compiled or beforemental health system information is shared within criminal justice systems. Ifthe particular analysis to be conducted does require such identifiers, there mustbe procedures in place to keep these confidential and thus they should be strippedfrom the analysis and aggregate reports that are eventually prepared and cir-culated. Criminal justice authorities should share information (with con- sent) with the mental health system in order to facilitate appropri-ate and quick follow-up services from mental health upon release. As recommended elsewhere in this document, correctional facilities should engage inmates in pre-release planning, which should include a discussion ofthe necessity of sharing clinical information with community providers in orderto ensure continuity of care. Consent should then be readily obtainable andeither a detailed summary or a complete clinical record can be transferred tothe appropriate community mental health program. As in other informationsharing situations, information shared should be the minimum necessary forthe purpose at hand. (See Policy Statement 21: Development of Transition Plan.)g hChapter V: Improving Collaboration Policy Statement 25: Sharing Information199 Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project200 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONInstitutionalizing the Partnership POLICY STATEMENT #26 Institutionalize the partnership to ensure it can sustain changes in leadership or personnel. Successful partnerships depend on collabora- tion between individuals. Over time, officials inmental health and criminal justice agencies maydevelop exemplary working relationships that leadto improved collaboration and better service to in-dividuals with mental illness. It is crucial, however,that the leaders of collaborative efforts make an ef-26 fort to institutionalize their partnership, ensuringits longevity beyond their own tenure. The follow-ing recommendations suggest some steps that canbe taken to ensure the endurance of collaborativeefforts between the criminal justice and mentalhealth system partners. Charge an individual with maintaining the vision of the collabora- tive effort and managing on a day-to-day basis communicationamong staff working for each of the various collaborating organi-zations. Interactions among separate organizations\u2014each with its own goals, poli- cies, jargon, and organizational structures\u2014tend to be extremely complicated.Successful collaboration often requires communication between multiple indi-viduals across organizational lines. Many successful partnerships can be tracedto the establishment of a position, sometimes referred to as a \"boundary span-ner\" position, whose responsibility it is to be the traffic cop for the various peopleresponsible for managing this communication on a day-to-day basis. The organization employing the boundary spanner often depends on a va- riety of factors, such as local politics, history, economics, and personalities ineach community. Nevertheless, researchers have found some common aspectsChapter V: Improving Collaboration Policy Statement 26: Institutionalizing the Partnership201 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectof successful boundary spanners. A clear conceptualization of the functions of a boundary spanner position is often more important than the exact location ofthe position. In addition, it is important to find experienced, well-respectedindividuals to staff these positions; these individuals are often veteran stafferswho are familiar with the formal and informal norms of multiple systems. Bound-ary spanners should be well compensated and given a title that appreciates theimportance of their cross-systems work. 13 Example: Court Monitor, Mental Health Court, King County (WA) The court monitor in the King County Mental Health Court serves as the link between the criminal justice and mental health systems. The court monitor first interviewscandidates for the Mental Health Court in an effort to understand the defendant'smental health issues. She then requests approval for the release of information fromthe defendant and communicates with the case manager who handled the defendant'spast treatment. Next, the court monitor prepares a report of the defendant's historyand a proposed treatment plan to the court while explaining the workings of the courtto the defendant. Finally, the court monitor meets with the public defender andprosecutor to discuss the case. 14 Determine how to share responsibility for positive and negative outcomes. Partnerships are often severely tested when the joint initiative draws bad publicity or suffers an unfortunate turn of events. For example, joint venturesare typically dissolved (sometimes appropriately) when a program participantcommits a high-visibility crime. In other cases, a lawsuit involving a personworking on the initiative can threaten the sustainability of a partnership. Partners should establish a plan, in advance, to respond to incidents that attract negative publicity in order to ensure that each does not simply engagein finger-pointing. This plan should include an agreement on how to respond toinquiries from the legislature, other state or local governing bodies, the media,or attorneys representing a plaintiff. Officials working together as part of a collaborative venture should de- velop a similar plan to respond to positive news trumpeting the success of aninitiative. In some cases, failing to share credit or to recognize the value of thepartnership publicly can be as destructive as an uncoordinated response to nega-tive publicity. 13. Henry J.

Documents that describe the nature and scope of collaboration between distinct agencies or organizations can be crucial to solidifying a partnership.Contracts or memoranda of understanding (MOU) also provide a guiding docu-ment to which partners can turn to resolve confusion or disagreement. Thestructure of any such agreement will vary depending on the partners involved,the goal and scope of the collaboration, local policies and regulations, and manyother jurisdiction-specific issues. Despite these necessary variations, certainelements are consistent across such agreements, and criminal justice and men-tal health partners should consider referring to the following list when develop-ing written agreements. Elements of a successful memorandum of understanding: \u0093Well-defined target population \u0093Overarching purpose that underlies the agreement \u0093Discussion of any relevant legislation or regulations \u0093Elaboration of specific goals, both shared and germane to a particular partner \u0093Definition of any new responsibilities \u0093Time lines for the implementation of new initiatives and for review ofthe implementation process \u0093Provision for the resolution of disputescChapter V: Improving Collaboration Policy Statement 26: Institutionalizing the Partnership203 Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project204 Criminal Health Consensus ProjectTraining Practitioners and Policymakers andEducating the CommunityCHAPTER VI The successful implementation of many (if not all) of the policy state- ments in this report depends on criminal justice staff who under- stand mental illness and the mental health system. Similarly, failure by mental health professionals to learn how the criminal justice system works in theirjurisdiction will undermine any efforts to build part- nerships between the criminal justice and mental health communities. While training is not a pana-cea\u2014and even with the best education and guid- ance, criminal justice or mental health personnel may not always know what the best course of ac-tion is\u2014it can significantly improve services to people with mental illness, their families, and the community and reduce the stigma associated withmental illness. For these reasons, training (and cross-system training) must be a part of any com- prehensive effort to improve the response to peoplewith mental illness who come into contact with the criminal justice system.In addition, because the involvement of indi- viduals with mental illness in the criminal justice system is a problem that concerns the community and requires solutions at the local level, it is in-cumbent upon criminal justice and mental health stakeholders to educate the community about the issue. Every organization, at a minimum, should ex- pect the following of any of their employees who come into contact with a person with mental ill-ness: \u0093minimize the risk of injury or harm to the responder, the community, and the personwith mental illness; \u0093respect the individual and the rights of thatperson; \u0093be conscientious of responses most likely toaggravate or improve the condition of theperson; \u0093understand that a person with mental ill-ness is no more likely to be violent than aperson without mental illness (except incases where a mental illness is accompa-nied by a co-occurring disorder); and205 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project\u0093know, at least generally, the mental health resources that are available to them. Familiarizing practitioners with the above is- sues, while a huge accomplishment in and of itself, is usually not sufficient to ensure the successfulimplementation of a program that targets people with mental illness . Whereas every good training program ensures that all staff have a basic famil-iarity with mental illness, agencies differ consider- ably in their efforts to provide staff with the addi- tional expertise needed to implement many of thepolicy statements included in this report. Indeed, many of the policy statements in this report con- template extensive training that goes far beyond thefundamentals described above. For example, a de- fense attorney needs specific skills to represent ef- fectively a client who has a severe mental illnessand who is offered an opportunity to participate in community-based supervision in lieu of incarcera- tion. In some jurisdictions, policymakers insist that all personnel have some elements of a sophisticatedunderstanding of mental illness and appropriate responses. In other agencies, officials identify only a special cadre of staff to receive highly specialized training. In smaller jurisdictions, including mostof those in rural areas, the size of the police agency and jail and court staff is so small that it is more likely that training and experience will be gainedin less structured or specialized formats. The policy statements in this section of the report recognize that approaches to ensuring that staff have a suffi-cient set of skills, background, and general degree of competence must vary accordingly. At the same time, the recommendations for implementation of the policy statements vary ac- cording to the criminal justice audience (i.e., law enforcement, courts, and corrections). For example,sworn staff in large police departments or state prison systems typically are required to participate in extensive annual in-service training programs.On the other hand, training for judges, prosecu- tors, or defense attorneys is less routine; there are fewer opportunities available to incorporate men-tal health issues into existing training programs.206 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectThat said, there remain several common elements of an initiative to im- prove practitioners' skills in responding to people with mental illness. The policy statements are organized according to these elements: \u0093Training goals and objectives \u0093Training curriculum \u0093Trainers \u0093Evaluation of training One theme that is apparent in nearly every training initiative that ad- dresses mental health issues as they relate to the criminal justice system is theneed for practitioners to be educated about the missions, procedures, and poli- cies of the systems with which they collaborate. The mental health treatment system and the various parts of the criminal justice system have different\u2014sometimes even contradictory\u2014goals and methods. For example, treatment providers and parole officers may view very differently a consumer's incom- plete adherence to a treatment plan, such as missing counseling sessions.Whereas many treatment providers view such setbacks as part of the recovery process, a parole officer may view a temporary lapse in treatment as grounds for violation and reincarceration. Cross-training efforts, in which members ofdifferent criminal justice and mental health agencies educate one another about the basic premises and objectives of their various systems, is crucial to helping bridge these gaps that may stifle successful collaboration. When designing and implementing training, agencies should be cognizant of local, state, and federal standards. A curriculum that has been successful in one state may not be effective in another due to different laws, standards, andrequirements. In Oklahoma, for example, police academy training is state-run and individual agencies do not have control over the training mandated for new recruits. Additionally, commitment laws may vary drastically from one state toanother. In Florida, under the Baker Act, only certain facilities are designated for people with mental illness whom officers believe are a danger to themselves or to others. 1 Recognizing the value of training while acknowledging the expense of pro- viding this service, this section of the report suggests in numerous places how jurisdictions can minimize the expense of training by tapping existing resourcesin the community or government. Stakeholders should also recognize the value of informal training, often known as experience exchange. For example, a ride- along program that exposes mental health service providers to the daily experi-ences of a police officer is not costly, except in terms of staff time, but is instru- mental to improving collaboration and trust across systems. The same is true for training programs that allow criminal justice personnel to visit mental healthcrisis centers or community mental health facilities. 1. The Florida Mental Health Act, a comprehensive revi- sion of the state's mental health commitment laws, is widely referred to as the Baker Act, in honor of the bill'ssponsor, State Representative Maxine Baker. The Baker Actwas passed in 1971 and has been amended several times since. In 1996 the act underwent a major reform, which included increased protections for individuals in the com-mitment system, strengthened consent and guardianshipPaying for Training Training, in and of itself, can be an expensive undertaking. Manyagencies or departments alreadyhave extensive training programsin place. Expanding training top-ics to include mental health is-sues (or to improve the thorough-ness with which mental healthissues are addressed) increasesfurther the time staff are not attheir posts or in court. This, inturn, can increase anorganization's overtime costs orrelief factor. There are other ex-penses beyond the staff costs:trainers, training facilities, andwritten materials, to name a few.Despite these costs, many city,county, or state agencies simplycannot afford to refrain furtherfrom training their staff on theseissues. Effective training can havea dramatic impact on the numberof injuries, and deaths, that staffuntrained to respond to a personwith mental illness sustain. Suchincidents generate high costs\u2014both directly (overtime, compen-satory time, lawsuits) and indi-rectly (community trust).Nowhere in the country have suchimpacts of training been toutedas impressively as in Memphis,Tennessee where the policedepartment's pioneering worktraining officers to serve on cri-sis intervention teams reduceddramatically staff injuries and useof lethal force incidents. 2Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the Community207 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectAlthough the discussion in this section of training curricula for various criminal justice and mental health constituencies recommends numerous top- ics that should be included in effective training, it is by no means an exhaustive description. It is important for every community to evaluate its own needs andresources when determining what information should be included to improve the response to people with mental illness who come into contact with the crimi- nal justice system. provisions, and provided for significant record keeping re- garding commitment proceedings.

The goals, development, and administration of a training program will vary considerably depend-ing upon the audience. Across the criminal justiceand mental health systems there are numerous dis-crete training audiences\u2014police officers, correctionsofficers, prosecutors, community members, mentalhealth practitioners, and many more. Even withinthe distinct parts of the criminal justice system, suchas the court, training audiences, and thus goals, willdiffer; training programs for public defenders, pros-ecutors, and judges will all be unique. Training is such a cornerstone for most crimi- nal justice organizations that these agencies typi-27 cally have an individual\u2014or sometimes an entiredivision\u2014responsible for administering the trainingprograms within the agency. Although these offi-cials will play a key role in implementing the recom-mendations described below, it is important that theytap the expertise of mental health experts to developtraining curricula that deals with mental illness.Similarly, officials responsible for training mentalhealth practitioners will need to reach out to crimi-nal justice professionals when preparing trainingmaterials regarding the operation of the criminaljustice system and the delivery of services to peoplewho have been involved with the criminal justice system. Identify the training audience. Criminal justice practitioners have often observed that a generic training program intended for anyone working in the criminal justice system is of little value. For example, when a generic training program discusses people with mental illness in the community, correctional officers are likely to view thematerial as largely irrelevant. Various authorities could prompt a training initiative by singling out a particular segment of personnel in the criminal justice or mental health sys-tems who should develop an improved understanding of issues concerning mental health and the criminal justice system. For example, the chief executive of a department or agency may decide that his or her entire department, or a par-ticular subset of the organization, needs training. A corrections commissioner may choose to require certain staff, such as those responsible for intake mentalChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 27: Deter mining Training Goals and Objectives209 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecthealth screening, to receive more intensive and specialized mental health train- ing, in addition to the pre-service and in-service training provided to all uni- formed staff. In other cases, an internal curriculum development committee may arrive independently at that same decision. In still other jurisdictions, across-system coalition, task force, or some other body that reflects a partner- ship among various stakeholders in the criminal justice and mental health sys- tems may determine that a particular constituency needs training. Small, rural communities, which often do not have the resources to develop and implement training initiatives for one constituency within the criminal jus- tice system, should consider coordinating with neighboring jurisdictions. Forexample, it may be only be feasible to train probation officers in a small rural county if probation officials in neighboring communities agree to include their staff among the trainees and supply resources to make the training possible. Training criminal justice or mental health personnel alone is not suffi- cient to implement many of the recommendations in this report. Indeed, pro- spective training audiences should be expanded to include nontraditional audi-ences; educating consumers, their families, victim advocates, public policymakers, and even the public at large, is essential. For example, family members and friends of people with mental illness should be educated aboutthe type and amount of information they should convey to dispatchers when making a call for police service and how to encourage a loved one who is incar- cerated to seek treatment. Victim advocates need to be in a position to explainsimply but thoughtfully to crime victims the conditions of release imposed on a probationer or parolee with mental illness. Develop a training committee or task force to focus on the issue of people who have mental illness and are involved in the criminaljustice system or at high risk for such involvement. A committee or task force can broaden the knowledge base of the individu- als involved in guiding training for a particular department or system. It also provides a mechanism through which criminal justice agencies and mental healthpractitioners, consumers, family members, and other stakeholders can collabo- rate to educate personnel in various departments. The chief executive of the criminal justice agencies (e.g., police chief execu- tive, sheriff, director of public safety, presiding judge, court administrator, jail administrator, corrections director), whose employees may be the primary tar- get audience for the training, should oversee the formation of the task force, inconsultation with the corresponding mental health authority. This level of in- volvement from top-ranking decision makers conveys to all subordinate staff the importance and value of the training program. It also helps to ensure that,ultimately, the person or division within an agency charged with coordinating training activities will likely be responsible for administering any training ini- tiative that is developed by a cross-system task force. A task force should have diverse membership that includes representa- tives of other criminal justice agencies, departments, state and local mentalb210 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecthealth agencies, and mental health service providers to identify or tap resources (e.g., facilities, training materials, trainers) that might not otherwise be avail- able to the initiative. Given the different situations faced by jurisdictions, the precise number and type of task force members will vary locally. Critical stake-holders for training development can include representatives from law enforce- ment, the judiciary, prosecution, defense, pretrial services, probation, mental health prosecutors, community mental health professionals, substance abusetreatment providers, family members, victim advocates, consumers (especially those who have been incarcerated), and corrections personnel. Example: Forensic Intervention Consortium, Albuquerque (NM) This interagency partnership resolves issues and barriers that people with mental illness face who become, or are at risk of becoming, involved in the criminal justicesystem. The consortium unites consumers, their f amily members, representatives of law enforcement and judicial agencies, treatment providers, advocates, and otherrepresentatives from the community. The consortium supports The Albuquerque Cri-sis Intervention Team (CIT), and CIT members are trained by consumers, family members and mental health professionals on de-escalation techniques, assessingconsumer's history, medication information and support systems, and the use ofpretrial services that are sensitive to consumer needs. Example: Mental Health Task Force, Fort Lauderdale (FL) Established in 1994, this task force brings together community leaders from the crimi- nal justice, mental health, and law enforcement communities to tackle concerns re-garding the treatment, management, and community placements of defendants withmental illness. As a result of the task force's success, a mental health court wasestablished in Broward County, Florida, to address the needs of people with mentalillness. The role of the task force was expanded in 1997 to create five subgroups(consisting of representatives from law enforcement, criminal justice, and mentalhealth) that identify solutions to various obstacles facing people with mental illness inthe criminal justice system. The subgroups' objectives are the integration of commu-nity-based mental health systems into the criminal justice system, and the appropri-ate diversion of consumers from arrest and incarceration. Determine training goals and objectives. Before the training committee can begin developing the training curricu- lum and identifying trainers, members must determine what outcomes theyexpect from the training. For example, the goal may be to implement a particu- lar policy statement in this report, or it may be more general, such as reducing the stigma associated with mental illness or reducing the number of police re-ferrals to detention that could more effectively be diverted to the mental health system. Training goals should be based on improving awareness and develop- ing particular competencies. Specific goals for different training audiences arediscussed in more depth in the subsequent policy statements and recommenda- tions. One goal that should underlie any training initiative is to help criminal justice and mental health personnel better understand the components andmethodologies of the different systems. This is especially important at the out- set of an effort to improve collaboration between the two systems.cChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 27: Deter mining Training Goals and Objectives211 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectEvaluate existing training materials, identify gaps in the curricula, and tap available resources to address these gaps. The coordinators of a training initiative should determine what training materials already exist in agency curricula to address the specified goals andobjectives, where deficiencies exist, and where additional community resources can be brought to bear. Before developing training for their Crisis Intervention Teams, for example, the Montgomery County, Maryland, Police Departmentenlisted the help of NAMI to conduct a needs assessment. The assessment helped the department identify areas in which training was needed and com- munity resources that could assist with that process. Once the agency has identified the gaps in its existing training, the com- mittee should tap all available resources for developing the material. For ex- ample, agencies should solicit training materials from other agencies or pro-grams. Materials that are obtained from other agencies should be tailored to the unique needs of the jurisdiction. Jurisdictions should build on the suc- cesses of others and then, based on their own needs assessment, shape the training. This should all be done in partnership with relevant stakeholders. Example: Roanoke County (VA) Police Department When the Roanoke County Police Department wanted to develop a CIT program, the county sent a sergeant and a mental health practitioner to Albuquerque, New Mexico,to observe their 40-hour training class. The team left with the PowerPoint\u00ae outlineand notes of the Albuquerque training. They presented these materials to the relevantstakeholders in Roanoke and adapted it to the needs of their community. Local colleges and universities often are an excellent resource in develop- ing training programs for criminal justice and mental health personnel. Not only do academic institutions frequently have experience with cross-training strategies, but they also help to minimize the cost of implementing the traininginitiative. In addition, the involvement of academic partners may prompt re- search projects and grant proposals, which can improve knowledge in the field and bring attention to successful training and collaborative endeavors. Substance abuse treatment programs that work with people arrested, de- tained, or incarcerated are likely to have experience developing cross-trainings. Given the three-way overlap among issues of criminal justice, mental health,and substance abuse, involving these programs is likely to greatly enrich the training. Community mental health centers and other local partners, such as board members of local advocacy groups like NAMI and mental health associa-tions, also may be able to donate space for training, training materials, and staff time. Example: Seminole County (FL) Sheriff's Department When it became unfeasible for the Seminole County Sheriff's Department to hold their own 40-hour training course, deputies were sent to the Florida Regional CommunityPolicing Institute to participate in their training on responding to people with mentalillness.d212 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectTraining for Law Enforcement Personnel POLICY STATEMENT # 28 Establish new skills, recruit, in-service, and advanced skills training requirements for law enforcement personnel about responding to in-dividuals with mental illness, and develop curricula accordingly. Training for law enforcement personnel is clas- sified according to the period when training is re- ceived and the depth of the training provided. Thisreport uses the following terms to describe thesedifferent levels of training: \u0093New skills (basic) training. This train- ing is often instituted at the outset of a newdepartmental initiative to ensure that allpersonnel have a basic level of knowledgeconcerning mental illness. It is typicallyprovided when personnel have not receivedany of the training listed below or if a de-partment-wide refresher is warranted. \u0093Recruit (pre-service/academy) train-ing. Training required by police and sher- iffs' departments for new recruits at theacademy. Recruit training includes curriculaon criminal law, defensive tactics, conflictmanagement/crisis intervention training,and many other topics. Content and lengthof training offered varies in each jurisdic-tion depending on state and local guidelines. \u0093In-service training. Annual training re- quired by most jurisdictions of all officers.Training topics can include orientation to theagency's role, purpose, goals, policies, andprocedures; working conditions and regula-28 tions and firearms qualifications; any policies or procedures; and rel-evant legal updates. In-service requirementsdiffer in every state and requirements canchange annually depending on state and/orlocal guidelines. \u0093Advanced skills (specialized) training.Training provided, often to a select group ofstaff, to prepare them to take part in a spe-cial departmental initiative. In the case ofmental illness, advanced training is gener-ally offered to officers who will participateon Crisis Intervention Teams (CITs) or otherspecialized units responding to calls involv-ing mental illness. The following chart describes suggested train- ing topics and suggested hours for different levelsof law enforcement training: 3 3. Many training topics in this chart are relevant for various levels of training. Ac- cordingly, the depth in which these topics are covered will depend on the time and purpose of the training. For example, a topic may be covered briefly in new-skillstraining and covered in more depth during in-service refresher courses. It should be remembered that training curricula for law enforcement personnel should be tailored to be consonant with state and local mandates.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 28: Training for Law Enforcement Personnel213 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectNew Skills Recruit In-service Advanced 2 hours 8-15 hours 20 hours 40 hours A.

There will be differences, however, in the detail provided. Fo r example, in the basic training, participants would be given only an overview of the topic, while the in-service or advanced training would be more in depth.Training Topics for Law Enforcement Personnel*214 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProvide at least two hours of new skills training regarding mental health issues to all law enforcement personnel who come into con-tact with people with mental illness. In every jurisdiction, a lead training official or a training development com- mittee is likely to identify law enforcement personnel who interact regularlywith people with mental illness but have received little or no meaningful train-ing on this subject. These staff, who have already met their recruit trainingrequirements but are not prepared to take refresher courses during in-servicetraining sessions, need new skills training. 4 Recipients of this training should include call takers and dispatchers, front desk personnel, new hires, and patrolofficers, as well as some detectives, drug-enforcement officers or others. De-pending on the size and needs of a particular jurisdiction, it may be necessaryto train additional personnel not covered in these categories, such as communi-cations officers, or other civilian personnel. New skills training should occur at the outset of any new departmental initiative regarding mental illness. The first goal of this training is to teachdepartment personnel and affiliated staff to recognize signs of mental illness sothey can respond accordingly. The purpose of this training is not to enablethese line staff to be diagnosticians; rather, officers and staff should emergefrom this training capable of identifying observable behaviors that might pointto the existence of mental illness. Furthermore, officers should be encouragedto consider how a potential mental illness may have contributed to an incident. The second goal of this training is to teach officers and staff to stabilize and de-escalate the situation, while conveying an attitude of respect for peoplewith mental illness and their families. They must understand relevant stat-utes and how to respond to not escalate the problem while a response is devel-oped. By helping personnel to understand how they may inadvertently uselanguage or take actions that stigmatize mental illness, trainers can also teachpolice personnel to change actions that may previously have been viewed asdisrespectful. To this end, the direct involvement of consumers and family mem-bers in this new skills training will help to emphasize destigmatization as atraining goal as well as the partnership between mental health personnel, ad-vocates, and law enforcement personnel. The importance of partnerships candevelop from the start of an officer's career. (See Policy Statement 33: Identify-ing Trainers, for more on incorporating consumers and family members intotraining initiatives.)aRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION 4. It may be appropriate to provide new skills refresher training even for staff that has received in-service training about mental illness.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 28: Training for Law Enforcement Personnel \"I want the first person who touches me to beeducated.\" JACKI MCKINNEY National People of Colour Consumer/ SurvivorNetwork Source: Panel discussion, meet- ing regarding mental health courtgrant program, March 18, 2002, Chicago, IL215 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project5. Agencies have different minimum educational require- ments for new recruits ranging from a high school diploma, to an associates degree to a bachelors degree. As a result,when developing training for new recruits, educational re-quirements must be taken into consideration. If one agency requires a four-year degree, and another requires very little formal education, the kind/level of training maybe influenced.Third, this orientation to mental health issues for personnel should teach them the importance of getting the right assistance and referrals for those withmental illness and victims of crime. Understanding local resources, their crite-ria for gaining access, and other sources of assistance will be of tremendousbenefit to personnel. Incorporate at least eight (and as many as fifteen) hours of train- ing in general mental health issues into existing recruit (academy-level) training programs for law enforcement staff. Recruit training refers to the fundamentals taught to each new law en- forcement officer (\"recruits\"). Regardless of educational level attained, all newrecruits are required to train in the academy before beginning service at a lawenforcement agency. (The duration of academy training for lateral transferswill vary by state.) Academy-level training should incorporate at least eighthours (and as many as fifteen) of training on general mental health issues.These may be integrated into existing training modules. State mandates for training and existing curricula differ across jurisdictions. Agencies will need totailor training models to their unique needs and requirements. 5 (See chart for suggested training topics.) Given the complex nature of many situations encountered by law enforce- ment officers, recruit training should touch on signs and symptoms of mentalillness, dual diagnosis of mental illness and drug/alcohol abuse, and relatedissues. Again, although recruits cannot and should not be trained as diagnosti-cians, they must be trained to respond to a range of aberrant behavior, regard-less of whether it can be attributed to mental illness, a medical disorder such asepilepsy, drug abuse, or a combination of these factors. (See Policy Statement4: On-Scene Response, for a more thorough discussion of people with co-occur-ring disorders, especially as they relate to law enforcement; also Policy State-ment 37: Co-occurring Disorders.) After finishing academy training, recruits (now considered \"new hires\") are assigned to work with more senior Field Training Officers (FTOs) beforebeginning independent duty. Like all new employees, new officers are extremelyimpressionable. FTOs are responsible for introducing the new officers to agencyculture and priorities. Additionally, the FTO may contribute to the new officer'spatterns of behavior. For these reasons, it is important that among the issuesFTOs review, they understand the recruit mental health training to be able toreinforce topics covered at the academy. To complement pre-service training for recruits, law enforcement agencies should make an effort to acquaint new hires with community members whob216 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecthave mental illness and family members of people with mental illness. Famil- iarity with consumers is of particular importance, as many new officers mayhave had little to no contact with this population. Officers should be encour-aged to visit consumer clubhouses and peer support projects, offer to sit on ACTprogram boards of directors, speak at local mental health group meetings, andparticipate (when invited) in social events where consumers are regularlypresent. Interactions with people who have mental illness who are not in crisiscan put a \"human face\" on mental illness that will challenge myths or miscon-ceptions officers may have. Example: Long Beach (CA) Police Department The Long Beach Police Department requires that all new recruits attend \"Field Con- tacts with People with Mental Illness.\" Through this course, recruits are introduced toconsumers both in the classroom and in mental health facilities. Example: Montgomery County (MD) Police Department The Montgomery County Police Department holds part of its training in the physical space of a public mental health facility to familiarize officers with people with mentalillnesses. Through such training exercises, officers see that people with mental ill- ness do not always exhibit signs of their condition. The officers also come tounderstand the effects of unintentionally stigmatizing people with mental ill-ness, and the impact that an inappropriate response in a situation involvingmental illness can have on a person, a family member, the victim, or the com-munity. Provide to patrol officers at least twenty hours, over a three-year cycle, of in-service training about mental illness that includes in-depth reviews of topics covered generally in recruit training andon additional topics. As discussed at the outset of this policy statement, in-service training re- fers to periodic courses provided to all officers at some interval (e.g., annually,biannually) to expand on previous training or as a refresher. Though some ofthese topics may be addressed in new skills or recruit training, in-service train-ing is an important opportunity to reinforce the department's sensitivity to peoplewith mental illness and to update staff about changes to the department's re-sponse protocols. At least twenty hours of in-service training should be pro-vided over a three-year cycle. In some cases, it may be inappropriate to waituntil such training sessions; in such an event, the updates can be providedduring informational roll calls, integrated into related modules such as thoseon use of force, cultural diversity, or special populations. Stand-alone modulesare preferable, but recognizing the many mandate training topics, an integratedcChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 28: Training for Law Enforcement Personnel217 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmodel that uses some stand-alone modules may be necessary. Issues such as the difference between mental illness and disorders such as epilepsy or autism,cultural and gender differences among individuals with mental illness, andmedication issues may all be suitable topics for in-service training (see chart formore suggested topics). Example: Seattle (WA) Police Department The Seattle Police Department requires all officers to attend a mandatory eight-hour block of instruction to develop an adequate competency level when encounteringcitizens with mental illnesses. Trainers should consider including nontraditional exercises such as hav- ing police officers attempt tasks associated with daily living while being ex-posed to \"voices.\" Training should also include opportunities to meet with con-sumers and their families in the field, at clubhouses, shelters, soup kitchens,and NAMI support parties and meetings, just as is recommended for recruits.In addition, training should provide the chance for law enforcement officers tovisit crisis centers and mental health facilities in order to gain resource aware-ness. Officers should be given ample opportunity to practice de-escalation tech-niques, such as talking to the person with mental illness and waiting out aviolent episode, as well as to run through diversion protocols that relyon contacting community-based mental health services and supports. (See PolicyStatement 3: On-Scene Assessment, for more on de-escalation techniques.) Role-playing exercises are one way to help officers model these behaviors prior tousing them in the field. As a caution, the training facilitator should carefully monitor role-playing exercises. When left unchecked, officers can disengage andnot fully participate in role-play exercises or, at the other extreme, participantscan be become overinvolved to the detriment of the class and ultimately to thedetriment of people with mental illness. Example: Montgomery County (MD) Police Department The Montgomery County Police Department employs an exercise in which officers are required to wear headphones that blare loud music and voices, conveying discon-nected thinking. Officers are asked to go about their routine tasks while wearing theheadphones. The purpose of the activity is to simulate some of the challenges that people with mental illness face. 6 For larger jurisdictions, more sophisticated training technologies may be available, including computer-simulated shoot/don't shoot scenarios or othermedia requiring officers to make split-second decisions involving people withmental illness. In these situations, what the officer chooses to do determineswhat he or she sees next. These methods enhance critical-incident decisionmaking skills and promote compliance with use of force protocols. 6. See www.power2u.org (the National Empowerment Center) for more on the cassette tape series \"Hearing Dis- tressing Voices,\" which employs this training technique.218 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectThis technology could be used in this context so officers can see the results of their decisions in a training environment. Videotapes are useful forrefresher courses or roll-call training, as they usually succeed in getting peopletalking. They can augment discussions and stimulate debate, but they are notthe sole response to training needs. Prepare select law enforcement staff to serve on a special team by providing them with advanced skills training on the fullest rangeof mental health topics every three years. Advanced training courses should typically be at least 40 hours and should be geared toward officers who will serve on special teams that focus on callsinvolving people with mental illness. (See chart for topics.) Consumers and their families, advocates, and mental health care provid- ers should be included extensively in specialized training. Additionally, as spe-cialized training entails more time than in-service training, information pro-vided to the officers should be more in-depth. The Memphis Police Department,Albuquerque Police Department, Montgomery County Police Department,Roanoke Police Department, Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, and Athens-ClarkeCounty Police Department are among those law enforcement agencies that havedeveloped a 40-hour advanced training course. Ideally, class size for advanced training classes should be kept manageable to ensure a facilitator-to-student ratio that allows for total participation. Someagencies may decide that only a special team of officers will receive this train-ing course, while other departments will mandate the advanced training for allofficers. The audience does not affect the information that should be included inan advanced training. Field Training Officers and others engaged in trainingor supervising patrol officers and dispatchers should be required to attend theadvanced training. Advanced skills trainings should include all of the techniques referred to previously, including extended visits to local mental health facilities to learnabout treatments offered and opportunities for computer simulations. As anadditional consideration, an emphasis may be placed on less-than-lethal (LTL)alternatives and on education to destigmatize mental illness and lessen fearshould be provided to enhance shoot/don't shoot decisions.dChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 28: Training for Law Enforcement Personnel219 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectTrain communications personnel (call takers and dispatchers) that work with law enforcement on how to deal with calls that may in-volve mental illness. Communications personnel who work with law enforcement agencies play an important role in an agency's response to people with mental illness. Train-ing communications personnel is not possible for every law enforcement agency,especially where 911 services are under the jurisdiction of the county or largermunicipality. When it is possible, however, law enforcement agencies shouldinvolve call takers and dispatchers in training to enhance law enforcement ser-vice to people with mental illness. Training communications personnel is imperative because the nature of their actions will frame how much information callers provide to them and howcallers perceive the agencies' sensitivity. These personnel also shape the re-sponding officer's state of mind upon arriving at the scene by emphasizing in-formation that can increase or decrease officer fear or other preconceptions.The questions call takers ask and the information relayed by dispatchers en-sure that responders have access to all possible information so that they areaware of disposition options. The responding officer can direct citizens to properservices, treat them effectively and with dignity, and de-escalate situations. Example: Houston (TX) Police Department The Houston Police Department credits the training of dispatch and communications staff as a key to their success in working with people with mental illness. Personnelwere trained to ask necessary questions in a timely and appropriate manner. The goalof this training is to ensure that responding officers are provided with as muchinformation as possiblee220 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project Training for Court Personnel POLICY STATEMENT #29 Provide adequate training for court officials (including prosecutors and defense attorneys) about appropriate responses to criminal de-fendants who have a mental illness. Successful implementation of the policy state- ments described in Chapter 3: Pretrial Issues, Ad-judication, and Sentencing depends in part uponprosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges who arefamiliar with mental illness, the mental health sys-tem, and the type of information they need to makeinformed decisions on behalf of their clients, on be-half of the state, or in the interests of justice. Edu-cational opportunities regarding mental health andthe law have traditionally tended to focus on caselaw addressing scenarios, such as the not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity plea or other issues regardingcompetency. As a result, new attorneys only rarelyare well familiar with mental health and the law.Of those attorneys who have established an under-standing of the issue through law school, few haveany practical preparation to defend or prosecute\u2014or assist the court with\u2014a typical criminal case in-volving a person with mental illness. The result isthat most criminal lawyers learn about how best toproceed with a case that involves a person with amental illness through discussions with colleaguesand case-by-case research\u2014essentially on-the-jobtraining. While in many instances this can be ad-29 equate for preparing the lawyer to handle an indi-vidual case, consistent with practices in his or herjurisdiction, the lawyer may be woefully unawareof current findings concerning issues unique to pro-cessing such cases. Given this situation, the recom-mendations under this policy statement review avariety of ways for court-related officials to developknowledge and skills that would improve their re-sponse to people with mental illness who are in-volved in the court system. Training for court personnel should include the following topics: \u0093signs and symptoms of mental illness \u0093stigma associated with mental illness \u0093prevalence of substance abuse among indi- viduals with mental illness and the effectsof substance abuse on mental illness \u0093gender and cultural differences amongpeople with mental illness and the poten-tial impact on criminal case processing \u0093the mental health system and available com-munity resources \u0093privacy rights and regulations relevant tomental illnessChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 29: Training for Court Personnel221 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project7. ABA, Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards, Stan- dard 7-1.3.aRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION Incorporate into continuing judicial education programs classes about mental illness and the participation of mental health profes-sionals in the criminal process. 7 Judges who are able to recognize the symptoms of mental illness and un- derstand the treatments and services available in the mental health systemwill be better equipped to deal with defendants with mental illness. It is impor-tant that support for such judicial education come from the jurisdiction's high-est appellate tribunal or its judicial supervisory authority with responsibilityfor continuing judicial education. Judges should also be aware of the preva-lence and interaction of co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disor-ders. This can be accomplished through direct training for judicial officers, orby identifying court liaisons available to court officers when individuals withmental illness are before the court. Example: Course on Co-Occurring Disorders, The National Judicial College The National Judicial College has a course that helps judges become better informed about co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disorders. The course isintended to help judges recognize the signs of a substance abuse or mental healthdisorder, select the appropriate judicial strategies for the treatment and monitoring ofsuch individuals, and design a plan for the implementation of systems or ideas toaddress co-occurring disorders in their own jurisdiction. Example: Mental Health Liaison, Texas Judicial System The state of Texas has created a mental health liaison to provide technical assistance to judges and attorneys in the pretrial and presentence phases. The state is alsodeveloping a bench manual for judges, which provides guidelines on sentencing andalternatives. A separate section of this manual will deal specifically with personswith mental illness. Provide training for defense attorneys and prosecutors regarding defendants with mental illness. It is crucial for defense attorneys and prosecutors to develop a basic under- standing of mental illness and the mental health system. Training topics caninclude information about the major mental illnesses, the high potential forrecovery with proper diagnoses and treatment, and the prevalence and effectsof substance abuse among individuals with mental illness (especially those in-volved in the criminal justice system). 8 In addition, prosecutors and defense 8.

STEVEN LEIFMAN Associate AdministrativeJudge, Miami-Dade County Court, Criminal Division, FL Source: Psychiatric News May 3, 2002 Volume 37 Number 9, p. 8. 2002 American PsychiatricAssociation p. 8222 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectattorneys should be trained to understand how mental illness can be a contrib- uting factor to criminal behavior. Some courts (such as Washington State's King County Mental Health Court) that focus exclusively on cases involving mental illness have used the expertiseof mental health partners to help defense attorneys and prosecutors developthis awareness. Mental health service providers can offer brief in-service train-ing sessions about different diagnoses, medications, service needs, and the com-ponents and contours of the mental health system. These sessions also canprovide an excellent opportunity for court personnel to educate personnel fromthe mental health system on the functions, concerns, and procedures of thecourts. Successful collaboration depends on criminal justice and mental healthpartners who understand each other's missions and methodologies. Prosecutors who are interested in pursuing alternatives to incarceration for defendants with mental illness should have a comprehensive understand-ing of the mental health treatment opportunities in their community. Again,this goal can best be pursued through collaborative cross-training with localmental health providers. The goal here is not just to develop awareness forprosecutors but to help representatives of both systems understand the needsand concerns of their counterparts. The primary goal of defense attorneys\u2014protecting the best interests of their clients\u2014similarly requires that counsel should have a base of knowledgeabout mental illness as well as an up-to-date understanding of the types ofmental health services available in the community, their individual require-ments, and their experience working in the justice system. It may be especiallyhelpful to have consumers and family members participate in these trainingsto help assist defense attorneys in understanding the concerns of defendantswho have mental illness. 9 Defense attorneys who will be specializing in cases involving defendants with mental illness, such as commitment hearings, shouldreceive more in-depth training. Example: Mental Health Litigation Unit, Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services The Mental Health Litigation Unit (MHLU) of the Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services provides training for defense attorneys who represent individualswith mental illness in civil and criminal cases. The MHLU offers a mandatory two-part training program for attorneys in Massachusetts who wish to accept assignmentsin mental health proceedings (e.g., civil commitment cases, involuntary treatmentcases). The first part of the training offers a comprehensive two-day review ofmental health law and procedural rules applicable in mental health proceedings, withan emphasis on litigation technique and strategy. The day-long second part of thetraining also provides an overview of the diagnoses and treatment of mental illness,emphasizing the issues typically raised in mental health proceedings (e.g., the predic- 9. Derek Denckla and Greg Berman, Rethinking the Re- volving Door: A Look at Mental Illness in the Courts, Center for Court Innovation, 2001. Available at www.courtinnovation.org/pdf/mental_health.pdf .Interviews with defendants with mental illness in this \"think piece\" demonstrate the distance between the client's and defense attorney's understanding of the client's bestinterests. In these interviews, some defendants suggestedChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 29: Training for Court Personnel223 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectthat defense attorneys who better understood mental illness would try to help their clients obtain treatment as opposed to encouraging a guilty plea\u2014the avenue to minimizing theclient's short term involvement with the criminal justice system.tion of dangerousness, medication). The MHLU also offers training on mental health issues to public defenders and private attorneys who will be appointed in criminalproceedings. Train pretrial services and probation personnel to recognize symp- toms of mental illness and to respond appropriately. There are two critical points in the criminal justice process where deci- sions as to an arrestee's interests are at stake: at the initial appearance beforea judicial officer when the decision as to release or detention is made, and atsentencing, when the judicial officer decides for those convicted of a crimewhether the offender should be incarcerated or supervised in the communityfor his conviction. In both instances the judicial officer has available a neutralagency, whose role is to provide the decision maker with all information aboutthe individual that is relevant to the decision. For the pretrial release decisionthe agency\u2014pretrial services\u2014identifies and provides all information that mightbe indicative of the arrestee's likelihood to return to court as required and re-main arrest free pending disposition. For the sentencing decision, the assistingagency\u2014probation\u2014looks more broadly at the issues of rehabilitation, punish-ment, deterrence, and other legitimate concerns. In both instances it is criticalthat the officers be sensitive to the possibility that the arrestee suffers frommental illness. It is not suggested that either agency attempt to become mentalhealth diagnosticians; rather, both should be adequately trained to be able torefer (or recommend that a judge refer) people who may suffer from mentalillness to trained mental health clinicians for a complete mental health assess-ment. Furthermore, both agencies should be trained on confidentiality issues\u2014the importance of obtaining consent for the release of mental health informa-tion, when and to whom information can be released, and the principle ofconveying the least information necessary. Example: Handbook and Training for Working with Mentally Disordered Defendants, Federal Judicial Center The Federal Judicial Center, the research and education agency of the federal judicial system, has developed a handbook and training program for federal probation andpretrial service officers regarding working with individuals with mental illness. Thehandbook and training program cover a variety of issues, including basic informationabout different mental disorders and treatments; a discussion of how to identify thepotential that an individual may have a mental health disorder or co-occurring sub- stance abuse disorders; and supervision issues that may arise for individuals with amental illness, such as issues of treatment, safety, and the potential for suicide.cHiring Staff with Mental Health Expertise Since developing initiatives that address the issue of clients withmental illness, a number of courtofficials have hired staff with abackground in mental health.These individuals may serve inpretrial positions, as probationofficers, or as boundary spannersbetween the courts and mentalhealth systems. Similarly, pros-ecutors and public defenders haveenhanced their offices' capacity towork on cases involving mentalillness by hiring social workers orother professionals with someexpertise in mental health. Whilesuch staff may require training re-garding court-related processes,their familiarity with clients withmental illness and the mentalhealth system can make them avaluable asset to many court-based programs. For example,pretrial service programs inBernalillo County, New Mexico,and Hamilton County, Ohio, em-ploy staff with a mental healthbackground, as does the KingCounty, Washington, MentalHealth Court.224 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Pretrial Services Training, Hamilton County (OH) The Hamilton County Pretrial Services Program offers training for staff on a variety of issues surrounding clients with mental illness. Staff members receive basic trainingon the variety of mental illness diagnoses, medications, symptoms, and co-occurringdisorders. In addition, pretrial staff member s receive training on interview tech- niques, referral procedures, and confidentiality regulations. The program providesboth in-service trainings and outside training opportunities offered through a combi-nation of in-house staff, independent contractors and workshops, and county-offeredclasses. Offer advanced courses on mental health law and participation by mental health professionals in the criminal process for studentswho desire to concentrate on criminal law practice. 10 The American Bar Association (ABA) recommends that education about mental illness be incorporated into law school curricula. There are a variety oflegal education topics relevant to mental illness that are appropriate for lawschool classes, including mental health law, disability law, confidentiality rights,civil commitment proceedings, treatment rights, competency proceedings, amongmany others. Some of these topics are already covered widely in law schoolcourses around the country. Some law schools, such as Virginia, Arizona, Ne-braska, and Villanova have taken a focused look at mental health and legalissues. Example: University of Virginia Institute of Law, Psychiatry, and Public Policy The Institute of Law, Psychiatry, and Public Policy is an interdisciplinary program in mental health law, forensic psychiatry, and forensic psychology. The institute offersacademic offerings on a wide array of topics in mental health law, including ethicalissues in mental health services, the interaction between psychological science andlaw, civil commitment proceedings, and many others. The institute also providestraining for medical students on relevant criminal justice issues. Develop and conduct programs for which continuing legal educa- tion (CLE) credit can be provided that offer advanced instructionon mental health law and participation by mental health profes-sionals in the criminal process. 11 Continuing legal education provides an opportunity for attorneys to im- prove their knowledge and skills regarding mental health issues. The Ameri-can Bar Association standards suggest that \"bar associations, law schools, andother organizations having responsibility for providing continuing legal educa-ed 10. ABA, Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards , Standard 7-1.3.11. Ibid.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 29: Training for Court Personnel225 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecttion\" incorporate programs about mental health law and participation by men- tal health professionals in the criminal process into their curricula. Further-more, the ABA recommends that prosecutors, public defenders, and other attor-neys who specialize in criminal law should participate in these programs.Continuing legal education for defense attorneys and prosecutors can includebasic information about mental illness (e.g., diagnoses, symptoms, treatment)as well as more specific material concerning mental health in the courts, suchas different dispositional options, appropriate charging, and proper informa-tion sharing procedures. To encourage the development of and participation in programs concern- ing mental illness and the courts, some state bar associations have made edu-cation about mental illness part of the CLE requirements. This designationcan help raise awareness about the importance of this type of education, butrequires the development of curricula and educational opportunities to ensurethat lawyers have the opportunity to become educated about this importantissue. Any organization providing or coordinating training programs concern-ing mental health and legal issues should make sure to obtain CLE certifica-tion, or credit toward professional certification, from the appropriate agencywithin the jurisdiction. This will provide added incentive for lawyers and othercourt personnel to take advantage of these training opportunities. Example: Continuing Legal Education Requirements, Florida Bar In February 2001, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously approved an amendment to the Continuing Legal Education (CLE) Requirements of the Florida Bar to includeeducation on mental illness among the mandatory categories of continuing legaleducation. Florida Bar members are required to undergo 30 hours of CLE every threeyears, five hours of which must be in one of four mandatory categories (profession-alism, ethics, substance abuse, and, now, mental illness).226 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel aRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONTraining for Corrections Personnel POLICY STATEMENT # 30 Train corrections staff to recognize symptoms of mental illness and to respond appropriately to people with mental illness. As is the case with law enforcement executives, corrections administrators place a premium ontrained staff. In addition, like those in policing or-ganizations, training efforts in corrections agenciestypically fall into one of four categories: new skills(basic), pre-service (academy), in-service, and ad-vanced. (See Policy Statement 28: Training for Law30 Enforcement Personnel, for brief definitions of thedifferent levels of training.) At the county level,however\u2014especially in small jurisdictions\u2014correc-tional staff may receive minimal pre-service train-ing, and the level of in-service training varies widelyacross different jurisdictions. Provide basic training regarding mental health issues to all cor- rections staff who come into contact with detainees or inmateswith mental illness. There are some staff in some prisons or jails who, despite being in regular contact with inmates with mental illness, have received little or no meaningfultraining regarding mental health issues. These personnel may be uniformedsecurity staff who received academy training but are not prepared for in-ser-vice refresher training on mental illness. This audience may also be programstaff, such as case managers, teachers, or vocational counselors, who did notattend an academy and may have received minimal pre-service training. What-ever their background, any corrections personnel who have regular interactionwith inmates with mental illness should receive basic training on how to betterserve those inmates.227 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectBasic training for corrections personnel should be geared toward the fol- lowing goals: \u0093improve staff 's ability to identify inmates with possible mental health issues; \u0093enable staff to understand when to refer an inmate for a mental healthscreening and/or assessment; \u0093teach staff to recognize symptoms of an adverse reaction to psychotro-pic medication; \u0093provide basic information on issues related to co-occurring substanceabuse and mental illness; \u0093reduce stigmatization of inmates with mental illness by sensitizing cor-rections staff to the unique needs of these individuals; \u0093assist correctional staff in recognizing cultural factors that may influ-ence their awareness of signs and symptoms of mental illness; and \u0093improve the ability of corrections officers to communicate facility proce-dures/rules to inmates with mental illness. Many states have established policies that require basic mental health services training. Example: Virginia Department of Corrections The Virginia DOC has established a comprehensive training program to train both institutional (security and nonsecurity) staff and clinical staff. The Department hasengaged a full-time mental health training coordinator who is stationed at the DOC'sAcademy for Staff Development. Training of correctional mental health staff should include experiential, in-service activities in addition to didactic, classroom instruction. For example,the Oregon Department of Corrections trains mental health staff on the hous-ing units directly alongside the correctional officers. In developing trainingprograms regarding mental illness for corrections staff it can be especially helpfulto collaborate with personnel from state mental health agencies, community-based mental health providers, or other professionals with mental health ex-pertise. Example: Training Video, New York State Department of Corrections, New York State Office of Mental Health In New York State, the commissioner of the Department of Corrections reached out to the commissioner of the Office of Mental Health to request collaboration and expertassistance in producing a training video on managing inmates with mental illness.The video is designed for use in the corr ections pre-service training academy as well as for in-service training purposes for those already through the academy.Educating Inmates About Mental Illness Some jurisdictions, such as the New York City Department of Cor-rections, provide training regard-ing mental health issues for in-mates, too. Although this trainingis somewhat controversial, itsgoals are laudable. Inmates whoreceive a basic orientation to men-tal health issues and the issuesinvolved in responding to theneeds of offenders with mentalillness can provide assistance tostaff in observing or identifyingother inmates in need of mentalhealth services\u2014often beforestaff become aware of the needsof those inmates.228 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIncorporate competency-based training in mental health issues in existing academy (pre-service) training programs and in-serviceprograms for corrections staff. Training academies and pre-service training programs offer an opportu- nity to begin sensitizing corrections staff to issues regarding mental illness.This training should focus on the development of competencies. Though a num-ber of hours may be designated for academy training on mental health issues, itis critical that the measure of training success be improvements in the trainees'knowledge and abilities. Suggested topics for academy training include thefollowing: Basic issues concerning mental illness \u0093signs and symptoms of mental illness \u0093attitudes about mental illness (e.g., stigma) \u0093understanding and assessing mental illnesses \u0093the relationship between violence and mental illness \u0093dual diagnoses: substance abuse and mental illness \u0093developmental disorders \u0093homelessness and mental illnesses Management of inmates with mental illness \u0093de-escalation techniques \u0093officer safety \u0093calming approach methods \u0093interviewing techniques \u0093medications: noncompliance; side effects \u0093internal services and referral procedures \u0093suicide prevention Administrative issues \u0093civil rights, including privacy rights \u0093confidentiality \u0093victims with mental illness \u0093available community resources \u0093cultural \u0093consumer and family perspectives Example: Pre-service and In-service training, Connecticut Department of Corrections The Connecticut Department of Corrections (DOC) offers pre-service and in-service training to corrections officers on how to work with inmates with special needs,bChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel229 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectincluding those with mental illness. This training addresses a number of issues, including legal requirements regarding confidentiality, symptoms of different mentalillnesses, collaboration with correctional mental health staff, and suicide prevention,among other topics. Correctional mental health staff, who are employed by Correc-tional Managed Health Care, receive training facilitated by both psychiatric profes-sionals and corrections officers. Example: Correction Officer Training, New York State Department of Corrections The New York State Department of Corrections (DOCS) Training Academy has teamed with the Capital District Psychiatric Center (CDPC) Mental Health Players to developan enhanced pr e-service tr aining curriculum concerning mental health issues. The full-day training emphasizes hands-on experience in dealing with inmates with men-tal illness. The morning session provides bac kground informa tion on types of mental health issues encountered most often in correctional facilities, including suicide pre-vention. The afternoon module is unique in that volunteers from the CDPC MentalHealth Players role play inmates experiencing mental health problems, providing cor-rection officer candidates a chance to practice communication skills in a \"real-world\"setting. Feedback from training academy staff and candidates has been overwhelm-ingly positive. Provide advanced training to corrections staff assigned to work specifically with inmates with mental illness. Corrections staff who are assigned to work specifically on units with in- mates at high risk of mental illness (e.g., special housing units, administrativesegregation) and/or already diagnosed with mental illness (e.g., psychiatric in-tensive care units) should receive intensive training in mental health issuesand management of inmates with mental illness. In Florida, state law requiresthat corrections officers employed by a mental health treatment facility receivespecialized training beyond that required for basic certification. It is importantto tap the expertise of professional mental health crisis workers when offeringspecialized training, especially in dealing with de-escalation techniques, re-straints, and lethal force. Provide parole board members with training in order to inform them about issues regarding the release of people with mentalillness from prison. Parole board members come from a variety of backgrounds and areas of expertise. Some may have experience that helps them understand people withmental illness, but most do not. The stigma of mental illness, especially thecommon association between mental illness and violence, may cause parole boardmembers to be wary of offering parole to offenders with mental illness (seec d230 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectPolicy Statement 20: Release Decision). Training can enhance parole board members' understanding of the complex issues presented by this offender group,and enable them to make informed decisions regarding parole candidates. Example: New Board Member Training, National Parole Board, Canada The National Parole Board in Canada offers extensive training about mental illness to new board members. Of the 15 days of total training required of new board mem-bers, two of the days are devoted to mental health issues. The board relies on twogeneral reference documents\u2014the Diagnostic Manual for Mental Disorder s and the Historical, Clinical and Risk Guide for Violent Offenders with Mental Illness \u2014and one internal risk-assessment manual, which has a chapter on mental illness. The paroleboard is also developing an even more in-depth guide for board members on dealingwith offenders with mental illness. Training curricula should be developed and, depending on the jurisdiction, tailored for individuals appointed to serve as parole board members, both fornew appointees as well as on an annual or ongoing basis. Parole board mem-bers should have a fundamental understanding about the nature and types ofmental illness and how mental illness is diagnosed and treated. They shouldalso be provided with training about the risks and needs associated with men-tal illness and the types of treatment, resources, and support services that canmitigate that risk. There is also opportunity in this context to provide cross-training, which would include training for mental health personnel about a jurisdiction's crimi-nal justice system as well as its public safety issues, needs, and processes. Inmany jurisdictions, these two systems, while having a significant shared popu-lation, have operated substantially apart from each other. Only in recent yearshave these barriers begun to break down. Cross-training is one opportunity todevelop shared understanding about the potentially competing criminal justiceand treatment needs of the offender who has a mental illness. Example: Cross Training, Massachusetts Parole Board, Massachusetts Department of Mental Health In 1998, the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (DMH), The Massachusetts Parole Board, and the Department of Corrections developed a broad agreement tostrengthen the delivery of mental health services to individuals with mental illnessincarcerated in state correctional institutions or eligible for parole. Cross-training between the DMH and the parole board provided background on new policies andprocedures developed as part of the agreement and helped staff from the differentagencies better understand the roles of their colleagues. Regional groups engaged inroundtable discussions to develop specific goals and strategies for realizing the ob-jective of improved service to inmates with mental illness. DMH staff has alsooffered training to senior parole officers in support of the collaborative agreement.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 30: Training for Corrections Personnel231 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProvide training for parole officers to improve their ability to su- pervise parolees with mental illness. Parole officers have a varying degree of exposure to people with mental illness. Parole officers with typical caseloads will undoubtedly encounter someclients with mental illness. These parole officers need basic training on how tobest serve these clients. This training should cover topics similar to those dealtwith in the basic training offered to corrections personnel discussed above. Inaddition, parole officers need training on the availability of community mentalhealth resources, intervention services, alternatives to revocation, sensitivityto victims, and updates on the changes in mental health treatment law. Paroleofficers should be able to recognize when a person with mental illness is decom-pensating and when a person with mental illness is not complying with condi-tions of release because of an inability to obtain access to effective treatment. It is especially important to reconcile the different missions of community corrections agencies and mental health service providers. Most mental healthand substance abuse treatment providers view relapse and setbacks in treat-ment as part of the recovery process. Parole requires offenders to follow certainrelease conditions or risk violation and reincarceration. These two outlookscan conflict when mental health (or substance abuse) treatment is part of aparolee's release conditions. Cross-training between parole officers and mentalhealth providers, consumers, and family members can be effective in synthesiz-ing the goals of parole and mental health treatment. Some parole officers have caseloads dedicated to parolees with mental illness. Because the primary focus of these parole officers is to supervise parol-ees with mental illness, it is appropriate to provide more in-depth training onmental health issues. Parolees who work with a dedicated mental healthcaseload will likely be collaborating frequently with mental health service pro-viders. It is crucial that these providers work together to understand eachother's roles in supporting an offender's reintegration into the community.e232 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectTraining for Mental Health Professionals POLICY STATEMENT # 31 Develop training programs for mental health professionals who work with the criminal justice system. Just as staff in the criminal justice system rec- ognize the need to learn new skills that will allowthem to provide appropriate care for people withmental illness with whom they have contact, thosewho work in the mental health field must developawareness of the special needs of people with men-tal illness who have been arrested and/or incarcer-ated. If they are to help people with mental illnesswho have criminal histories to live in the commu-nity at large, mental health staff must understandthe implications of those histories as well as theimprint arrest and incarceration may leave on aperson. They also must understand the criminal jus-tice system itself so that they can interact produc-tively with their counterparts in that system. Criminal justice agencies and community men- tal health programs have different traditions, mis-sions, and often even different values. Their staffhave typically been trained very differently. Oneway of looking at these differences is to think of themas different cultures. In order to achieve successfulcollaboration and integration of resources, staff fromboth arenas will need to understand their culturaldifferences as well as appreciate their overlappingmissions.31 An analogous situation arose when substance abuse treatment began to increase in jails and pris-ons. What was discovered at that time was thatcross-training was necessary for solid collaborationand integration of services. Cross-training here sim-ply means that each staff train the other, so thatcriminal justice personnel learn more about mentalhealth and mental health staff learn more aboutcriminal justice in a combined learning environment. Training topics for mental health providers and administrators include the following: Training about law enforcement \u0093the public safety responsibilities of law en- forcement officers \u0093police protocols for the use of force \u0093responsibilities of first and backup respond-ers \u0093officers ' expectations of community providers \u0093familiarity with law enforcement officers and officials \u0093the booking process Training about the court \u0093general court procedures \u0093information sharing in the court settingChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 31: Training for Mental Health Professionals233 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION\u0093responsibilities of prosecutors, court admin- istrators, defense attorneys, and judges \u0093conditional release programs and their ad-ministration in the jurisdiction Training about corrections agencies \u0093jail classification procedures \u0093jail personnel and the jail environment \u0093correctional procedures, including intake and classification \u0093scope of behavioral health services availablein prison \u0093correctional medical staff and facilities \u0093corrections release planning staff and pro-cedures \u0093community corrections (e.g. probation, pa-role) procedures and protocols\u0093familiarity with the rules of Medicaid, SSI,SSDI, TANF, and other benefit programs forthose who are incarcerated in jail or prison Training about working with consumers who have been involved with, or are atrisk of being involved with, the criminaljustice system \u0093advance directives \u0093the effects of correctional incarceration on mental illness \u0093obstacles faced by individuals who have beenincarcerated \u0093ensuring the safety of the provider and con-sumer \u0093cultural competency \u0093housing options in the community for peoplewith mental illness Work with university and other mental health professional trainingprograms to enhance their curricula on the criminal justice system. Training programs for mental health professionals around the country are slowly changing their curricula to address working with a criminal justice sys-tem population. Training in this area has several purposes. By enabling men-tal health staff to use and understand terminology common in the criminaljustice system, the training would allow them to work more effectively withstaff in that system. Training also could have a more clinical orientation, help-ing mental health staff to better understand the complex needs of people withmental illness who are in contact with the criminal justice system. Dependingon the approach of the program, topics to be addressed might include every-thing from the basics of criminal law and the criminal justice system to apply-ing relapse prevention techniques to criminal thinking. With law schools and criminology programs adding courses on mental ill- ness, mental health practitioners may also wish to enroll in them for the pur-pose of better understanding the criminal justice system's orientation. Thiswould be especially true in areas or settings where criminal justice issues havenot yet penetrated professional mental health training programs. (See PolicyStatement 29: Training for Court Personnel, for more on law school and con-tinuing legal education classes regarding mental illness.)234 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectDevelop in-service curricula for mental health staff that address obstacles to working with criminal justice clients. In-service training is likely to be of more use to mental health staff already working in the field. In many mental health agencies, training in a number ofclinical and nonclinical areas is already frequently scheduled. Adding trainingin criminal justice issues will generally not pose great logistical difficulty. This in-service training would have several purposes. It would provide current information to mental health staff about provisions in the criminal jus-tice system for treatment of people with mental illness. It would allow mentalhealth and criminal justice personnel to build and enhance relationships. Andit would provide a forum for problem areas to be identified, potentially leadingto plans for subsequent training. In-service training also could provide opportunities for mental health staff to learn from clients themselves and their families about the challenges theyface when reentering the community after time in jail or prison\u2014or even afteran arrest with no time having been served. People with mental illness whohave criminal justice histories often find they face an additional stigma. Train-ing that involves mental health staff and clients with histories of criminal jus-tice involvement can provide opportunities to address this stigma and the dis-crimination faced by many such clients. Example: Transitions Training, New York State Office of Mental Health The New York State Office of Mental Health has developed a training program for mental health agency administrators and supervisors to help them better serve indi-viduals with mental illness who have been incarcerated in state prison. The trainingprogram addresses coordination with parole staff as well as the stigma attached toinvolvement in the criminal justice system. The training is delivered by mental healthconsumers who have experienced the struggles of incarceration in state prison andrelease back into the community. A mental health advocacy group provides con-sumer-trainers with support. Example: Connecticut Jail Diversion Project Mental health clinicians in Connecticut's Jail Diversion Project receive periodic in- service training about the missions and procedures of the different criminal justiceagencies with which they collaborate. Representatives from the Department of Cor-rections, the State's Attorney's office and the Public Defender's office (among others)participate in the training and discuss case scenarios with the clinicians. The clini-cians learn how to maintain the integrity of their role as treatment professionals whileoperating in the criminal justice system.bChapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 31: Training for Mental Health Professionals235 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project236 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONEducating the Community and Building Community Awareness POLICY STATEMENT # 32: Educate the community about mental illness, the value of mental health services, and appropriate responses when people with mentalillness who come into contact with the criminal justice system.32 Educate community members about mental illness to help combatstigma and improve the community's understanding of mentalhealth as a community issue. Despite the prevalence of mental illness and the cost to taxpayers of inad- equate mental health treatment, communities have not made access to effec-tive mental health service a priority. Furthermore, when a person with mentalillness is involved with the criminal justice system, the public typically assumes,incorrectly, that the person is inherently violent and cannot function in thecommunity. Indeed, the Surgeon General's recent report on mental health argues that the stigma around mental illness is one of the most significant challenges to thedevelopment of effective mental health policy. 12 This stigma has intensified over recent decades, despite the advancement of scientific knowledge about thecauses of mental illness and the effectiveness of certain treatments; studiesshow that a greater portion of people associated mental illness with violence inthe 1990s than the general public did in the 1950s. 13 Combating the stigma surrounding mental illness and enlisting broad-based support for improvements to mental health policy requires education. Untilthe general public comes to understand mental illness as a disease similar tophysical illnesses, public support for improved mental health services is un- 12.

Police departments have done similar community outreach to improve their service to individuals with hear- ing impairments. See Christine Stolba and Marci Sliman,Policing the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Populations, Cul-tural Diversity and the Police. Available at: www.policylab.org/deaf.pdf.likely to increase. To this end, California's Little Hoover Commission's report Being There suggests the formation of a statewide commission on mental health advocacy to build public support for adequate mental health services. Chang-ing public opinion about mental illness is a difficult task, but one for which thecriminal justice system can be an extremely effective partner. Criminal justicepersonnel are charged with ensuring public safety. They have, therefore, asingular credibility advocating for improved community-based mental healthservices and dispelling notions that people with mental illness in the commu-nity compromise public safety. Criminal justice officials, who deal with theinflux of individuals with mental illness into their system on a daily basis, canhelp the public and policymakers become aware of the need to improve commu-nity-based mental health services. Example: Commission on the Status of Mental Health of Iowa's Correc- tions Population The Community Corrections Improvement Association, the private foundation arm of the Iowa Sixth Judicial District Department of Correctional Services, formed the Com-mission on the Status of Mental Health of Iowa's Corrections Population to provide aforum for public discussion about issues at the intersection of mental health andcriminal justice. During November 2001, the commission held a series of eight publichearings, supported by a panel of experts, across the state of Iowa to consider theissues from a local level. The commission also administered a survey to assesspublic attitudes and knowledge, developed a video and media relations campaign, andplanned a conference to raise awareness about mental health and criminal justiceissues. Educate consumers, family members, friends, and advocates for people with mental illness about the processes and procedures ofthe criminal justice system. Consumers and their loved ones often want to cooperate with the criminal justice system\u2014or seek the assistance of officials in the criminal justice sys-tem\u2014but lack the knowledge to successfully interact with representatives ofthe various criminal justice agencies. Criminal justice agencies can improveconsumer awareness and initiate positive relationships through communityoutreach programs. Such programs can be important preventative tools, whichimprove the safety of both criminal justice personnel and consumers duringfuture interactions. 14 Similarly, consumers and families who know whom to call and what to ask for are much more likely to have their needs met at theoutset, which will make these interactions less frustrating for both parties.b238 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Chapel Hill (NC) Police Department The Chapel Hill Police Department conducts community trainings in conjunction with NAMI and the local clubhouse (an organization that provides support services through a self-help community-based center) to educate family members as to their rights andresponsibilities when in contact with the police department. These interactions havealso helped increase the level of trust between the community and the police depart-ment. When a person with mental illness becomes involved in the criminal jus- tice system, his or her family, friends, mental health service providers, andother advocates may want to help in a variety of ways. Family members maywant to inform the defense attorney about the defendant's mental health his-tory, to advocate for the defendant's placement in a particular treatment pro-gram, or generally to help their loved one navigate the criminal justice system.Advocates in some communities have developed resources for such situations. Example: When a Person with Mental Illness is Arrested: How to Help, A New York City Handbook for Family, Friends, Peer Advocates, and Commu- nity Mental Health Workers Staff at the Urban Justice Center's Mental Health Project developed a practical hand- book for supporters of people with mental illness who have become involved in thecriminal justice system. The handbook provides general information about the crimi-nal justice process (arrest, arraignment, meeting with counsel), relevant statutes andadvice for advocates on working with defense attorneys, as well as information spe-cific to the New York City criminal justice system. Example: Mental Health Services for Mentally Ill Persons in Jail - A Manual for Families and Professionals Including Jail Diversion Strategies, NAMI Wisconsin NAMI Wisconsin, in conjunction with a variety of mental health and criminal justice professionals, developed a manual to help families and professionals better under-stand the issues that arise when an individual with mental illness becomes involvedin the criminal justice system. This manual includes sections dedicated to the mentalhealth system, the criminal justice system, jail diversion programs, and other relevantissues. Though originally targeted to families of consumers who are involved in thecriminal justice system, the manual has proved useful to professionals throughout themental health and criminal justice fields. Family members and other supporters of people with mental illness should also receive information about the prerelease and discharge planning processesfrom corrections personnel, and receive instruction on how they can participatein helping their spouse or relative make a smooth transition from the jail/prisonback to the community. It is especially important that they know what re-sources are at their disposal to assist them and their recently released familymember when a crisis occurs.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 32: Educating the Community and Building Community Awareness239 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectEducate victim advocates about mental health services and proce- dures for offenders with mental illness. Victim advocates should be informed about mental health services and procedures within correctional facilities and how discharge planning occurs.They should receive orientation, education, and assurances about what ser-vices are available for offenders and what supervision the offender will undergoin addition to what protection they can expect from the criminal justice system.These matters can be included in the overall community education and train-ing curriculum developed by criminal justice agencies.c\"Like any crime victim, a person victimized by aperson with mental illnessimmediately wants thatperson to be held account-able. But they also wantto participate in creating asystem to make sure thesame thing doesn't hap-pen to someone else.\" ELLEN HALBERT Director, Victim Witness Division, DistrictAttorney's Office, Travis County, TX Source: Personal correspondence240 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONIdentifying Trainers POLICY STATEMENT # 33 Identify qualified professionals to conduct training.33 Identify criminal justice professionals, mental health profession- als, consumers, and other appropriate individuals to conduct stafftraining. The success of a training program usually hinges on the quality and appro- priateness of the trainer. Criminal justice system personnel may be skepticalof new approaches\u2014sometimes with good reason. Training loses its effective-ness when participants detect that a facilitator is advancing a political agenda or training largely for financial profit. Accordingly, it is important to choose credible trainers who reflect the shared goals of the criminal justice agency andthe mental health community and who are committed to a long-term workingrelationship. Involving criminal justice system personnel in leading the education pro- cess sends a potent message to those being trained that responses are being instituted because the agency is invested in enhancing service to people with mental illness. For example, law enforcement trainers have the knowledge baseand credibility to cover sections on officer safety, enforcement protocols, andother response topics that a civilian may not. Involving the chief executive of the agency to commence the training or to provide completion certificates also conveys the message that enhancing the response to people with mental illnesses is a priority for the agency. Example: Sheriff and County Commissioner, Pinellas County (FL) In Pinellas County, the sheriff or the county commissioner has been to each of the training classes to speak about the importance of the topic and show support. Thisinteraction has proven to be invaluab le in highlighting to class participants the impor- tance of responding appropriately to people with mental illnesses. Additionally, theCounty Commissioner's office presents a plaque to every officer who completes the40-hour course.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 33: Identifying Trainers241 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectFrontline mental health professionals who have knowledge and field expe- rience relating to the criminal justice system should be included in training forfrontline officers. Street-level crisis intervention workers, for example, are agood resource for law enforcement officers because they have relevant field ex-perience. Mental health experts with significant criminal justice or forensicexperience or community mental health crisis staff are also good choices. These experts should be coached to concentrate on the basic elements of their exper- tise that provide a framework for understanding the essential concepts. Theyshould provide a model that everyone can use to detect and respond appropri-ately to general classes of mental illness. Detention facility inspectors and statepublic defenders who specialize in mental health issues may be useful trainersfor addressing an audience of mental health professionals. Most important, whoever is chosen to train personnel in the criminal jus- tice system must be familiar with the challenges and risks that these individu-als face in the field. Noncriminal justice trainers should be encouraged to par-ticipate in ride-alongs or other experience exchanges in corrections or court settings to better understand these challenges and concerns. Facilitate delivery of training in small or rural jurisdictions where there may be a shortage of trainers. Smaller jurisdictions may need to consider creative resource sharing to make training more feasible. These jurisdictions may create regional trainingclasses, where one or two staff people are sent from several different areas.These staff members would then be responsible for training others in their ju- risdiction. This type of training can also help address cross-jurisdictional is- sues and problems and enhance coordination among neighboring agencies. Al-though distance-learning mechanisms such as CD-ROM or online courses maybe an option for those who cannot otherwise obtain access to training, theyshould not be favored over in-person training sessions. While small, rural ju-risdictions face limited resources, they do have access to national groups that will help to provide training resources (e.g., the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Institute of Corrections). Key to the success of training remote,rural jurisdictions is the commitment of agency managers to access the resources that are available. Example: Athens-Clarke County (GA) Police Department The Athens-Clarke County Police De partment conducts mental health training in con- junction with Advantage Behavioral Healthcare, the local community mental healthcare provider agency. Local mental health care professionals (some in private prac-tice) teach the Crisis Intervention Team class and each instructor donates his or hertime to the department. Additionally, officers are taken to a local hospital or mentalhealth facility to meet with staff and consumers. This has been a helpful method forpersonalizing the discussion about people with mental illness for officers who havehad limited contact with this population.b242 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectBecause criminal justice personnel are exposed to the same myths about mental illness as the public, communities must involve consumers in criminaljustice system training to debunk these myths and to make personal connec-tions with appropriate personnel. It will be critical to invite consumers who arearticulate and have a range of personal experiences to share. This involvementshould not be limited to a trip to an inpatient mental health facility. Instead,criminal justice personnel should meet with people with mental illness who areliving independently, employed, and managing their illness. Another effectivemechanism to personalize mental illness may be for agencies to identify some-one within the agency who has a family member with a mental illness and iswilling to share his or her experiences. Similarly, it is important for trainees tohave a full understanding of the experience of the victims of crimes committedby offenders with mental illness. Including victim advocates in the design anddelivery of training programs is helpful to this end.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 33: Identifying Trainers243 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project244 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONEvaluating Training POLICY STATEMENT # 34 Evaluate the quality of training content and delivery; update training topics and curricula annually to ensure they reflect both the bestpractices in the field as well as the salient issues identified as prob- lematic during the past year. (See Chapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes, for a more comprehensive discussion ofassessing the results of policies and programs thatare suggested by this report.)34 Test whether trainees have effectively learned the material presented. Some law enforcement, court, or corrections veterans may participate re- luctantly in a training session, confident that they have \"seen it before\" or \"doneit all.\" Administering a pretest at the beginning of the training session canchallenge such beliefs. Immediate post-testing of course content is valuable aswell, in order to assess changes in attitudes and knowledge. It might be usefulto conduct a third test, six months after the training, to evaluate how trainingplayed out on the street, in case adjustments need to be made. As a caution,while testing is important it can be considered counterproductive if partici-pants think they have to memorize terminology. Tests should address informa-tion that will inform and improve responses to people with mental illness incontact with the criminal justice system.Chapter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the CommunityPolicy Statement 34: Evaluating Training245 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectEnsure that current national trends and facility-specific needs guide the training agenda. New topics and recommendations for training are being developed across the country on a continuing basis. Mental health training curricula should beupdated regularly in accordance with the best practices in the field. Sources forcurrent information can be obtained from such organizations as the Center forMental Health Services (CMHS) of the Substance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration (SAMHSA), the National GAINS Center, the Ameri-can Correctional Health Services Association (ACHSA), the American Psychi-atric Association (APA), and the National Commission on Correctional HealthCare (NCCHC). Criminal justice training officials should use the experts withinthe mental health community to evaluate current training procedures. Example: NAMI Evaluation of National Institute of Corrections Training Programs The National Institute of Corrections work ed with NAMI to ev aluate National Institute of Corrections training for mental health correctional teams from 22 different jurisdic-tions. NAMI provided feedback to the corrections training personnel in charge ofthose training programs. Promote workshops and seminars on mental illness at confer- ences and professional associations. Most members of the criminal justice system attend professional confer- ences and belong to professional associations. This includes law enforcementline and staff, court officials, and corrections administrators and staff. A number of organizations exist that provide training to court officials, including the National Judicial College, National District Attorneys Associa-tion, National Legal Aid and Defenders Association, National Association ofPretrial Services Agencies, and the American Probation and Parole Associa-tion, to name just a few. Several organizations also provide training on topicsfor law enforcement, including the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF),the Police Foundation, the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP),the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement (NOBLE), the Major Cit-ies Chiefs' Association (MCCA), and the National Sheriffs' Association (NSA).Organizations such as the Association of State Correctional Administrators(ASCA), the National Institute of Corrections (NIC), and the American Correc-tional Association (ACA) provide training geared to corrections administrators. Many of these organizations have been including sessions on various as- pects of working with individuals with mental illness at their regular meetings.These organizations should consider the recommendations contained in thisdocument when planning such sessions in the future.cb246 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectElements of an Effective MentalHealth SystemCHAPTER VII Many of the recommendations contained in this report are predicated on the availability of effective mental health services in the community. Police, judges, jailers, commu- nity corrections officials, and others who refer a person with mental illness to community-basedmental health services expect the delivery of cer- tain services and outcomes. A well-functioning mental health system will reduce the number ofpeople with mental illness who come into contact with the criminal justice system. Policy statements and recommendations in this chapter are intendedto point the way toward an effective mental health service system. Mental health systems in many states across the country have undertaken examinations of the services they offer, their funding mechanisms, and the administrative systems needed to manage themeffectively. Systems have looked at overarching is-sues such as the legislative mandate for the state to provide services or the population to be targeted for these services. They have also looked at the de- tails of reimbursement and relationships with otherfunctions within state government. Legislative com- missions have put some state systems under the microscope of examination and in at least one state,California, a state-funded independent oversight agency has recently studied the quality and avail- ability of mental health services. 1 It would not be surprising if different states taking different approaches came up with highly varied recommendations for improvements to themental health system. However, as much as details may vary, there is remarkable consistency in ele- ments recommended by state commissions andthose described by the U.S. Surgeon General's 1999 report on mental health. 2 For a comprehensive ex- amination of the way mental health services areprovided in this country, the Surgeon General's re- 1.

State policymakers considering improvements in their state-based systems should make themselves fa- miliar with the contents of the report and consideradapting many of its recommendations to fit the needs uncovered by their efforts. It is at the community level, however, that mental health services are delivered, and it is there that policies prove to be effective or not. Policymakers and partners seeking change in com-munity responses must be aware of the structure of the community mental health system in the towns and cities where they live. They should fo-cus not just on what exists, but most intently on what a community mental health system could look like if all pieces were in place. Mental health ex-perts in this country know what works and what doesn't. They agree for the most part on services that should be available in community mentalhealth systems. Yet, for a variety of reasons, our public mental health system has been unable to implement much of what we know. The followingpolicy statements argue for and enumerate prac- tices and approaches shown to be effective.Finally, it is important to consider the role played by funding in determining the scope and depth of the public mental health system. While this report does not provide sufficient analysis todevelop recommendations specific to funding is- sues, readers must bear in mind the funding rami- fications inherent in many of the steps recom-mended herein. At a minimum, it is important for those who use this report to consider three funding issues asthey contemplate implementation of its recommen- dations. First, are there sufficient funds available to the system for it to meet the expectations of itsvarious constituents? Second, are funds allocated appropriately to ensure the system's priorities are met? And third, is there a mechanism to determinewhether allocated funds are achieving the outcomes appropriators think they are purchasing? As funding for public mental health services has evolved, it has become an extremely complex system. Each funding stream brings with it condi- tions and constraints that determine for whom andfor what services it can be used.248 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectReaders of this report and virtually everything written on this nation's public mental health system understand that fundingfor services involves an exceptionally complicated mix of local,state, and federal monies. To provide the full spectrum of ser-vices envisioned in this report, a local provider agency mustweave together funds derived from sources that may have differ-ent guidelines, fiscal years, and stated purposes. Some fundingcomes to agencies on a per capita basis, some on a \"fee forservice\" or reimbur sement basis. Some services are paid for regardless of who accesses them, while most require clients toqualify for programs by demonstrated poverty or disability. Local support - In many communities, local tax levies pro- vide a source of operating support for community mental healthagencies. Levels of community support can vary widely. Manyagencies serve several towns and therefore may draw supportfrom each of them. It is not at all unknown, however, for onetown to provide substantial support, while its neighbor contrib-utes meagerly to the agency. County support - A number of states have developed mental health systems that are financed and managed at the countylevel. In many of these states, this has been a conscious pro- cess of devolution. Again, there is considerable variation among states that have developed county-based systems. Typically, stategeneral funds are provided to counties in block grants based onformulas that may include population, anticipated need, and his-toric contribution. As with federal block grants to states, how-ever, the idea is to promote local control. State support - State general revenue funds are traditionally the largest funding source for mental health services. For a va-riety of reasons, however, the share of state funds has beenfalling for close to a decade, whether measured as the percent-age of state budgets or as the portion of the total mental healthbudget in a given state. At the same time, the amount of statefunding needed to provide the required \"match\" for federal Med-icaid funds has continued to rise, as states have increased theirreliance on Medicaid for many services. In a typical state, forexample, general revenue funds for mental health services mayhave made up approximately 32 percent of the overall publicmental health budget in 1996. By 2001, that portion had de-creased to 19.5 percent. By contr ast, the state Medicaid match had risen from 20 percent to 29 percent of the overall budgetover the same period.Federal support - Each state receives a share of the Mental Health Block Grant, which is administered through the Centerfor Mental Health Services within the Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration. These Block Grant funds typi-cally comprise approximately 1.5 percent to 3 percent of a statemental health system's budget. States also receive SubstanceAbuse Block Grants, which make up a higher proportion of thebudget for substance abuse services. Even in systems wheremental health and substance abuse services are administeredtogether, however, the two Block Grant programs are subject torules that prevent their blending. Federal entitlement programs provide the largest sources of funds for the public mental health system. As already noted, the pro-gram that has the largest impact on the system is Medicaid. Tobe eligible for Medicaid, most adults with mental illness mustqualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Medicaid funding poses a great problem for states. While the federal program does provide funding for some services used bypeople with mental illness, it also comes with many restrictions.To begin with, many people who need public mental health ser-vices do not qualify for Medicaid, which was created to addressthe medical needs of needy and disabled persons. Secondly,only certain services are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement.Since these are services based on medical needs, many stateMedicaid authorities do not allow reimbursement for importantrehabilitative services required by people with mental illness.Thirdly, Medicaid has never allowed for hospitalization of adultsaged 21 to 64 in large psychiatric institutions, although it paysfor costs in institutions used by people with developmental dis-abilities, for example. With fewer people than ever in institu- tions, this exclusion for \"institutions for mental diseases\" -IMDs - may not seem to be a great problem. However, Medicaidpays out large amounts for services to developmentally disabledpeople receiving services in the community, on the theory thatthe community services are preventing more costly institution-based services. Mental health services do not qualify for such\"waivers\" since there are no savings to be realized by divertingadults with mental illness from noncovered institutional care. Support also comes through prog rams administered by other agencies in the federal government. Housing programs, for ex-ample, are funded through the Department of Housing and Ur-ban Development (HUD), vocational rehabilitation programs areadministered by the Department of Education, and so forth. Inaddition, qualifying veterans receive mental health servicesthrough programs operated by the Veterans Health Administra-tion of the Department of Veterans Affairs. In most states, theseprograms are operated independently of the state-administeredpublic mental health system. It is often the case that if an indi-vidual receives services through a VA program, he or she maynot be deemed eligible for non-VA services.Funding for Mental Health Services249 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project250 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONEvidence-Based Practices POLICY STATEMENT #35 Promote the use of evidence-based practices and promising ap- proaches in mental health treatment, services, administration, andfunding. In recent years, enormous advances have been made in treatments available for persons with men-tal illness. New medications have emerged; new ser-vices, supports, and interventions have proven ef-fective. Researchers have conducted studies andcollected data\u2014they have developed an \"evidencebase\"\u2014which demonstrate the effectiveness andapplicability of some of these treatments and ap-proaches. Gradually, a body of research literatureis growing to support the choice of particular inter-ventions in certain situations. While some research-ers might argue over the standards by which an in-tervention or treatment approach is judged to beevidence-based, there is general agreement that the35 term and designation imply that a given practicehas withstood rigorous scientific examination. The public mental health system must take steps to ensure that practice keeps pace with re-search. By ensuring that what is done meshes withwhat is known, mental health policy makers andproviders can reduce the numbers of homeless indi-viduals on the streets, the numbers of individualswith mental illness whose behavior or crimes attractthe attention of police officers, and the numbers ofattempted and completed suicides by people whohave not received effective treatment for their men-tal illness.Chapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 35: Evidence-Based Practices Implement evidence-based practices into the public mental health system. Dr. Robert Drake, a national leader in the move toward evidence-based practices, characterizes evidence-based practices as standardized treatmentsand services subjected to controlled research involving objective outcome mea-sures and more than one research group. Evidence-based practices are built onscientific principles, and while they are supported by certain values and as-251 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project3. Robert E.

Steinwachs, \"Translating Re- search into Practice: The Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) Treatment Recommendations,\" Schizophrenia Bulletin 24, 1998, pp. 1 -10.sumptions they are not themselves values; rather, they are specific interven- tions and treatment models that have been shown to improve client functioningand the course of severe mental illness. 3 Among the evidence-based practices experts believe should be available in the public mental health system are: appropriate use of all available psychotro-pic medications; assertive community treatment; supported employment; fam-ily psychoeducation; illness self-management; and integrated treatment for co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders. This is by no means animmutable list. In fact, it is expected that these currently identified practicesrepresent just the leading edge of a much larger body of evidence-based prac-tices that will result in more reliable standards for mental health services. Prom-ising practices exist in a variety of areas, including rehabilitative services, sup-ported housing, and case management, among others. Properly implemented,existing evidence-based practices have been shown to improve outcomes forboth the client and the system. There is every reason to believe that if theywere implemented more broadly, fewer people with mental illness would be-come involved in the criminal justice system. Studies show, for example, that people who are prescribed the newer, \"atypi- cal\" antipsychotic medications experience fewer debilitating side effects thando clients taking the older classes of medications, with the result that they aremore likely to adhere to their treatment regimens and thus to see the course oftheir illness improve. Yet the schizophrenia PORT study shows that the newermedications are seriously underutilized, especially in African-American andother minority populations, resulting in higher noncompliance with treatmentand the familiar consequences of untreated mental illness. 4 The evidence shows that mental health service providers should make the newer medications rou-tinely available to those who would benefit from them. The Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) model (also known as Pro- gram of Assertive Community Treatment, or PACT) has been the subject ofmore than a quarter century of research showing its effectiveness with clientswho do not respond to less comprehensive approaches. Since its inception inMadison, Wisconsin, in the 1970s, the ACT model has demonstrated that amobile, multidisciplinary team approach, with services available twenty-fourhours a day, significantly improves outcomes for persons with hard-to-treatmental illnesses. In some sites, persons with histories of criminal justice in-volvement or deemed to be at risk of criminal justice involvement have beenidentified as priority clients of ACT programs. Despite the abundance of research that demonstrates ACT's effectiveness, providers and systems have until recently been reluctant to make the changesnecessary to implement the program. Research is less clear on the factors that\"When it comes to suicide and mental illness, thegap between what weknow and what we do islethal.\" KAY REDFIELD JAMISON Researcher, Author Source: Night Falls Fast: Under- standing Suicide , Knopf, 1999252 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmay have impeded implementation of ACT, but many providers note that it is difficult to change staff habits, program configurations, and patterns for statefunding and federal reimbursement. In this way, the story of ACT is illustrativeof some of the hurdles to be overcome by all evidence-based practices. So, too, isthe recent upturn in ACT implementation, which stems from increased advo-cacy for the program at both the federal and grassroots levels, as well as clari-fication of reimbursement rules under Medicaid and other funding streams. It is important to note that evidence-based practices are not all treatment interventions. Supported employment, family psychoeducation, and illness self-management are better seen as support techniques that ultimately allow a cli-ent to develop his or her self-reliance and personal strengths. Each in its ownway can be a critical element in a person's recovery and ability to function, butnone of these practices can be seen as direct treatment. The U.S. Surgeon General and others have made efforts to gather and disseminate information about evidence-based practices, but it is apparent thata huge gap remains between knowledge and practice, between what is knownthrough research and what is actually implemented in many public mental healthsystems across the country. A particular challenge for public mental health stake-holders is to ensure that evidence-based practices become more broadly avail-able and more seamlessly integrated into existing systems of care. The Surgeon General's 1999 report on mental health makes this challenge particularly clear. \"Exciting new research-based advances are emerging thatwill enhance the delivery of treatments and services in areas crucial to consum-ers and families\u2014employment, housing, and diversion of people with mentaldisorders out of the criminal justice systems. Yet a gap persists in the broadintroduction and application of these advances in services delivery to local com-munities, and many people with mental illness are being denied the most up-to-date and advanced forms of treatment.\" 5 Example: New York State Office of Mental Health The departments of mental health in Illinois, Maryland, New York, Ohio, and Virginia, among other states, have held or plan to convene conferences on evidence-basedpractices. The most ambitious of these was held in New York by the Office of MentalHealth for the clear purpose of acquainting county-level polic ymakers and local ser- vice providers with national best-practice trends. The New York conference was thefirst step in a projected series of initiatives designed to make adherence to bestpractices a top priority in the New York public mental health system. Example: NASMHPD Research Institute The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) Re- search Institute is joining with the New Hampshire Dartmouth Psychiatric ResearchCenter and the Medical University of South Carolina to develop methods for the dis-Replicating Evidence- Based PracticesSuccessfully Researchers point out that the history of ACT implementationalso raises another of the com-plex questions in the promotionof evidence-based practices.There are communities in whichproviders claim to be operatingACT teams. On examination, how-ever, it is evident that the modelhas been incompletely applied,raising serious concerns about itsability to live up to expectationsbased on research documentingthe complete model. For ex-ample, the original ACT standardscall for a psychiatrist to partici-pate as a full member of thetreatment team, not just as a con-sultant. Some agencies, however,see an opportunity to save moneyby restricting participation of thepsychiatrist. Inevitably, thischanges the nature of the teamand, thus, potentially erodes re-liability of \"ACT\" in that commu-nity. Researchers remind us thatan evidence-based practice can-not succeed if its local implemen-tation does not maintain fidelityto the original model. Worse,when a practice such as ACT iscorrupted and improperly applied,results can be very different fromthose intended. 5. Office of the Surgeon General, Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General .6. The NASMHPD Research Institute (NRI) has recently launched a center for evidence-based practices, perfor- mance measurement, and quality improvement. The fullrange of the center's activities is still under development.Chapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 35: Evidence-Based Practices253 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectsemination of evidence-based practices. This effort, which various government and foundation sources support, is intended to provide hands-on assistance with replica-tion of proven interventions. At the same time, research is under way to determinethose factors that improve acceptance and implementation of proven models. Thiswork has tremendous implications for the future of effective mental health services. 6 Incorporate recent findings, best practices, and promising prac- tices into existing approaches at the agency level. Identification and implementation of evidence-based practices should not prevent innovation or the development of new practices. Many practices em-ployed in the public mental health system have not yet been well researched.This does not mean that they aren't effective; in many cases, they simply havenot attracted the attention of researchers or they do not easily conform to tradi-tional research methodologies. Researchers, providers, and practitioners shouldbe encouraged to continue to develop new methods to serve people with mentalillness who enter the system. Incentives for this activity should include an em-phasis on outcomes in funding and contracting structures used for communityservices. Reliance on performance measures that emphasize recovery and im-provement in a person's quality of life can lead to development of practicesgeared towards these outcomes. Providers should incorporate innovative ap-proaches and methods expected to achieve good outcomes, paired with appro-priate evaluation methods, into the practices employed by their agencies. Promote and support research in the government, academic, and private sectors into the causes and treatment of mental illness. Research into effective medications and services is vitally important to the mental health field. Medical and rehabilitative advances of the past quartercentury have changed our society's understanding of what is possible for some-one with mental illness to achieve. Yet most researchers and practitioners agreethat much remains unknown about mental illness and its treatment. As theSurgeon General's report on mental health notes, the nation must continue toinvest in research at all levels to continue the trends benefiting many peopletoday. 7 The federal government sets much of the nation's agenda in basic, clinical, and services research. The research agenda is broadly encompassing; it shouldnot overlook concerns of those people with mental illness who have contactwith the criminal justice system. Practitioners and policymakers at the com-munity level should be familiar with the research process and should promote See the NRI Web site at: http://nri.rdmc.org/ for more details. NRI also presents an annual conference that has evolved into a leading venue for services researchers andpractitioners to meet and exchange information.7. Office of the Surgeon General, Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General , pp. 453-54.b c254 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectcontinued support of federal agencies, such as the National Institute of Mental Health and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. At the same time, the government should ensure that its policies and rela- tionships with academic research centers and with industry promote researchexpected to benefit the same core group of disabled individuals. Close attentionshould be paid to provision of incentives that will ensure continuation of theprogress this field has experienced in recent decades. The research community also has an obligation to guard the safety of any human subjects involved in its programs. Mental health service providers mustwork with researchers to ensure that clients who participate in research under-stand the potential risks and benefits of the programs in which they take part. Employ effective mechanisms to disseminate research findings and promote promising practices and evidence-based practices topractitioners in the field. Researchers and policymakers have noted the unfortunate truth that prac- tice in the field too frequently fails to reflect what is known about the mosteffective practices available. This wide gap between what is known and what isin fact done results in lost lives, failed systems, and wasted resources. Policymakers should ensure that practitioners employ effective mechanisms for knowledge dissemination of findings regarding promising practices and evi-dence-based practices in the systems they oversee. These mechanisms mightinclude conferences, professional journals, academic partnerships, and regularin-service training opportunities. Contracts should include bonuses or otherincentives for the use of evidence-based practices as well as for training andother dissemination practices. Example: Ohio Department of Mental Health; Illinois Office of Mental Health Some state public mental health systems are accepting the challenge and taking steps to bridge the gap between research and practice. For example, the Ohio Department ofMental Health has established \"coordinating centers of excellence\" responsible fordisseminating evidence-based or promising practices across the state. Eight of thesecenters are planned with the hope that they can promote local initiative and raisestatewide quality measures. In Illinois, funding from the state Office of Mental Healthhas helped to establish the Illinois Staff Training Institute for Psychiatric Rehabilita-tion at the University of Chicago.dChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 35: Evidence-Based Practices255 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project256 Criminal Justice/Mental Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONIntegration of Services POLICY STATEMENT #36 Initiate and maintain partnerships between mental health and other relevant systems to promote access to the full range of services andsupports, to ensure continuity of care, and to reduce duplication ofservices. People with serious mental illness generally have service needs that extend well beyond coremental health treatments such as medication andcounseling. This is especially true of people with co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse dis-orders (see Policy Statement 37: Co-Occurring Dis-orders) but applies equally to any person withmental illness who has concerns related to healthcare or other disabilities. In many cases, these needsare best met by agencies or providers who can com-bine specific expertise in other areas with these orother traditional mental health services. It is cer-tainly easier for clients to access services throughproviders able to link acute clinical services withnecessary support services such as housing assis-tance, vocational rehabilitation, and educational ser-36 vices\u2014and consumers cite ease of access as an im-portant reason for sticking with or abandoning treat-ment. Similarly, when they are served by a singleagency or by a well-coordinated partnership, con-sumers usually feel they are treated with greaterrespect. They are not asked for the same informa-tion again and again, and they may even be sparedfilling out quite so many forms. From a clinical standpoint, provision of coordi- nated services simply makes sense. Even when aclient sees different clinicians in the same agency,it is more likely that charts and records are consis-tent and there is agreement on treatment goals. Co-ordinated care, a value expressed by many healthcare providers, is much more achievable when allrelated services are provided by the same agency. Promote services and systems integration for co-occurrence of mental illness and other chronic conditions. While the disorders thought of most frequently as co-occurring are mental illness and a substance abuse disorder, these are by no means the only disor-ders to overlap. Mental illness can also coincide with developmental disabilityChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 36: Integration of Services257 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project8.

In each instance, it is now understood, the personwith co-occurring conditions meets with greater success if his or her needs areconsidered as a whole and the disorders are treated in an integrated manner.The goal of integrated treatment is to combine treatments for more than onedisorder at the level of clinical intervention. Ideally, the individual with co-occurring disorders should find services to be delivered seamlessly, \"with a con-sistent approach, philosophy, and set of recommendations.\" 8 Example: Fountain House, New York City (NY) Fountain House, in New York City, is the founding site and leading example of the clubhouse model of rehabilitation. Its program has been replicated in communitiesworldwide. It provides education, housing, employment programs, and social opportu-nities for its members. While clubhouses such as Fountain House do not directlyprovide clinical treatment services, they generally have strong links with appropriateagencies to ensure that members who need treatment are able to receive it. In opera-tion since 1948, Fountain House itself is able to meet the needs of members who areelderly or disabled by illness or disability. Ten percent of its members, for instance,are deaf or hearing-impaired. Approximately half of its members have histories ofsubstance or alcohol abuse. And one in five are elderly. Like other successful andlong-standing models, Fountain House appears to meet the needs of its clients byaccepting them as they present themselves and working with them from that pointforward. Integrate primary health care and mental health care services. People with mental illness are at greater risk for health problems than is the general public. Smoking and poor nutrition are more prevalent among peoplewith mental illness. Because of poverty or disorganization associated with theirillness, people with mental illness are also less likely to visit primary healthcare providers on a regular basis. As a result, people with mental illness are inpoorer health than the general population, and they rarely benefit from earlyintervention for health problems. When they do receive treatment for healthproblems, their conditions may already be in advanced states, so the treatmentitself is typically more involved and more costly. Some mental health providers have explored integration of primary health care and mental health care as a way to improve general health among peoplewith mental illness. A recent study has demonstrated the benefits of this ap-proach. 9 Subjects in the study were enrolled in a Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health clinic, where some were randomized to receive primary care through anintegrated care initiative located in the mental health clinic, while others re-ceived medical care through the general medicine clinic. Those who receivedb\"The organization of ser- vices for adults with severemental disorders is thelinchpin of effective treat-ment. Since many mentaldisorders are best treatedby a constellation of medi-cal and psychosocial ser-vices, it is not just theservices in isolation, butthe delivery system as awhole, that dictates theoutcome of treatment.\" Source: Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General , p. 285258 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project10. National GAINS Center, Courage to Change , December 1999, pp. 17-22.primary care through the integrated care clinic had significantly better out- comes than those with mental illness who received primary and mental healthcare in separate settings. Policymakers and providers should consider adoptingthis approach to improve the general health of people with mental illness andto lower the incidence of emergency interventions in that population. Develop blended funding strategies to sustain comprehensive, integrated services. Funding is the major challenge faced by advocates and managers who wish to start or maintain integrated or comprehensive service programs. Those whohave managed to start programs and operate them successfully do have experi-ence that can be useful to others in the field. According to a report by the GAINSCenter, there are several strategies that increase the likelihood of success. 10 Programs focusing on integrating several types of services in order to pro- vide comprehensive treatment should identify a mix of funding sources that, ina sense, reflects the blending of services. Reaching out to different fundingsources may appear to be more difficult than traditional mental health funding,which usually relies on categorical funding streams. Approached creatively,however, adopting a mix of services can also expand the range of funding possi-bilities. Approaching the development of services in this manner may also helpproviders to better understand what they are looking for in services as well asin funding and where the service deficiencies lie for the target population. Adjust licensing and other regulatory functions to encourage development and operation of comprehensive, integrated services. Funding is by no means the only issue keeping systems from supporting more effective services. Key providers in a given community, perhaps compet-ing for funding, may operate with different philosophies, undermining opportu-nities for cross-training, effective communication, or service coordination. Atthe same time, conflicting or confusing licensing regulations can thwart oneagency's efforts to provide integrated services. To achieve widespread service integration, policymakers will need to coor- dinate or consolidate regulatory and reporting mechanisms. The purpose is to make creative and effective integrated service models available for people whohave mental illness and a variety of other needs.c dChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 36: Integration of Services259 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Assertive Community Treatment The Assertive Community Treatment model (kno wn as ACT or PACT) was developed in Madison, Wisconsin, in the 1970s. Six states (Delaware, Indiana, Michigan, RhodeIsland, Texas, Wisconsin) currently have statewide ACT programs. Nineteen stateshave at least one or more ACT pilot programs in their state. It is a service-deliverymodel that provides comprehensive, locally based treatment to people with seriousand persistent mental illness. Unlike many other community-based programs, ACT isnot a linkage or brokerage case-management program that connects individuals tomental health, housing, or rehabilitation agencies or services. Rather, it provides highlyindividualized services dir ectly to consumers. ACT recipients receive the multidisciplinary, round-the-clock staffing of a psychiatric unit, delivered in the \"realworld\" settings of their homes, local coffee shops, or other places they may frequent.To have the competencies and skills to meet a client's multiple treatment, rehabilita-tion, and support needs, ACT team members are trained in psychiatry, social work,nursing, substance abuse, and vocational rehabilitation. Recently, ACT teams haveplaced a greater emphasis on inclusion of consumers as treatment team members,either in the traditional professional positions or as peer counselors able to communi-cate more effectively with a team's clients. The ACT team provides these necessaryservices 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. To make ACT programsmore accessible, states have adopted funding strategies approved by Medicaid for thispurpose. As part of their contracting process, states monitor ACT programs for com-pliance with certain agreed-upon practice standards. Example: Village Integrated Service Agency, Long Beach (CA) The Village Integrated Service Agency in Long Beach was initially developed through state legislation (1989) that attempted to remove administrative and funding barriers from the delivery of comprehensive, individualized mental health services. The threebasic elements of Village's program design are collaborative case-management teams,case-rated funding, and a ps ychosocial rehabilitation/recovery philosophy. As in the ACT model, services at the Village are primarily delivered to the client wherever he orshe is: at home, on the job, in the supermarket. Teams of clinicians work with eachclient and bring complementary skills to the process. Case-rated funding is an impor-tant principle because it is focused on outcomes rather than on delivery of units ofservice. The overarching recovery philosophy imbues staff and clients with a willing-ness to seek the rewards that come with higher risks, knowing that support will beavailable when needed. The Village offers a clear, single point of responsibility foreveryone it serves and provides coverage 24 hours a day, seven days a week.260 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONCo-Occurring Disorders POLICY STATEMENT 37 Promote system and services integration for co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. In the view of many practitioners and research- ers, co-occurrence of mental illness and substanceuse disorders in individuals is so common as to bethe norm rather than the exception. In fact, it isestimated that 75 percent of people with mental ill-ness within the criminal justice system meet crite-ria for drug and/or alcohol abuse or dependence;some cite figures indicating that up to 90 percent ofthose behind bars with either mental illness or sub-stance abuse disorders have co-occurring disor-ders. 11 As a result, increased attention has been given to identification of the most effective modelsfor the provision of services to the \"dually diagnosed\"37 population. For the past 15 years, extensive effortshave been made to develop integrated models of carethat bring together mental health and substanceabuse treatment. Recent evidence from more thana dozen studies shows that comprehensive inte-grated efforts help persons with dual disorders re-duce substance use and sustain mental health re-covery. Integrated approaches are also associatedwith a reduction in hospital utilization, psychiatricsymptomatology, and other problematic negativeoutcomes, including rearrest. 12 Employ an integrated approach to treatment of persons with co- occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders. While there is widespread agreement that models featuring integrated ser- vices for individuals with co-occurring disorders are far more effective thanthose delivering services in a fragmented or sequential fashion, access to inte-grated programs is not available in most localities. 11.

Bixler and Brice D. Emery, Successful Pro- grams for Individuals with Co-Occurring Mental Health andSubstance Abuse Disorders: Examples from Five States , National Association of State Mental Health Program Direc- tors, National Association of State Alcohol and Drug AbuseDirectors, August 2000.Barriers to integration exist at policy, program, and clinical levels. The terms \"substance abuse disorder\" and \"mental illness\" are often integrated un-der the phrase \"behavioral disorders.\" Because substance abuse disorders canboth mimic and exacerbate psychiatric disorders, the differentiation of whatmay be contributing to abnormalities in mood, thinking, or behavior is a diffi-cult task requiring sophisticated assessment strategies. It is unfair, and un-wise, to put the burden of differential diagnosis on law enforcement, the courts,corrections, or community corrections staff. The responsibility for assessingand responding to the behavioral needs of arrestees, defendants, inmates, andparolees must rest with community behavioral health providers. These provid-ers must offer an integrated behavioral health service package to the criminaljustice system if the shared vision of effective treatment and efficient justice isto be achieved. The essence of integration is that the same clinicians, working in the same setting, provide and coordinate both mental health and substance abuse inter-ventions. For the dually diagnosed individual or the referring agent, the ser-vices appear seamless. Clinicians take responsibility for combining the inter-ventions to address the individual's clinical and legal circumstances, and therecommendations are consistent with the best practices of both the mental healthand addictions fields. Neither disorder is considered primary, and it is recog-nized that successful resolution of the symptoms of both the addiction disorderand the nonaddiction psychiatric disorder are interdependent on integratedtreatment strategies. Integration involves modifications of traditional approaches to both men- tal health and substance abuse treatment. While there are numerous \"right\"ways to deliver services, and dual diagnosis programs differ from one anotherin many ways, successful programs incorporate several critical components thatmake them comprehensive. Effective integrated programs do more than add a cross-trained staff mem- ber or a dual diagnosis group to existing traditional programming. Experts havedefined comprehensive programs by the presence of intensive case managementmodels, motivational interventions to advance clinical goals, the involvement offamily and natural supports, and a long-term treatment perspective. 13 Example: Dependency Health Services and Central Washington Compre- hensive Mental Health, Yakima (WA) The Integrated Crisis Stabilization and Detoxif ication Programs in Yakima are two separate programs that work in close collaboration. Each has learned to offer inte-grated services to persons with co-occurring substance abuse and mental health diag-noses. The two programs complement each other and offer \"seamless\" program-ming. 14 The staffs in the two programs, which share a medical director, together initiate joint clinical interventions. They also collaborate with other agencies, includingthe hospital (for ambulance response and medical care) and local law enforcement.Intensive Case Management Intensive case management is often accomplished through theuse of multidisciplinary teamsthat include both mental healthand substance abuse specialistswho share responsibility for treat-ment and for training each other.Adhering to the principles of as-sertive community treatment thatare designed for individuals whoare difficult to engage in tradi-tional services, intensive casemanagement services performoutreach to the client's home (orstreet outreach if the client ishomeless) and natural supportsystem. Even where there arecourt-ordered conditions for treat-ment, noncompliance may be anearly feature, due to the disablingeffects of co-occurring disorders,and assertive outreach may berequired for some individuals.Without such efforts, clients maybe expected to drop out of treat-ment, with ensuing revocation orrearrest.262 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectRecognize that relapse is a common feature in the experience of many individuals with co-occurring disorders. Effective programs accept that recovery from dual disorders is a long-term process. Both mental illnesses and addictive disorders are characterized byperiods of higher functioning interrupted by periods with disabling symptoms.Recovery takes place over months and years. Scarce resources should not bediverted from long-term community-based care to high-cost, short, intensiveinterventions. Relapses are anticipated and contingency plans are made tominimize the duration and severity of the relapse. Close collaboration withcommunity corrections staff is critical to ensure the responses to relapses serveboth public safety and clinical goals. Integrate mental illness and substance abuse treatment policy, funding, and regulation at the federal, state, and agency levels inorder to achieve desired clinical outcomes. To facilitate service integration, there need to be integrative policies and administrative support at the system level. State, county, and local mentalhealth authorities either promulgate, or are bound by, financing mechanismsand regulations that impede integrative service delivery. In most states, forexample, licenses for mental health and substance abuse facilities are handledby two different state agencies with separate regulatory, financial, and over-sight procedures. Frontline providers are often caught between doing what isclinically indicated and what is financially reimbursable with the dual diagno-sis client suffering the consequences of ineffective care. New interorganizationalstructures and policies are required to enable the seamless provision of requi-site services. These structural changes do not necessarily require more re-sources, and integration has the potential to be cost efficient. 15 Advocates and practitioners agree that much can be done at the systems level to remove impediments and ease the provision of integrated mental healthand substance abuse services. Supported by the federal Substance Abuse andMental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in June 1998, the NationalAssociation of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) and theNational Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD)conducted a formal dialogue intended to explore the issues related to the provi-sion of integrated services. A report on this dialogue was issued by the twoorganizations in March 1999. In signaling their desire to collaborate in findingsolutions, they have initiated a process each hopes will bring movement at boththe federal and state levels. 16 More recently, the SAMHSA work plan for 2002 15.

For example, the federal Substance Abuse Block Grant and Mental HealthBlock Grant are separate funding streams administered in different centerswithin SAMHSA. They often flow to different agencies in a given state and, inturn, finance quite different providers and services at the community level.Because integration of such federal funding brings with it the possibility of asignificant realignment of resources throughout the system, many who wouldbe affected are moving towards integration with great caution. It should also be noted that the use of illicit drugs\u2014and, more specifically, arrest for drug-related crimes\u2014may result in limitations on an individual'sability to receive important federal benefits such as SSI or to qualify for hous-ing under many public housing programs. Because of the high prevalence of co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disorders, many of those whocome into contact with the criminal justice system are people whose past activi-ties have left them unable to access various federal benefit programs. Thiscircumstance places an additional strain on state systems and local agenciesseeking reimbursement for integrated services provided to people with co-oc-curring disorders.264 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectHousing POLICY STATEMENT #38 Develop and enhance housing resources that are linked to appropri- ate levels of mental health supports and services. As public mental health policy has moved away from reliance on institutions and toward commu-nity integration, policymakers, providers, and ad-vocates have been forced to confront the many ob- stacles facing persons with mental illness who seek safe and affordable places to live. While some ofthe difficulties encountered by this population arecommon to all who live on low or moderate incomes,other challenges are more directly related to the ex- perience of mental illness. In any case, in order to consider steps a community might take to improvehousing options, it is first necessary to understandthe existing obstacles. The price of housing stock, particularly in ma- jor cities, has risen well beyond the ability of people with low or moderate incomes to pay for it. Since people in the public mental health system are amongthe poorest in the nation, they are hard hit by thiscrisis in affordable housing. In 2000, there was nohousing market in the country where a person witha disability receiving SSI benefits could afford to rent a one-bedroom or efficiency unit. 18 Federal housing subsidies for individuals with mental illness do not adequately compensate for theinflated private housing market. In 1992 and 1996,38 Congress passed laws permitting public and as-sisted-housing providers to designate housing as\"elderly only.\" This resulted in many \"non-elderly\"adults disabled by mental illness no longer having access to a major portion of the affordable rental units in this country. Unfortunately, U.S. Depart-ment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)officials have also promoted policies in recent yearsthat have failed to keep pace with the needs of low- income people with disabilities who wish to rent af- fordable apartments. The Section 811 SupportiveHousing for Persons with Disabilities Program hashad its funding reduced from $346 million in 1991to $217 million in the most recent budget. 19 Federal housing policy makes it especially dif- ficult for ex-offenders with mental illness to secure public housing assistance. At the most basic level,housing subsidies such as Section 8 are availableonly for the working poor\u2014applicants must havefederal income tax forms to be eligible. Because thelarge majority of individuals with mental illness are unemployed (70 percent to 90 percent) most do not qualify for such programs. 20 In addition, public housing authorities, Section 8 providers, and otherfederally assisted housing programs are permitted, 18. \"Priced Out in 2000: The Crisis Continues,\" Technical Assistance Collaborative, Inc., Boston, MA and Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Housing Task Force, Washington, D.C., June 2001.19.

Ibid., pp. 35-6 .aRECOMMENDATIONS FOR cases required, to deny housing to indi- viduals with certain criminal histories.21 For ex- ample, if an individual is evicted from public hous-ing for drug-related criminal activity, he or she isbarred from reapplying to live there for three years.Because many people with mental illnesses have co- occurring substance use disorders, these restrictions affect this population disproportionately. People withmental illness who have histories of any kind ofcriminal justice involvement also frequently findthemselves \"jumped over\" by others without suchhistories on waiting lists for assisted housing. Even without the barriers to receiving federal assistance, the majority of individuals involved inthe criminal justice system\u2014regardless of whetherthey have a mental illness\u2014have limited resourcesto secure adequate housing. For example, most ex-offenders leave prison without enough money for a security deposit on an apartment. 22 Furthermore, private landlords may require prospective tenantsto disclose employment, financial, and criminal his-tories, as well as mental health information, and mayexclude individuals based on these characteristics. Families and friends are an important housing resource for individuals with mental illness. When these individuals become involved in the criminaljustice system their relationships with families andfriends are often strained. Families living in publichousing may be concerned that allowing an ex-of-fender to resume residency there will compromise their own housing eligibility (see federal restrictions above). More generally, family and friends may feelincapable of or uninterested in helping an individual who has decompensated sufficiently to become in-volved in the criminal justice system. Even if individuals with mental illness who have been involved in the criminal justice systemare able to tap family or friends as a housing re- source, their reintegratin into the community can be problematic. If an individual with mental illnessis simply returning to the environment that fosteredhis or her involvement with the criminal justice sys-tem in the first place, there is a good chance thatthis reintroduction will result in a rapid return to the behavior that originally caused them to offend. Individuals with mental illness who are able to locate housing often have difficulty sustaining resi-dency. Sustained residency is usually predicatedon the provision of support services (mental health,substance abuse, employment, etc.) in conjunction with housing. Housing and support services can be linked in a variety of ways. Responses to the housing shortage for people with mental illness differ according to numerousvariables: location (group vs. single-occupancy), levelof supervision, funding source, intensity of integra- tion with support services, intensity of case man- agement, and others. It is difficult to identify dis-crete housing \"models\"; each approach tends to beunique to the community where the housing is pro-vided. The recommendations below are an attemptto identify some of the common characteristics of successful efforts to develop housing options for in- dividuals with mental illness. Form community-based partnerships to develop comprehensive solutions to housing for persons with mental illness. Lack of affordable housing is a community problem. Just as there is no one cause for the shortage of housing, no one agency can possibly assume responsi-266 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectbility for addressing the problem. Effective solutions require partnership of the most inclusive kind. Local, community-based agencies are almost always themost effective at joining together to access housing funding available from state,federal, and, sometimes, private sources. Local agencies are also best positionedto understand the community's particular need and, most important, to createpartnerships that can provide necessary housing and supports for people withmental illnesses. In every community, collaboration among service providers, housing de- velopers, lenders, and elected or appointed officials is critical to successful de-velopment of housing for people with mental illness, especially those with his-tories of criminal justice involvement. Local mental health service providersshould actively seek and form partnerships to meet this most pressing of needs. Example: Community Mental Health Centers, Vermont In Vermont, every Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) has hired a housing coordinator. These coordinators work with staff from state housing agencies, publichousing authorities, nonprofit developers, and others to develop cross-system, col-laborative efforts to provide housing for individuals with mental illness. CMHC hous-ing coordinators also work with private landlords, nonprofit developers, case manag-ers and others to ensure that clients are on Section 8 waiting lists, tenant/landlord disputes are settled amicably, and housing development efforts consider the needs ofthe mentally ill population. 23 Establish leadership and coordination at the state level to provide technical assistance and ensure access to resources. State mental health agencies should examine their role in housing devel- opment. Depending on the structure of state mental health systems, state men-tal health agencies may be able to require provider agencies to participate inlocal housing collaborations. More likely, it is through force of leadership and,especially, provision of incentives that state mental health agencies can assumea role in meeting this critical need. A relatively small matching grant or provi-sion of technical assistance in completing often complicated applications can becrucial contributions to local housing initiatives. Although solutions to the housing shortage for people with mental illness ultimately must be locally based, state agencies should encourage local provid-ers to address this issue, and they should facilitate such projects with assistanceand funding. Creation of a state-level office that concentrates on housing forpersons with mental illness indicates the centrality of housing in the servicearray. 23. Elizabeth Edgar, and Anne D.

By providing centralized expertise,state offices can help local agencies learn to negotiate regulations and require-ments related to zoning, property acquisition, licensing, federal funding mecha-nisms, and the many other issues that arise in housing development. Similarly, state housing offices can locate disparate funding sources and assist local communities in accessing them. Example: Office of Housing and Service Environments, Ohio Department of Mental Health The Ohio Department of Mental Health has created an Office of Housing and Service Environments. In 1989, this office, which has since been sub-divided into threeoffices, began to redirect some funds, formerly used in the development and renova-tion of hospitals, to housing development. The DMH Office of Housing also providestechnical assistance to local community health boards to create independent corpora-tions to develop housing for individuals with serious mental illnesses. 24 Institute linkages between housing options and service availability. Almost all successful housing initiatives for individuals with mental ill- ness are integrated with the provision of other services, including mental health,employment, crisis management, and substance abuse. This model of \"sup-portive housing\" recognizes that housing issues must not be viewed as isolatedfrom the other needs of this population; housing should be viewed as part of abroader model of integrated treatment for individuals with mental illnesses(see Policy Statement 36: Integration of Services). Research has shown repeat-edly that retention rates for housing with services are considerably higher (of-ten twice as high) than for housing that is not linked to services. 25 The issue of whether services should be a mandatory condition of receiving housing is contentious. Some housing developers favor agreements that re-quire individuals with mental illness to have their adherence to treatment closelymonitored by case managers as a condition of receiving housing. Some serviceproviders and mental health advocates hold strong philosophical positionsagainst requiring acceptance of services as a condition of housing. This issueremains difficult and divisive. In all cases, availability and use of service models such as Assertive Com- munity Treatment can go a long way toward meeting the needs of both tenantand landlord in most housing situations. People with Severe Mental Illness on the Utilization of the Public Health, Corrections, and Emergency Shelter Sys- tems,\" Housing Policy Debate 12, 2001.26. See www.omh.state.ny.us/omhweb/omhq/q0901/ Pathways.htmlc268 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Pathways to Housing, New York City (NY) In 1992 the New York State Office of Mental Health established the Pathways to Housing program, which seeks to relocate individuals from shelters and the streetsinto permanent housing. Crucial to the Pathways mission is the integration of inten-sive services, based on the ACT model. 26 Pathways to Housing favors the eradication of all restrictions for housing clients; employment, substance abuse treatment, lifeskills, and other services are aggressively offered, but not required of program par-ticipants. Example: Corporation for Supportive Housing (CA) The California branch of the Corporation for Supportive Housing has established the Health, Housing, and Integrated Services Network. This initiative brings together fourcounty public health departments with more than 20 different nonprofit service pro-viders (mental health, substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, employment, and others) to link abroad array of services to housing. 27 Many programs that provide housing to individuals with mental illness are linked to case management services. These services may be provided bycommunity mental health providers, the housing providers themselves, or othernonprofit agencies. The intensity of case management, i.e., the volume of caseseach case manager handles, varies widely. Case management is often crucial inlinking a client to the services that are integrated with housing providers. Manyindividuals with mental illness who have been involved in the criminal justicesystem have had bad experiences with treatment programs, and without a dedi-cated case manager they may not successfully reach out to these services, evenif these services are provided in conjunction with housing. Case managers arealso extremely important in helping consumers deal with crisis situations. (SeePolicy Statement 13: Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility for dis-cussion of the Thresholds Jail Program and Policy Statement 14: Adjudicationfor discussion of the Nathaniel Project; both programs provide case manage-ment and help connect to supportive housing individuals with mental illnesswho have been involved with the criminal justice system.) Blend funding for development and operation of stable, affordable housing. The most successful housing partnerships are those that identify several funding sources that will allow them to make housing affordable for peoplewith disabilities such as mental illness. Since funding sources frequently im-pose restrictions on the use of their available funds, this blending of fundingsources may be the only way to gain access to funds for both development andoperation of properties. When considering funding for housing this population,d 27. See www.csg.org/whohhis.html 28. A recent study of more than 3,500 formerly homeless individuals with mental illness involved in a New York City supportive housing program showed that the per annumcosts of the housing program were only slightly higher thanthe service costs typically accrued by the individuals. The supportive housing model cost $13,750 per placement per year and resulted in a cost reduction of $12,145 per place- ment per year. Dennis Culhane et al., \"The Impact of Sup-portive Housing.\"Chapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Sta tement 38: Housing269 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectit is important to remember that supportive housing for individuals with men- tal illness has proven very cost effective when compared with the cost of ser-vices (shelter, criminal justice, hospitals, etc.) typically provided to individualswho are homeless and have a mental illness. 28 Example: Common Ground (NY) Common Ground, a New York City nonprofit organization that develops and manages large, congregate, supported housing properties, receives funding from more than 30different sources. Their funders include foundations, private sector corporations, theNew York City Departments of Housing, Human Resources, and Homeless Services,and the New York State Office of Mental Health, among others. 29 There are many federal programs that can be used for people with mental illness. These include: HOME, Community Development Block Grant, Section8 rental assistance (including Section 8 Mainstream Housing Opportunities forPersons with Disabilities), McKinney/Vento Homeless Assistance, Section 811Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, and Housing Opportunitiesfor People with AIDS (HOPWA). Each program comes with its own require-ments and restrictions, but those interested in developing housing in their com-munities should become familiar with these options. 30 Example: Connecticut Local Housing Authorities During the 1990s, local housing authorities in Connecticut received more than $40 million from HUD, primarily from the McKinney grants program, to support the provi- sion of housing and services for individuals with mental illness. The state aggres-sively educated local housing authorities on how to apply for the grants, and fosteredcollaboration between state mental health service providers and local housing authori-ties. 31 The federal Shelter Plus Care Program offers substantial funds specifically targeted to individuals who are homeless and disabled, including those with seriousmental illness. Title VII of the National Af fordable Housing Act of 1990 amended the McKinney Act to create this grant program. The program provides rental assistancebut requires a local match of an equal or greater amount of services. Some states have found ways to make funds available for development of housing for people with low incomes, including those with disabilities. Bondissues, trust funds, and one-time appropriations have been used for these pur-poses in different states. For example, Oregon recently negotiated the sale ofits former Dammash State Hospital. A 1999 statue establishes a trust fundwith the sale proceeds; 70 percent of the trust fund interest will be used tofinance community-based housing options for individuals with mental illness. 32 Agencies such as Housing and Mortgage Finance Corporations may also havestate-specific programs that encourage housing developers to tap various fund-ing sources. 29.

Ibid., p. 7.270 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectDevelop an array of housing to meet the varied needs of individu- als with mental illness. Typically, community response is most favorable to development of hous- ing that mixes people with mental illness with others who may require no sup-port and/or who will rent at market rates. Most of the programs mentionedabove are predicated on development of such \"integrated\" (also known as \"scat-tered-site\") housing. A building with eight units, for example, may include justone or two units for persons with mental illness. Developers and most commu-nity mental health agencies frown on development of properties with manyunits, all of which are to be occupied by people with mental illness. Such \"con-gregate\" housing is a target for community opposition and is seen by manyadvocates as inimical to the concepts of community integration and recovery.Just the same, it should be pointed out that some communities have seen op-portunities arise for development or redevelopment projects that are targetedexclusively to people with mental illness. Still, such projects are growing lesscommon. 33 Example: Project Renewal (NY) Project Renewal, a New York City based nonprofit, has facilitated the construction of both \"integrated\" and \"congregate\" housing throughout the city. One of its severalcongregate housing facilities, Renewal at Clinton Residence, opened in 1990 and housesand provides services for 57 individuals with mental illness who were formerly home-less. Project Renewal also maintains more than 90 units of \"scattered-site housing,\"some of which are occupied by graduates from Project Renewal-run treatment pro-grams. Rent subsidies are provided by HUD and federal section 8 programs, amongother funding sources. It should be remembered that people with mental illness fall at different points on a continuum. For some, independent housing with only occasionalsupports is appropriate. For others, intensely supervised housing is necessaryto ensure their safety and success in the community. It would be a mistake fora community to institute a housing plan that doesn't account for this range ofneeds. To ensure appropriate housing development, a community should as-sess the housing options available as well as indications of need, such as wait-ing lists for section 8 housing or the numbers of people with mental illnessfound to be inadequately housed in shelters, with relatives, or, indeed, in jailsor prisons. 33. Another reason for the decline in popularity of con- gregate housing is that, compared with some integratedhousing models, congregate housing can be more expen- sive. This is due in large part to the extensive in-houseservices available, especially having 24-hour trained mental health staff on-hand.

People whose lives have been affected by men- tal illness develop a vast reservoir of experience thatcan be put to constructive use to meet their imme-diate needs, those of their peers, and, ultimately,those of the mental health system. In still too manyplaces, this reservoir remains untapped, and con-sumers and families have little meaningful involve-ment in determining the direction of services and asystem that are meant to meet their needs. In the 1980s, Congress recognized the value of including consumers and families in mental health39 services planning when it created the precursors totoday's statewide mental health planning and advi-sory councils. A major requirement for the composi-tion of the councils is that no more than 50 percentof their membership be drawn from the ranks ofprofessionals or state administrators. The intentionis to make councils hospitable to consumers and fam-ily members and, in fact, consumers and familymembers serve on these federally mandated coun-cils in every state.Chapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 39: Consumer and Family Member Involvement Build consumer and family participation into all levels of the ser- vice delivery system. Inclusion of consumers and family members at the county and/or local level is more variable than at the state level. County boards, for example, may ormay not require participation by consumers and family members. Many localagencies include consumers and families on their governing boards or on agencyplanning committees, and such inclusion is encouraged by national associa-tions. Still, consumers and family members in many areas report their frustra-tion with what they view as a lukewarm commitment to this principle, espe-273 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project34. Principles for Behavioral Healthcare Delivery , Na- tional Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, Rockville, MD, 2001.cially in instances where they feel their inclusion reflects tokenism rather than an openness to their experience or perceptions of the system. Example: National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare The National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare (NCCBH) includes the following among the principles of governance it suggests to its members: \"Governingboards should include members of or access to the views and input of individualswho are consumers and/or family members of consumers of the organization's ser- vices.\" 34 Include consumers and family members in service delivery. Consumers and family members can also make important contributions to service delivery. Evidence is mounting to demonstrate the effectiveness of con-sumer-operated support services, for example. Systems that employ people withmental illness to help others gain insight into their illness and build strategiesthat can help them cope with it report success as measured by lowered use ofcrisis services. Services such as \"warmlines,\" which make it possible for a per-son needing support to prevent an exacerbation of symptoms by talking withsomeone who has had direct experience with mental illness him-or herself, havebeen shown to succeed in a variety of settings. \"Drop-in centers\" are consumer-operated sites where people with serious mental illness can meet others andparticipate in social, vocational, and educational activities. Similarly, some programs employ consumers to act as \"peer educators\" who provide generalized information about coping with mental illness in a mannerthat is authenticated by their own experiences. Peer educators frequently rungroups for consumers at mental health service agencies in which they discussissues of common concern. By removing the experience of mental illness from awholly clinical approach, peer educator programs often allow people to makeconnections with one another and understand how to deal with their illness ina more individualized way. Consumer-operated services such as these are seenas part of the continuum of services that also includes professional services;they are not to be seen as a replacement for the professional system. Example: Harbor Inn Residential Facility, Boston (MA) In Boston peer educators every week visit Harbor Inn, a residential facility on Long Island in Boston Harbor. They meet with residents who are in transition from hospitalsto community settings. Many residents have histories of involvement with the crimi-nal justice system. Educators, who themselves are in treatment for mental illness,show videotapes or share written materials that provoke group discussions of issuessuch as housing, basic living skills, and tobacco use that are relevant to the lives ofthose in the residence.b\"Peer provided supports and services are a vastuntapped resource forrecovery when it comes tocommunity based re-sources for diversion fromthe criminal justice sys-tem. And those supportsand services are equallyvaluable for personstransitioning back into thecommunity.\" TOM LANE Consumer Activist/ Advocate, Director,Forest Park Drop In Center at South Florida State Hospital, FL274 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Assertive Community Tr eatment Programs Assertive Community Treatment programs in many locations around the country have recently added positions on their professional teams that are intended to be filled byconsumers of services. Sometimes known as \"peer counselors\" or \"peer advocates,\" the consumers who fill these positions provide insight into the experience of mentalillness and recovery that professionals without a consumer background are unable tooffer. Ensure that people with mental illness are accessing the full range of entitlements for which they are eligible (e.g., SSI, SSDI). For many people, access to appropriate services is determined by their ability to access the health benefits and other entitlements for which they areeligible. People with mental illness who are found to be disabled by their illnessor who have little or no income as a result of their disability are eligible for anarray of income and reimbursement benefits. Many mental health and addic-tion services provided by community agencies are reimbursable through Med-icaid and Medicare, which are generally available to people who qualify forSupplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Income (SSDI).Qualification for income support also can lead to eligibility for housing sup-ports. In any case, income support through SSI and SSDI provides funds withwhich an individual can pay rent and meet other basic needs. Other valuablebenefits programs for which persons with mental illness may be eligible in-clude Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, and ben-efits available to veterans through the Veterans Administration. Rules and procedures for accessing disability entitlement programs are difficult for many with mental illness to understand. There is also a shortage ofstaff at community mental health agencies who are trained to provide assis-tance to clients who may qualify for either entitlement program. It is morecommon than not for first-time applications for entitlements to be denied, at aminimum causing a delay in benefits for qualified applicants. Because theseentitlements are frequently the only legitimate source of income for many withmental illness, such delays can lead to homelessness and such \"survival crimes\"as shoplifting and bill evasion. The issue of accessing government benefits is also examined in the sec- tions of this report that look at the release of people with mental illness fromjails and their reentry to the community from prison (see Policy Statement 13:Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility and Policy Statement 21: De-velopment of Transition Plan). Because many people with mental illness com-ing out of jail or prison have no other means of support, linkage with appropri-ate government benefits in a timely manner can make the difference betweensuccess and failure in the community. As discussed elsewhere in the report,cChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 39: Consumer and Family Member Involvement275 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmental health provider agencies must work with partners in jails and prisons to establish protocols that will result in people with mental illness gaining speedyaccess to appropriate benefits. Mental health agencies must train staff to provide assistance with applica- tions for SSI and SSDI and the follow-up that is so often needed to secure thesebenefits. Further, they must ensure that case managers, employment counse-lors, rehabilitation therapists, and others who may be working with clients tosecure employment are familiar with the each client's benefits profile. An in-crease in income can mean an end to benefits. When clients are working, espe-cially when they are doing so through \"transitional employment\" or \"supportedemployment\" programs, staff should make sure that their transition does notleave them without health insurance or sufficient funds for housing and food.The rules and regulations applied by the Social Security Administration to theseprograms can create challenges for staff to provide guidance to clients on en-titlement and benefit matters. It can also be time-consuming. Training andprioritization of this service are necessary if clients are to access supports in-tended to help them at a difficult time in their lives. Example: International Center for Clubhouse Development The International Center for Clubhouse Development (ICCD) publishes standards for programs that receive its certification. Among its most firmly held principles is theimportance of employment in the recovery of clubhouse \"members.\" In the ICCDstandards are two that are meant to encourage training and consistency in maintainingthe benefits of members who are working in transitional or more competitive employ-ment. Clubhouses receiving ICCD certification are expected to provide sufficient train-ing to ensure appropriate access to benefits by clubhouse members.276 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 40: Cultural Competency Cultural Competency POLICY STATEMENT #40 Ensure that racial, cultural, and ethnic minorities receive mental health services that are appropriate for their needs. Among the many barriers to appropriate treat- ment that people with mental illness must negoti-ate, those arising from cultural differences can makea profound difference in the quality of care a personreceives. To supplement the groundbreaking 1999report on mental health, the U.S. Surgeon Generalin 2001 issued Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity , in which the disparities in mental health treatment are documented and discussed. The mainmessage of the supplemental report is: \"culturecounts.\" It states, \"The cultures that patients comefrom shape their mental health and affect the kindsof mental health services they use. Likewise, thecultures of the clinician and the service system af-fect diagnosis, treatment, and the organization andfinancing of services. Cultural and social influencesare not the only influences on mental health andservice delivery, but they have been historically un-derestimated\u2014 and they do count . Cultural differ- ences must be accounted for to ensure that minori- ties, like all Americans, receive mental healthcaretailored to their needs.\" 35 Failure to provide mental health services in a culturally sensitive context al-40 most certainly results in higher numbers of peoplewith mental illness from racial, cultural, and ethnicminorities in our nation's jails and prisons. The Surgeon General's supplemental report collects many of the studies that have demonstratedboth the particular needs of different cultural andethnic groups, and the availability, utilization, andeffectiveness of mental health services for the dif-ferent groups. It is clear that African Americans,Native Americans and Alaska Natives, Asian Ameri-cans and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic Americansmay all present symptoms of distress or mental ill-ness according to certain idioms of distress that areparticular to their cultures. Members of each of thesegroups may also be more likely to seek and acceptalternative therapies than are their white counter-parts. In many cases, these alternative therapiesare seen as much more acceptable or consistent withcultural norms than the dominant modes of treat-ment practiced in the mental health system mightbe. Within each of these broad groups there existnarrower cultural subgroups, making it difficult foroutsiders to approach a person showing symptoms 35. Office of the Surgeon General, Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity - A Report of the Surgeon General , Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Mental Health Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental277 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONof mental illness with any certainty about how of- fers of treatment, for example, will be understoodor accepted. There is a great deal of data that demonstrate the unevenness with which mental illness falls onmembers of the cultural minority groups. The pub-lic system has, to date, been guilty ofundertreatment of some mental illnesses in somecultures and what might be called overtreatment ofothers. The thrust of the Surgeon General's supple- mental report and of much that has been publishedabout mental health care for members of differentcultures is that policymakers and practitioners musttake the time to understand mental illness and treat-ment in cultural terms so that suffering within vari-ous cultural groups that goes either undetected orimproperly treated can be abated. Recruit members of minority communities for clinical and admin- istrative positions in which there is regular client contact. The quest for cultural competency has been under way in the public men- tal health field for some time, but the results to date are mixed. With so manydifferent cultural groups now living side by side in our society, it would be diffi-cult for mental health practitioners or agencies to develop expertise in eachone. It is reasonable, however, for agencies to approach the challenge in a man-ner similar to the approach suggested by the Surgeon General's office in com-piling its supplemental report. That is, it makes sense for each agency to iden-tify practitioners with the cultural understanding and, if applicable, the languageskills to communicate effectively with the cultures most highly represented inthe community. The underrepresentation of minorities among mental healthproviders, administrators, policymakers, and consumer and family organiza-tions only helps to perpetuate the system's disparities. Agencies should be en-couraged to recruit members of minority communities to fill clinical and contactpositions. Example: North Carolina Area Health Education Centers Since 1985, the North Carolina Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program has received special state funding to bring its educational services, training programs,and information services to the community mental health facilities in the state. Recog-nizing that a significant percentage of mental health clients in the public system arefrom minority groups, yet that the majority of mental health professionals are notminorities, AHECs promote the recruitment of racial and ethnic minority students intomental health professions through special regional programs.278 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectcProvide training in cultural issues to all staff members in contact with clients. At the same time, each agency should make sure that every staff member who comes in contact with clients has training that will allow him or her torecognize cultural clues in a person's presentation and response to offered ser-vices. Cultural competency training itself is evolving, but it is clear that for themental health system to meet its responsibilities to all in the communities itserves, mental health professionals must develop an understanding of the rolesof age, gender, race, ethnicity, and culture in the manifestation of mental illnessand its research and treatment. A culturally informed training curriculum isessential if the system is to advance in this area. Example: Pacific Clinics (CA) Pacific Clinics, a provider of behavioral health care services in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties in California, has made a priority of establish-ing services to meet the needs of different cultural groups. Many of their 50 sitesinclude staff from Spanish-speaking cultures who can provide culturally sensitiveservices to Latino clients. Pacific Clinics also has developed services that are sensi-tive to the needs of the multiple Asian populations living in that part of California.Services at the clinics include links to culture-specific f amily and consumer groups, as well. Develop targeted outreach programs to make services available to members of minority communities. Members of cultural and linguistic minority groups not only have a more difficult time than others accessing services, many simply fail to consider seek-ing help when they need it. To many in minority communities, the system isremote and frightening, especially when no one working in it appears to sharetheir language or experience. Deep-seated values can also result in even greaterstigma within some cultural groups than exist in the general population. It is therefore very important for local agencies and the public mental health system in general to seek innovative ways to reach out to cultural minorities intheir service areas. Outreach can and should take into account the cultural andlinguistic barriers that may be standing between people in need and the ser-vices that could help them. One effective way to do this is to tailor outreachapproaches to specific groups by using their language and by forming partner-ships with cultural institutions that traditionally serve specific communities.In many parts of the country, for instance, mental health agencies have soughtto improve outreach to African-American populations by forming collaborativerelationships with churches in their communities.bChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 40: Cultural Competency279 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Mental Health Association of New York City (NY) In 1998, the Mental Health Association of New York City extended its LifeNet help line service to the city's Hispanic community by creating Ayudese , a Spanish-language 24 -hour referral and education toll-free telephone service. In 2000, the help line servicebecame available to members of New York's largest Asian communities when a newnumber was created to provide information and referrals in Mandarin and Cantonese.The service is advertised on posters in different languages that are carried in the city'ssubway cars. In a recent pilot project, police in eight of the city's police precinctscarried LifeNet referral cards in different languages to give to people they perceived tobe in need of services. Example: Haitian Mental Health Clinic, Cambridge (MA) Operated through Cambridg e Hospital, the Haitian Mental Health Clinic provides cul- turally and linguistically appropriate ambula tory mental health care for first-and sec- ond-generation immigrants of the Haitian community of metropolitan Boston, includ-ing individual and family treatment f or adults and children, long-term and short-term therapy, crisis intervention, psychological testing, and psychopharmacology within amanaged care framework, encouraging preventive and primary care.280 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 41: Workforce Workforce POLICY STATEMENT #41 Determine the adequacy of the current mental health workforce to meet the needs of the system's clients. Like other segments of the human services field, the public mental health system is experienc- ing significant difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to provide appropriate servicesand to effectively manage the myriad agencies on which it relies at the community level. Constrained state budgets and tightly capped reimbursementrates result in salaries for line staff and other pro- fessionals that are barely competitive with fields requiring far less professional commitment and re-sponsibility. Mental health officials in many states report difficulty in filling positions at the service provision level. Some positions remain vacant forlong periods of time. Officials also report high rates of turnover in sensitive line positions in both hospi- tals and community agencies. In many agencies,ironically, the pathways for career advancement lead only to management positions where clinical skills and experience may take a back seat to other at-tributes. As a result, mental health agencies can find themselves with few experienced clinicians meet- ing clients and poorly prepared managers dealingwith increasingly complex reimbursement, staffing, and planning issues. Case managers are, arguably, the most impor- tant link in an individualized, community-based system. Theoretically, they should be the most con- stant face of the system to consumers and their im-mediate families. However, most consumers who have received services in community mental health centers for any length of time report that they haveseen their case managers turn over steadily. More-41 over, many complain that their case managers arealmost universally young, inexperienced, minimally trained, and paid on a par with people working at McDonald's. Many consumers report that they\u2014theconsumers\u2014know far more about the mental health system and how it works than do the case manag- ers they are meant to rely on. At the same time, mental health workers with the ability to provide services with particular sensi- tivity to cultural, language, or age-related needs arein especially short supply in many areas. At a time when awareness of the need for culturally sensitive services has grown, it is a sad truth that providersin many communities simply cannot attract the workers needed to implement those services. It is evident that there are any number of rea- sons for high vacancy and turnover rates. The jobs entail stressful workloads and conditions, while com- manding little public respect or compensation. Re-ality may not jibe with expectations or training, and paperwork and other bureaucratic imperatives place an additional set of burdens on workers who mayhave a genuine desire to serve people in need. More- over, staff currently entering the field may find themselves in agencies oriented only toward sur-vival and not toward achieving the high expecta- tions that should be the hallmark of the community mental health system. Services researchers mustthoroughly examine the factors involved in workforce recruitment and retention, and steps must be taken to address the gaps evident in the field.Without significant improvement in this area, many281 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectHealth, 2001. 36. Little Hoover Commission, Young Hearts and Minds: Making a Commitment to Children's Mental Health , Sacra-aRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONof the important recommendations in this report will not be implemented, simply because competent staff will not be available to do the necessary work. Example: California State Task Force A California statute created a task force led by the De- partment of Mental Health to identify options for meet-ing the staffing needs of state and county health, hu- man services, and criminal justice agencies. Also inCalifornia, the Center for Health Professions at the Uni-versity of California, San Francisco, has created theCalifornia Workforce Initiative to look broadly at needsin the health care workforce, including the behavioralhealth care field. 36 Plan to increase the supply of skilled and experienced mental health providers. Using data from research, policymakers and state legislators should con- sider steps that will ensure availability of sufficient resources to attract quali- fied workers to the mental health field and to make work in the mental healthfield an attractive career choice for those with an aptitude for provision of sup- portive services. At the same time, state mental health officials should under- take efforts designed to raise the professional standing of mental health fieldworkers and others involved in providing mental health services. Working in concert with universities and other entities outside the public mental health system, officials should develop degree or certificate programs that recognizeand reward life experience that can be converted to credentials acceptable to regulatory, licensing, and reimbursement bodies. Efforts should also be made to provide financial or other incentives that will attract workers to the mentalhealth field. For example, tuition loan forgiveness or support programs should be implemented. Innovative opportunities for professional development and advancement should be increased. Example: Ohio Residency/Traineeship Program, Ohio Department of Mental Health Since 1947, the Ohio Department of Mental Health (ODMH) has funded the training of psychiatric residents, psychology students, graduate-level nurses, and social workersto provide services to persons in Ohio's public mental health system. This program isseen as critical in the development of high-quality and high- performance mentalhealth clinicians. Recruitment and retention is closely linked to experience gainedand expertise fostered in this program. ODMH works in partnership with local mentalhealth systems and institutions of higher education to implement this initiative. Example: Mental Health Worker Certificate Program, Walnut (CA) A new project at Mt. San Antonio College/Regional Health Occupations Center in Walnut, California, will create a competency-based certificate program for entry- levelmental health workers. The program expects to contribute to a more prepared mentalhealth workforce. The curriculum includes 64 hours classroom study and 6 months'clinical practice experience. It expects to train between 20 and 50 workers over a six-month period.282 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectPromote the employment of current and former clients in the pro- vision of mental health services. The mental health system's own clients may represent a ready reservoir of talent that can supply workers for many positions in the field. An expandingbody of research shows that consumers of mental health services bring skills and compassion to such frontline positions. Training programs should be devel- oped to maintain high standards of care and full integration of consumers intothe workforce. Programs that ensure appropriate support for consumers work- ing in mental health services should be developed at local agencies. Agencies should also come to consensus on the ethical issues raised by the inclusion ofconsumers in the mental health workforce; seeing a possible compromise to patient confidentiality, some agencies prohibit their clients from taking on pro- vider positions, while others have founds ways to minimize the issue. Finally,state systems and provider agencies must find ways to substitute experience for education in qualifications for case management and other frontline posi- tions. This may require negotiations with a state Medicaid authority so thatproviders can bill for experienced peer counselor activities, thus eliminating a major obstacle to consumer employment. Example: New Jersey Division of Mental Health Services, Department of Human Services The New Jersey Division of Mental Health Services, Department of Human Services, wanted to open the way for employment of consumers as peer counselors in AssertiveCommunity Treatment programs operated in many of the state's counties. While the benefits of this initiative seemed obvious to the division, Medicaid reimbursementregulations were a barrier. The state Medicaid agency's willingness to defer to statemental health agency guidelines made it possible for this plan to move forward. Provide training that specifically addresses the consumer and fam- ily experience of mental illness. While ongoing training of all mental health workers is necessary to ensure familiarity with developments in the field and to address deficits in trainingreceived prior to employment, specific training by consumers and family mem- bers can help mental health workers better understand the needs of those they serve. Exposure to the experiences of primary consumers of mental health ser-vices and their families can provide insights that do not come from much of the training received in classroom or credentialing situations. Example: NAMI Training Courses State NAMI affiliates in fourteen states have presented a comprehensive course for providers that is taught by mixed teams of consumers and family members. Classes are presented throughout the year and with significant state mental health agencysupport in Vermont, Connecticut, Missouri, and Utah. The purpose of the course is toacquaint providers with the firsthand e xperience of mental illness . Evaluations of early classes indicate that staff have changed clinical practice as a result of what theyhave learned in the course.cbChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 41: Workforce283 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmento, CA, October 2001, pp. 63-66. 37. Examples can be found at the WICHE Web site:www.wiche.edu/mentalhealth/Frontier/index.htmThe need for training and cross-training of professionals is addressed else- where in this report but must be mentioned here again for emphasis (see Chapgter VI: Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating the Com- munity). With workforce issues, including job frustration and burnout, loomingas large problems in the mental health field, staff training is a tremendously important function. A workforce in which individuals have a firm grasp of their role and of the options open to them in the performance of their duties will provide a more professional response to the challenges faced in the field. Plan to increase the supply of skilled and experienced mental health providers in rural areas. A separate but very much related issue is the acute shortage of mental health workers in many rural areas. Particularly in the rural West, where popu- lation density is low, recruitment of psychiatrists and other skilled profession- als presents an enormous challenge. Many counties report vacancies in keypositions lasting several years. Community mental health therefore takes on a different look in rural areas, especially in the West. Care may be delivered by whatever professionals are available. Primary care physicians often take onthe role of psychiatrist in rural communities, and telemedicine and other tech- niques that allow few professionals to cover vast areas are widely employed. Wide distances distort the meaning of \"community\" mental health, and institu-tional care at state hospitals many hours' drive from home can be more com- mon. Practices that have proven effective in more densely populated districts are often simply impractical in rural areas. The unique needs of people with mental illness in rural states have been explored in detail by the Mental Health Program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE), in Boulder, Colorado. By collect-ing and analyzing data on mental health services in frontier counties (fewer than seven persons per square mile), WICHE has identified the greater chal- lenges in service provision. At the same time, policymakers and providers instates with large rural areas have worked to identify services that are effective in such settings. 37 Another organization that focuses on the issues in rural mental health is the National Association for Rural Mental Health (NARMH). Founded in 1977 in order to develop and enhance rural mental health and substance abuse ser- vices and to support mental health providers in rural areas, NARMH has addedthe goal of developing and supporting initiatives that will strengthen the voices of rural consumers and their families. Both WICHE and NARMH address recruitment and retention issues in the rural mental health workforce. 38 NARMH maintains a job bank on its Web site and provides information on recruitment through its annual conference.d284 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONAccountability POLICY STATEMENT #42 Establish and utilize performance measures to promote accountabil- ity among systems administrators, funders, and providers. The purpose of performance measures is to evaluate and monitor how well a system responsiblefor providing mental health care is performing: toreport the information in quantitative terms and todirect the system's efforts and resources towarddesirable goals. The fundamental problem with de-fining such a set of indicators is the lack of consen-sus on these goals and, therefore, the lack of defini-tion of what constitutes \"good\" performance. The various stakeholders of the mental health system\u2014consumers, family members, advocates,providers, purchasers, and policymakers\u2014oftenhave different expectations of the system. A pur-chaser may emphasize efficiency and cost, while a42 consumer may consider outcomes more important.One stakeholder may define a good system as onethat contains costs and increases consumer satis-faction; another stakeholder may consider a systemsuccessful when it helps a consumer to participateproductively in the life of the community. These dif-ferent values and expectations of stakeholders in asystem help to shape the character of the perfor-mance measurement system. They also shape thegoals and objectives of the system, which, in turn,determine selection and ranking of performance in-dicators and the criteria by which performance isjudged to be adequate. (See Chapter VIII: Measur-ing and Evaluating Outcomes.)Chapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 42: Accountability Utilize performance measures in budgeting, contracting, and man- aging mental health services. Different stakeholders also have different uses for performance measures. Payers, for instance, need performance indicators to make purchasing deci-sions and to ensure that contract provisions are met. Consumers may use infor-mation on performance to make enrollment decisions, choose providers, andtrack quality and responsiveness of the different systems of care available to285 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectthem. Providers need performance measures for quality management and im- provement purposes. Accreditation agencies are incorporating performance mea-sures to monitor adherence to regulations and standards and to guide accredi-tation and program-review decisions. Finally, governmental entities needperformance measures for policymaking, purchasing decisions, budget formu-lation, and monitoring accountability. Performance measures are one set of tools in the arsenal of efforts intended to improve quality, management, and accountability. Often, they are used as akey component of ongoing management functions such as planning, qualityimprovement/management, contract management, and accountability. The fo-cus of management is to monitor and improve (or maintain) levels of perfor-mance: performance measures are quantitative, measurable ways to do so. Per-formance measures can be used effectively in planning/budget systems, qualityimprovement/management systems, and in contracts management. Example: New York State Office of Mental Health Center for Performance Evaluation and Outcomes Management The New York State Office of Mental Health has created the Center for Performance Evaluation and Outcomes Management to develop performance measures and associ- ated performance targets for each priority initiative and major sector of the publicmental health system and to evaluate the outcomes associated with each initiative. Involve consumers and families in mental health service evaluation. Evaluation of mental health services by those who use them is an extremely valuable gauge of the system's effectiveness. One way to tap the energy, com-mitment, and hard-earned knowledge of mental health consumers and familymembers is to engage them in the independent evaluation of services. Consum-ers and family members can help design surveys and \"report cards\" on services.With consumer and family participation, it is more likely that report cards willreflect real-life experiences of consumers: Did they get help applying for ben-efits? Did they receive help in finding housing and/or employment? Were theytreated with respect? Consumers and families generally respond to such surveys if they feel the results will be made known to them and will lead to any corrective measuresindicated. In some places, consumers and family members have gone beyondthese efforts to form consumer satisfaction teams, which work with the systemto formally evaluate services through site visits, surveys, and interviews withclients. When efforts of this nature are paired with a commitment by providersto make improvements in services based on the team's findings, significantprogress can be made.b286 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Consumer Surveys, Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Under the auspices of the Center for Mental Health Services and its Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program, consumers and professionals have worked togetherto develop consumer surveys that are now in use in a number of states. Thesesurveys, which in some states have been translated into Spanish, Cambodian, tradi-tional Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, and Vietnamese, among other languages, providean opportunity for consumers to indicate how well services do or do not work for them. Example: Consumer Satisfaction Team, Philadelphia (PA) In 1990, a Consumer Satisfaction Team (CST) was developed in Philadelphia. At the time, a state hospital was closing and patients from the hospital were being trans-ferred to community services. Family members and consumers, skeptical of the system's commitment to provide adequate services, coalesced to form the CST. The consumersand family members w on support of local authorities for incorporation of the CST's findings in the overall evaluation of the system's ability to provide services in the community. Relying primarily on multiple interviews with consumers at different agen-cies, the CST was able to document consumer views on provided services. The Phila-delphia CST has served as a model for a number of state and local systems wishingto formalize methods for obtaining consumer feedback. Attach funding to outcomes. States and other government entities responsible for funding the public mental health system should employ budgeting and contracting mechanismsthat emphasize improved outcomes. Performance based budgeting and othermechanisms that allow for costs in one system to be balanced against offsets inanother - spending in the mental health system versus fewer costs in correc-tions, for example - should be considered by legislatures of states wishing tobetter understand the full implications of the policies they establish. Similarly, state mental health agencies that contract with provider agen- cies for services in communities should attach funding to the outcomes to beachieved. For example, contracts can include incentives for lower rates of ar-rest among the population served by an agency, along with safeguards thatensure the agency is not \"creaming\" or finding ways to provide services only toclients at lower risk for involvement in the criminal justice system. By their nature, performance-based budgeting and contracting mechanisms promote provision of a full spectrum of services that meet all needs experiencedby people with mental illness. Strategic placement of both incentives and ac-countability can lead to development of a system that stresses collaborationand outcomes and allows those making service decisions to make specific spend-ing decisions, as well.cChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 42: Accountability287 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectExample: Performance-based budg eting, Various states Performance-based budgeting and contracting initiatives are under way in many states across the country. While it is too early in this wave of activity to identify states thatare leading the field, it is possible for states and counties to begin to learn lessonsfrom the experiences of their counterparts in other jurisdictions. Florida, Texas, Vir-ginia, Missouri, and South Carolina are among the states that have examined orimplemented performance-based budgeting in state government. In addition, the fed-eral government is developing methods to convert existing block grants, such as theMental Health Block Grant, to \"performance partnership\" grants. Regulations for thiseffort will be issued some time in 2002.288 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectChapter VII: Elements of an Effective Mental Health System Policy Statement 43: Advocacy Advocacy POLICY STATEMENT #43 Build awareness of the need for high quality, comprehensive services and of the impact of stigma and discriminatory policies on access tothem. The stigma of mental illness is a persistent and pernicious force against which people with mental illness, their families, and those who provide ser-vices to them must continually struggle. As noted in the Surgeon General's report on mental health, stigma manifests itself in distrust, bias, fear, ste- reotyping, embarrassment, anger, and/or avoidance. Stigma derives in part from poor or incomplete un-derstanding of causes and treatment for mental dis- orders. Stigma translates into problems that must be addressed by the public mental health system if it is to provide needed services to people with mental illness. Among the most major problems is the re-luctance of nearly two-thirds of all people with di- agnosable mental illness to seek treatment. Stigma is not the only issue that discourages people in needfrom seeking treatment, but among many popula- tions, including rural populations and members of many distinct cultural groups, it clearly keeps manyaway from needed services and supports. 39 Stigma also manifests itself in negative public attitudes towards payment for mental health ser-vices. Even with passage of mental health insurance \"parity\" laws in nearly two-thirds of the states, pri- vate insurance coverage for mental illness often re-43 mains inequitable in terms of co-payments and dol- lar or durational limits on coverage. At the same time, support for public funding of mental healthprograms remains soft relative to public willingness to pay for highways, prisons, or even other health services. In recent years, a common approach by the mental heath community to the problem of stigmahas been to point out that mental illnesses are ill- nesses like any other. Much faith has been placed in the promise of research to clarify the etiology ofmental illness and to further improve treatments that already can demonstrate effectiveness compa- rable to treatments for \"accepted\" diagnoses suchas heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. While this approach to stigma and discrimination can be shown to have had some effect, it is clear that public sup-port for greater expenditure on mental health ser- vices has simply not materialized. Recent years have also seen a rise in greater awareness of other problems associated with men- tal illness, particularly within the law enforcement, judicial, and corrections fields. Low public invest-ment in mental health services has resulted in a system that often cannot adequately meet the com- plex needs of the people it is meant to serve. A stark 38. See: www.narmh.org/ 39. Office of the Surgeon General, Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon Gen- eral, p. 454.289 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONsymptom of this undervalued and underfunded sys- tem is the increase in criminal justice contact for people with mental illness. Without adequate ser-vices, many commit the petty crimes that bring them to the attention of law enforcement and the courts and that may result in stays in jail or prison. Create public support for the investment necessary to make high- quality, comprehensive mental health services available to thosewho need them. A significant effect of stigma is that it allows many in society to distance themselves from people with mental illness and the real, if complicated, social issues associated with their condition. People with mental illness, especially those in trouble with the law, are easy to dismiss as unworthy of public notice.At a minimum, they may be seen as inconsequential in the broad political cal- culus by which limited resources are allocated. Even harsher attitudes prevail when offenders with mental illness are seen exclusively as authors of their ownproblems or when they become involved in high-profile, often tragic, encoun- ters with the law. The challenge to public mental health policymakers, providers, consum- ers, and family members is to find ways to make the public aware of the experi- ence and costs of untreated mental illness. Having found that their own voices alone are ineffective in changing public attitudes, these advocates must searchfor new allies who can help to carry the message, making support for effective services a public priority. Present a common front to advocate for greater investment in im- proved mental health services. In the face of stigmatizing attitudes, increased efforts by law enforcement officials, judges, prosecutors, and corrections administrators to understand and address the causes for their increased contact with individuals with mentalillness hold the potential to increase awareness of the costs borne by society when appropriate mental health services are not delivered. By highlighting the burdens placed on their systems by people overlooked or underserved by thepublic mental health system, members of the criminal justice system have an unprecedented opportunity to help shape public opinion and public policy. In- creased public awareness of the inefficiency stemming from the current alloca-tion of resources will help to create the political will necessary to direct re- sources toward development and maintenance of comprehensive, high-quality public mental health programs. Improvement in public mental health programswill result not only in fewer criminal justice contacts by people with mental illness but, more basically, in more opportunities for people with mental illness to participate fully in society. (See Policy Statement 32: Educating the Com-munity and Building Community Awareness.)b290 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectMeasuring and Evaluating OutcomesCHAPTER VIII W 1. The subsequent policy statements do not review the elements of validating in- struments to identify a mental illness or to assess the potential of a person with mental illness to be violent. Although extremely important, and certainly needed,hen agents of change go to ex- traordinary lengths to facilitate collaboration among mental health and criminal justice stakeholders, which leads to the development of new and exciting initiatives to improve the systems' response to people with mental illness, it is essen-tial that they measure and evaluate the impact of these efforts. Too often, policymakers exhaust time and resources planning and implementing a newprogram, policy, or statute without taking the steps to ensure that they will know the results of the ini- tiative. By then, administrators need additionalresources to sustain the initiative, yet appropria- tors are insisting upon some evidence describing the impact of the program before authorizing theexpenditure of additional funds. Indeed, policymakers and organization execu- tives are right to demand such information. It of-ten rewards the initial decision to authorize the allocation of resources to a particular initiative withdata illustrating the benefits of a new program. The results of an objective, thoughtful evaluation also signal how an initiative can be improved. Further- more, the evaluation process itself facilitates qual-ity control; not every good idea is implemented well. Sometimes the results of a study reveal that a new program, policy, or legislation has had a negligibleimpact on a problem, or occasionally even exacer- bated it. The section of the Introduction to this report entitled \"Getting Started\" explains that an essen- tial first step for any jurisdiction interested in im- proving the response to people with mental illnessis to identify the problem (or problems) that leaders in the criminal justice and mental health commu- nity can agree to address. This chapter assumesthe existence of such an agreement about the prob- lem; the first policy statement underscores the im- portance of establishing practical measures of suc-cess, which will allow program funders and program administrators to determine whether they have ad- the validation of various diagnostic instruments is complex and beyond the purview of this report.291 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectdressed the problem.1 The second policy statement in this chapter reviews the elements of a program or policy that will support the data collection needed to measure the outcomes identified. The last policystatement in the chapter assumes the change agent has helped analyze an initiative's successes and fail- ures and discusses disseminating the findings. Evaluations can be extraordinarily complex and expensive undertakings. The policy statements in this chapter suggest how policymakers and prac-titioners can measure the impact of an initiative practically and efficiently. That said, any effort to obtain reliable and useful information describingan initiative's outcomes requires some resource al- location. Examples cited elsewhere in this report sometimes include a provision requiring state orlocal government officials to use a portion of the funds allocated to evaluate the impact of the pro- gram. 2 Partnering with local universities is one way to conduct an evaluation and maximize the use of existing resources.The value and usefulness of a program evalu- ation often corresponds to the degree to which vari- ous stakeholder groups are involved in identifying outcome measures, developing a data collectionprocess, and disseminating the findings. Exten- sive collaboration inevitably enhances the quality and efficiency of the evaluation. Equally impor-tant, it vastly improves the likelihood that signifi- cant segments of the community will accept the findings that the evaluation yields. That said, thischapter does not address the oversight of the evalu- ation. (For a discussion about how to collaborate effectively and establish and institutionalize part-nerships, see the section of the report Introduction entitled \"Getting Started\" and Chapter V: Improv- ing Collaboration.) 2. See, for example, The California Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program. California Board of Corrections, Mentally Ill Offender Crime ReductionGrant Program: Annual Report, June 2000. Available at www.bdcorr.ca.gov/cppd/ miocrg/miocrg_publications/miocrg_publications.htm.292 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIdentifying Outcome Measures POLICY STATEMENT # 44 Identify outcome measures that will enable policymakers and the public to assess the value and efficacy of the initiative. Change agents who have nurtured a new pro- gram, policy, or statute should, before the initiativeis implemented, determine how they will measureits success. The outcome measures identified shouldcorrelate to the specific goals of a program and theproblem it was designed to address. Program ad-ministrators and policymakers are sometimes proneto pinning the success of an effort to types of out-comes that their program could never guarantee. Selecting outcome measures that are particu- larly difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to mea-sure also undermines the value of an evaluation.For example, while determining the overall cost sav-ings that a program generates can be very valuablein persuading the legislature to maintain or increasefunding for a project, isolating such data can be ex-tremely complex. Empirical data linking a program'simpact on criminal behavior to a pilot project can beequally elusive. Longitudinal studies with randomassignment and control groups are not only an enor-mous undertaking, they also may not yield conclu-sive findings.44 Law enforcement, court, corrections, and men- tal health system officials each measure success dif-ferently, and they have developed (or are in the pro-cess of developing) performance-based measuresunique to their professions. 3 The recommendations below describe outcome measures that can be tai-lored to law enforcement, court, corrections, or men-tal health programs. In addition, these measurescan provide useful information without requiring anevaluation process that is particularly time-consum-ing or expensive to conduct. 3. See, for example, Larry Hoover, ed., Police Program Evaluation , Police Executive Research Forum, 1997; Larry Hoover, ed., Quantifying Quality in Policing , Police Ex- ecutive Research Forum, 1997.Chapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes Policy Statement 44: Identifying Outcome Measures293 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION Establish process measures to assess how well the program activi- ties have been implemented. Project funders and the public will want to know exactly what project sup- port bought. The following list describes the process outputs that programadministrators should count both before and after program implementation. Number of people served Program administrators should know the total number of people served over a specified period of time. These numbers will indicate the size of thetarget population served and the extent of each person's involvement in theprogram, enabling administrators to compare these figures with numbers pro-jected at the beginning of the effort and to understand better the makeup andneeds of the target population. Each program will identify different process measures depending on the program design and the point of intervention on the criminal justice continuum.For example, administrators of a Crisis Intervention Team should capture atleast the following data: the number of calls referred to the team; the numberof individuals referred to community-based services; the number of individualshospitalized; and the number of referrals to community-based services who re-ceived follow-up services. A pretrial services program would track the follow-ing numbers regarding the number of people served: the number of defendantsinterviewed; the number of defendants referred for a mental health assess-ment; the number of defendants recommended for pretrial release; the numberof defendants approved for pretrial release; and the number of defendants whosuccessfully comply with the conditions of release. Example: Jail Addiction Services, Clinical Assessment and Triage Services (CATS), Montgomery County (MD) The Montgomery County Clinical Assessment and Triage Services (CATS) is a team of mental health professionals at the county jail who assess new inmates suspected ofhaving a mental illness at intake and assist in determining whether it would be appro-priate for some of these inmates to be diverted to community-based mental healthtreatment. The team uses the following measures to gauge their impact: 1) number ofinmates assessed for behavioral health problems; 2) number of inmates recommended for diversion; 3) number of inmates with mental health symptoms diverted into com-munity treatment; and 4) number of in mates who are eligib le for the public mental health system.294 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectUnits of Services Whereas the figures discussed above will indicate the extent of the target population's penetration of the layers of the program, units of service indicatesthe target population's access to substance abuse and mental health services.For each person served, it is important to know the number of contacts that heor she has had with mental health and/or substance abuse treatment provid-ers. A \"contact\" could include a weekly counseling session or participation in anAlcoholics Anonymous meeting. Researchers should continue to tally the num-ber of contacts an individual has after he or she has completed a sentence orafter referral. Such information will be extremely useful in determining whethera new program has made services accessible to the target population and whethera new program has successfully engaged people with mental illness in treat-ment and/or facilitated access to services. 4 Efforts should be made to determine when there are repeated contacts with the same individual (identifiers need not be used) and whether contactsare increased or reduced before and after the project's start. Timeliness of Service Program administrators should consider using the timeliness of the ser- vice delivered as one way to measure empirically the quality of service pro-vided. For instance, jail administrators should determine how long it takes fordetainees referred for a mental health assessment following the screening to infact receive an assessment. Similarly, it is helpful to know how much timepasses after a person is released from prison before he or she makes contactwith the mental health system. Example: Montgomery County (MD) Police Department The Montgomery County Police Department uses the timeliness of service and the distribution of trained officers as several factors to help measure quality of service.The program measures the average length of time between the call to the CIT officersthe Department of Health and Human Services crisis center specialist. In addition,the police department calculates both the percentage of the patrol force that is CITcertified and the percentage of police districts that have at least one trained CITofficer assigned to each shift. Establish outcome measures that indicate the impact of the initia- tive on the person's involvement with the criminal justice systemand mental health system. Confirming a connection between a new program and some desired out- comes, such as improved public safety and providing better, or more, servicesb 4. Subsequent contacts with (or calls for service to) law enforcement, even when they do not end in arrest, are also important indicators of the extent to which the mentalhealth system has effectively engaged the individual. These contacts and other contacts with the criminal justicesystem are addressed in the subheading under the next recommendation regarding public safety. 5. The National GAINS Center for People with Co-occur- ring Disorders in the Justice System has provided technicalChapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes Policy Statement 44: Identifying Outcome Measures295 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectwith limited resources, can be extremely difficult. Nevertheless, such outcome measures are compelling and key to maintaining support from policymakersand the public. Accordingly, program administrators should identify aspects of public safety, quality of life, and cost efficiency that can be realistically measured withoutbeing irresponsible or misleading about the impact of the program on theseissues. For example, tracking whether (and how often) program participantsare re-arrested, violate a condition of release, are reincarcerated, or are re-hospitalized provides important indicators of the program's impact on the jus-tice system and a person's involvement with it. Such data, however, need re-sponsible analysis to determine when the program correlates to particular resultsor when it causes change. Public SafetyMeasures of public safety include numbers describing the following: \u0093calls for service to law enforcement \u0093calls for transportation / referral \u0093re-arrest \u0093jail admissions \u0093jail days \u0093jail or prison-based disciplinary infractions \u0093revocations of community-supervised release Other measures, although more difficult to track than the numbers above, include assaults involving people with mental illness and uses of force involv-ing a person with mental illness. Quality of lifeChanges in personal functioning measures, such as the following, enable researchers to assess how or whether an individual's quality of life has im-proved or worsened: \u0093suicidal ideation/attempts \u0093demonstrable improvement in functioning (using the scale provided in the DSM IV)6 assistance for the jail diversion programs and the Research Triangle Institute is responsible for overall program inte- gration, data management, and data analyses.

See the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), American Psychiatric Association, Washington D.C., 1994.Federally Sponsored Evaluations The federal government (particu- larly through the US Departmentof Justice and the US Departmentof Health and Human Services)plays an essential role in gener-ating knowledge about what pro-grams have demonstrated prom- ise or have proven effective in improving responses to peoplewith mental illness. Although notevery new initiative can benefitfrom a federally-sponsored evalu-ation, policymakers and practitio-ners across the country can learnfrom program evaluations that thefederal government has con-ducted\u2014especially when datasets and outcome measures arecongruent across jurisdictions.The Substance Abuse and Men-tal Health Services Administra-tion (SAMHSA), through the Cen-ter for Mental Health Services(CMHS) and the Center for Sub-stance Abuse Treatment (CSAT)has initiated a three-year Jail Di-version Knowledge Developmentand Application project to studyprograms that divert some indi-viduals with mental illness andco-occurring substance abusedisorders from jail in nine sites.The purpose of the study is todetermine when jail diversionworks, for whom, and under whatcircumstances. This evaluationeffort will capture and analyzedata both within and across ju-risdictions and should provideimportant information for thefield. 5296 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectCost Project funders will be especially interested in the costs associated with an initiative: \u0093requests for law enforcement for service \u0093jail days \u0093mental health crisis facility admissions \u0093psychiatric inpatient admissions and total days \u0093substance abuse crisis facility admissions and total days \u0093involuntary treatment costs \u0093prison days To capture the true criminal justice cost reductions that a new initiative realizes, jail and corrections administrators should attempt to calculate thereal cost of incarcerating a person with mental illness. Existing prison and jailper diem costs reflect the expense of incarcerating an average inmate. Inmateswith mental illness, however, typically absorb a disproportionately high amountof correctional resources. Although no correctional system has effectively iso-lated the cost, providing mental health services (especially when taking intoaccount the cost of escort and transportation costs) in a prison or jail is expen-sive. The bedspace for a person with mental illness in prison or jail (recall thatmany are assigned to high-security cells) may also be more expensive than theaverage inmate Corrections administrators also should attempt to capture some of the costs associated with inadequately treating mental illness in prison or jail. Thesesituations can lead to inmate-on-staff assaults, inmate-on-inmate assaults, andother use-of-force incidents, which translate into missed work days, lawsuits,and injuries to officers and inmates\u2014physically and emotionally. Such inci-dents also often increase the length of inmates' stay. Law enforcement officials should use similar measures to gauge the fiscal impact of an initiative. Reducing the time it takes for a police officer to clear acall involving a person with mental illness (while also reducing the likelihoodthat there will be a subsequent call for service) has significant cost implica-tions. Lowering rates of injuries among line staff or members of the communitywho have a mental illness is also a significant outcome. Quality of Service The preceding recommendation included as an important outcome mea- sure the timeliness of service. This performance indicator can be a useful ele-ment to consider when measuring the quality of service. Satisfaction with ser-vice, although considerably more subjective than the timeliness of service, isalso an important measure of the quality of service.Chapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes Policy Statement 44: Identifying Outcome Measures297 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectMonitor the gross numbers of people with mental illness in con- tact with\u2014or under the supervision of\u2014the criminal justice system Improving the effectiveness and the accessibility of mental health services should reduce the number of people with mental illness who are in contact withthe criminal justice system. (See Policy Statement 1: Involvement with theMental Health System.) Indeed, the overrepresentation of people with mentalillness in the criminal justice system is, in part, what prompted the Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project . Accordingly, assuming state and local government officials have provided criminal justice officials with sufficienttools and guidance to identify people with mental illness, they should track thegross numbers of people with mental illness (or, in the case of law enforcement'scontact with a person with mental illness, those individuals who exhibit signs ofpotential mental illness) at each stage on the criminal justice continuum (i.e.,arrest, detention, probation, etc.). Such data should also include demographicinformation (e.g., age, race, gender) regarding this population.c298 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONCollecting Data POLICY STATEMENT #45 Ensure mechanisms are in place to capture data consistent with the process and outcome measures identified. Once officials have determined the criteria they will use to measure the impact of the program, theyneed to be sure they will capture the relevant data.In addition, they need to establish a baseline, whichserves as a benchmark against which progress canbe measured. Implementing many of the policy statements in this report should facilitate the collection of datathat would accomplish both these goals. For in-stance, Policy Statement 2: Request for Police Ser-vice explains the value of tagging calls for assistancethat appear to involve a person with mental illness.45 Policy Statement 11: Pretrial Release / DetentionHearing addresses the importance of screening apretrial defendant for mental illness. Policy State-ment 13: Intake at County / Municipal DetentionFacility and Policy Statement 17: Receiving andIntake of Sentenced Inmates provides for screeningpeople with mental illness when they enter a jail orprison. The recommendations below suggest howstate and local government officials can capitalizeon these and other opportunities to assemble valu-able data. Agree upon common definitions of mental illness and the charac- teristics of the general target population. Researchers studying various initiatives that target people with mental illness have cited inconsistent definitions of mental illness and uneven quali-ties of documentation as a major obstacle to evaluating effectively the impact ofa program. 7 7. Polly Phipps and Gregg Gagliardi, Implementation of Washington's Dangerous Mentally Ill Offender Law: Prelimi-nary Findings, Washington State Institute for Public Policy, March 2002.Chapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes Policy Statement 45: Collecting Data299 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project8. Ibid, Appendix G, p. 67.Although mental illness diagnoses are complex, and insisting upon a pre- cise diagnosis is problematic, it is reasonable and wise to ensure partners use common definitions. Example: Dangerous Mentally Ill Offender (DMIO) Program (WA) When the Washington State Institute for Public Policy conducted a pr eliminary review of the DMIO program, it recommended that the agencies charged with implementingthe program needed \"to come to an agreement about which objective criteria (diagno-sis, functional impairment) will qualify a candidate as mentally ill for the purposes ofthe DMIO program.\" Department of Corrections officials, while noting that agenciesalready were using a \"working definition\" for \"major mental disorder,\" concurred thatreviewing and resolving differences in the definitions adopted by the committee anddefinitions already employed by DOC would be useful. 8 For the data to be particularly useful, it is important that the target popu- lation share other common denominators, such as the age of the group (juve- niles or adults) and the presence of a co-occurring disorder (e.g., mental illnessonly or mental illness and a co-occurring substance abuse disorder). Of course, detailed definitions of the target population alone will not en- sure that evaluators are analyzing data for a population that shares similarmental health status and/or criminal history. Training staff on the application of this definition to the client population is essential. Capitalize on existing management information systems to facili- tate data collection and analysis. Automated management information systems reduce paperwork, main- tain data in an organized fashion, and provide quick access to information. Data collections that can easily draw from these systems can reduce the time it takesto capture data, ensure the information is collected in a consistent format, andenable quick analysis of the information. For example, law enforcement offi-cials could add a field to police record management systems, which would en-able law enforcement to record information, after a call is cleared, about suc- cessful referrals to community-based services. Example: Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program (CA) The state law that established the Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Pro- gram requires counties receiving a grant to conduct an evalua tion of their project that includes outcome and performance measures. To assist counties in assembling dataneeded for the evalua tion, the Board of Corrections (which oversees the grant pro- gram) tapped three existing databases: 1) the State Department of Mental Health'sClient and Services Information (CSI) System, which captures various data regardingdiagnoses, demographic information, and lifestyle information; 2) the Medi-Cal/CSIBilling systems, which net data regarding the health and support services that eachclient uses; and 3) the State's Adult Performance Outcome System, which capturesb300 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectdata for each client regarding the results of two of three mental health instruments administered at the beginning of mental health treatment and at regular intervalsthereafter. 9 Example: Dangerous Mentally Ill Offender (DMIO) Program (WA) In evaluating the quality and quantity of pre-release and post-release services that the target population received, the Washington Public Policy Institute relied in part ondetailed notes that community corrections officers entered into the state Departmentof Correction's Offender Based Tracking System (OBTS) electronic database. Solicit comments and opinions from staff, crime victims, family members, and program participants. Program staff, crime victims and program participants and their family members can be extremely helpful in informing policymakers how a new pro-gram or initiative has affected lives and systems. To that end, policymakersshould encourage administrators to collect anecdotal data from these stake- holder groups. Indeed, information about their satisfaction with a new policy or program is often as important as empirical data regarding the impact of theprogram. Program administrators should survey crime victims, asking them whether they felt that they had been sufficiently informed about developments in thecase and whether they had been adequately consulted, given the requirements of the existing state law. Obtaining feedback from practitioners is also essential. Example: Jail Diversion Program, Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) DMHAS officials conducted a written survey of judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and other court officials, asking them to what extent they agreed with statementsregarding the jail diversion program, such as the following: 1) it saves the court time;2) it gives unfair advantage to the defendants; 3) it protects the rights of the defen-dant; 4) it saves the state money; and 5) it reduces risks to the community. Theyincluded the results in a report submitted to the General Assembly. This reporthelped to convince the Connecticut State Legislature to expand funding for the JailDiversion Project to create diversion programs statewide. Example: Mobile Crisis Team (MCT), Montgomery County (MD) The MCT provides emergency mental health services to individuals at any location in the jurisdiction to attempt to stabilize the situation at the least restrictive level pos- sible. Clients who requested the MCT are surveyed regarding their level of satisfac-tion with the response. In surveying people with mental illness who participated in the program, interviewers should ask about the individual's level of satisfaction with his orher housing situation, employment status, or relationships with loved ones. 9. California Board of Corrections, Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program , p. 7.cChapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes Policy Statement 45: Collecting Data301 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project10. Ibid.Some jurisdictions have taken additional steps to collect empirical data regarding the qualitative impact of the initiative. Example: Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program (CA) The Board of Corrections, which oversees the grant program, developed a methodol- ogy to evaluate the program. Thir teen of the 15 counties that are grant sites are employing this experimental design. Randomly selected treatment and comparisongroups are assessed at least twice (before and after the intervention) with the sameinstruments over the same period of time. Records are kept for every project partici-pant (in both the comparison and treatment groups) and must include any services orinterventions received and a definition those services. 10 Establish procedures early in the process to share information that will facilitate the data collection of people served by both thecriminal justice and mental health systems. Criminal justice and mental health officials sometimes let laws and regu- lations protecting the privacy of people served by the mental health systemserves prevent efforts to collect data and conduct evaluations. There are ways,however, for researchers to respect these mandates and still obtain data that will inform an evaluation. For example, to determine whether an initiative has been effective in maintaining contact between a community mental health pro-vider and a person referred by the police, courts, or corrections, criminal justiceofficials do not necessarily need records regarding a particular person's atten-dance at a clinic. Instead, information in the aggregate would serve the same purpose. In addition, researchers do not necessarily need to have access to a mental health provider's records to determine the units of service provided to aparticular individual. Requesting that the provider simply check its records for a particular person would accomplish the same goals. Example: Crisis and Engagement Services, Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division, Dept. of Community and Human Services, King County (WA) The King County Department of Comm unity and Human Services conducted a cross- system e xamination of the costs or providing services to a group of \"high utilizers of drug and alcohol acute services.\" T his evaluation included costs associated with jail time, inpatient psychiatric services, substance abuse crisis services, involuntary treat-ment costs, and emergency room admissions . To minimize information-sharing ob- stacles, the Mental Health, Chemical Abuse and Dependency Services Division firstcollected information concerning the use of mental health and substance abuse ser-vices under their supervision. The division then asked the jail and local emergencyroom to provide information that w as cross-referenced with the initial list to determine which individuals were utilizing multiple services during a one-year period. d302 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectChapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes Policy Statement 46: Dissemenating Findings aRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATIONDissemenating Findings POLICY STATEMENT # 46 Publicize program successes as appropriate to the media, public, and appropriators Once agents of change have completed an evalu- ation, they should share the results of their find- ings with various audiences. In most cases, dissemi- nating information about the impact of the program46 is essential to build support for a new initiative, tofacilitate the replication of a pilot project, or to en- gage additional partners. This policy statement suggests three ways to accomplish these goals. Capitalize on existing networks of advocacy groups to publicize program results By tapping its national network, an advocacy group, such as a local Mental Health Association or affiliate of NAMI (Alliance for the Mentally Ill), can be ex-traordinarily effective in spreading the word about a new and promising initiative. Example: Crisis Intervention Team, Memphis (TN) The Memphis CIT was established as a result of a collaborative effort among the Memphis Police Department and various leaders in the community, including mem-bers of the NAMI. Training is an important component of the CIT initiative, and NAMImembers play a key role in administering the training program for police officers.NAMI hosts an annual awards dinner for officers serving on the CIT and has also beenhelpful in trumpeting the results that Professor Randolph Dupont has documented:the response time for a CIT officer on a crisis call averages 5 to 10 minutes, ascompared with other models where police take 30 to 50 minutes. NAMI's promotion ofthese and other data at its conventions and on its website has facilitated replication ofthe CIT model in communities across the country. Advertise positive program results in local media outlets When the results of an evaluation confirm the value of a new initiative, policymakers and practitioners should publicize the data. In this regard, pressb303 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectkits that briefly highlight the findings and provide contact information for pro- gram spokespersons can be extremely effective. It is important to identify spokespersons who the media or the public might not immediately associate with the issue. For example, a mental health advo-cate or provider might be expected to talk about the value of en effective com- munity-based mental health program. On the other hand, law enforcement officials, corrections administrators, or other criminal justice practitioners whoexplain how effective mental health services have improved public safety can be particularly compelling. Example: Trauma, Addictions Mental Health and Recovery (TAMAR) Program (MD) Preliminary research regarding rearrest rates among women participating in TAMAR has been impressive. Wardens and other correctional administrators of facilities incounty jails where the TAMAR program has been established have made presentationsfor county commissioners and state legislators citing these data to help explain thevalue of the initiative. Elected officials have responded by promoting the replicationof the program and publicizing its value to the state and counties in public hearings. Example: Partners in Crisis (FL) Linda Gregory, the widow of a deputy sheriff shot and killed by Alan Singletary (a person with a history of untreated mental illness) and Alice Petree, Alan Singletary'ssister, are members of Partners in Crisis, a coalition of leaders in the criminal justiceand mental health system in Florida. Partners in Crisis conducted public serviceannouncements across Florida featuring Ms. Gregory and Ms. Petree who explainedthe value of access to effective mental health services. Create clearinghouses at the state and local level that provide in- formation regarding the availability of services people with mental illness coming into contact with the criminal justice system. Clearinghouses can help to advertise new initiatives that are promising and spread the word about valuable lessons learned in other communities. Example: Texas Council on Offenders with Mental Impairments The Texas Council on Offenders with Mental Impairments is statutorily responsible for providing technical assistance and information to local and state criminal justiceentities regarding alternatives to incarceration for those with special needs. Thecouncil comprises individuals from throughout the state who represent every facet oflocal and state criminal justice systems. These board members are responsible forcollecting information from the field and bringing it to the council for review andresponse. Establishing for one jurisdiction an organization that will serve as a clear- inghouse around criminal justice and mental health issues exclusively may be unrealistic, but adding this function to an existing entity is often feasible. For example, the mental health agency funding community programs or an entityor person reporting to the court (e.g., pretrial services, probation, mental health court staff) regarding the availability of community-based services could be- come a locus of information.c\"We need to better demonstrate theeffectiveness of the kindsof programs inthis whatworks, Maryland Division of CorrectionAppendices306 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectGlossary1Appendix A 1.

These programs include vari-ous community-implemented trea tment programs and facilities. arraignment \u2014 The first appearance in court of an individual after arrest at which the individual is informed of the chargesand a pretrial release/detention decision is made. assertive case management \u2014 An intensive form of case manag ement intended to help pa tients to increase daily-task func- tioning, residential stability, and independence, and to reducetheir hospitalizations. Assertive case management substantiallyreduces inpatient service use, promotes continuity of outpatientcare, and increases community tenure and residence stability forpeople with serious mental illness. 3 Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) \u2014 Sometimes referred to as Program of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT).A team-based approach to the provision of treatment, rehabilita-tion, and support services. ACT/PACT models of treatment are built around a self-contained multidisciplinary team that servesas the fixed point of responsibility for all patient care for a fixed group of patients. In this approach, normally used with clientswith severe and persistent mental illness, the treatment teamtypically provides all patient services using a highly integratedapproach to care. 4 assessment \u2014 An examination, more comprehensive than a screening, performed on each newly admitted detainee (or in-mate) soon after arrival at an institution. It usually includes areview of the medical screening, behavior observations, an in-quiry into any mental health history, and an assessment of sui-cide potential. atypical antipsychotics \u2014 Also known as second-genera- are known as \"atypical\" because they are generally moreeffective in symptom reduction than the earlier generation ofantipsychotic medications, without the side-effect profile typicalof those medications. 5 bail \u2014 A condition of pretrial release in which an individual who has been arrested must pay a specified amount to obtain307 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectrelease. The purpose of bail is to assure the appearance of the accused at all court proceedings. behavioral health care \u2014 An encompassing term including assessment and treatment of mental and/or psychoactive sub-stance abuse disorders. 6 blood levels of medication \u2014 The amount of a medication present at any given time within the inmate's blood system\u2014used to determine whether a correct, or optimal, dosing regimenis being used in order to achieve therapeutic effects. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) \u2014 The BPRS is an 18-item rating scale used for evaluating psychiatric symptomchange. Developed by John Overall, Ph.D., and D. R. Gorham,Ph.D., the BPRS provides an efficient, clinician-based means toassess a large number of psychiatric symptom constructs. TheBPRS generates valid patient information covering the full spec-trum of psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., bipolar disorder, major de-pression, schizophrenia, psychosis, and anxiety). call for service \u2014 When police are called to respond to some event; does not necessarily indicate that a crime has been com-mitted. Typically, when police respond to calls, they are referredto as \"out of service.\" case management \u2014 A range of services provided to assist and support patients in developing their skills to gain access toneeded medical, behavioral health, housing, employment, social,educational, and other services essential to meeting basic hu-man services; linkages and training for patient served in the useof basic community resources; and monitoring of overall servicedelivery. This service is generally provided by staff whose pri-mary function is case management. 7 case-rcase-rcase-rcase-rcase-r aaaaated fundingted fundingted fundingted fundingted funding \u2014 Payment to the provider based on one glo- bal fee for the patient case, regardless of the servicesrendered. 8 A system within each correctional facility/agency for determining and reviewing the level of security required byeach inmate, based upon history, current charges, behavior, andperceived risk of violence or elopement. clinical informatics \u2014 The use of information technology and standardized protocols (e.g., algorithms or decision trees) toevaluate and treat inmates for mental health or health problems. clubhouse model \u2014 Based on a model developed at Foun- tain House in New York, a clubhouse provides support servicesthrough a comprehensive self-help community-based center. Staffand members work as teams to perform the tasks necessary for the operation of the clubhouse. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) \u2014 A manual-driven course of structured counseling aimed toward increasing aware-ness of one's thoughts, behaviors and actions, and the conse-quences of them. CBT is often used to address specific problemareas such as anger management, moral reasoning, criminal think-ing, addiction, relapse prevention, and relationships. command staff \u2014 Manages the daily operations and future planning of a police department, (e.g., chief, deputy chiefs, andmajors). Commission on Accreditation for Law En forcement Agencies (CALEA) \u2014 The Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc., was established as an indepen-dent accrediting authority in 1979 by the four major law enforce-ment membership associations: International Association of Chiefsof Police (IACP); National Organization of Black Law Enforce-ment Executives (NOBLE); National Sheriffs' Association (NSA);and Police Executive Research Forum (PERF). The purpose ofCALEA is to improve delivery of law enforcement service by of-fering a body of standards, developed by law enforcement prac-titioners, covering a wide range of up-to-date law enforcementtopics. The CALEA accreditation process is voluntary. community-based treatment \u2014 A concept of treatment that focuses on the community services offered to an individual througha system of community support. Individuals with mental illnesscan remain citizens of their community if given support andaccess to mainstream resources such as housing and vocationalopportunities. 10 community corrections \u2014 The provision of corrections ser- vices to offenders under supervision, in a low-security-level fa-cility located within a community or neighborhood, rather than inan institution; includes probation/parole, electronic monitoring,and other arrangements where offenders may have access topaid or volunteer work and/or be living within their own homes. community mental health system \u2014 The system intended to provide public mental health services directly to those in needof assistance in the communities where they reside. Develop- ment of the community mental health system can be traced toenactment of the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1964.Intended to provide a community-based alternative to institu-tional care for many people with mental illness, implementationof the community mental health system rested on expansion ofoutpatient services in the community, particularly in federallyfunded community mental health centers. In many jurisdictions,the community mental health system has yet to meet the expec- 6. Logical Health Care Solutions, Glossary, p. 14. 7.

Glossary tations of its designers or those who work within it, primarily because funding did not materialize to provide needed services.11 community policing \u2014 Philosophy of law enforcement that includes prevention, partnering and collaboration, and problemsolving. See below for definitions of these elements. Community Policing Consortium \u2014 The Community Po- licing Consortium, which is funded by the Office of CommunityOriented Policing Services, is composed of the International As-sociation of Chiefs of Police (IACP), National Sheriffs' Associa-tion (NSA), National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Ex-ecutives (NOBLE), Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), andPolice Foundation. The consortium's primary mission is to de-liver community policing training and technical assistance to policedepartments and sheriff's offices. computer-aided dispatch (CAD) \u2014 Systems that fully au- tomate call taking and dispatching functions, and have the capa-bility to provide an agency with sophisticated record keeping andanalysis functions. CAD systems work by recording caller infor-mation such as phone number and address, prioritizing calls forservice, and matching those calls to available police resources,which are also monitored by the system using vehicle locatorsystems. This enables the system to quickly reference informa-tion about call types, location, disposition, responding officer,and many other identifiers that inform dispatchers and officersabout appropriate responses. consumer \u2014 In the mental health system, \"consumer\" is the term most frequently applied to a person who receives mentalhealth services. The term is sometimes used more generically torefer to anyone who has a diagnosis of mental illness. Not allpersons with mental illness accept this terminology, however.Some may prefer to be known simply as clients of the facilitieswhere they receive services. People who feel they have beenabused by the system or who reject traditional mental healthservices may prefer a term such as \"survivor.\" co-occurring disorder \u2014 Refers to two or more disorders occurring simultaneously. Generally refers to mental health andsubstance abuse disorders but can refer to mental health, physi-cal health, developmental, or other disorders. 12 Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) \u2014 Police program devel- oped in Memphis, Tennessee. A CIT is comprised of designatedofficers who are called upon to respond to mental disturbancecalls and crises, such as attempted suicides. These officers par-ticipate in specialized training under the instructional supervi-sion of mental health providers, family advocates, and mentalhealth consumer groups. Officers trained under this program are skilled in de-escalating potentially volatile situations, gatheringrelevant history, and assessing medication information and theindividual's social support system. The CIT is recognized as anational program and has been replicated in communities suchas Portland, Oregon; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Seattle, Wash-ington; San Jose, California; and Waterloo, Iowa. cross-training \u2014 The implementation of a training program to educate individuals from both the criminal justice and themental health communities on the issues and concerns eachconfronts, cross-training attempts to build awareness in bothcommunities to help develop a more coordinated approach to theneeds of people with mental illness involved with the criminaljustice system. cultural competence \u2014 Recognition of and response to cul- tural concerns of ethnic and racial groups, including their histo-ries, traditions, beliefs, and value systems. Cultural competenceis one approach to helping mental health service systems andprofessionals create better services and ensure their adequateutilization by diverse populations. Cultural competence entails aset of behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in asystem or agency or among professionals that enables that sys-tem, or agency or those professionals to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. 13 current situational stressors \u2014 Circumstances and envi- ronmental realities that create significant pressure on, or greatlylimit, an individual's ability to function in a healthy, productivemanner. custodial transport \u2014 The transportation of an individual when he or she is under arrest and is not free to leave. A suspectmay be in handcuffs during custodial transport to a police station. decompensation \u2014 Temporary return to a lower level of psy- chological adaptation or functioning, often occurring when anindividual is under considerable stress or has discontinued psy-chiatric medication against medical advice. de-escalation techniques \u2014 Verbal and nonverbal interper- sonal skills that enable an officer to recognize and defuse violentbehavior, preferably without using force, thus preserving thesuspect's safety and dignity. defendant \u2014 An individual who has been charged with but not yet convicted of a criminal charge.309 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectdefense attorney or counsel \u2014 The official who represents the defendant in a criminal case. developmental disability \u2014 A substantial handicap in mental or physical functioning, with onset before the age of 18 and ofindefinite duration. Examples are autism, cerebralpalsy, uncontrolled epilepsy, certain other neuropathies, andmental retardation. 14 diagnostic profile \u2014 The symptoms exhibited by a person that allow a clinician to arrive at a specific diagnosis. discharge plan \u2014 A written plan that provides an inmate with guidance to help him/her make a successful transition from in-stitution to community. Typically includes concrete plans in sev-eral areas such as housing, employment or education, transpor-tation, continued counseling or social services, requiredsupervision (i.e., pr obation/par ole), and the like. dispatch function \u2014 Dispatch answers phone calls and sends patrol cars to respond to those calls. From simple service calls,such as helping someone locked out of his/her car, to true emer-gency calls, such as a domestic violence call, nearly every policeresponse is generated from dispatch. Depending on the circum-stances, every call is given a \"priority\" or ranking and then dis-patched to the appropriate beat officers in a specific order. Dis-patch composition can differ greatly from one jurisdiction to thenext. In some jurisdictions, dispatch is located in the police de-partment and is responsible only for police emergencies.

Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProgram Examples Cited in ReportAppendix B Birmingham Police Department continuedSTATE: Alabama AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Birmingham Police Department PROGRAM TITLE: Community Service Officer Unit POLICY STATEMENT(S): On-Scene Assessment and On-Scene Response YEAR ESTABLISHED: 1976 Overview The Community Service Officer Unit responds to calls in- volving individuals in crisis, including people with mental ill-ness, survivors of violent crimes, and missing persons. Description In 1976, the Crisis Intervention Taskforce in Birmingham decided to increase training and develop a Community ServiceOfficer (CSO) unit in the Birmingham Police Department. Theunit responds to every problem along the social work spectrum,including elder abuse, child endangerment, domestic violence,and mental illness. It was initially formed as a pilot programand was funded by the sta te of Alabama Community Education Training Act (CETA). The unit is now fully funded by the city ofBirmingham. When a patrol officer responds to a call for service involv- ing a person with mental illness, the officer decides if a Commu-nity Service Officer (CSO) should provide secondary response.The CSO unit is staffed by six social workers that are housedwithin the department and report to the chief. The CSO unit canfacilitate certain direct services that officers are not fully trainedto provide (e.g., crisis intervention), make referrals, and trans-port consumers to the primary mental health-care facility. Currently, University Hospital has been designated as the primary emergency health care facility for people with mentalillness. Police officers can bring people who are in a mentalhealth crisis to this location. This centralized location prevents confusion in coordinating follow-up services. The police depart-ment has developed a positive relationship with the psychiatricnurses who facilitate emergency care in the ER. The CSO unit has developed a policy manual/ reference guide for sergeants. New recruits to the police force attend a 12-hour block of instruction in the academy on people with mentalillness and crisis intervention. In 2001 the CSO unit also pro-vided training to sergeants with a workshop/ training sessionabout the unit's capabilities and resources.

The officer inthis position receives approximately 100 hours of mental healthtraining. Description The Community Mental Health Officer (CMHO) responds 24 hours a day, seven days a week to pages and/or calls fromofficers who encounter a situation involving a person with men-tal illness who is in crisis or who appears dangerous or threaten-ing. Upon responding, the officer determines whether the personrequires immediate psychiatric evaluation. In Florence, the CMHOhas the same authority as a probate court judge to make aninvoluntary commitment for 48 hours, but she can also file apetition with the judge for a longer period. It is not necessary forthe CMHO to wait for a petition from the judge to bring the per-son in for evaluation and, consequently, responding patrol offic-ers feel less inclined to find a \"petty\" complaint under which totake the person into custody. The Community Mental Health Officer also reviews arrest reports weekly to check the status of arrestees who have beenidentified as having a mental illness that requires treatment, anddetermines whether arrestees are compliant with their medica-tion or if their condition is worsening and emergency treatmentis needed. The officer also maintains a log of arrestees andmaintains contact with a liaison at the partnering mental healthagency for follow-up. The Community Mental Health Officer maintains a close relationship with the local hospital emergency room for respond-ing to injuries or other medical conditions. The emergency roomhas developed a \"fast track\" procedure, in which the officer callsahead to ensure that the arrestee will receive prompt service atthe hospital. In 2001, the CMHO and the Alabama State Department of Mental Health collaborated on the development of a statewide,40-hour, post-academy training. T his training will be provided for all officers in the state and will include role plays and lec-tures from doctors to teach basics in addressing issues relatedto mental illness and substance abuse.Challenges/Areas for Improvement The Florence Police Department is developing methods for connecting people with substance abuse treatment, while avoid-ing unnecessary interactions with the corrections system. (Cur-rently, the only way people with mental illness can access sub-stance abuse treatment is through the jail.) The department alsointends to address the perceived lack of adequa te responses to people with mental illness who are adjudicated through the DrugCourt.

The tool can be downloaded, administered, and immedi-ately sent to the department's central office using handheld per-sonal desk assistants or Palm Pilots. Mental health profession-als in the central office can then make assessments andrecommend or initiate appropriate interventions, if needed. Description There are 13 correctional and pretrial facilities within the state of Alaska, where geography and low population densitypresent particular challenges. To ensure consistent, comprehen-sive inmate mental health screening, the Department of Correc-tions has developed the mental health management system. The software for Alaska's program was written by Depart- ment of Correction's staff and has been copyrighted. The PalmPilot serves not only as an electronic means of keeping medicalrecords, but as a platform for the entire management informationsystem. The platform-interactive database provides for a stan-dardized assessment system. All clinicians perform the same,standardized exam on the Palm Pilot. It is structured as a psy- chiatric interview and produces comprehensive psychological di-agnosis and treatment planning. The information is then up-loaded to a statewide computer network and becomes availablefor printing for medical files. The system makes it possible togenerate information is summary and/or aggregate form, therebyfacilitating quality assurance and research. For example, infor-mation and reports can be generated by facility, by activity levelswithin a facility, or by diagnostic or prescription trends at a facility.

Description The Conditional Community Release Program employs a contract psychiatrist, probation officer, surveillance officer, andintake specialist to identify, diagnose, and supervise offenderswith mental illness. Once referred, the inmate is evaluated within72 hours by an intake specialist. If appropriate, the inmate isadmitted to the program and jail-release planning is undertaken.The psychiatrist will see the person in jail in order to ensurecontinuity of care once released, and the probation officer willsee the client to complete all necessary paperwork. Once released, the probationer may be placed in a housing facility funded by adult probation, or released to his or her homeif appropriate. While in the community, the probation officer andsurveillance officer supervise the client. The psychiatrist pro-vides follow-up treatment if the client is not enrolled in commu-nity treatment. Using contracts with a local medical servicesagency, the program provides medication at a reduced cost andensures that the clients receive necessary psychological testing. The program is 45 days in length, at which time the client is transferred back to his or her original probation officer orreferred to a specialized mental health caseload. In the eventthe client is not stabilized, the county will continue to serve theclient until this is accomplished. Contact Information Maricopa County Adult Probation Department 111 S.

Health Consensus ProjectSTATE: Arizona AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office PROGRAM TITLE: Data Link Project POLICY STATEMENT(S): Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility YEAR ESTABLISHED: 1999 Overview The Data Link Project allows the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office to cross-reference names of detainees with the records ofthe local behavioral health provider in order to identify individu-als who may be eligible for diversion from the criminal justicesystem. Description When individuals are booked into the county jail, their name, date of birth, social security number, and gender are entered intothe Data Link Program database. The system electronically andsimultaneously cross-references the individual's name with thedatabase of the local behavioral health authority, which includesnames and information for mor e than 12,000 clients who receive mental health services in the area. The data link provides forcontinued identification of clients throughout the day, regardlessof booking charge, time of booking, or current mental status.The information flows only one-way\u2014from the jail to the mentalhealth provider. Clients that match all categories are considered a full match and their names are immediately sent electronically to the jaildiversion staff computer as well as the client's case manager.Full match screens contain the client's booking number, a maxi-mum of three booking charges, court jurisdiction(s), and generaldemographic information. Clients that match at least one of thecategories, with the exception of gender, are considered a partialmatch and are only sent to the jail diversion staff. The jail diver-sion staff further investigates partial matches, which are eitherconverted to full matches or deleted from the system. If con-verted to a full match, the case manager then electronically re-ceives notification of the client's admission to jail. After full matches are determined, the jail diversion staff use various criteria to select candidates for the jail diversionprogram. The criteria include, but are not limited to: \u0093nature of the current offense(s) \u0093history of incarceration \u0093current mental status \u0093availability of community mental health resources \u0093public safety factors \u0093past performance in treatment settings.The jail mental health diversion program consists of three types of intervention: Clients may be released from jail withconditions that include treatment; clients may be placed on sum-mary (unsupervised) probation, which includes mandatory treat-ment; or clients may be given the opportunity for deferred pros-ecution in an intervention that includes increased judicialparticipation and supervision, and required treatment participa- tion over a specified period of time. Successful completion ofall requirements results in dropping criminal charges. All threetypes of diversion programs require mandatory group therapysessions, including integrated treatment group for co-occurringdisorders, which accounts for about 70 percent of the diversionpopulation. For individuals who are eligible for diversion, case manag- ers are required to send pertinent clinical and care informationto the jail diversion staff within 24 hours. They also must visitthe client in the jail within 72 hours of incarceration, and at least once every 14 days thereafter until the inmate is released fromjail. Challenges/Areas for Improvement One of the risks of the system is jeopardizing the offender's right to privacy by the automatic sharing of information that oc-curs. However, advocacy groups were involved with the forma-tion of the program so as to try to eliminate many of theseconcerns from the outset. Contact Information Maricopa County Sheriff's Office 102 W.

Description The prosecutor, in conjunction with the case manager, de- termines eligibility for the Mental Health Diversion Program.Prosecution is deferred for eligible defendants, who are grantedconditional release with certain requirements, including behav-ioral health treatment. Compliance with these conditions is moni-tored by pretrial services. If the defendant successfully com-pletes the program, which lasts 180 days, charges are dismissed.If they fail to comply with program conditions, prosecution re-sumes. Since the implementation of the Mental Health Diversion Program, there have been no filings for Rule 11 (competency tostand trial) hearings in the city court. This has resulted in greatsavings to the community. The number of misdemeanant defen-dants detained beyond their initial appearance has decreasedsignificantly each year, and, just as significantly, the number ofmisdemeanor defendants remaining in custody more than 30 dayshas decreased to a negligible n umber (fewer than five in each jail population reviewed during the first quarter of 2000).

The CaliforniaState Legislature first authorized the program in 1998 and reau-thorized the program in 2000-2001. The program is overseen bythe California Board of Corrections and has provided over $104million in grants for 30 projects in 26 counties. Description To be eligible for a grant, the program required counties to establish a Strategy Committee that included key leaders fromthe criminal justice and mental health communities (e.g., sheriff,superior court judge, county mental health director). The autho-rizing statute required the Strategy Committees to develop a Lo-cal Plan that described the county's existing response to offend-ers with mental illness, service gaps that had been identified,and proposed strategies for improving service to offenders withmental illness. The legislature earmarked $2 million for noncom-petitive planning grants to assist counties in developing theseplans. The grants were awarded in multiple phases based on the three separate legislative appropriations. The first set of appro-priations was made in May 1999 and totaled $22.9 million toseven counties. The 1999/2000 State Budget appropriated anadditional $27.7 million to the grant program; these funds weredistributed to six counties. The Board of Corrections refers tothe grantees from 1999 and 2000 as MIOCRG I. The 2000/20001State Budget included an additional $50 million for the grantprogram. In May 2001, 15 counties received grants totaling ap-proximately $45.7 million. The Board of Corrections refers tothese fifteen counties as MIOCRG II. The MIOCRG requires the Board of Corrections to develop a plan to evaluate the efficacy of the program in reaching itsstated goals of reducing crime, jail crowding, and criminal jus-tice costs associated with offenders with mental illness. Theboard staff developed a research design in conjunction with fundedcounties. This research plan requires counties to collect com-Appendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report321 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmon data elements concerning the population served, the ser- vices provided, and the efficacy of the programs. The countiessubmit data to the board every six months. In addition, theprogram requires counties to evaluate their project by establish-ing outcome and performance measures and conducting a pro-cess assessment. This two-tiered evaluation allows the board tofocus on cross-site evaluations while the counties can concen-trate on the unique aspects of their program.

Description In 2000, the California State Assembly passed a bill in response to the shortage of mental health professionals through-out the state of California. The bill directed the representativesof the task force funded by the Budget Act of 2000 to addressand identify options for meeting the staffing needs of state andcounty health, human services, and criminal justice agencies.The task force has representatives from the Department of Men-tal Health, the California State University, the California Commu-nity Colleges, and a number of other educational and mentalhealth stakeholders. The bill also instructed the task force toestablish regional training centers and to develop a grant pro-gram for students in California colleges and universities thatoffer certain degrees in order to attract students to employmentin publicly funded mental health services. The task force willreport its findings to the Legislature by May 1, 2002. Also in California, the Center for Health Professions at the University of California, San Francisco, has created the CaliforniaWorkforce Initiative to look broadly at needs in the health careworkforce, including the behavioral health care field. The programs have begun implementing several areas of development on the issue of staffing shortages. However, data hasyet to be examined concerning the outcome of these programs.

Description The MET program was designed with the following goals: to prevent unnecessary incarceration and/or hospitalization ofindividuals with mental illness; to prevent duplication of mentalhealth services; to protect the community and individuals whomay be a danger to themselves or others; and to enable policepatrol units to return quickly to service. MET units can be dispatched either directly to calls involv- ing mental health issues or in support of a request for assis-tance from patrol units. In the latter case, the MET takes overthe call, allowing the patrol unit to respond to other calls. TheMET unit focuses on calm, supportive, and respectful interac-tions with individuals with mental illness and only uses force asa last resort. Currently, the MET program provides response tocalls for service during 10 hours a day, seven days a week. The MET has led to cost-savings for the county because officers can assess which individuals have private insurance,Medi Cal (which allows individuals to use private hospitals), orno insurance. If a person with MediCal is sent to the countyhospital, the county pays twice for the person. Additionally, theMET is able to direct patients away from an already overbur-dened County Hospital. One of the core strengths of the MET program is the train- ing for participating officers. The Long Beach Police Department mandates both acad- emy and in-service training on issues related to responding topeople with mental illness. New recruits must attend a six-hourcourse on issues involving people with disabilities. This portionof the training is mandated by the state. Additionally, recruits arerequired to attend a class called Field Contacts with People withMental Illnesses. This training is not state-mandated. The Field Contacts course is also part of the in-service training. The Los Angeles County Mental Health Department funds the MET team and its additional training. During its first threeyears of operation, the MET team handled 1,810 calls for service,hospitalizing 838 people, (46 percent). Of the persons hospital- ized, 357 (43 percent) were hospitalized privately, for a cost-savings of $785,400. During this same time period there wereless than ten uses of force.

Description The San Diego County PERT teams comprise specially trained officers or deputies who are paired with mental healthprofessionals; together, they respond on-scene to situations in-volving people with mental illness. The 24 PERT teams representa partnership between the Sheriff's Office and the eight law en-forcement departments in the county. Participating officers, deputies, and mental health profes- sionals are specially selected and complete an 80-hour block oftraining. The training includes modules about on-scene assess-ment, payer systems, community-based organizations, and avail-able hospitals. The goal of the program is appropriate place-ment for people with mental illness in the least restrictiveenvironment possible. The PERT model is funded by both county and state grants (which are actually pass-through federal SAMHSA funds). Part-ners determined that the most efficient way to manage thesefunds was to form a separate organization, known as \"PERT,Inc.\" The board for PERT, Inc. is made up in part of NAMI boardmembers and board members from the Community ResearchFoundation, which is the largest private, nonprofit mental healthservice provider in the county. PERT, Inc. supervises the PERTstaff and coordinates billing for services rendered (a fundingstream that provides considerable support for the program). Theexecutive director of PERT, Inc. developed training and is viewedby the police and mental health professionals as a neutral liaison. Important to the success of this program are the commit- tees that meet to discuss the program and solve problems. Thefirst committee is the coordinating council, which meets quar-terly to examine policies. The coordinating council is made upof a captain or assistant chief from all nine departments and theAppendix B.

Description The San Bernardino Partners Aftercare Network (SPAN) was one of many programs to receive funding from California'sthe Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program(MIOCRG). (See description of the MIOCRG above.) SPAN is housed on the grounds of the San Bernardino County's West Valley Detention Center. The aftercare manage-ment team serves as a \"bridge\" between the offender's releasefrom state custody and his or her reintegration in the community.SPAN provides a number of services such as early dischargeplanning so that the mental health needs of inmates' can beassessed early on. In addition, released inmates receive a 14-day supply of medication at the time of their release to cover theperiod until they can meet with a mental health service worker.Identification cards are provided to inform law enforcement per-sonnel and treatment providers that the person with mental ill-ness is part of the program. The coordination of terms and conditions of probation is handled by a sub-program, STAR-LITE (Supervised TreatmentAfter Release\u2014Less Intense Treatment Expectations). STAR-LITE provides extensive front end case management to inmateswho are at high risk of recidivism. This includes housing, finan-cial support, and substance abuse counseling.

Description Many homeless individuals are charged with crimes and have outstanding warrants, usually for misdemeanors such asillegal lodging. These individuals may be wary of attending court proceedings or, due to their lack of a permanent address, do not receive notices to appear. Most studies estimate that at least 20- 25 percent of the adult homeless population has a mental illness. The San Diego Homeless Court is a program run by the San Diego Public Defender's Office that brings court proceedingsinto shelters, where legal issues are disposed of through pro-gressive pleabargaining and alternative sentencing measures. TheHomeless Court does not resolve felony cases. Prosecutors anddefense attorneys work together to hold court sessions once-a-month. The program works on a four-week schedule. \u0093week one: participants sign up for a court pro- ceeding \u0093week two: the court and prosecution prepare cases for the next scheduled hearing \u0093week three: the defense attorney meets with the participants to review and prepare for the cases \u0093week four: the court personnel arrive at the shel- ter and hear the cases Sentences often involve participation in programs at local shelters or other community services instead of fines or jail-time.Also, shelters can then provide drug counseling, job placement,and access to additional public services (e.g. mental health care).

Description The Village Integrated Service Agency in Long Beach, Cali- fornia, was initially developed through state legislation (1989)that attempted to remove administrative and funding barriersfrom the delivery of comprehensive, individualized mental healthservices. The three basic elements of the Village's program de-sign are collaborative case management teams, case-rated fund-ing, and a psychosocial rehabilitation/recovery philosophy. As inthe ACT model, services at the Village are delivered to the clientwherever he or she is. Teams of clinicians work with each clientand bring complementary skills to the process. Case-rated fund-ing is an important principle because it is focuses on outcomesrather than on delivery of units of service. The overarching re-covery philosophy encourages staff and clients to seek the re-wards that come with higher risks, knowing that support will beavailable when needed. The Village offers a clear, single point ofresponsibility for everyone it serves and provides coverage 24hours a day, seven days a week. In 1987 a group of concerned parents, consumers, busi- ness people, and professionals, prompted the lieutenant gover-nor to help form a task force to make recommendations for cre-ating a better mental health system. Two years later, after 14statewide community hearings, the task force' s recommendations were incorporated into a bipartisan legislative bill, which waspassed in 1989. The statute provided funding for three years,directly out of the state general funds, for three Integrated Ser-vice Agency (ISA) demonstration projects in three different set-tings\u2014countywide, urban, and rural. The mission of the VillageIntegrated Service Agency is to support and teach adults withpsychiatric disabilities to recognize their strengths and power tosuccessfully live, socialize, and work in the community. In addi-tion, the organization also seeks to stimulate and promote thesystem-wide changes necessary so that these individuals mayachieve these goals.Appendix B.

These programswork with the courts to link to treatment services people withmental health and co-occurring substance abuse disorders ar-rested on minor offenses. Description In 1994 DMHAS developed in Hartford the first jail diver- sion program in the state for defendants with mental illness.The program was the outcome of interagency discussion aboutthe frequent rearrest of people with serious mental illness. Priorto this program, the courts were helping defendants with mentalillness to obtain mental health services by finding them incom-petent to stand trial and admitting them to psychiatric hospitals.This approach, geared towards enabling the defendants to be-come competent to stand trial, generally did not focus on theirlong-term needs. The goals of the diversion program include the following: \u0093reduce recidivism of people with mental illness by providing access to treatment \u0093reduce incarceration of individuals with mental ill-ness for minor offenses \u0093free jail beds for violent offenders; provide judgeswith additional sentencing options \u0093increase the cost-effectiveness of the courts, Depart-ment of Corrections, and DMHAS The jail diversion program allows the courts and commu- nity mental health centers to work together for the benefit of thedefendant. The clinicians who operate the diversion programswork out of the local community mental health centers.

The only information that diversion staff pro-vide to the court is a treatment plan and what options are avail-able to the client. The nature of the illness and any diagnosesare kept confidential. The diversion team does not make thedecision to divert; it simply offers options to the judges. If theclient agrees to allow the clinician to share more informationwith the court it is easier to prepare a treatment plan that can befollowed up by the court. If the court does offer diversion to the defendant, possible outcomes include deferred prosecution with the condition of treat-ment, dismissal of charges, or probation with special conditionof treatment. When possible, diversion staff follow-up on pro-gram participants to assess their success in the program. In 1997, Connecticut's jail diversion program was selected as part of the SAMHSA study of the impact of jail diversion.Using initial data from that study, DMHAS prepared a report tothe Connecticut General Assembly Joint Committee on the Judi-ciary, Public Health, and Appropriations. DMHAS's ability todemonstrate that individuals who participated in the programsspent significantly fewer days in jails and psychiatric hospitalshelped convince the General Assembly to appropriate funding foran expansion of the program to all 22 geographical area courts inthe state. Beginning in 1998, researchers in Connecticut havecollected data comparing the experiences of two groups of de-fendants with mental illness\u2014one group from courts with diver-sion programs and one group from courts without diversion pro-grams. The data collection period is complete and the study is currently in the data analysis phase. The researchers will look tocompare the costs of serving the two groups, including costs associated with criminal justice services and mental health ser-vices.

Only defendants who have been charged withmisdemeanors are eligible for the court, excluding those chargedwith domestic violence, driving under the influence, or battery,unless the victim consents to the transfer of the defendant. Description Defendants can be referred for participation in the mental health court in a variety of ways including by the magistrate whopresides at the bond hearing, the defense attorney, the defendant'sfamily, the police, or a mental health caseworker, among others. Defendants may either be in custod y or out-of-custody (e.g., on pretrial release) when they are referred. For defendants whoare in custody, clinicians from Nova Southeastern University as-signed to the public defender's office screen defendants prior tothe initial probable cause/bail hearing. When defendants ex-hibit symptoms of mental illness, the defender informs the courtduring the hearing, which is generally conducted via closed cir-cuit television. Depending on the time of arrest, the magistratepresiding at the bond hearing will refer the individual to themental health court either for the same day or the next day.Individuals who are deemed to be in crisis or a danger to them-selves are referred to a crisis center until they are stabilized, atwhich point they may be eligible to again participate in the court. Defendants who are referred to the court have a probable cause hearing in the court to review the charges. Those individu-als whom the judge determines are eligible for the court areoffered, after consulting with an attorney and mental health pro-fessionals, the opportunity to participate in treatment under thesupervision of the court. For those defendants who agree to thisarrangement, the state's attorney holds their charges in abey-ance, pending the progress of the treatment. After being selected for participation in the program, de- fendants are further assessed and then assigned to a case man-ager. The case manager is responsible for preparing a serviceplan, which is coordinated in conjunction with the defendant,family members, a treatment provider, and the mental healthcourt. The court then holds a series of status hearings, as needed,Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services continuedAppendix B.

Description Continuing Legal Education Requirement (CLER) was adopted by the Supreme Court of Florida in 1988 and requires allFlorida Bar members to further their legal education. The FloridaBar requires each member to complete 30 hours of CLE over athree-year period. Five of those hours of education must beobtained in one of four mandatory categories\u2014ethics, profes-sionalism, substance abuse, and mental illness awareness. Addingmental illness awareness as a mandatory category demonstratesthe Florida Bar's appreciation of the importance of attorney'sgaining education in this area. The Board of Governors of theFlorida Bar voted 50 to 0 in suppor t of mandator y CLE in mental illness awareness. Challenges/Areas for Improvement According to Angela Vickers, an attorney and mental health advocate who was a leading proponent of the inclusion of mentalillness awareness as a mandatory category in the Florida CLER,there is a shortage of educational opportunities for attorneys inthis area.

The goal of the team is torespond appropriately to people with mental illness who are thesubject of calls for service. Description The Sheriff's Office funds all CIT training. When the pro- gram was first initiated, all CIT officers were required to com-plete a 40-hour block of training. The Crisis Intervention Teamassigns one trained officer to every shift. This deputy is expectedto respond to calls for service involving people with mental ill-ness. If this officer is unavailable, any deputy can respond to thecall. However, it is expected that the responding deputy will speakwith the CIT officer to gain insight and develop a strategy toeffectively manage the call. In order to better prepare and re-spond to the needs of people with mental illness, CIT staff cre-ate and maintain a file of information about each individual withwhom they have contact, including the nature of the illness, fam-ily relations, the layout of the person's home, the availability ofweapons, and any other relevant information. The Sheriff's Of-fice collects these data from the Forensic Diagnosis team at thejail, the Crisis Intervention Team files, and the Medical BraceletProgram. The Sheriff's Office also participates in the Seminole County Mental Health and Substance Abuse Task Force. The task force(which includes representatives from the State Attorney's Office,Public Defender's Office, Seminole Community Mental HealthCenter, NAMI, and the Coalition for the Homeless) meets monthlyto discuss issues related to each agency's response and the col-laborative initiatives developing among the agencies. The Sheriff's Office has contracted with the Mental Health Association of Central Florida (MHACF) to set up the MedicalBracelet Program. The MHACF is a nonprofit organization andthe project is funded entirely by the Sheriff's Office. The pro-gram offers free voluntary registration to people with mental ill-ness. They can get a bracelet or an identification card that alertslaw enforcement to a particular condition. Accordingly, if a citi-zen with mental illness fails to comply with medication or en- counters the police, the responding officer will be aware that theperson is in need of specific assistance. This information isstored in the department's communication center and is avail-able 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In 2000, the CIT responded to approximately 1200 calls for service involving people with mental illness. Also, participationin the task force has provided the Sheriff's Office with feedbackon CIT program successes and barriers, and each participatingagency's understanding of other agency's roles was significantlyincreased. Challenges/Areas for Improvement Since the initial training, the sheriff's office has recog- nized the need to locate alternate training opportunities. Oneresource that the sheriff's office has identified is the FloridaRegional Community Policing Institute at St. Petersburg, whichoffers a class entitled \"Managing Encounters with the MentallyIll.\" Contact Information Seminole County 100 Examples Report331 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSTATE: Florida AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Pinellas County Sheriff's Office PROGRAM TITLE: Crisis Intervention Training Program POLICY STATEMENT(S): Training for Law Enforcement Personnel YEAR ESTABLISHED: 2001 Overview Pinellas County Sheriff's Office personnel receive training on using crisis intervention skills in interacting with people forwhom mental illness was a factor in the call for service. Description The Mental Health Commission of Pinellas County pro- vides a 40-hour training program at no charge to the Sheriff'sOffice. The Mental Health Commission of Pinellas County com-prises mental health providers, mental health advocates (e.g.,NAMI), and law enforcement executives. Nonpolice personnel,including people with mental illness and family members, teachthe training course. 150 employees of the Pinellas County Sheriff'sOffice have been trained, including civilian staff, corrections, andlaw enforcement. Specifically, Pinellas County has made an ef-fort to train its communications/dispatch staff. The Pinellas County Crisis Intervention (CI) program is based on the Memphis, Tennessee, Police Department's CrisisIntervention Team model, in which specially trained officers re-spond to calls involving people with mental illness. The countyhas helped other Florida police departments implement theirown Crisis Intervention programs. As a result of the crisis intervention training, dispatchers are prepared to ask the necessary questions to provide deputieson-scene with as much information as possible, and sworn staffare better able to respond to calls involving people with mentalillness. Challenges/Areas for Improvement The department hopes to increase the number of its CI- trained officers. Unfortunately, there are not enough trained of-ficers to have a CI officer respond to every call involving a personwith mental illness. Usually, only 10 to 12 people per shift havereceived CI training. As a result, there are many instances inwhich a CI officer is not available to respond to a call involving aperson with a mental illness. The department would also like to hire social workers to follow up with a person who has been admitted to a mentalhealth care facility. The social worker would speak with familymembers and caseworkers or locate resources. This interventionmight increase the number of people with mental illness who can be helped by access to ongoing services.

Description The Athens-Clarke Crisis Intervention Program (CIP) is based on the Memphis CIT program, particularly with regard tothe training requirements. Unlike the Memphis model, however,the county government in Athens-Clarke determined that specialteams alone could not provide an adequate law enforcement re-sponse to people with mental illness in Athens-Clarke County.County government officials believed that every officer must beable to respond effectively to a call for service involving a personwith mental illness. All new recruits are required to attend post-academy train- ing in mental health crisis intervention. Currently, about half ofthe 210 sworn officers have been trained in this subject area.Advantage Behavioral Health, a community-based health care provider, conducts the training. Local mental health profession-als donate their expertise, teaching the crisis intervention class.As part of the course, officers visit a local hospital or mentalhealth facility to interact with and learn from consumers. The training provides officers with a well-structured method for handling on-scene response. When arriving on-scene, anofficer must first assess whether the consumer is a danger tohim/herself or others. Based on their crisis intervention train-ing, the officer must then decide if the person is in need ofprofessional evaluation. During regular business hours, an of-ficer may transport a consumer to the local mental health careprovider, Advantage Clinic, for evaluation. During off hours, or if the person is considered violent, the officer may bring the indi-vidual to the emergency room wher e an Advantage staff person will meet them. As a result of the Crisis Intervention Program, the Athens- Clarke County Police Department has established close relation-ships with local advocacy groups, particularly NAMI and the MentalHealth Association. In April 2001, the captain who serves as theinformal liaison to the mental health care providers won the MentalHealth Association's annual award for public services as a resultof his work with the CIP .Challenges/Areas for Improvement The Athens-Clarke County Police Department plans to con- tinue providing crisis intervention training to its officers until allsworn personnel have received the training. Also, the depart-ment has encountered difficulties in finding appropriate care andplacement for youth who have mental illness, and would like todevelop specialized responses for this population.

Description To be eligible for supervision in the mental health unit, probationers must have a diagnosis of mental illness and/ormental retardation. Pedophiles and those who have been foundunfit to stand trial are not eligible for the program. Probationersare mandated to receive mental health services ranging fromoutpatient counseling to psychiatric hospitalization and nearly allare on psychotropic medication. The most common diagnosesare Axis I psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, severe mooddisorders, and bipolar disorder). Staff in the unit have mental health-related experience and training. Officers supervise reduced caseloads of approxi-mately 50 probationers and work closely with treatment provid-ers and a contracted clinical consultant to ensure comprehensivecase management. Officers perform a number of duties includ-ing: conducting clinical assessments; making referrals; complet-ing detailed supervision plans; monitoring compliance with pro-bation conditions, medication requirements, and other treatmentobjectives; helping probationers to obtain disability benefits,Supplemental Security Income, and medical cards; and servingas advocates for probationers in their effort to obtain mentalhealth services. Contact standards are dictated by the three phases. Each phase lasts a minimum of three months. Prior to advancing to aless restrictive phase, probationers must meet strict criteria.

Description Most Thresholds members (as the program's clients are called) have a history of state inpatient psychiatric hospitaliza-tion and incarceration\u2014the average member has been hospital-ized 112 times and arrested 35 times. Thresholds relies on the Bridge Model of assertive com- munity treatment, which uses an intensive team approach to pro-vide long-term, comprehensive, and integrated services. TheThresholds Program marks the first time that the Bridge Modelhas been specifically applied to the jail population. Thresholdsstaff forge relationships with clients while they are still in jail,sometimes even securing early release into Thresholds custody.Once released from the jail, the members are expected to adhereto treatment regimens, to work with a psychiatrist, and to nomi-nate Thresholds as a payee. Thresholds provides services forsubstance abuse, vocational training, education, and peer sup-ports. Thresholds has developed relationships with housing pro-viders and the police department to ensure community supportand to enlist assistance in monitoring program members. Thresh-olds provides 24-hour services; if a member is missing, Thresh-olds staff will go into the streets to locate the member.

Thresholds has compiled impressive outcome data con- cerning the success of its program. Thresholds has recentlycompleted a study comparing data for thirty program partici-pants who have completed one-year of Thresholds service withdata from the one year prior to their involvement with the pro-gram. Prior to becoming involved in Thresholds these individu-als had spent a combined 2,741 days in jail; during one year inThresholds they spent a total of 489 days in jail, a reduction ofCook County Adult Probation Department continued336 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project82 percent. Similarly, in the year prior to being involved in Thresh- olds the group had been arrested a total of 101 times, whileduring their year at Thresholds they were arrested 49 times for areduction of 51 percent. The group experienced a similar reduc-tion in hospital days (85 percent) and total hospitalizations (82percent). The Thresholds program costs approximately $26 perday per member, whereas jails cost approximately $70 per dayand hospitals cost $500 per day. According to these per diemrates, the Thresholds program saved $157,000 in jail costs and$917,000 in hospitalization costs in the one year studied.

Brief Description The concept behind the public hearings was to impress upon the public that mental health is a local concern. The fo-rums sought to accomplish this by both educating those whoattended and gauging feelings about how Iowa is currently han-dling the issue of mental health. Part of the strategy includedattracting media attention in statewide newspapers. The 240 participants in the hearings each completed a questionnaire that was then analyzed by the State Public PolicyGroup (SPPG). The survey sought to assess varying groups'perceptions of how the state was addressing the mental healthissues within corrections treatment programs. In the surveys, 80.8 percent of those polled said that ac- cess to mental health and substance abuse treatment serviceswas an urgent matter in the state of Iowa. Additionally, reportsconcluded that there is poor communication between mental healthproviders and corrections staff. When asked how to address thisissue, respondents showed strong support for a \"no closed doors\"program, which would make it a uniform protocol in all parts ofthe community. In this system, agencies from the police depart-ment to the department of human services immediately referpeople with mental illness to a mental health provider. Thecommission will publicize the findings by developing a videobased upon clips from the public hearings and interviews withincarcerated persons who suffer from mental illness. The followup is a conference in the spring of 2002 intended to draw atten-tion to not just the problem but possible solutions, includingideas that have worked in other states.Thresholds Psychiatric Rehabilitation Centers continuedAppendix B.

Description Anne Arundel County uses a Mobile Crisis Team modeled after a program implemented in Berkley, California. The pro-gram is funded through grants from the federal government. Theprogram was developed after representatives of law enforcementand the mental health representatives met and determined thatthe mental health professionals were better equipped than policeto respond to the needs of people with mental illness. As aresult, the county decided to expand funding for its crisis inter-vention teams. The specific plan was designed with the assistance of a focus group of officers and mental health professionals. When the MCT responds to a call, the social worker helps the officer determine whether someone is a danger to them-selves or others, assesses the need for intervention, and, if ap-propriate, assists the individual obtain access to mental healthservices. The team also coor dinates follo w-up to consumer cases and shares only essential, nonprivate information with the policeafter the initial call for service. A lieutenant on the police de-partment serves as a liaison to the head of the county mentalhealth agency.

Description The Suicide Screening Initiative is designed to maximize the likelihood of identifying inmates who are at risk of commit-ting suicide. When an inmate is first processed through theCentral Processing Unit, an officer completes the Suicide ScreeningForm, consisting of seven items relating to current suicidal ide-ation and past history of suicidal/self-destructive behavior. Thereare specific questions regarding mental health history and cur-rent psychiatric treatment (e.g., psychotropic intervention). Inmates are then processed through intake, where the same form is completed a second time. The process is intentionallyredundant and allows for the inmate to answer the same ques-tions asked by different staff members. Third, inmates arescreened at medical intake where nursing staff use the sameSuicide Screening form. The document, initiated at Central Pro-cessing, follows the inmate throughout this process. If an in-mate answers affirmatively to any of the questions at any pointalong this three-part process, a referral is generated to mentalhealth services, at which point mental health staff conduct anassessment to determine the suicide risk of the detainee. Procedures for accountability are in place to ensure that the form is completed correctly and that all inmates requiring anassessment are seen by mental health staff. Inmates who have ahistory of self-destructive behavior are put on a list and theirinstitutional and medical records are placed in a special file.Facility staff monitor these inmates closely.

Description The Montgomery County Police Department covers a variety of topics in its CIT training course, including (but not limited to): \u0093Suicide prevention \u0093Methods of approach \u0093Interviewing techniques \u0093Co-occurring disorders and Assessing Mental Illness \u0093De-escalation techniques \u0093Psychotropic medications \u0093Post Trauma tic Stress Disorder (PTSD) The department uses a variety of training techniques in the course, including cassette tapes that simulate the experienceof a person with mental illness who hears voices. Designed bysomeone who suffered from a psychiatric disability, the cassettetape series \"Hearing Distressing Voices\" simulates the experi-ence of someone who hears voices. The program was developedin association with the Massachusetts based National Empower-ment Center (www. Power2u.org). The curriculum calls for the participants to wear head- phones that emit disturbing shuffling sounds, derogatory com-ments, and in some cases, racial slurs and profanity. The intentis to help trainees to understand the difficulties that people whohear voices experience. While listening to the tapes, participantsare asked to complete forms or answer questions\u2014tasks thatinmates with mental illness must perform. In addition, the department holds a portion of its training program in the physical space of a public mental health facilityto familiarize officers with people with mental illnesses.Contact Information CIT Coordinator Montgomery County Department of PoliceStrategic Planning Division2350 Research Blvd. continued342 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectAppendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report STATE: Maryland AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Mental Hygiene Administration, Division of Special Populations PROGRAM TITLE: Maryland Community Criminal JusticeTreatment Program POLICY STATEMENT(S): Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility YEAR ESTABLISHED: 1994 Overview The Maryland Community Criminal Justice Treatment Pro- gram (MCCJTP) is a multiagency collaborative that provides shelterand treatment services to offenders with mental illness in theircommunities. Created to serve jail inmates with mental illness, the program now also targets individuals on probation and parole. Description The MCCJTP now operates in 18 of Maryland's 24 local jurisdictions. The program is overseen by local advisory boardscomprised of state and local leaders and provides a wide rangeof services, including case management, screening, counseling,discharge planning, and community follow-up. The program alsoprovides training for criminal justice and treatment profession-als, both within Maryland and from outside the state. Research-ers identified four of the key components of the program: \u0093strong collaboration between state and focus on disorders. Program participants are identified through a classifica- tion process at the local detention center, or through parole/probation. They are then referred to the local program directorfor assessment and eligibility and assigned to a case manager. Apsychiatrist sees the patient to determine his or her mental ill-ness or dual diagnosis needs, and to determine treatment possi-bilities. The case manager considers the client's needs and de-velops a service plan approved by the client, and then contactsrelevant agencies, courts, families, etc. The plan is then pre-sented to the court, and upon approval, the client is released andfollowed by the case manager into the community. It is the job of the case manager to assure coordination with necessary providers. Case management services include crisisintervention, screening, counse ling, discharge planning, and com- munity follow-up. The program also provides routine training forcriminal justice and treatment professionals. The MCCJTP isespecially attentive to the housing needs of its clients; case man-agers help clients become eligible for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Shelter Care Plus funds, whichare supplemented by local matching funds. Case managers workwith clients to find permanent housing options and to integratesupportive services into the housing arrangement. From October 1, 1994, to September 30, 1995, the program served a total of 503 clients in eight jurisdictions. Of this num-ber, 5 percent returned to state psychiatric hospitals, 20 percentreturned to detention centers, and 5 percent returned tohomelessness. Data from the first quarter of 1996 reflect a sig-nificant reduction in recidivism: the program served 241 clients,of which 1 percent returned to psychiatric hospitals, 7.4 percentreturned to detention centers, and 2.4 percent returned tohomelessness.

The MHLU also provides training concerning the repre-sentation of defendants with mental illness in criminal cases. Description The primary mandate of the Mental Health Litigation Unit (MHLU) of the Committee for Public Counsel Services is to \"pro-vide trial and appellate representation to indigent persons againstwhom are filed petitions seeking (a) commitment to public orprivate psychiatric facilities (b) judicial authorization to admin-ister or terminate certain types of treatment ( e.g., antipsychotic medication, aversive behavior modification, life-support mecha-nisms) or (c) day-to-life commitment as a \"sexually dangerousperson.\" Typically, representation is provided by private attor-neys certified by the MHLU to accept such assignments.\" Attorneys who wish to be certified to accept assignments in mental health proceedings must apply for the program and, ifaccepted, complete a two-part training. The training covers bothaspects of mental health law and diagnoses and treatment ofmental illnesses. Attorneys who are certified must attend atleast eight hours each fiscal year of approved continuing legaleducation programs to maintain their certification. The base text for MHLU training on mental health proceed- ings is Mental Health Proceedings in Massachusetts: A Manual for Defense Counsel , by Stan Goldman, director of the MHLU. The text covers in-depth various aspects of mental health lawincluding voluntary admission, involuntary admission, the com-mitment process, competency deter mination, and other topics. The focus of this portion of the training is on litigation strategyand technique. In addition, attorneys who wish to representdefendants in mental health proceedings must attend trainingson clinical aspects of mental illness and treatment.

The FTTalso works with individuals in the pretrial stage, those who havecompleted their sentence, and those who are released under publicsafety supervision. An inmate's diagnosis or criminal historywill not disqualify him or her from participating in the program. Description The Forensic Transition Teams (FTT) are the primary mechanism through which the Department of Mental Health,Department of Corrections, Department of Youth Services, andparole and probation agencies seek to implement the goals es-tablished in a 1998 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).Signed in 1998, the MOU established a collaborative effort toimprove services to offenders with severe mental illness. Aspart of the MOU, The parole board agreed to: \u0093Identify and refer inmates with mental illness who have upcoming parole hearings and collaborate with DOCand DMH in developing a disc harge plan for the inmates. DOC agreed to \u0093Identify and refer inmates who are potentially eligible for continuing care services, obtain releases allowingfor specified information to be shared between theclinician, the Parole Board and the DMH. \u0093Work with the DMH Forensic Transition Team (FTT)Coordinator and/ or DMH case manager at theinmate's institution, and collaborate on development of a service plan for potential parolees, especially byfacilitating the entry of the FTT Coordinator or DMHCase Manager into an inmate's facility. And the DMH agreed to: \u0093Assess individuals for potential continuing care eligi- bility who are referred by DOC clinical staff or DOCCommittee for Public Counsel Services, Mental Health Litigation Unit (MHLU)continued345 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectmental health service provider, arrange for the provi- sion of community mental health services, includingcase management services, and, with the client'ssigned consent, communicate with assigned paroleofficers on information regarding attendance andprogress in treatment. \u0093Provide mental health evaluations and consultationregarding potential continuing care parolees uponreferral by the Parole Board and to provide technicalsupport to clinical staff employed through the con-tract between DOC and their health service provider,who are filing applications for continuing care andfacilitate communication between DMH/ vendedstaff and DOC/ vended staff. \u0093Maintain a database on the target population andprovide consistent feedback on effectiveness of re-lease planning efforts for this population. To be eligible for work with an FTT, inmates must fit cer- tain clinical criteria (e.g., diagnosis, functional impairment, andduration of illness), need DMH services, and be without othermeans to access those services. FTT staff meet with eligible inmates to determine the offender's needs upon release and the potential risks to publicsafety. The FTT works with criminal justice officials as well aslocal mental health and other service providers to determinewhat services will be offered. After release, the FTT monitorsthe client's adjustment during a three-month transition period.FTT supports client reentry by helping them maintain contactwith service providers and adhering to the conditions of theirrelease. Within three months of the offender's release FTT stafftransition out of the case. The Department of Mental Health has developed a data- base on offenders with mental illness to track the success of theinitiative. From April 1998 to September 2001, 63 percent ofreleasees had remained engaged in mental health services at theend of the three-month transition period. Only 4 percent hadbeen reincarcerated and the same percentage had required acutehospitalization.

The DMH trains themembers of the parole board on basic mental health issues. Aseparate training for parole administrators focuses on improvedrelease planning for parolees with mental illness. Description The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding identified edu- cation and training as crucial to realizing the goal of improvedservices to incarcerated individuals with mental illness. Thecross-training both covers basic mental health issues and helpsstaff from all agencies to understand the new policies and pro-cedures developed as part of the broad agreement. Specifically,the Department of Mental Health educates the parole board andparole administrators about the Forensic Transition Teams\u2014a collaborative program to identify inmates with severe and persis-tent mental illness, improve discharge planning, and ensure con-tinuity of care for parolees. Challenges/Areas for Improvement The DMH hopes to extend its cross-training efforts to the various regional parole offices. These trainings would bring rep-resentatives together from hospitals, community mental healthproviders, and parole offices. The goal would be to improve thecross-system knowledge among these groups and ultimately tofacilitate collaboration between the different agencies at the re-gional level.

The Police Department also haspromoted collaboration among various leaders in the communityand the mental health system. Description The Lee's Summit Police Department serves a community of 70,000 people with approximately 104 sworn officers. TheCrisis Intervention Team that the department has developed issimilar to other CIT programs. It differs from other CIT pro-grams, however, in that staff who receive CIT training and serveon the team include a broad range of personnel who interact withpeople with mental illness: school resource officers; traffic offic-ers; detention officers; and DARE officers. The Lee's Summit Police Department has implemented a 40-hour training curriculum and trained 22 officers to date. Theyalso provide two eight-hour training courses: 1) introductorytraining for recruits; and 2) in-service training for patrol officers. The Lee's Summit Police Department also coordinates with the local mobile crisis team, which CIT officers can contact foron-scene assistance. The Lee's Summit Police Department actively campaigned to have the Crisis Intervention Team program implemented inthe community, and have seized many opportunities to discussthe program with community organizations, the media, and thegeneral public. The department also offers citizen ride-alongs tofacilitate understanding between officers and citizens. As a re-sult of these actions, many family members of people with men-tal illness report that their level of trust in the police departmenthas increased. The department also founded a coordinating council, which includes mental health care providers, consumers and other rep-resentatives from NAMI, local law enforcement, the MissouriDepartment of Mental Health, Western Missouri Mental Healthstaff, Truman Medical Center, Metro-area private mental healthservice providers, Jackson Country Sheriff's Office, and KansasCity Police Department. The council meets monthly, providesguidance on training, and identifies people to write training cur-ricula and teach courses.Contact Information Lee's Summit Police Department Consensus ProjectSTATE: Nebraska AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Lincoln Police Department PROGRAM TITLE: Emergency Protective Custody Policy POLICY STATEMENT(S): On-Scene Assessment and On-Scene Response YEAR ESTABLISHED: 2000 Overview The Lincoln Police Department provides all patrol officers with mandatory recruit and in-service training regarding responseto people with mental illness who appear dangerous to them-selves or to others. Description There are approximately 200 patrol officers in the Lincoln Police Department. All of them receive mandatory recruit andin-service training concerning calls that involve the possibility ofplacing a person in emergency protective custody (EPC). In Ne-braska, only peace officers (e.g., sheriffs, police, jailers) are al-lowed to place an individual in EPC. As a result, the police arenotified when a service provider or family member feels a personwith a mental illness is a danger to him or herself or others. Ifthe officer suspects that the individual is dangerous, he or shewill notify the Lancaster Mental Health center for an evaluationof the individual. The department has developed a partnershipwith the center for provision of these services. The Lancaster Mental Health Center provides screening services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for people referred bypolice officers. On-call staff may perform consumer assess-ment at the scene of the incident, the police station, or the cen-ter. After evaluation, if a person is determined to be potentiallydangerous, he/she is taken to the County Crisis Center or Lin-coln General Hospital. These services are entirely county-funded.The most likely outcome is that the person will be ordered tofollow outpatient commitment. The police department also participates in two interagency task forces: one involving adults with mental illness, and onethat focuses on children/juveniles. During regular task forcemeetings, agency participants discuss specific cases and, if nec-essary, may share confidential information relevant to solvingongoing problems. These multi-agency meetings provide all in-volved parties with opportunities to share invaluable informationand establish trust. The Lancaster Mental Health Center is popular with offic- ers from the Lincoln Police Department because of its effective-ness in engaging people with mental illness and in limiting theirsubsequent involvement with law enforcementChallenges/Areas for Improvement The police department would like to establish a liaison within the department to develop further relations between lawenforcement and mental health service providers. This liaisonwould be on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Additionally, the task force is attempting to identify re- sources for a juvenile assessment center, because limited place-ments exist for juv eniles who require mental health evaluations. The task force is also working with the local courts to clarifyinformation-sharing boundaries and to prevent confidentialityviolations.

Description Founded in 1964, the National Judicial College has pro- vided educational opportunities for 58,000 judges worldwide.Based on the premise that the public benefits from an informedjudiciary, the college offers continuing education for judges in arange of topics. Affiliated with the University of Nevada, Reno,the National Judicial College offers a master's and Ph.D. programin judicial studies. Academic programs also include two-day tothree-week residential sessions offered throughout the year aswell as national conferences focused on contemporary issuessuch as prison overcrowding and the role of media in the courts. The College recently began offering a course regarding co- occurring disorders, which educates judges who handle criminalcases involving defendants with mental illness who also havealcohol and drug addictions. Judges improve their ability to de-termine which approaches to trea tment are likely to be effective given the defendant's situation, and they improve their under-standing of how to monitor individuals with mental illness andhistory of drug abuse and their compliance with conditions ofrelease. Methods used in the teaching include presentations,panels, videotape exercises, role play in the National JudicialCollege courtroom, and visits to 12-step meetings. The College believes that the course will make the treat- ment options themselves more effective because judges will havea better idea of which option is right for each offender. Thecourse focuses on showing judges how to evaluate the extent ofan offender's substance abuse and mental health problem, aswell as how to recognize the physiological and pharmacologicalaspects of substance abuse. The course also covers the correla-tion between addiction and mental illness.

Description After a consortium of mental health providers communi- cated the need for the Police Department to improve its responseto people with mental illness, the Department established a CITteam. To participate in the program, all CIT officers are requiredto complete a 40-hour certification course, which is similar to thecourse that the Memphis Police Department developed. The train-ing includes courses on officer safety, legal issues, psychophar-macology, and also includes role-play activities. The training dis-cusses alternatives to the use of force and minimizing injuries toofficers and citizens. Officers are carefully selected through a screening process and are given incentive pay for their CIT participation. Whencalls involving people with mental illness come into dispatch,they are directed to CIT officers for response. As of 2001, of 425patrol officers, 250 have been trained and 108 were active teammembers. Albuquerque has expanded upon the basic Memphis CIT model by adding a detectives' bureau housed within the SpecialInvestigations division. This bureau is assigned to follow up withCIT cases with a focus on prevention. There are four full-timedetectives supervised by a sergeant to review CIT reports andidentify people at high risk for contact with law enforcement andconduct follow-up. An example of a high-risk case would be aperson who has repeated contacts with the police and has notreceived additional services. These detectives interact regularlywith the mental health community to keep high-risk individualsfrom falling through the cracks. The goal is to reduce their con-tacts with police by connecting them with the appropriate ser-vices. The mental health providers continue to interact with the assigned detectives to conduct follow-up with people determinedto be at-risk. Outreach and education has also been conductedwith mental health groups such as NAMI. Education has beenprovided so that family members are aware of the program andcan ask for a CIT officer as needed.Division of Mental Health Services continuedAppendix B.

Description A small (three-person) pretrial services team ensures that all individuals with mental illness formally charged in Albuquer-que are screened for conditional release. The team monitors thedefendant's compliance with the conditions of release. The program began in 1994, when the New Mexico Alliance for the Mentally Ill, in response to a court or der and lawsuit, convened community groups to open channels of communicationbetween criminal justice and mental health providers. A jaildiversion project emerged, consisting of both prebooking (CIT-Memphis model) and post-booking (the Pretrial Services Divi-sion) diversion efforts. Judges, attorneys, jail staff, mental health providers, fam- ily members, and police refer cases to the Pretrial Services Divi-sion. Pretrial Services Specialists provide a highly structuredand concentrated form of supervision with stringent reportingrequirements, taking into consideration the defendant's mentalillness. Specialists regularly visit the defendant in the commu-nity and maintain contact with family members, case managers,and service providers. Pretrial Service Specialists work closely with the local mental health center, where a Forensic Case Manager facilitatesclient treatment and acts as a liaison between treatment servicesand the criminal justice system. In addition, to facilitate and support the diversion effort, the adult probation department inAlbuquerque has assigned two agents assigned to work specifi-cally with persons with mental illness. From September 1999 to September 2000, the number of clients served through the Pretrial Services Jail Diversion pro-gram totaled 110 persons, at least 61 percent of whom had beencharged with misdemeanors. At least 68 percent of those whoreceived community-based services had a dual diagnosis of mentalillness and substance abuse.Albuquerque Police Department continued352 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectAccording to an article that appeared in the Albuquerque Journal in 1999, in the first one and a half years of the Pretrial Services Jail Diversion program, about 40 cases a year were di-verted.

FIC workswith both jails and the police to provide education on how to bestmanage offenders with mental illness. Description Since its inception, FIC has trained 120 officers of the Albuquerque Police Department, receiving support from the chiefof police there. Training sessions are closed to the public andtake place over a few days. Classes are kept small, with usuallyno more than 20 officers in attendance, and officers receive fol-low-up training. The cornerstone of FIC's project is the jail di-version program. Its most recent project is the development ofmental health services within the New Bernalillo County Jail sothat individuals with mental illness can immediately be screenedand treated on site. In addition, FIC keeps a Forensic Pretrial Specialist at metro court to assist offenders with mental illness.The program receives funding from the New Mexico Departmentof Health and is supported by the University of New MexicoMental Health Center.

Description The Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services is an independent nonprofit corporation in New YorkCity, which provides services and supervision for almost 4,500offenders a year. The Nathaniel Project offers comprehensive community-based case management services and intensive su-pervision and support. Staff assist participants in obtaining andengaging in treatment, supportive housing, and benefits\u2014allcrucial elements in establishing stability and avoiding criminalinvolvement. The project monitors participant progress and of-fers guidance and supportive counseling for a two-year period. Referrals can be made by anyone, but typically come through court personnel. Candidates undergo a multi-step screening andrisk-assessment process to assess their current situation, psy-chiatric and criminal history, and potential for success in theprogram. The Nathaniel Project will consider any prison-bounddefendant who has been indicted on a felony charge, has a seri-ous mental illness, and requires on-going psychiatric treatmentand supportive services to function in the community. Upon referral, Nathaniel staff conduct a psycho-social as- sessment of the individual as well as an evaluation of the cir-cumstances in the pending criminal case. This allows staff todetermine whether he or she meets the program's basic criteria:that he or she has a serious and persistent mental illness (in-cluding Mentally Ill Chemically Addicted) and is jail or prison-bound. The screening also determines whether the individual isstable enough to make use of program services and whetherstaff can develop a reasonable, individualized plan for consider-ation by the court and the District Attorney's Office. When the judge approves the offender's participation in the program, project staff make arrangements for temporary or tran-sitional housing prior to the inmate's release from custody; staffthen meet with each client at the time of their release and escortthem to their housing provider. During the first year of the pro-gram participants receive intensive case management and su- pervision services. During the first year, the case management focus is to help clients apply for and receive Medicaid and other public benefits,obtain stable housing or enter a residential treatment program,become engaged in community-based psychiatric treatment, anddevelop other community-based links that will help them achievestability. In the first 90 days, when the risk of relapse is greatest,project staff directly administer treatment so that there is conti-nuity during the transition to new housing and treatment provid-ers. The project budget also includes a \"subsistence\" allowancefor medication and basic needs such as food, clothing, and tem-porary housing, and for any gap in benefits. Project staff meet regularly with the participant and vari- ous service providers to monitor progress, collect information forthe court, intervene as an advocate for the participant with pro-viders, assist providers in treatment planning and working withthe participant. Above all, staff foster a close relationship withthe participant to reinforce treatment compliance. This relation-ship is the critical element to compliance and helps participantsachieve the goals and objectives outlined in their service plancontract. If the participant does not fulfill his or her programobligations, project staff will inform the court and/or probationpromptly. Staff also escort clients to all court dates and presentprogress reports to the court as requested. During the second year, case management shifts to a monthly monitoring and supervision model. Participants are expected tohave a stable living situation, to be engaged in treatment, and tohave developed a community-based support network. Frequencyof contact is determined in coordination with other mental healthtreatment providers and by court requests for continued progressreports.

Description The Parole Restoration Project was developed with funding from the New York State Department of Criminal Justice Ser-vices and the New York City Department of Corrections. Projectstaff identify parole violators with mental illness who are willingto volunteer in the program. After identifying eligible violators, project staff assess their treatment needs, links them with community-based service pro-viders, advocate for support of the treatment plan from parolefield staff, and, when appropriate, recommend the restitution ofparole. When project staff are successful in securing a restitution of parole to the offender (in lieu of incarceration), the staff fa-cilitate contact with providers and escort the offender to ser-vices. The project capitalizes on relationships with the OsborneAssociation/El Rio (outpatient drug treatment); the Women'sPrison Association (residential and community supervision, familypreservation); Friends of the Island Academy (crisis interventionand education); and the CASES Nathaniel Project to connect theparolee to services. PRP staff also monitor participant compli-ance through ongoing contact with community-based service pro-viders, provides monthly reports to the Division of Criminal Jus-tice Services, the Department of Correction and Division of Paroleon participant progress, and notifies appropriate authorities ininstances of noncompliance.

Description The New York Commission of Correction and the Office of Mental Health developed SPSG, which has been validated throughnumerous research projects. The guidelines consist of a struc-tured interview conducted during the booking process by book-ing officers and examines risk factors from past behavior, theinmate's current situation, and mental status. If there are indi- cations that the inmate may be suicidal, the booking officer con-tacts the shift commander for immediate intervention, who ar- ranges for increased supervision of the individual. The New York State Local Correctional Suicide Prevention Crisis Service Program is a multifaceted program designed tofacilitate the identification and treatment of prisoners who aresuicidal and/or seriously mentally ill. This program has beenspecifically structured to establish administrative and direct ser-vice linkages among county jails, police lockups, and local men-tal health programs. It clearly defines the roles and responsibili-ties of mental health and local correction agencies in theidentification and management of high-risk prisoners. The modelalso provides materials for training both officers and mental healthservice personnel. The Crisis Service Program was designed in 1984 by the NYS Office of Mental Health, the NYS Commission of Correction,Ulster County Department of Mental Health, and a statewidetask force. The task force included representatives from the fol-lowing agencies: NYS Association of Chiefs of Police; NYS Sher-iffs' Association; NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services; NYSDivision of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse; NYS Office of MentalRetardation and Developmental Disabili ties; NYS Division of Sub- stance Abuse Services; and the Governor's Task Force on Alco-holism and Criminal Justice.Appendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report355 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectThe Local Correctional Suicide Prevention Crisis Service Program contains the following six major components (descrip-tions of the components relate to the current curriculum andmaterials): 1. An Eight-Hour Training Program for jail and lockup officers in Suicide and Suicide Prevention is a train-ing program provided prior to the implementation ofthe procedures. The key elements of this programare: a) trainer's manual, b) 50-minute video, andc) officer handbook. 2. A Mental Health Resource Manual can be used to familiarize local mental health personnel with mentalhealth and operational issues relevant to police lock-ups and county jails. The major components of themanual are: a) an overview of the criminal justicesystem; b) suggestions regarding the best ways ofproviding mental health services with local correc-tional facilities; and c) a detailed explanation of New York State laws relative to the delivery of mentalhealth services to jail and lockup inmates. 3. Policy and Procedural Guidelines for county jail, police lockup, and mental health agency personnel.The policies and procedures outline administrativeand direct service actions that will enable staff toidentify, manage, and serve inma tes who have men- tal illness or are at a high risk for suicide. 4. Suicide Prevention Intake Screening Guidelines that can be administered during the intake process to facilitate identification of high-risk inmates. Theguidelines are administered by jail and lockup offic-ers prior to cell assignment. Administration time isapproximately five minutes. 5. A Four-Hour Refresher Training Program for Jails and Lockup Officers training is designed as an in-service refresher course focusing on the essentialaspects of identifying and managing suicide risk injails and lockups as well as responding to the impactof a facility suicide on jail/lockup staff. It is basedupon the basic eight-hour program and includes: 1)trainer's manual and 2) set of six videotapes. 6. Criminal Justice System Training for Mental Health Services Providers is a 14-hour training program designed to provide mental health staff andother service providers with basic knowledge of thecriminal justice system, suicide prevention, New YorkState Mental Hygiene Law, and alternatives to incar-ceration. The training addresses many of the sameareas presented in the suicide prevention training for corrections and police officers and contains consider-able New York State-specific information. TheManual of Criminal Justice Interventions for MentalHealth Providers focuses on alternatives to incarcera-tion for persons with mental illness and is a supple-ment to the 14-hour training program. This program was designed for implementation based on adoption of all six interrelated program components. No indi-vidual component is intended to be freestanding. Following the demonstration and refinement of the pro- gram, a statewide initiative was implemented to provide all NewYork State counties with training and technical assistance inimplementing the program. This initiative was administered bythe NYS Office of Mental Health, Bureau of Forensic Services,and the NYS Commission of Correction, Medical Review Bureau,in cooperation with the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Ser-vices, Office of Public Safety. All of the counties in New YorkState implemented the program.

The program relies on a network of part-ners including the Center for Urban Community Services (CUCS)whose staff provides in house support services for the formerlyhomeless who live in Common Ground housing. Description Based upon a holistic model as a response to homelessness, Common Ground goes beyond just shelter for the homeless, pro-viding a supportive and community setting within one of thebuildings it owns. In order to create a sense of belonging, Com-mon Ground offers facilities such as clinics, libraries, mentalhealth services, computer centers, and art studios within eachbuilding where members of the pr ogram can become part of a community. The comprehensive support system helps homelesspeople regain a sense of stability and independence. Funding for the program comes from a range of sources, including government and private grants, as well as rents andfees from property management. Rent at the buildings is set at 30 percent of a tenant's salary. Supportive housing generally costs between $10,000 and$18,000 per year per tenant compared to $25,000 for homelessshelters and $160,000 for a psychiatric hospital. Common Groundmaintains three buildings in Manhattan. Since 1991, 1,850 ten- ants have been housed.

Description In 1994, as part of a Memorandum of Understanding be- tween the New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) and theNew York State Division of Parole (DOP), the DOP establisheddedicated mental health caseloads for parolees in the New YorkCity region. Since then, dedicated mental health caseloads havebeen added in the Buffalo region. Parole officers in this programcarry a reduced caseload of approximately 25 cases and workclosely with community mental health agencies to help paroleesengage in treatment. The DOP worked with its regional directors to establish this program without any specialized funding. The program rec-ognizes that it often takes increased time and interagency coor-dination to serve parolees with mental illness. Accordingly, theprogram involves specialized training for the parole officers, re-duced caseloads, and agreements between the DOP and the OMH. Challenges/Areas for Improvement Only individuals with serious and persistent mental ill- ness, as defined by the OMH, are currently eligible for the Dedi-cated Mental Health Caseloads. The DOP would like to expandthe program to serve parolees who have mental health problems that do not fit the OMH standard of serious and persistent. Thereis, however, currently a waiting list for the program. In addition,the DOP is actively considering the creation of two related pro-grams: the Parole Support and Treatment Program and the es-tablishment of a transitional housing unit in the Sing-Sing StatePrison that will help inmates with mental illness prepare fortheir transition into the community.

Description This MOU was prepared to enhance the opportunities for parolees with severe and persistent mental illness to adapt toliving in their communities and to reduce the potential for recidi-vism. The MOU addresses discharge planning, entitlement ap-plications, post-release aftercare, cross-training, and resolutionsof disputes arising between the two agencies. Through the MOU, the DOP and OMH agree to engage in collaborative prerelease planning, including early identificationof inmates with severe and persistent mental illness and devel-oping linkages to community-based mental health programs. TheMOU also established a new intensive case management pro-gram for parolees with mental illness. In the MOU, the parties also agreed on the importance of helping inmates complete applications for various social services(public assistance, Medicaid, food stamps) prior to release. Inaddition, there are provisions covering joint-training for OMH andDOP personnel. This training is, in part, intended to help parolestaff gain access to mental health services for parolees.

Description PSTP is a program for which parolees with chronic mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorders with a mini-mum parole term of six months may volunteer. The PSTP is a collaborative effort between the New York Office of Mental Health (OMH), the New York Division of Parole(DOP) and Project Renewal, a New York City-based nonprofit thatprovides a variety of housing and support services for individu-als with mental illness and/or substance abuse. Project Re-newal will provide the supported transitional housing and casemanagement for the PSTP , which will include 50 residential beds scattered among several locations. Project Renewal hopes tomaintain groups of units to provide an element of peer supportfor program participants. Program participants will be identified by the prerelease coordinators in conjunction with the OMH Central New York Psy-chiatric Center Satellite/Mental Health Units. Once involved inthe program, a team of community-based mental health workerswill work with a parole officer with a dedicated mental health caseload to ensure that necessary services, including basic lifeneeds, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and hous-ing, are supplied to the participant. Some program participantsmay require some period of transition before entering PSTP hous-ing. Once the parolee is placed in PSTP housing, Project Re-newal staff will provide supportive services at the housing site,as opposed to requiring the participant to access services fromproviders outside of the housing location. While involved in theprogram, the support team and the parole officer will work withthe parolee to establish a long-term housing and services plan.Long-term housing options will vary for different parolees; somemay be transitioned to congregate living facilities with in-house,24-hour support, and some may be moved to less intensivelysupported housing.358 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectIn addition to its work with PTSP , Project Renewal admin- isters a range of rehabilitation programs intended for homelessindividuals in New York City. Starting with mobile medical andpsychiatric outreach teams, Project Renewal workers reach out tohomeless in the streets, shelters, and transit terminals. Oncethe homeless person is willing to accept help, the program pro-vides services such as short-term and permanent housing, psy-chiatric and medical support, substance abuse treatment, andemployment training/job placement. Completely renovated by1995, Holland House in midtown Manhattan has become one ofthe nation's only large scale permanent housing centers servingthe homeless and the homeless with disabilities, including men-tal illness and HIV/AIDS.

It provides education,housing, employment programs, and social opportunities for itsmembers and helps them to access clinical treatment. Description Fountain House is operated by its members in partnership with professional staff. It provides community-based program-ming including opportunities for joining in the running of theClubhouse, working at participating businesses throughout NewYork City, and taking advanta ge of Fountain House's housing, education, advocacy, and social and recreation activities. The program's roots date back to the mid-1940s, when ten patients in a state mental hospital formed a self-help group.When they were released, they continued to meet in nearby NewYork City, calling their group \"We Are Not Alone,\" or \"WANA.\"Their goal, based on the concept of self-help through mutualhelp, was to assist one and other and ex-patients like themselvesfind jobs, places to live, and friendship\u2014paths back to indepen-dence and productivity. In 1948, they established their first club-house, which was the genesis of Fountain House, the first pro-gram of its kind in the field of community support and psychiatricrehabilitation. While clubhouses such as Fountain House do not directly provide clinical treatment services, they generally have stronglinks with appropriate agencies to ensure that members who needtreatment are able to receive it. Fountain House is able to meet the needs of members who are elderly or disabled by illness or disability. Ten percent of itsmembers, for instance, are deaf or hearing-impaired. Approxi-mately half of its members have histories of substance or alco-hol abuse. And one in five are elderly. Fountain House meets theneeds of its clients by accepting them as they present them-selves and working with them from that point forward. According to a document developed jointly by Fountain House members and staff, \"the Fountain House vision is that peoplewith mental illness everywhere achieve their potential and arerespected as co-workers, neighbors and friends.\" Fountain Housetoday serves 1,300 active members annually.

Program Examples Cited in Report361 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSTATE: New York AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Office of Mental Health PROGRAM TITLE: Pathways to Housing (New York City and Westchester County) POLICY STATEMENT(S): Housing YEAR ESTABLISHED: 1992 Overview Pathways to Housing provides housing to individual who are homeless and have psychiatric disabilities and/or substanceabuse problems. Unlike most programs that provide housing forthis population, participation in Pathways housing is not contin-gent on the receipt of treatment. Instead, Pathways offers hous-ing first, and then provides links to other clinical and supportservices. Description Pathways to Housing believes that housing is the key ele- ment in helping people with mental illness and substance abusedisorders to stabilize their lives and begin the process of recov-ery. Accordingly, Pathways focuses on clients who have been turnedaway from other programs because they refuse to participate intreatment, have histories of violence and incarceration, or havepersonality or behavioral problems. Program participants are required to sign a standard lease agreement and must agree to two inspections a month, for up tosix months. In addition they have access to support servicesthrough an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) team. Theservice coordinator and tenant develop an individualized plan,based on the wishes of the tenant, which extends beyond hous-ing to include education, vocation, mental health, physical health,alcoholism and substance abuse treatment, finances, self-care,and social and family network/support. About half of theprogram's staff are in recovery from substance abuse or a psy-chiatric disability, and oftentimes, were themselves once home-less. Pathways was founded in 1992 by the Office of Mental Health. The program currently serves 300 individuals in scat-tered site locations throughout Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and in Westchester County. Funding for the program comesfrom Section 8 vouchers, the HUD Shelter Plus Care Program,and the Office of Mental Health. In a recent study, 225 homeless people with psychiatric disabilities were r andomly assigned either to the Pathways pro- gram or to traditional New York City services. After one year, theself-reported quality of life improved at comparable rates andthere were no differences in the levels of substance abuse be-tween the two samples. The one significant difference that Path- ways points to is that there was an 80 percent reduction in theamount of time spent homeless for the group assigned to Path-ways versus a 23 percent reduction in time spent homeless amongthose assigned to traditional services. Additional data from 2000indicates that 88 percent of the program's members remainedhoused after five years.

Description The training program is designed for administrators and supervisors of mental health agencies that currently serve orintend to serve persons with mental illness who have been incar-cerated. The goals of the training are to improve provider recep-tivity toward serving this population, increase the coordinationbetween mental health providers and parole staff, and reduce thestigma surrounding involvement with the criminal justice sys-tem. The training is coordinated by the Howie T. Harp AdvocacyCenter. The Transitions Training program employs forensic con- sumer co-trainers that have all experienced incarceration in stateprison firsthand, and have struggled with recovery once releasedinto the community. These consumers are especially effectivetrainers because they can assess how effective agency providerswho attend the sessions have been in the past in helping thispopulation in a positive and therapeutic manner. The trainingsessions cover topics such as the New York State criminal justicesystem, mental health services in prisons, and the experiencesof incarceration, release, and reintegration. Ten free sessions of training are offered to mental health provider agencies. Additional training sessions are available fora fee. The training manual itself also provides a wealth of con-tact information for agency providers looking for specific organi-zations that provide assistance to released inmates, ranging fromways to get involved in community service to programs for for-merly incarcerated mothers.

Consumers canbe referred through a variety of avenues, including from the statecorrectional facilities, local jails, police, public defender's office,hospitals, and emergency rooms. Project Link has a special focus on engaging consumers who are members of minority populations and, to this end, em-ploys a diverse and well-trained staff. Components of the project include a mobile treatment team that delivers services to 40 of the 100 project enrollees who arein the greatest need of assistance. The mobile treatment teamincludes a part-time forensic psychiatrist and a full-time psychi-atric nurse practitioner. The project also operates a treatmentresidence for clients with chemical dependence, which is staffedaround the clock. Project Link staff work with consumers while they are still involved in the criminal justice system (e.g., in the courtroom, inthe jail), working to have consumers placed in Project Link as analternative to incarceration and a condition of release. ProjectLink staff also work with community corrections officials in us-ing the leverage of sanctions to improve compliance. Project Link staff conduct extensive training and cross- training efforts; they have presented seminars to representativesof the local parole, police force, bar association, and other crimi-nal justice personnel.Appendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report363 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProject Link has collected data concerning the effective- ness of the treatment program. The experiences of 46 individu-als admitted to the mobile treatment team were examined be-tween October 1, 1997 and December 1, 1998. The data for theperiod while involved with Project Link were then compared todata from the year prior to their involvement. Individuals in-volved in the project experienced a significant drop in mean num-ber of days spent in jail per month (9.1 to 2.1) and mean numberof hospital days (8.3 to 3). Using per diem rates, this translatesto a reduction of $30,908 to $7,235 for total jail costs and from$197,899 to $42,247 in reduced hospital costs. In addition, con-sumer satisfaction ratings for the program were a mean of 4.6out of 5 (5 being the highest level of satisfaction) and 35 of the46 consumers reported that Project Link helped them cut downon their substance abuse. Project Link received the American Psychiatric Association Gold Achievement Award in 1999 for its success in meeting theclinical, social, and residential needs of this difficult-to-servepopulation. Challenges/Areas for Improvement Maintaining ongoing funding support is the biggest ob- stacle to sustaining the program. To date, the principal sourceof funding for the project has been time-limited grants.

Description As of 2001, four full-time crisis intervention advocates and a contract staff of six part-time advocates operate the MobileCrisis Unit. The unit is on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week toassist police officers who respond to people in crisis. In addition to contracting intervention assistance from ad- vocates, the Chapel Hill Police Department also trains all officersto appropriately respond to people with mental illness. Academytraining is state-mandated but the department provides supple-mental training as well. As part of the training, people withmental illness visit the classroom to speak to officers and inter-act informally with them. These consumers share their personalexperiences with police encounters. The departmental response protocol states that when an officer responds on-scene to a call, he or she will try to defusethe problem immediately, but may also contact the Mobile CrisisUnit for assistance. If necessary, the officer transports the per-son in crisis to North Carolina Memorial Hospital for emergencyevaluation and/or commitment. The police department has amemorandum of understanding with North Carolina MemorialHospital, which provides that individuals picked up by the policemay be brought to the hospital and will be seen within a speci-fied period of time. The Mobile Crisis Unit also coordinates informal case con- ferences with the police department. Some individuals with mentalillness frequently come into contact with officers. The unit canoffer suggestions for officers on their interactions with thoseindividuals whom they know well. The crisis unit can provideresources and measures to protect both the officer's and theindividual's safety. The Mobile Crisis Unit understands that providing an ef- fective response to police situations involving people with mentalillness depends on a community partnership among law enforce-ment, mental health care providers, crisis intervention advocates,and citizens. Relationships with a local community clubhouse and NAMI provide unit staff with the opportunity to interact withfamily members of people with mental illness and become ac-tively involved in community education. Additionally, the crisisunit is hosting a support group for children of parents with men-tal illness. Challenges/Areas for Improvement Turnover among employees working in the local mental health center is high. As a result, the crisis unit regularly mustform new relationships with staff at the mental health center. Inaddition, the Chapel Hill Police Department, with additional re-sources, would like to develop and implement a system for pro-viding additional follow up and intervention to people who fre-quently come in contact with the police.

Correctional psychologists from state prisons across NorthCarolina refer candidates for the program. Description The SOAR program was established at Harnett correctional institution in North Carolina and is administered in two wings ofone of the dormitories. Sexual offenders who admit their guiltand volunteer to enter the SOAR program are referred from prisonunits across the state. SOAR is based on the premise that 1)deviant sexual behavior is learned; 2) the treatment of sexualoffenders involves learning appropriate and responsible socialand sexual behavior to substitute for the negative behaviors thatled to the commission of the offense. SOAR is an intensive residential therapeutic community. Participants are in treatment six hours per day, five days perweek for twenty weeks (approximately 600 hours of treatment).Approximately 40 participants are selected for each of two treat-ment cycles, with about 72 inmates completing SOAR each year.The program is staffed by psychologists with experience in work-ing with sexual offenders as well as inmate peer counselors\u2014inmates who have completed the SOAR program and who, aspeer counselors, provide support services to staff and partici-pants. The SOAR program has an approximate annualized operat- ing cost of $183,000 per year, a cost of $7.16 per inmate (whichdoes not include the cost of incarceration). The primary criteriaused for evaluating the program's success are periodic analysesof recidivism statistics. As of April 2000, 302 SOAR participantshad been released into the community and lived in the commu-nity for an average of three years. Of these, 25 participants (8.3percent) were readmitted to the North Carolina Department ofPrisons (for any reason, including parole violations). Elevenparticipants (3.5 percent) returned to the department of prisonsfor either a conviction on a new sexual offense or a charge thatmay have been sexually motivated. SOAR staff is in the processof collecting data regarding non-SOAR sex offenders released from custody for comparison purposes. Challenges/Areas for Improvement Treatment of sex offenders faces a number of challenges. Despite research to the contrary, the stigma that sex offenderscannot be treated persists. In addition, the lack of trained andexperience staff to work with this population presents ongoingdifficulties. Also, sex offenders who are identified as such by theprison population will often be reluctant to be housed in thegeneral population for fear of harassment or violence by the otherinmates.

Box ProjectSTATE: Ohio AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Department of Mental Health PROGRAM TITLE: Coordinating Centers of Excellence POLICY STATEMENT(S): Evidence-Based Practices YEAR ESTABLISHED: 2002 Overview The Ohio Department of Mental Health is in the process of establishing Coordinating Centers of Excellence (CCOE) respon-sible for disseminating evidence-based or promising practicesacross the state. Description The eight centers of excellence are planned with the hope that they can promote local initiative and raise statewide qualitymeasures. Each center is \"hosted\" within an existing entity, such as a university or county mental health boards and agencies. Atthe time of this writing, there are four centers for excellence inplace and four in the developmental stages. The centers workclosely with the department of mental health to focus their ef-forts on particular interventions, treatments, and populations.The four extant centers of excellence are discussed below: \u0093Learning Excellence is a program for children and adolescents run by Ohio State University that assists\"alternative schools\" in addressing the educational,social, emotional, and behavioral needs of thoseinvolved in the program. \u0093The Ohio Medication Algorithm Project (OMAP) is a program run by the University of Cincinnati andButler County CMH for adults, adolescents, and chil-dren that promotes utilization of medication algo-rithms to guide psychiatric medication decisions. \u0093Substance Abuse/Mental Illness (SAMI) is a pro- gram operated by Case Western Reserve Universityfor adults with co-occurring substance abuse andmental illness that promotes utilization of the inte-grated treatment model for SAMI services. \u0093The Use of Advance Directives is a program setup by the Washington County ADAMHS Board to encouragethe use of psychiatric advance directives amongmental health consumers and clinicians in the state. The four centers in the developmental stages are: \u0093Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST) is a program being coordinated by the Stark County CMH Board for chil-dren and adolescents that hopes to increase state-wide use of MST.\u0093The Medical College of Ohio is setting up a programfor people living with mental illness and their fami-lies in which evidence-based psychosocial rehabilita-tion practices to strengthen family involvement willbe encouraged. \u0093The Ohio Council of Behavioral Health care Organiza-tions is planning a program for adults living withmental illness to improve service quality by promot-ing client servicing \"clustering\" to organize services. \u0093A program for adults with mental illness involvedwith the criminal justice system is being organized topromote diversion programs using the GAINS Centermodel by Summit ADAMHS and NEOUCOM. Calendar year 2001 marked the ending of the long-stand- ing Longitudinal Study of Mental Health Services and ConsumerOutcomes in a Changing System (LCO) and the beginning of anew study, the Innovation Diffusion and Adoption Research Project(IDARP). The fifth and final wave of data collection of the LCOstudy was completed in 1998. During the past two years LCOresults were disseminated to a wide range of constituent groups(consumers, family members, agencies, boards, state and na-tional leaders). In addition, efforts were made to evaluate theeffectiveness of various dissemination methods and formats. The IDARP project goes several steps further in the study of dissemination by seeking to identify factors and processesassociated with the successful adoption and assimilation of in-novative evidence-based practices by behavioral health organi-zations across Ohio. The study focuses on evidence-based prac-tices that are being put forth by the Coordinating Centers of Excellence. Key informants (agency directors, clinical staff, CCOEleads) will provide information to better understand the processesby which evidence-based practices are adopted and what factorslead to their long-term success. This research is expected toprovide valuable information to the centers of excellence and topave the way for organizations wishing to adopt these practicesin the future. The research will also reduce the likelihood thatorganizations will misattribute their successes or failures to fac-tors that are irrelevant to the adoption of innovative practices.

Program Examples Cited in Report367 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSTATE: Ohio AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Hamilton County Department of Pretrial Services PROGRAM TITLE: Hamilton County Early Intervention Services POLICY STATEMENT(S): Appointment of Counsel; Pretrial Release/ Detention Hearing Overview The Hamilton County Pretrial Services Department inter- views arrestees, identifies defendants who may have a mentalillness, and presents the court with various options for theiradjudication. Description When pretrial services staff identify a defendant as possi- bly having a mental illness, the initial court appearance is post-poned from the morning calendar to the afternoon. The defen-dant consults with an attorney, and a mental health clinicianconducts an assessment. Options are then presented to the courtat the afternoon hearing. Pretrial services interviewers ask a series of questions developed by the Court Psychiatric Clinic to be used as a screen-ing tool to identify individuals who may have a mental illness ordevelopmental disability. These questions include: 1. Have you ever been in special education classes? 2. Have you ever been in a psychiatric/mental hospital?3. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist, psychologist, or case manager? 4. Have you ever taken medications for psychiatric rea- sons for your nerves? 5. Have you ever been in psychiatric outpatient treat- ment? 6. Have you ever heard voices?7. Have you ever thought about or attempted suicide? A positive response to any of these questions triggers an additional inquiry by mental health staff. The mental health staff use BASIS-32, a standardized, self-report problem behavior andsymptom identification tool, for this assessment. The tool yieldsan overall impairment score that results from scores of five spe-cific domains: mental health functioning including relationships,depression, and anxiety; daily living skills; impulsivity; addictivebehavior; and psychosis. Early identification with swift interven-tion to treatment services for arrestees who may have mentalhealth problems is the primary objective of the project, whichseeks to enhance the ability to quickly determine eligibility for pretrial diversion, pretrial release, and intermediate sanctions.The county is conducting pilot studies involving persons entering the criminal justice system. The studies will collectinformation about rates of psychiatric and substance abuse dis-orders, extent of trauma tic life events, and overall cog nitive func- tioning. Such data will facilitate a more effective treatment strategyin the development of appropriate alternatives to incarceration.

The Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Psychotherapy Team(ADAPT) serves inmates with mental health concerns incarcer-ated in the jail. Description Inmates admitted to the facility receive an initial screening from the booking officer. Next, a mental health worker performsa cognitive function examina tion, which is followed by an evalu- ation by a clinical psychologist. The county also employs a crisisintervention specialist who is a member of the jail's staff. Thecrisis intervention specialist receives 40 hours of training peryear from the facility's mental health coordinator. Inmates who are at high risk may be housed in the mental health housing units where they are more closely observed andmonitored by ADAPT staff and deputies. These inmates mayinclude those who are actively psychotic, suicidal, or in with-drawal. The primary responsibilities of ADAPT staff include: \u0093psychosocial assessments \u0093crisis intervention \u0093management of acute psychotic episodes \u0093monitoring of detoxification \u0093suicide prevention \u0093prevention of psychological deterioration during in- carceration \u0093chemical dependency treatment \u0093education focused on individual needs \u0093elective therapy services. These services are available at no cost to all inmates of the jail and referrals are made to community agencies for follow-up services. Corrections staff for the mental health unit are selected jointly by the ADAPT director and correction security supervi-sors. These deputies work only on the mental health unit. Jailmental health services are enhanced by the use of a computer-ized information tracking system. This system is used to track all inmates who have received a mental health evaluation. Theinformation contained in the system includes demographics, di-agnosis, staff time, and the number of inmates using each typeof service. Contact Information Summit County Jail 205 E.

Program Examples Cited in Report369 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSTATE: Oklahoma AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Broken Arrow Police Department PROGRAM TITLE: Mobile Outreach Crisis Intervention Services POLICY STATEMENT(S): On-Scene Assessment and On-Scene Response YEAR ESTABLISHED: 2001 Overview The Broken Arrow Police Department established a part- nership with the Mobile Outreach Crisis Intervention Services(MOCS), a community-based mental health organization, to as-sist the police as second responders to crisis calls involvingpeople with mental illness Description The Broken Arrow Chief of Police is a member of the MOCS advisory board, along with representatives from NAMI, ParksideHospital (a local mental health facility), and the Tulsa PoliceDepartment. In this role, the chief became acquainted with theMOCS services and their benefit to the police and their clients.As a result, the police department and MOCS jointly developedthe following response protocols. After an officer responds on-scene and encounters a per- son who may have a mental illness that appears to be a factor inthe incident, the officer can call MOCS immediately for an evalu-ation. It is estimated that responding officers call MOCS aboutthree times weekly for assistance. Once MOCS arrives on-scene,they can assess the mental health needs of the individual. If theindividual is in need of services but is not violent, MOCS cantake the person to a mental health facility without police escort.This saves time for the police and expedites services to the cli-ent. Also, in facilitating patient commitment, MOCS has moreflexibility than the police\u2014police can only detain and transportto the nearest mental health facility individuals who are a dangerto themselves or others. When not responding to these types of calls, MOCS also provides preventive and follow-up services to clients releasedfrom mental health facilities after commitment. The team is ableto meet with family members and to coordinate services. MOCSis also available to the police to assist with SWAT team inci-dents. MOCS provides guidance and support in barricade situa-tions in which the person may have a mental illness. The State of Oklahoma mandates two hours of annual po- lice in-service training on mental illness. Broken Arrow PoliceDepartments requires four hours of training and provides theopportunity for an additional eight hours of in-service trainingon mental illness. Additionally, two hours of mandator y training for new recruits are provided in the academy.This service is funded through a grant from the Oklahoma State Department of Mental Health. A state law was passed toprovide funds for a state-certified training program modeled af-ter the Memphis Crisis Intervention Team. At the time of thiswriting, the training program w as in the process of being made available to all Oklahoma law enforcement agencies.

Description The jail diversion program targets defendants at five differ- ent points in the criminal justice system: 1. the initial contact made by law enforcement 2. screening and evaluation upon jail booking to assure continuity of treatment while in custody 3. screening for pretrial release4. ongoing bail review process for those detained as situations change (i.e., amendment of charges by thedistrict attorney) 5. assessment for the presentence investigation report. In their annual report for the year 2000, pretrial services reported that one in four program participants with serious men-tal illness were reincarcerated within eight months, and 39 per-cent of those rearrested were booked on charges of drugs or analcohol related offense.

Description Defendants identified as having co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders are referred to the same drugcourt program as defendants who have substance abuse prob-lems only. Shared elements of the program include: a singlejudge; voluntary participation; the use of gr aduated sanctions; program progress monitored by the court, with appearances atleast once a month; and dismissal of charges upon successfulcompletion. There are some important variations in the program for defendants with a co-occurring mental illness and a substanceabuse problem. Eligibility for defendants with co-occurring disor-ders is determined by the jail mental health staff and negotiatedwith the district attorney and public defender. These individualsreceive collaborative mental health and substance abuse treat-ment and the range of sanctions is sensitive to the mental healthproblems of this population. In addition, there is a mental healthspecialist/court liaison who serves the dual role of case man-ager and liaison to the judge.

Program Examples Cited in Report371 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSTATE: Oregon AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Lane County Sheriff's Office PROGRAM TITLE: Interim Incarceration Disenrollment Policy POLICY STATEMENT(S): Intake at County / Municipal Detention Facility YEAR ESTABLISHED: 2001 Overview The Interim Incarceration Disenrollment Policy in Lane County helps detainees and inmates retain their benefits whenincarcerated for short periods of time. For those individuals who arenot receiving benefits when they arrive at the jail, or whose benefitsare suspended while incarcerated, the program helps to expeditetheir enrollment in appropriate benefit programs upon their release. Description At the behest of officials in Lane County, Oregon has adopted the Interim Incarceration Disenrollment Policy, which specifiesthat individuals cannot be disenrolled from their health plan dur-ing their first 14 days of incarceration, during which the statemakes the Medicaid payments. In addition, Lane County officials have developed a relationship with the local application-process-ing agency for Medicaid and Social Security Insurance. Now, theapplication process for those individuals who did not have ben-efits prior to incarceration or whose incarceration period lasts longerthan 14 days can begin while the detainee is still in custody. The jail has also started an initiative to ensure that in- mates in their jail diversion program\u2014all of whom are diag-nosed with severe and persistent mental illness\u2014can accesstheir state health plan benefits upon their release. First, theinmates receive help from jail employees in filling out the plan application. Then staff members fax each application to theSenior and Disabled Services (SDS) office a day or two beforethe inmate's release. The applications are processed rapidly.Finally, the SDS office faxes to the jail the inmate's temporarycards, which can be used immediately to access all health planbenefits. A permanent care provider is sent after the inmate hasa managed care organization. In case there are problems or inmates need help with other issues, the jail staff stays in regu- lar contact with former inmates. Prior to developing this initiative, inmates had to wait sev- eral weeks for their applications to be processed, during whichtime they were without health care coverage.

(CST) was devel- oped in Philadelphia in response to the closure of a state hospi-tal. The CST visits various locations where mental health ser-vices are offered or where consumers are located and conductsinformal interviews with consumers to determine their level ofsatisfaction with the services. Description In 1990, when the State of Pennsylvania closed the Phila- delphia State Hospital, consumers, family members, and advo-cates in the city wanted to ensure that the needs and preferencesof the people discharged from the hospital were incorporatedinto the design of community-based mental health services. Agroup of these individuals formed CST, Inc. CST staff make unannounced visits to mental health and substance abuse treatment sites. They also visit consumers in their places of residence, in clubhouses, and in drop-in centers.In 1999 CST teams in Philadelphia and Delaware County madeapproximately 1,000 site visits an d interviewed a pproximately 7,500 consumers. CST prefers informal interviews over surveys. Through persistent advocacy CST has won support of local authorities for incorporation of CST's findings in the overall evalu-ation of the system's ability to provide services in the commu-nity. The Philadelphia Office of Mental Health funds CST, Inc. The Philadelphia CST has served as a model for a number of state and local systems wishing to formalize methods for ob-taining consumer feedback.

Description The forensic community re-entry and rehabilitation pro- gram was developed in response to the higher percentage ofinmates with mental illness who serve their maximum sentences as compared to inmates without mental illness. The lack ofsufficient community-based resources makes it difficult for theparole board to approve a parole plan, which leads to inmateswith mental illness being denied parole at rates significantly higherthan other inmates. In 2000, 16 percent of inmates served theirmaximum sentence, compared with 27 percent of inmates whohave a mental illness. Of those inmates who were classified ashaving a serious mental illness, 50 percent served their maxi-mum sentence. Once inmates with mental illness are released,they return home to neighborhoods where they are frequentlyunwelcome and where the lack of community services makestheir successful reintegration very difficult. The Pennsylvania Department of Correction (DOC), in con- junction of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole andthe Pennsylvania Community Providers Association, collaboratedto apply for funding for this program from the U.S. Departmentof Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance. The funding was re-ceived in 2001 and the program will begin in May 2002. Theprogram will employ Community Placement Specialists (CPSs)who will oversee the transition of the program participants fromthe prison to the community. The program will also providetransitional housing for a limited time (30 to 60 days) for thoseparticipants who do not have adequate community housing ac-commodations. DOC mental health staff will re fer inmates with mental illness, mental retardation, or substance abuse problems to theprogram approximately 12 months prior to their release. Mentalhealth staff will then interview the inmates and develop an as-sessment of their needs and strengths and forward this informa-tion to the community placement specialist. The CPS will locatecommunity-based treatment and support services (housing, mental health, substance abuse, childcare, employment training) in theinmate's home jurisdiction. The CPS will also ensure that the inmate is enr olled in any relevant pre-parole or reentry classes or services and will oversee the development of a transition planthat is acceptable to all of the relevant parties (providers, paroleboard, housing services, etc.) Once offenders are paroled, pa-role agents will supervise their treatment and supervision andthe CPS will conduct follow-up with service providers to monitorthe participant's progress. The pilot program will be located at the State Correctional Institution at Muncy, a close security female institution that housesthe inmates with the most serious mental illnesses. The DOCestimates serving 20-40 participants in the first program year. Contact Information Chief Psychologist Pennsylvania Department of Corrections2520 Lisburn RoadP .O.

Description Since 1993, the Women's Discovery Program has provided substance abuse treatment for female inmates in Rhode Islandstate prisons. Beginning in 1999, with the support of a grantfrom SAMHSA, the DOC added the Safe Release Program, whichtargets female inmates with mental illness or co-occurring sub-stance abuse disorders. Women who volunteer for the Discovery Program and re- main active participants for 30 days become eligible for the SafeRelease Program. The Safe Release Program is overseen by theProvidence Center, a local community-based mental health pro-vider. Eligible inmates receive mental health treatment and spe-cialized case management services. (The Safe Release Programis not the only mechanism for inmates to receive psychiatricservices; the Department of Corrections provides mental healthservices to eligible inmates even if they do not enter the Discov-ery Program.) The case managers who oversee the discharge planning for inmates with mental illness are employed by the ProvidenceCenter, and they continue to provide case management servicesfor up to one year after the inmate is released. This includeshelping inmates locate community-based substance abuse andmental health services, housing, employment, and other services.When appropriate, Providence Center case managers will even provide transportation for the inmate from the prison to a mentalhealth facility upon release. The use of community-based men-tal health providers as discharge planners ensures continuity ofcare after the inmate is released. Challenges/Areas for Improvement The Safe Release Program is funded by a grant from SAMHSA, which will ultimately expire. Continued funding of theprogram is not assured.Another challenge reported by program administrators is that individuals with co-occurring mental health and substanceabuse problems remain extremely difficult to serve, both whileincarcerated and once they are released. The lack of affordablehousing, the small number of appropriate treatment programs,and the dearth of employment opportunities are all enormousobstacles to overcome.

From this collaboration, a close partnership was initiatedbetween the Memphis Police Department and the University ofTennessee Medical Center Psychiatric Unit (also called \"TheMed.\") The CIT officers' goals are to de-escalate or to eliminateencounters that may be potentially injurious to consumers, po-lice officers, or citizens. The CIT consists of 213 patrol officers (approximately a quarter of the department's uniform officers) who receive exten- sive training in responding to people with mental illness. Offic-ers in the department volunteer to become members of the CIT,and are compensated through income increases, written com-mendations, and annual awards ceremonies. CIT officers complete a 40-hour training program, receive a week of annual in-service training (attended by all uniformofficers), and then receive an additional eight hours of special-ized training. Staff at the Med provide most of the officer train-ing, and family members of consumers also contribute to thetraining curricula. Training topics include recognizing mental ill-ness and medications, crisis de-escalation techniques, defenseweapons training, and role-playing sessions. The CIT officersalso visit patients' homes, the Veterans Administration hospital,and NAMI-facilitated state mental hospitals. Each of Memphis's seven precincts employs CIT officers who are familiar with each area. When responding to a call forservice involving a person with a possible mental illness, a CITofficer is guided by state statute and training guidelines to as-sess whether the subject should be transported to the Med forfurther assessment and provision of services and support. TheMed has an open-door policy and will provide assessments 24Appendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report375 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projecthours a day, 7 days a week, and is prepared to admit any person within 15 minutes of arrival. This ensures that officers are im-mediately available to return to patrol duties. Once admitted to the Med, unit staff assess the need to transfer the consumer to the state hospital or provide referrals tocommunity mental health programs and other resources. The Memphis CIT has served as a model of an advanced, proactive response to mental illness in the community, and hasbeen duplicated in numerous police departments nationwide. As a result of the CIT officers transporting consumers in crisis to the Med, this mental health facility has experienced a 40percent to 50 percent increase in the amount of new patientsadmitted. Before the CIT program, officers who made arrestswould take the subject directly to jail. However, the jail is notfully equipped to diagnose and pr ovide management of mental illness and substance abuse disorders. Challenges/Areas for Improvement The department is developing and identifying resources to create a detoxification unit at the Med. Officers responding tocalls for service in which the subject appears to be intoxicatedwould transport the person to the Med instead of the city jail. Asa result of this program, citizens with possible substance abusedisorders or co-occurring mental illness would be diverted fromthe jail to a medical facility that will focus on providing immedi-ate and long-term care rather than incarceration.

Description Programming is in place to provide habilitative, social sup- port, continuity of care, and security services to offenders iden-tified as mentally retarded or intellectually impaired. Interdisci-plinary teams, including a physician or registered nurse,psychologist, social caseworker, vocational supervisor, social worksupervisor, and rehabilitation aid, perform needs assessments todetermine services. Services for the identified population re-main in place through transitional/discharge planning. MROP is operated within two specialized housing units: 731 beds for male intellectually impaired offenders at one loca-tion and an additional 106 beds at another location for femaleinmates. MROP is intended to ensure that mentally retarded offenders are provided sheltered housing and work conditions,fair discipline, and protection from other prisoners. Offenders participate in a group intelligence test when they are processed into TDCJ-ID Diagnostic Unit. If an offender scoresbelow 70, he or she is then administered the Culture Fair test. Ifthe offender scores below 70, the offender is then sent to a diag-nostic facility where the Wechsler test is individually adminis-tered. Those scoring below 74 on the full-scale IQ are trans-ferred to the MROP for comprehensive evaluation. The Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) will complete a compre- hensive evaluation to determine the presence or scope of mentalretardation within 30 days of arrival to the MRO facility. As aresult of the evaluation/needs assessment, the team will de-velop an Individualized Habilitation Plan (IHP). Evaluations bythe various disciplines of the team are conducted to assess,diagnose, and identify treatment requirements of individuals whoare dually diagnosed (substance abuse and/or mental illness).Memphis Police Department continued376 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectOffenders with mental retardation are housed in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their habilitation, treat-ment, safety, and security needs. MROP housing assignmentand cell assignment status are initially determined on the daythe client arrives at the sheltered facility. MROP services include medical care; psychiatric services (for offenders who exhibit signs and symptoms of mental ill-ness); education (academic, special education, prerelease andvocational classes), occupational therapy; substance abuse treat-ment; ongoing treatment planning and monitoring (to measureclient progress and suitability of services); and continuity ofcare (transitional/discharge planning).

In 1994, TTUHSC began using telemedicine todeliver health services, including mental health services, to adultinmates and juv eniles in several facilities. Description TDCJ has contracted with TTUHSC to provide health ser- vices to 26 adult institutions, where approximately 33,000 in-mates are incarcerated. TTUHSC conducts approximately 2,000telemedicine consultations per year for inmates, via closed cir-cuit, interactive video technology. Researchers there are cur-rently developing a newer computer-based desktop system. Prior to the implementation of telemedicine, most inmates needing specialized medical care were transported from the prisonto a specialist, hospital, or other facility. Each trip cost between$200 and $1,000. The use of telemedicine in appropriate cir-cumstances has helped to save significant transportation expenses. Previously, the TTUHSC had provided telepsychiatry and telepsychology to inmates on a limited basis. A recent telepyschinitiative, however, has more than doubled the number oftelepyshciatry consultations that TTUHSC conducts. Approxi-mately one-third of consultations are intelepsychiatry and telepsychology. The TTUHSC telemedicineprogram has been recognized nationally as a leader in the field.

Description TDCJ has spelled out the procedure for obtaining non-for- mulary drugs for offenders in custody as part of the PharmacyPolicy and Procedure Manual. The prescribing physician mustprovide documentation in the offender's health record about whatrole the desired drug will have in the offender's treatment plan(e.g., diagnosis, special considerations) and also provide docu-mentation about the unavailability of an acceptable substitute inthe formulary. Procedures and a flow diagram have been developed to show the protocols for what happens when such a request ismade. R equests for non-formulary medication are made to the clinical pharmacist assigned who, in turn, evaluates the requestby a review of information provided by the prescribing physi-cian/psychiatrist and/or a review of other relevant informationincluding the target disease, previous medications used for theindication, dosages, compliance allergies, diagnostic procedure,TDCJ Disease Management guidelines, national standards andguidelines, and applicable scientific literature.

Box PROGRAM TITLE: Crisis Intervention Team POLICY STATEMENT(S): On-Scene Assessment and On-Sc ene Response YEAR ESTABLISHED: 1997 Overview The Houston Police Department established a Crisis Inter- vention Team to improve the response to people with mentalillness who come in contact with law enforcement and who are considered potentially dangerous to themselves or to others. Description Representatives of the mental health community began working with the Houston Police Department in 1991 by partici-pating in problem-solving discussions. In 1997, a committeeconsisting of the Houston Police Department, probation services,the sheriff's office, mental health professionals, and other agen-cies developed the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT). The team ismodeled after the Albuquerque, New Mexico, program. When a call for service involving a person with a mental illness is answered, the call-taker notes that it should be routedto a CIT officer. Dispatch will call a CIT officer to respond. On-scene, the CIT officer will first try to de-escalate the situation.The goal is to protect the officer, the individual who is the subjectof the call, and all others. In the majority of cases, the person isbrought to a mental health facility. The Houston Police Department holds a 40-hour training course for officers who volunteer to become members of theCrisis Intervention Team. Crisis intervention, communication, officer safety, psychopharmacology, psychosis, and mental retar-dation are among the topics included in the curriculum. TheHouston Police Department staff psychologist and another mem-ber of the department's psychological services division lead thecourse. An officer teaches one section of the course and a con-sumer (a former attorney who had numerous encounters withHPD) discusses the mental health code. Two psychiatrists (onefrom each of the major hospitals utilized by officers) speak withthe class. The course also includes two afternoons of role-playactivities. Call-takers and dispatchers also receive training to learn what questions should be asked to determine if the call involvesa person with a mental illness. This training is designed to edu-cate the non-sworn personnel of the department how to providea timely and appropriate response to people in the communitywho have a mental illnesses.Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation continuedAppendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report379 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectAdditionally, in 2002 all 5,500 officers were required to take an eight-hour basic training course on communication skills andde-escalation techniques appropriate for responding to peoplewith mental illness. As a result of the Houston CIT program, estimated time for obtaining a mental health warrant dropped from three to fourhours to 15 minutes. This reduces the amount of time that aperson with mental illness remains in police custody and it expe-dites treatment. Challenges/Areas for Improvement The Houston Police department's aim is to have 25 percent of patrol officers trained in the more extensive, 40-hour CrisisIntervention Unit training. As of 2001, 577 (10 percent) officershad received this training. Those officers will have the opportu-nity to use and maintain their CIT skills and become acquaintedwith the mental health providers, hospital staff, and the citizenswith mental illness who have repeated contacts with the police. There are only five categories of calls that are currently tracked by Houston Police Department's CIT . The unit is in theprocess of expanding their tracking system to include demo-graphic information, alcohol or substance abuse usage, weaponsinvolved, and other categories.

It is a collaborative effort among the Texas Board of Par-dons and Par ole; the Te xas Council on Offenders with Mental Impairments (TCOMI); Correctional Managed Health Care pro-viders; and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Parole Di-vision. Description The Medically Recommended Intensive Supervision Pro- gram was formerly known as the Special Needs Program andwas renamed in November 2001. TCOMI staff, in conjunctionwith Correctional Managed Health Care, identifies inmates whomay be eligible for this program. Potentially eligible inmates gobefore a three-member MRIS Parole Board panel, which deter-mines whether the inmates should be considered for MRIS and,if so, what the conditions of release will be. TCOMI providesbackground information for this hearing, including the offender'streatment history while incarcerated. Panel decisions are madeby majority vote. TCOMI reports back to the parole board at leastonce a quarter on the status of the releasee's progress. On thebasis of these reports the MRIS panel can modify the conditionsof release.

Special needs offenders include those with serious mental ill-ness, mental retardation, terminal or serious medical conditions,physical disabilities, and those who are elderly. Description The council is made up of nine appointed members with experience in managing special needs offenders, plus represen-tatives from various state agencies that focus on issues such asalcohol and drug abuse and mental health matters, as well asmental health advocates. The council's responsibility is to iden-tify mentally impaired offenders as well as the services that areneeded by this special population. The council funds commu-nity-based alternatives to incarceration in order to deliver theseneeded services. It also works to develop a statewide plan formeeting the needs of offenders with mental health disabilitiesand to provide a continuum of care throughout the criminal jus-tice system experience. To further this goal TCOMI oversees awide variety of programs, including: \u0093Intensive Case Management (1 to 25 Ratio) \u0093Specialized Community Supervision / Parole Officers \u0093Joint Treatment Planning \u0093Pre-release Screening, Referral and Placement Ser-vices \u0093Vocational Rehabilitation \u0093Rehabilitative / Psychological Services \u0093Crisis Stabilization Services \u0093Local Advisory Committee In order to assess the effectiveness of the community- based programs, the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) establishedan outcome measure of reduction in arrests as one indicator ofperformance. Based upon the analysis of arrest rates for FY '99, the reduction in arrests was 34 percent. In addition to measuringarrest data, TCOMI also compiles data on the number of offend-ers with special needs sentenced or returned to prison duringthe fiscal year. Of the 1,882 offenders served by TCOMI pro-grams 37, or 2 percent were admitted or returned to prison dur-ing FY '00.

ASEND programming is designed to assist the in-mate to live successfully in the population and to prepare forrelease to the community. Description Since 1986, the Utah Department of Corrections has been operating the Advantage Prog ram at the Utah State Prison to address the needs of offenders with an IQ below 70. In 1999,space was designated at the prison and new policies, proceduresand programmatic approac hes were implemented under the name ASEND. ASEND operates in a segregated living unit within theUtah State Prison and falls under the Division of InstitutionalOperations (DIO). ASEND's objective is to assist individuals in acquiring and maintaining skills that enable them to cope more effectively withthe demands of their lives and to raise their levels of physical,mental, and social functioning. ASEND is also intended to in-crease offender safety. The Division of Institutional Operations has an existing screening and referral process, which can provide referrals toASEND. Referrals may also come from DIO psychologists, socialservice workers, correctional habilitative specialists, housing unitadministrative staff, school staff assigned to work at DIO, andinmates themselves. In order to qualify for ASEND, offenders need to meet one of three primary criteria and three of a set ofsecondary criteria. Primary criteria include a) an IQ of 80 orbelow; b) cognitive or intellectual deficits as documented by testinginstruments; c) documented history of being victimized by otheroffenders while living inside a correctional facility and whichoccurred in part as a result of the intellectual, cognitive, andsocial deficits. Secondary criteria include such issues as priorhistory of services for people with disabilities, poor personalhygiene, inappropriate behavior, difficulty completing tasks thatare routinely completed by other offenders, poor work record (within the institution), low literacy level. The program is comprised of the following components: 1) written individual habilitative plan; 2) education program com-ponent; 3) cognitive programming component; 4) employmentjob readiness component; 5) modified behavior privilege matrix;6) additional services coordination for inmates who are mentallyill or have history of sexual abuse and/or substance abuse. The project has and continues to develop in collaboration with advocates, volunteers, and leaders in the community.

Description The 911 Call Center tries to flag any calls that involve people with mental illness. Dispatch makes an effort to assignthese calls to CIT-trained officers. As of 2001, there were eightCIT-trained officers with at least one CIT officer on duty for eachshift at the department. However, limited staffing makes it im-possible to ensure that a CIT officer handles every call involvinga person with a mental illness. In response to the lack of avail-able resources, officers must fill out a special form for every callin which it is suspected that a person may have a mental illnessthat is a factor in the incident. This form includes all pertinentquestions to help officers without CIT training to ask the appro-priate questions. These forms are later reviewed by the sergeantto determine whether the officer reacted appropriately and toflag whether the person is acting in a way consistent with mentalillness and is receiving necessary services. Once an officer has determined that a person has a mental illness and may be a danger to him-or herself, or others, theofficer must fill out paperwork for an emergency custody order(ECO). When the ECO is granted, the officer brings the individualto a designated facility for evaluation. Roanoke's designated fa-cility is Blue Ridge Behavioral Healthcare. If, upon assessment,the facility agrees that the person is in imminent danger, theymust go to the magistrate and get a temporary detaining order tohave the person hospitalized for 72 hours. The department hasan excellent relationship with Blue Ridge Healthcare (the desig-nated facility) and the Louis Gale Clinic. The clinic has donatedstaff time to help develop the training and provide instruction forthe CIT program. At the time of this writing, the Virginia Department of Crimi- nal Justice Services is reviewing this training for possible use asstatewide in-service training. Additionally, the department willbe working toward statewide adoption of their training.Appendix B.

The relevant statute requiresidentification of eligible offender s, provision for financial and medical eligibility deter mination for eligible offenders, collabo- rative prerelease planning, and a study of the impact of the law.The statute also appropriates $10,000 per person annually for upto five years to provide additional services to the offenders. Description The DMIO program requires substantial collaboration from the various criminal justice and mental health partners. TheDMIO Implementation Council includes representatives from theDepartment of Social and Health Services (DSHS), Departmentof Corrections (DOC), Regional Support Networks (RSNs), WACommunity Mental Health Council, National Alliance for the Men-tally Ill\u2014WA, Washington Advocates for the Mentally Ill, Wash-ington Association of County Designated Mental Health Profes-sionals, and mental health consumers. After selection for the voluntary program, offenders meet multiple times with a transition planning team that includes rep-resentatives from mental health and substance abuse services,community corrections, the offender's family, DOC risk manage-ment specialists, family members, and developmental disabilityservices (when appropriate). The planning team considers awide range of issues including notification of victims and com-munity, housing and mental health/substance abuse serviceneeds, eligibility for benefits, crisis plans , daily life and recre- ation issues, and others. The planning teams are expected tofollow the program participant for at least thirty days after his orher release after which the Regional Support Networks (compo-nents of the Washington State mental health system) and com-munity corrections officers maintain oversight of the individual. The DMIO legislation also requires an outcome study of the effects of the legislation to be conducted by the WashingtonState Institute for Public Policy and the Washington Instituted forMental Illness research and Training.Preliminary findings concerning the implementation of the DMIO legislation were released in March 2002. This report de-tailed several challenges that the implementation of the legisla-tion is facing; these challenges are discussed below. Obstaclesto implementation notwithstanding, the program has achievedsignificant early success in providing treatment for participants.The implementation analysis uses data from a previous studythat tracked the transition of offenders with mental illness priorto the DMIO legislation (Community Transition Study\u2014CTS).Eighty-three percent of DMIO participants have received prereleasemental health services from community providers compared with10 percent of CTS offenders. Similarly, 94 percent of DMIOprogram participants received community mental health servicesin the three months post-release compared with 29 percent ofCTS offenders. Recidivism rates over the long term are not yetavailable. Challenges/Areas for Improvement The DMIO implementation process has encountered sig- nificant obstacles. First, the preliminary study suggests that theprocess for identifying eligible participants needs to be evalu-ated and standardized; there is currently insufficient consensuson what constitutes a \"mental disorder\" and \"dangerousness.\"Second, insurance providers have placed the program in jeop-ardy by refusing to provide insurance to RSNs who accept DMIOparticipants. At the time of this writing this situation had causedeight of fourteen RSNs to withdraw or not sign contracts of par-ticipation in the program.

Description Dependency Health Services, also known as Yakima Hu- man Services, provides a variety of substance abuse treatmentservices in Yakima County. One of the programs that Depen-dency Health Services runs is a detoxification center, which servesindividuals in crisis situations involving drugs and alcohol. Cli-ents can be referred by the court, hospitals, friends and family,the police, or others. Central Washington Comprehensive Mental Health (CWCMH) is a non-profit organization, which provides a full range mentalhealth services, rehabilitation and support services, as well ascommunity education to individuals, families and organizationsin multiple counties in Washington. At their Yakima center,CWCMH provides crisis services 24 hours a day, seven days aweek. Mental health professionals assess and stabilize indi-viduals in crisis by providing immediate intervention and by fa-cilitating further treatment as needed. The CWCMH mental health crisis services and the Depen- dency Health Services detoxification center are located in thesame building. These pr ograms have collaborated for a number of years to provide integrated services to individuals with co-occurring disorders. Individuals admitted to the mental healthcrisis center who display signs of substance abuse can be im- mediately referred to treatment professionals from DependencyHealth Services. The reverse is also true for individuals admit-ted to the detoxification center who display signs of mental ill-ness. This collaboration allows for comprehensive treatment tobe offered to individuals regardless of the agency to which theyare originally referred. Integrated treatment has helped betterprepare people for reentry into the community and thus cut downon subsequent hospitalizations, crisis situations, and involve-ment with the criminal justice system.

Description King County's Mental Health Court offers misdemeanor defendants with mental illness a single point of contact with thecourt system. The court is staffed by a judge, prosecutor, de-fender, treatment court liaison, and probation officers. Defen-dants may be referred to the mental health court by jail psychiat-ric staff, police, attorneys, family members, or probation officers.A defendant may also be referred by another district court at anypoint during regular legal proceedings if the judge feels the de-fendant could be better served by the mental health court. Thecourt reserves the right not to accept cases into its jurisdiction. Participation in the program is usually voluntary, as defen- dants are asked to waive their rights to a trial on the merits ofthe case and enter into a diversion or plea agreement with anemphasis on community-based treatment. The exception is thatcases in which competency issues have been raised are alwayseligible for transfer to the mental health court. A court liaison tothe treatment community is present at all hearings and is re-sponsible for developing an initial treatment plan and linking thedefendant up with appropriate services. Defendants receive court-ordered treatment; successful participation in the treatment planmay result in dismissed charges or reduced sentencing. If thedefendant is placed on probation, the case will be assigned to amental health specialist probation officer. The mental health spe-cialist probation officers carry substantially reduced caseloadsin order to provide a more intensive level of supervision to thistraditionally high-needs population. A one-year follow-up study of the court showed that those individuals who chose to participate in the program received anincreased amount of treatment services and experienced lessfuture problems within the criminal justice system, i.e., lowerrates of new bookings.Contact Information King County Mental Health Court W-1034 King County CourthouseSeattle, WA 98104Phone: (206) 296-3502 Web site: www.metrokc.gov/kcdc/mhhome.htmKing County District Court continuedAppendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report389 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectSTATE: Washington AGENCY/ORGANIZATION: Seattle Police Department PROGRAM TITLE: Crisis Intervention Team POLICY STATEMENT(S): On-Scene Assessment and On-Scene Response YEAR ESTABLISHED: 2001 Overview The Seattle CIT program represents a collaboration be- tween Seattle law enforcement and mental health and medicalprofessionals. A committee of mental health practitioners, thepolice, and interested community members oversaw the creationof the program after reviewing and visiting relevant programsand responses used in other cities. Description The Seattle CIT program is based on the Memphis model and is very similar in most respects. Unlike Memphis, however,Seattle does not provide specialty pay for CIT officers, and theselection of personnel and job assignment procedures are differ-ent. CIT officers are in every patrol unit. Patrol officers respond-ing to a call that involves a person with a mental illness will callin a CIT officer as necessary. CIT officers must undergo a 40-hour training course, which is conducted by local mental healthprofessionals. As of 2001, Seattle had 203 CIT-trained officersand 160 actively working in patrol. In addition, Seattle CIT staffwork closely with the Seattle Mental Health Court. To complement the CIT program, King County health care providers have developed a Crisis Triage Unit Center for peoplein crisis. The unit is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week andis available for officers to bring individuals who appear to have aserious mental illness. Officers are not asked to diagnose indi-viduals in crisis. As a result, many of the people brought into thetriage unit may be abusing drugs or may have other conditionsthat can mimic the symptoms of mental illness. The crisis tri-age unit has agreed to accept individuals in crisis regardless oftheir diagnosis Seattle is currently attempting to replicate a program that Albuquerque has developed called \"team within a team.\" In thisprogram, a detective is assigned to the Crisis Intervention Teamand serves as a liaison with the Mental Health Court, mentalhealth practitioners, and the community. The detective can pro-vide follow-up, be on call for the court, and go out on appoint-ments with mental health providers as needed. This officer isalso responsible for following up on cases that would normallyfall through the cracks when an incident is largely the result ofuntreated mental illness and is basically noncriminal (e.g., adispute between neighbors). Albuquerque has four detectivesassigned to these tasks.Challenges/Areas for Improvement Though the Seattle Police Department CIT maintains its own database containing the number of people with mental ill-ness involved in police calls for service, this information in-cludes only cases that are coded and closed as mental illnesscalls. This does not include cases prioritized by the police de-partment as robbery or assaults, but which also may involvesuspects with mental illness. Because of this tagging system,the CIT's internal statistics may not accurately reflect the num-ber of offenders with mental illness in the community.

Description NAMI Wisconsin has 34 affiliates serving 40 counties throughout the state, with a membership of nearly 5,000 people.NAMI Wisconsin published the Manual for Families and Profes- sionals Including Jail Diversion Strategies in 1998 and distrib- uted it to sheriffs, jail administrators, human services adminis-trators, and legal professionals. A collaborative effort with 16different contributors from various fields, the handbook's goal isfor persons with mental illness to receive better services andappropriate jail diversion. The manual focuses on the possible path of someone with mental illness in the criminal justice system. The manual be-gins by introducing and describing the major mental illnessesand proceeds to describe the mental health system, explains theworkings of the criminal justice system and commitment proce-dures, shows the option of jail diversion programs, details men-tal health services for persons who are incarcerated, and definesstatutes and terms used in the Wisconsin Mental Health System.NAMI Wisconsin distributed the manual to all of its affiliates.

Description Developed more than 20 years ago in response to over- crowded jails, a la wsuit, and a burgeoning number of persons with mental illness entering the criminal justice system, the Com-munity Support Program (CSP) is designed to help offenderswith mental illness live successfully in the community. The CSPoperates out of a small clinic staffed by nurses, case managers,and a psychiatrist. In addition to providing mental health treat-ment, the CSP helps clients obtain benefits and housing. Ser-vices provided are clustered into groups, and one or more staffmembers handle a \"clustered\" service. For example, a full-timefinancial services advocate manages clients' benefits claims, whileanother caseworker handles housing services. This allows staffto develop expertise in their individual area, aiding in negotia-tions with the community. Referrals to the program commonly come from other pro- grams that the Wisconsin Correctional Service operates for thestate's courts, such as pretrial services. Other referral sourcesinclude probation and parole, private attorneys, and psychiatrichospitals. Core elements of the model include the following: medical and therapeutic services, money management, housingand other support services, day reporting and close monitoring,and participation backed by firm legal authority. The Milwaukee CSP collects a variety of yearly program- level and client-level outcome data. Highlights of their 1999Annual Evaluation Repor t include the following: \u009393 percent of CSP consumers maintained their inde- pendent living status; \u009387 percent of CSP consumers remained arrest free during this time period. In addition, new data will be collected and measured by the program in 2001. New information will include responses toa consumer survey regarding consumers' feelings about programAppendix B. Program Examples Cited in Report391 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectservices, data on consumers' employment status, psychiatric symptom management, and a measure of independent living. Challenges/Areas for Improvement In 1995, two components were added to the existing CSP model: an employment program and a 24 hour a day, 7 days aweek Forensics CSP to provide outreach to clients who were un-successful in the site-based CSP or who need assistance in theirhome. A more recent need identified by the program is morehospital and crisis beds available in the community. Contact Information Community Support Program Wisconsin Correctional Service 2023 W.

Olive Correctional Complex PROGRAM TITLE: Behavior Modification Treatment Level System POLICY STATEMENT(S): Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment toPrograms and Classification/Housing Decisions YEAR ESTABLISHED: N/A Overview The WV Division of Corrections has implemented a Behav- ior Modification Treatment Level System at the Mt. Olive Correc-tional Complex. Mental health staff at the facility have estab-lished this system to facilitate effective inmate management andto provide an incentive for inmates placed in the Mental HealthUnit (MHU) to achieve an appropriate functioning level. Description Prior to the implementation of the system on the Mental Health Unit, inmates housed in this area were locked down intheir cells for twenty-three hours per day. Programming levelswere not in place and the inmates were not receiving individual-ized mental health treatment. Prior to implementation, four-point restraint techniques occurred on a regular basis; since itsimplementation, these techniques have been used only in oneincident. Additionally, inmates on the MHU used to be single-celled with limited inmate-to-inmate contact. Since the imple-mentation of this system, the MHU inmate population has beensufficiently stabilized to allow for double bunking. Challenges/Areas for Improvement One of the fundamental challenges for effective implemen- tation of this system has been in the selection of staff that arephilosophically aligned with an habilitative model as opposed toa punitive model. An interview selection board was used toscreen potential staff to work on the mental health unit: employ-ees more geared toward working in a punitive environment areless receptive to support the treatment level systems. Additionalchallenges include the perceptions of facility staff regarding in-mates assigned to the MHU. Through a combination of educa-tion and incremental steps, the facility has integrated the other-wise segregated mental health population into the generalpopulation. Using structured recreation time and softball gameshelped to alleviate anxieties among both staff and members ofthe inmate population (both general and MHU). Inmate compli-ance with psychotropic medication regiments recommended bythe treating psychiatrists also presented a challenge, which hasbeen mitigated by consistent treatment and the building of rap-port between the treatment team and the inmates.Wisconsin Correctional Service continued392 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectContact Information Mount Olive Correctional Complex 1 Mountainside WayMount Olive, WV 25185Phone: Federal Bureau of Prisons PROGRAM TITLE: Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee POLICY STATEMENT(S): Development of Treatment Plans, Assignment to Programs, and Classification/Housing Decisions YEAR ESTABLISHED: N/A Overview In order to deliver consistent and cost-effective medical care, the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee of the FederalBureau of Prisons (BOP) established the National Formulary forthe Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Committee's objectives are to ensure that inmate medical car e will be delivered consistently and cost-effectively as a result of the Formulary's implementation. Description Implementation of the formulary includes review of evi- dence-based scientific literature for both new and existing drugsand to determine their appropriate role in BOP's pharmacothera-peutic armamentarium. It is the committee role, through the Na- tional Formulary, to stay current with BOP Clinical TreatmentGuidelines for medical and mental health conditions, as well as toreflect the generally accepted professional practices of the medi-cal community at large. The committee meets annually and is composed of phar- macists and clinicians from the bureau and other institutionsand includes the chief physician and chief psychiatrist. It ischaired by the chief pharmacist. The committee reviews theformulary and updates it according to evidence-based medicine.New drugs are reviewed by conducting literature searches andcost/benefit analyses to determine whether the side effect of agiven drug is worth the benefit of administering it. The committee promotes the use of atypical drugs over typical drugs due largely to the side effects attributed to moretraditional or typical medication. They encourage clinicians tocontact them with information about the use of new drugs inorder to have outcome information available at the annual meet-ing. If there is a request at the institution level for a drug that isnot on the formulary, the committee checks the diagnosis to en-sure an appropriate correlation for the condition, checks whetherthere is an existing medication in the formulary that they believeis as effective and, if so, will not approve the request. The onlyexperimental drugs that are approved are those that have beenapproved by the Federal Drug Administration.

Description Started at Fountain House in New York, clubhouses have become an integrated part of the mental health community inmany areas. The International Center for Clubhouse Development (ICCD) publishes standards for programs tha t receive its certifi- cation. Among its most firmly held principles is the importance ofemployment in the recovery of clubhouse \"members.\" Two ofthe ICCD standards are meant to encourage training and consis-tency in maintaining benefits of members who are working intransitional or more competitive employment. Clubhouses receivingICCD certification are expected to provide sufficient training toensure appropriate access to benefits by clubhouse members. The International Standards for Clubhouse Programs, con- sensually agreed upon by the worldwide clubhouse community,define the Clubhouse Model of rehabilitation. The principles ex-pressed in these standards are at the heart of the clubhousecommunity's success in helping people with mental illness to stayout of hospitals while achieving social, financial, and vocationalgoals. The standards also serve as a kind of \"bill of rights\" formembers and a code of ethics for staff, board, and administrators.The standards insist that a clubhouse is a place that offers respectand opportunity to its members. The standards provide the basisfor assessing clubhouse quality, through the International Centerfor Clubhouse Development (ICCD) certification process. Every two years the worldwide clubhouse community re- views these standards, and amends them as necessary. The pro-cess is coordinated by the ICCD Standards Review Committee,made up of members and staff of ICCD-certified clubhousesfrom around the world.

These surveys, which in some stateshave been translated into Spanish, Cambodian, traditional Chi-nese, Portuguese, Russian, and Vietnamese, among other lan-guages, provide an opportunity for consumers to evaluate theservices that they receive. Description The MHSIP , which is supported by the Center for Mental Health Services, seeks to provide objective, reliable and compa-rable information about mental health services to help mentalhealth policymakers and providers improve those services. Origi-nally organized in the 1970s, the MHSIP is guided by the MHSIPAd Hoc Group, which is composed of representatives from local,state, and federal mental health agencies, recipients of mentalhealth treatment, advocacy group representatives, and delegatesfrom related social service providers. The MHSIP Consumer Survey is a key component of the MHSIP Consumer Report Card, which is an effort to develop atool to assess the quality and cost of mental health and sub-stance abuse services. The Consumer Survey has been increas-ingly adopted by states and other entities for implementationsince it became available in 1996. The original version of the survey contained 40 questions, including questions about general satisfaction, access to ser-vices, appropriateness of treatment, and outcomes of care. Amore recent version, developed in February 2000, has 28 ques-tions. Since 1996, the survey has since been adapted and modi-fied slightly by different states.

NAMI has also developed training coursesfor consumers and families to help them better understand andmanage their mental illness or support their family members who have mental illness. Description The NAMI Provider Education Program is designed to help mental health providers better understand the consumer experi-ence of mental illness. The teaching team for the provider courseconsists of five people: two family members; two consumers;and a mental health professional who is also a family member ora consumer. All of the teaching team members are appropriatelytrained educators. The provider course is currently being taught in 13 states: Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Washington DC, andWisconsin. Evaluations of early classes indicate that providershave changed clinical practice as a result of what they havelearned in the course. The NAMI Family-to-Family Education Program is a free 12-week course for family caregivers of individuals with severebrain disorders (mental illnesses). The course is taught by trainedfamily members. All instruction and course materials are free forclass participants. Developed by NAMI-Vermont in 1990, thecourse is now taught by more than 2,000 trained NAMI volunteersin 43 states, four large municipalities, and two provinces ofCanada. To date, 50,000 family members have graduated, and the project continues to expand. The Family-to-Family curriculum focuses on schizophre- nia, bipolar disorder (manic depression), clinical depression, panicdisorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The coursediscusses the clinical treatment of these illnesses and teachesthe knowledge and skills that family members need to cope moreeffectively.Appendix B.

Description The Center for Evidence Based Practices, which is sup- ported by various government and foundation sources, will pro-vide hands-on assistance with replication of proven interven-tions. At the same time, the center will conduct research todetermine those factors that improve acceptance and implemen-tation of proven models. The center's mission is to help state mental health agen- cies (SMHA) develop and implement evidence based practices,performance measures, and quality improvement processes. Toaccomplish this mission the center will pursue three major ac-tivities. First, the center will identify, share and promote knowl-edge about evidence-based practices. This will involve serving as a repository of innovative programs and national trends, sur-veying states on key issues, hosting national and regional confer-ences, and maintaining a dedicated website. Second, the centerwill conduct research and develop knowledge about evidence-based practices, including studying emerging and promising prac-tices to transform them to an evidence based foundation. Third,the center will provide technical assistance to individual states,including convening in-state focus groups, bringing in outsideexperts, and evaluating the design and implementation of state-based evidence based practice programs. Challenges/Areas for Improvement Over the last few years, states have implemented mental health performance measurement systems. As states move for-ward, they encounter issues related to standardization, imple-mentation, benchmarks, and uses of the performance measures.Quality improvement initiatives to address these concerns areneeded at the systemic level rather than at the progr ammatic or service levels.

Description Psychological and psychiatric examinations are standard elements of the National Parole Board risk-assessment proce-dures; there are no separate risk-assessment procedures solelyfor offenders with mental illness. Prerelease psychological andpsychiatric examinations are required for some inmates and canbe requested when information concerning the mental status ofthe offenders is not otherwise sufficient. The National Parole Board standards are based on the con- sideration of two elements: 1) Information about the offender'scriminal history risk factors and assessment of identified areasat time of incarceration; and 2) Information about the behaviorof the offender during incarceration or on conditional release inthe community. Issues relevant to offenders with mental illnessthat are considered include the impact of treatment programs inwhich the offender has participated (the offender must have ben-efited from these programs), the effect of medication that theoffender is prescribed, and the release plan that addresses theprogramming and other community-based interventions that will contribute to the inmate's success.

The parole board utilizes standard referencematerials on mental illness and risk assessment as well as ma-terials developed internally. Description New Parole Board Members are acquainted with the Diag- nostic Manual for Mental Disorder s, a standard reference tool about mental illness. The Diagnostic Manual contains informa- tion on symptomatology and treatment of a wide variety of men-tal illnesses. The training also covers the Historical and Clinical Risk Guide for Violent Offenders with Mental Illness (also known as HCR20), which is a standard publication used in criminal jus-tice and noncriminal justice situations (e.g., hospital emergencywards). In addition, one of the chapters of the National ParoleBoard's internal risk-assessment manual is devoted to issuesrelated to offenders with mental illness, and the board is in theprocess of developing an even more in-depth guide to this sub-ject for parole board members. The board uses case studies aspart of the training and contracts with experts in the field ofmental health and criminal justice to help deliver the training.

Description The Program of Assertive Community Treatment model was developed in Madison, Wisconsin, in the 1970s. Six states (Dela-ware, Idaho, Michigan, Rhode Island, Texas, Wisconsin) currentlyhave statewide ACT programs. Nineteen states have at least oneor more ACT pilot programs in their state. Unlike many other community-based programs, ACT is not a linkage or brokerage case-management program that connectsindividuals to mental health, housing, or rehabilitation agenciesor services. Rather, it provides highly individualized services di-rectly to consumers. ACT recipients receive the multidisciplinary,around-the-clock staffing of a psychiatric unit, but within theirown home and community. To have the competencies and skillsto meet a client's multiple treatment, rehabilitation, and supportneeds, ACT team members are trained in the areas of psychiatry,social work, nursing, substance abuse, and vocational rehabilita-tion. Recently, ACT teams have placed a greater emphasis oninclusion of consumers as treatment team members, either inthe traditional professional positions or as peer counselors ableto communicate more effectively with a team's clients. ACT teams provide services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. To make ACT programs more accessible,states have adopted funding strategies approved by Medicaid forthis purpose. As part of their contracting process, states monitorACT programs for compliance with certain agreed-upon practicestandards. ACT strives to lessen or eliminate the debilitating symp- toms of mental illness each individual client experiences and tominimize or prevent recurrent acute episodes of the illness, tomeet basic needs and enhance quality of life, to improve func-tioning in adult social and employment roles, to enhance anindividual's ability to live independently in his or her own com-munity, and to lessen the family's burden of providing care. The ACT model is indicated for individuals in their late teens to their elderly years who have a severe and persistentmental illness causing symptoms and impairments that producedistress and major disability in adult functioning (e.g., employ- ment, self-care, and social and interpersonal relationships). ACTparticipants usually are people with schizophrenia, other psy-chotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder), and bipolar dis-order (manic-depressive illness); those who experience signifi-cant disability from other mental illnesses and are not helped bytraditional outpatient models; those who have difficulty getting toappointments on their own as in the traditional model of casemanagement; those who have had bad experiences in the tradi- tional system; or those who have limited understanding of theirneed for help. Challenges/Areas for Improvement Despite the documented treatment success of PACT, only a fraction of those with the greatest needs have access to thisuniquely effective program. In the United States, adults with se-vere and persistent mental illnesses constitute one-half to onepercent of the adult population. It is estimated that 20 percent to40 percent of this group could be helped by the ACT model if itwere available.

Program Examples Cited in Report399 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project400 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectAn Explanation of Federal Medicaid andDisability Program Rules 1Appendix C INCOME-SUPPORT BENEFITS People with disabilities, including those disabled by a severe mental illness, are entitled to monthly income-supportpayments through two different f ederal programs: SSI for those with low incomes and SSDI for people who have worked andpaid Social Security taxes. Many people whose SSDI benefit istoo low because they worked only a short time can qualify forboth SSDI and SSI. 2 These federal disability benefits are linked with health care coverage: \u0093In most states, SSI recipients automatically have Med-icaid coverage. Where they do not, a separate appli-cation will enable most to secure Medicaid. 3 \u0093All SSDI recipients qualify for Medicare after a 24-month wait. People who have been getting SSI orSSDI payments when arrested cannot receive ben-efits while in jail. But whether and how they remaineligible when released varies.When Inmates Lose SSI Generally, the length of time a person is in jail deter- mines whether, or when, federal SSI benefits will be affected.The monthly payments are nearly always interrupted whilesomeone is in jail, but benefits are payable up until the time ofincarceration and sometimes a little longer, and can resumeshortly thereafter, as long as the person has been in jail lessthan a year (see below). When incarceration is for less than 12 consecutive months, the federal Social Security Administration (SSA) con-siders this a \"suspension\" and payments should resume soonafter the person leaves jail-as long as SSA is informed of therelease and the person submits a simple form with evidenceshowing that he or she again meets the financial requirements. 4 SSA presumes that these individuals remain disabled underfederal rules. To complete this reapplication process, the Social Secu- rity office must be able to verify that the person has been re-leased. Families, community mental health workers or jail ad-ministrators can assist people in this situation by making sureSSA is alerted to the need to resume benefits and told whereto send the checks. 1.1.1.1.1.

They will have to show that they are still disabled underthe eligibility standards (see below). When Inmates Lose SSDI People who qualify for SSDI remain eligible as long as they meet the federal definition of disability. SSDI benefits aresuspended following a conviction and confinement in jail for30 days or longer. But SSDI benefits are not terminated, nomatter how long the term. However, Social Security must verifythat the person is no longer in a correctional facility beforepayments can resume. Specifically: \u0093SSDI benefits are suspended if someone has beenconvicted and confined in jail longer than 30 days,whether or not it is a full calendar month. 5 \u0093SSDI benefits are suspended for any 30-day periodduring which an individual is confined in a jail orprison in connection with a verdict of not guilty byreason of insanity or guilty but insane, or a findingof incompetence to stand trial. 6 \u0093SSDI benefits that were already paid are recovered.For example, someone arrested on the fifth of themonth who has already cashed that month's checkwill have future checks reduced until the benefits paidfor that month are recovered. Federal rules on payment of SSDI benefits to inmates were different for people incarcerated before April 1, 2000. 7 The above description applies to everyone incarcerated sincethat date. A worker's dependents, such as a spouse or child,sometimes receive SSDI. These payments are not suspended or terminated when the worker is in jail; they continue even when the worker losesbenefits. 8 How Time in Jail Affects Eligibility for SSI Benefits In jail less than one calendar month: Inmate remains eligible for SSI and should receive the full cash benefit. For example, someone who enters jail on February 10 and is released before midnight March 31 shouldlose no cash payments.In jail throughout a calendar month: Inmate will have SSI pay- ments suspended but not terminated. 9 This means that an inmate who is in jail on the first of the month and stays thewhole month is not eligible for a cash payment for that month. For example, someone who enters jail on February 10 and is not released until April 1 will not loseFebruary's payment (not being in jail for the wholemonth) but will lose the March payment. In jail at least one month and then released after the first of another month: Inmate can receive an SSI cash payment for part of the month in which he or she is released. 10 For example, someone who enters jail on February 10 and is released May 15 the same year will not lose the February payment, but will lose March andApril benefits. In May, the person will be eligible forhalf of the monthly benefit. While this will be paideventually, it could be delayed if the Social SecurityAdministration (SSA) is not informed promptly thatthe individual has been released. In jail for 12 consecutive calendar months: Inmate's eligibil- ity is terminated. 11 Technically, termination occurs after 12 continuous months of suspension. Only full months count. For example, someone who enters jail on February 1st of one year and is released on February 10th thefollowing year will have SSI eligibility terminated be-cause benefits were suspended for 12 continuousmonths. This person will have to file a new applica-tion and resubmit evidence of disability. But someone who enters jail on February 10th of one year and is released on February 10 a year later has benefitssuspended for March through January and prorated for Febru-ary of the second year. This person's eligibility will not be ter-minated because benefits were not suspended for 12 continu-ous months. Qualifying for SSI or SSDI on Release Inmates not receiving benefits when sent to jail can ap- ply for SSI or SSDI while incarcerated, in anticipation of theirrelease. They usually need assistance, however, to obtain theappropriate forms and gather the necessary evidence. 5.5.5.5.5. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x)(1)(A)(i), as 6.6.6.6.6. \u00a7 402(x)(1)(A)(ii) as amended by Public Law 106-170. 7.7.7.7.7. The old rules will continue to apply to individuals whose jail or prison confine- ment began before April 1, 2000. Although it is not described here, the Bazelon Cen- ter has a memorandum that lays out those rules. If you would like a copy, send a request with a stamped ($.34) self-addressed envelope to: Bazelon Center Publica-tions Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectNormally, review of an application takes about three months, so an inmate should apply as long as possible beforethe release date. SSA will assess eligibility based on the application. If it is approved before the inmate's release, payments will beginas of the first day of the calendar month following release. 12 If the application is approved after the inmate is released, ben-efits are payable at that time, and SSI (but not SSDI) benefitsare backdated to the first day of the month following release. An individual with a severe mental illness may also qualify for advance emergency payments. To be eligible, people mustdemonstrate: \u0093a financial emergency; \u0093that they are likely to qualify for assistance; and \u0093that they have not already received assistance forthat benefit period. Why Benefits Are Lost and What Can Be Done About It Jails have an incentive to inform SSA that a person is confined; they receive federal payments when they supply in-formation resulting in suspension or termination of SSI or SSDIbenefits. But they have no such incentive to advise SSA whensomeone is released so that benefits can be restored. Jails and prisons can enter into agreements with SSA to provide monthly reports of inmates' names, Social Securitynumbers, dates of birth, confinement dates and other infor-mation. The institution receives $400 when this information issent within 30 days of the inmate's arrival and $200 if it issent within 90 days. 13 This information should-but does not always-include an estimated release date. Jails, prisons and hospitals can also enter into pre-re- lease agreements with the local Social Security office, whichwill help their staff learn the rules for pre-release processingof applications and reapplications for SSI. 14 When such an agreement exists, SSA processes claims more quickly, inmateshave assistance in gathering the information needed to sup-port their application, and benefits are often payable immedi-ately upon release or shortly thereafter.Health Care Coverage Medicare and Medicaid are two sources of health cover- age. People eligible for SSDI (and those over age 65) are cov-ered by Medicare, after a 24-month wait. Low-income indi-viduals qualify for Medicaid in various ways; in most statesanyone who qualifies for SSI is covered. Medicaid providesbetter mental health care coverage than Medicare. Medicaid Medicaid is a joint federal-state program. To qualify, a person must fall into one of several eligibility categories. Onceeligible, the individual is covered by a package of services de-fined by the state under broad federal requirements. Federallaw requires some services to be available, such as physicianservices and general hospital care. Others are offered at stateoption-among them, various community-based mental healthclinic and rehabilitative services. As a result, Medicaid cover-age varies from state to state. However, all states cover a sig-nificant array of mental health services for people with severemental illnesses. Most jail inmates with severe mental illnesses have in- comes below the Medicaid limit and may therefore be eligiblefor coverage. Usually their eligibility for SSI is what qualifiesthem for Medicaid. In 32 states, SSI eligibility results in auto-matic Medicaid coverage. In seven other states, SSI recipientsare automatically eligible for Medicaid but must submit a sepa-rate application for Medicaid. In the 11 states that use differ-ent rules, 15 people who receive SSI nearly always qualify for Medicaid, although they must go through a separate applica-tion process. Some low-income individuals do not receive SSI or SSDI disability benefits, either because their disability is not severeenough to meet strict federal standards or because they havenot applied. But they may still be eligible for Medicaid. Currently, 39 states cover people who become \"medi- cally needy\" when their income is reduced by high health careexpenses. 16 States can extend Medicaid coverage to people in other categories, such as low-income families or individualswho, without access to community-based services, would beforced to live in a health care institution. Also, a number ofstates use waivers of federal rules to cover other groups ofuninsured low-income people through Medicaid. by Public Law 104-193, the Personal Re- sponsibility & Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act of 1996 (SSI-incentive effective for reporting individuals whose confinement began after March 1, 1997); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7402(x) as amended by Public Law 106-170, the Ticket to Work & Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (SSDI-incentive effective for reporting individuals whose confinement began after April 1, 2000). 14.14.14.14.14.

An Explanation of Federal Medicaid and Disability Program Rules403 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectInformation about eligibility rules can be obtained from the state Medicaid agency. Medicaid Rules on Jail Inmates Under Medicaid law, states do not receive federal match- ing funds for services provided to individuals in jail.17 How- ever, federal law does not require states to terminate inmates'eligibility, and inmates may remain on the Medicaid rolls eventhough services received while in jail are not covered. 18 Ac- cordingly, someone who had a Medicaid card when jailed maybe able to use it again immediately after release to obtainneeded services and medication. However, the situation for inmates who qualify for Med- icaid through their eligibility for SSI can be complicated. Ev-eryone whose SSI eligibility is terminated will lose Medicaid.When SSI benefits are suspended due to incarceration, stateshave the option to\u2014and generally do\u2014terminate an inmate'sMedicaid eligibility. When an inmate's Medicaid eligibility is not tied to SSI, the state has the flexibility under federal law to suspend theeligibility status during incarceration. But the federal Medic-aid rules establish only minimum requirements, while statesare permitted to impose more restrictive policies. 19 Unfortu- nately, most states have procedures that terminate Medicaideligibility automatically any time someone is in jail. 20 Under federal rules, eligibility should be reinstated upon release unless the person is no longer eligible (see below ).Before ending someone's Medicaid eligibility, states must makea redetermination of the person's potential for qualifying un-der all the state's eligibility categories. 21 This redetermination need not be conducted until release is imminent, but if thereleased inmate still meets the state's eligibility standards forMedicaid, eligibility should not be ended. Regrettably, this re-determination often does not occur. Even inmates who keep their Medicaid eligibility may lose Medicaid coverage unnecessarily because of procedures incorrectional facilities. Something as simple as the loss of aMedicaid card following arrest can make it impossible to ob-tain mental health services from Medicaid providers upon re-lease. This often happens because jails take possession of allpersonal property when booking a person. In many jurisdic-tions, this property is destroyed if it is not claimed within acertain time. Inmates cannot claim the property themselvesand if they have no one to do it for them, their Medicaid card is destroyed. There is one exception to the rule that no Medicaid reim- bursement is available for jail inmates. When someone is trans-ferred from a jail to a hospital for acute health services (forexample, an appendectomy), the hospital can claim federalMedicaid reimbursement for this service. Also, if a person isin an institution temporarily pending \"other arrangementsappropriate to his needs,\" services may remain Medicaid-re-imbursable. 22 Generally, however, mental health services furnished to inmates must be funded by correctional systems or state orlocal mental health systems, not by Medicaid. FEDERAL RULES ON MEDICAID REINSTATEMENT \u0093Jail inmates can have their Medicaid suspended. \u0093Upon release, federal policy requires that their ben- efits resume. \u0093Many individuals will be incarcerated for so long thattheir Medicaid benefits will have been suspended forlonger than the state's customary period of time af-ter which a redetermination of eligibility is conducted(time varies by state). The state will reassess whetherthese inmates remain eligible for Medicaid. However,this assessment should be conducted prior to re-lease because, under federal policy, a state may notdrop someone from Medicaid without determiningwhether or not the person can qualify under any ofthe state's eligibility categories. 23 \u0093States are permitted to use simplified proceduresfor redetermining the eligibility of individuals whohave been incarcerated, according to federal HCFAofficials: 24 Regardless of the simplified procedures used, unless a state has determined that an indi-vidual is no longer eligible for Medicaid, States mustensure that incarcerated individuals are returned tothe rolls immediately upon release. Thus, allowingindividuals to go directly to a Medicaid provider anddemonstrate his/her Medicaid eligibility. 25 18. 18. 18. 18. 18. Social Security Act \u00a7 1905(a)(A). 19.19.19.19.19.

For example, a former inmate may have tovisit the local SSA and state Medicaid offices to confirm thathe or she has been released and complete other administra-tive paperwork. As a result, people on SSI may have no healthcare coverage during the time between their release from jailand reinstatement of their SSI payments-normally at least oneor two weeks. One way services can be covered immediately after some- one is released from jail is for the state to continue the person'sMedicaid eligibility pending reinstatement on SSI, which willin turn restore federal Medicaid eligibility. Once the individual'sSSI is reinstated, the federal government will provide retroac-tive reimbursement for Medicaid-covered services furnishedfor up to three months after the person left jail. This meansthat even though federal dollars may not be available immedi-ately for services provided after release to former inmates whoseMedicaid eligibility is tied to SSI, nearly all of these individu-als will eventually be covered. Providers can be paid by thestate and the state will eventually receive federal funds. Thestate will remain fully liable only for services to the very fewindividuals who are not found re-eligible for SSI and Medicaid. Medicare Medicare coverage is also suspended when someone is incarcerated. It will not resume until the person's SSDI pay-ments resume. For more information on Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). CONCLUSION Federal rules on how and when inmates receive benefits are complex, but they do provide opportunities for inmates toobtain federal entitlements upon release. Instead of fosteringrecidivism, states and localities should support access to thebenefits needed by people with severe mental illnesses whoare released from jail.Appendix C. An Explanation of Federal Medicaid and Disability Program Rules405 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project406 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus ProjectProject History / MethodologyAppendix D The Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project Re- port is the result of dozens of days of meetings among lead- ing criminal justice and mental health policymakers and prac-titioners from across the country, surveys administered to stateand local government officials in communities in 50 states,hundreds of hours of interviews with administrators of inno-vative programs, and thousands of hours reviewing materialsdescribing research, promising programs, policies, and legis-lation. This appendix describes the history and the methodol-ogy of this project in greater detail. PROJECT ORIGINS The Council of State Governments (CSG) developed the Criminal Justice / Mental Health Consensus Project in responseto requests from state government officials for recommenda-tions to improve the criminal justice system's response topeople with mental illness. State government officials identi-fied this issue as particularly pressing for several reasons.Practitioners and advocates have approached lawmakers incapitols across the country explaining the urgency of the prob-lem. Newspaper headlines describe tragedies involving peoplewith mental illness that seemingly could have been prevented.And, the current approach to responding to people with men-tal illness has placed an enormous strain on criminal justiceand state budget resources. On October 28-29, 1999, CSG convened a small, na- tional, bipartisan working group of leading criminal justiceand mental health policymakers from across the country. Atthat meeting, the policymakers identified key issues regarding people with mental illness involved with the criminal justicesystem. CSG staff developed a draft document, which, in manyrespects, served as minutes of that meeting. This draft docu-ment also incorporated suggestions that working group mem-bers submitted subsequent to the October meeting. The work-ing group met again on January 19-20, 2000 to provide com-ments and suggestions regarding the draft document. The two meetings made it clear that the issue was far too complex to explore comprehensively in just two short meetings.Furthermore, the interests represented needed to be expandedconsiderably to reflect the cross-section of perspectives andprofessionals who have a significant stake in the issue. PROJECT ORGANIZATION To accomplish these goals, CSG partnered with six orga- nizations: the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), thePretrial Services Resource Center (PSRC), the Association ofState Correctional Administrators (ASCA), the National Asso-ciation of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD),the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, and the Center forBehavioral Health, Justice & Public Policy. Together, staff fromthese organizations formed the Consensus Project Steering Committee, which two legislators (Rep. Mike Lawlor of Con-necticut and Sen. Robert Thompson of Pennsylvania) co-chaired. The Steering Committee designed an 18-month ini-tiative to build on the ideas developed during the first twoworking group meetings, to broaden the support base for these407 Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Projectrecommendations, and to identify efforts in jurisdictions across the country that could help inform the implementation of therecommendations. The Steering Committee established four advisory boards: law enforcement, courts, corrections, and mental health. PERF ,PSRC, ASCA, and NASMHPD, respectively, coordinated theseadvisory boards. The criminal justice advisory boards includedpolicymakers and practitioners whose focus was either lawenforcement, court, or corrections-related. Each of the crimi-nal justice advisory boards also included a cross-section ofrepresentatives of the mental health system: a state mentalhealth director, a clinician, a provider, a consumer, and anadvocate. Of course, those five perspectives alone could notrepresent the diverse views of the mental health community.The mental health advisory board provided an opportunity forthe mental health experts serving on each of the criminal jus-tice advisory boards to share notes and develop recommenda-tions that targeted the mental health system only. In forming the advisory boards, each coordinator identi- fied practitioners and policymakers widely respected by theircounterparts across the country, ensuring an impressive levelof expertise across the project. In addition, coordinators in-vited people to serve on the advisory board who were leadersin their respective membership associations, such as the Na-tional Sheriffs' Association, the National Correctional HealthCommission, the American Probation and Parole Association,the National Association of County Officials, the National Dis-trict Attorneys Association, the National Criminal Justice As-sociation, the National Mental Health Association, the NationalAlliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Association of CountyBehavioral Health Directors, the National Center for StateCourts, the International Association of Paroling Authorities,and other groups. This provided each advisory board withliaisons to many of the major associations whose membersthe policy statements would affect. ROLE OF ADVISORY BOARDS PERF and ASCA convened their advisory boards three times over the 18-month period. The advisory groups thatNASMHPD and PSRC coordinated met twice. They also estab- lished \"peer groups.\" The positions represented on thesepeer groups were similar to those included on the advisoryboards. The establishment of the peer group, however, en-abled the coordinators to consult an additional 10-20 leadingpractitioners. For each round of meetings, the advisory boards/peer groups adhered to a similar agenda, format, and set of goals.At the first round of meetings, each advisory board revieweddraft policy statements that the first two working group meet-ings generated, identified additional issues that needed to beconsidered, and agreed upon a methodology to identify pro-grams, policies, and legislation that might inform further dis-cussion of the policy statements. They also began planningthe dissemination of the work pr oduct to affiliated professional organizations. Between the first and second advisory board meetings, coordinators surveyed the field for promising programs andpolicies. PERF staff asked numerous departments whetherthey\u2014or any other departments they knew of\u2014were doingsomething innovative regarding people with mental illness.Using this snowball sample to identify a handful of depart-ments, PERF subsequently interviewed in detail officials andstaff at these agencies about their efforts. Coordinators for the other advisory boards employed different approaches to obtain this information. NASMHPDstaff administered an email list serve. ASCA staff distributeda lengthy questionnaire to every state corrections system andnumerous jail and community corrections administrators.PSRC staff followed up on leads that advisory board membersand the literature provided. At the second round of meetings, advisory board (or peer group) members met to comment on the policy statementsthat the advisory board developed, explored the issues thatthe advisory group had determined needed further consider-ation, and discussed the programs and policies that the coor-dinators had identified. For the third round of meetings, members of the four advisory boards met concurrently, in the same location. There,they reviewed and commented on the final draft of the Con- sensus Project Report. They also had an opportunity to exchange comments on the work of the other advisory boards.

PSRC staff and ASCA staff werethe primary authors of Chapter III: Pretrial Issues, Adjudica-tion, and Sentencing and Chapter IV: Incarceration and Reen-try, respectively. NASMHPD staff authored Chapter I: Involve-ment with the Mental Health System, Chapter VII: Elementsof an Effective Mental Health System, and Policy Statement23: Maintaining Contact Between Individual and Mental HealthSystem. Staff from the Bazelon Center and the Center for Be-havioral Health, Justice & Public Policy contributed to the chap-ters that NASMHPD staff authored. They also provided exten-sive commentary on the chapters that focused on the variousaspects of the criminal justice system. CSG staff served as editors of the overall document. Although CSG staff were the lead writers of the sections andchapters not addressed above (i.e., Executive Summary, In-troduction, Chapter V: Improving Collaboration, Chapter VI:Training Practitioners and Policymakers and Educating theCommunity, Chapter VIII: Measuring and Evaluating Outcomes,and the appendices), these sections of the report reflect anextensive, collaborative effort among the members of the Steer-ing Committee and the members of the advisory boards. The project partners developed and maintained a com- mon vision for the report by communicating regularly\u2014oftenspeaking by telephone or emailing each other several times aday. In addition, over the two-year lifespan of the project, theSteering Committee had approximately 10 all-day meetings.Appendix D.

CSG's income is derived from five sources:annual dues paid by each state and member jurisdiction; dona-tions from the private sector; federal grants; foundational grants;and secretariat group fees. Founded in 1933, CSG has a longhistory of providing state leaders with the resources to developand implement effective public policy and programs. Owing toits regional structure and its constituency\u2014which includes statelegislators, judges, and executive branch officials\u2014CSG is a unique organization. With its headquarters in Lexington, Ken-tucky, CSG has four regional offices, representing the West, Mid-west, South, and East. The national Criminal Justice / MentalHealth Consensus Project is coordinated by CSG's Eastern Re-gional Conference (CSG/ERC), which is the only CSG regionaloffice with a criminal justice program.
