Active Ingredients in Relaxium To understand how Relaxium works, you must first know more about the supplement's active ingredients. Dr. Ciliberti claims the secret to his success is combining natural remedies that promote relaxation and mitigate the negative impact that stress and anxiety have on the body. This helps to restore the body's sleep cycles. Here are some of the active ingredients found in Relaxium. Magnesium Magnesium is an essential mineral found in the human body. When levels are too high, some people experience anxiety, irritability, and muscle tension. Without enough magnesium, you may find it difficult to sleep. Relaxium works to regulate the body's lactic acid levels and maintain a healthy level of magnesium. L-Tryptophan Tryptophan in the human body helps produce two important biomolecules that promote restful sleep - serotonin and melatonin. This makes L-tryptophan essential for overcoming insomnia and promoting quality sleep. Melatonin Speaking of melatonin, this is [a natural sleep hormone](https://somnustherapy.com/falling-asleep-with-melatonin/) produced in the human brain and required for achieving quality sleep. Not only does melatonin help facilitate the transition between being awake and falling asleep once night falls, but it also contains anti-aging properties. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is a powerful adaptogen that is most widely recognized as a key component of Ayurvedic medicine. Ashwagandha is considered a natural sleep aid and works by increasing your resistance to stress and promoting relaxation. It can also work to help return the body to a state of relaxation following a stressful or anxious encounter. All of these elements work together to help restore and support healthy sleep patterns. Chamomile, Passionflower, Valerian, and Hops - Relaxium contains a combination of beneficial natural herbs including chamomile, passionflower, valerian, and hops - all of which are associated with promoting relaxation, with some acting as natural sedatives. These herbs were popular in Western medicine for several centuries and are also said to calm the mind, regulate important neurotransmitters in the brain, and promote deep sleep. Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) GABA is a neurotransmitter that helps promote sleep and relaxation while easing anxiety and making it easier for you to [wind down at night](https://somnustherapy.com/tips-and-benefits-of-a-wind-down-routine-before-bed/). Certain clinical studies also show that GABA improves overall sleep quality while increasing the duration of undisturbed sleep. Another bonus is that GABA helps regulate cortisol levels, which are associated with stress and weight gain.
