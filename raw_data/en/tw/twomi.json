People with the autoimmune disorder can experience a bewildering set of symptoms: rashes, pain, and fatigue, along with potentially life-threatening problems, like blood clots, kidney disease and inflammation of the heart. But lupus sufferers were telling Dr. Diamond about murky mental concerns, too. \"The patients I was talking to had been experiencing a much broader range of issues \u2014 problems with memory loss, thinking, emotional regulation,\" Dr. Diamond remembers. \"They were told to see a psychiatrist, relax, or take a Valium. But they knew that wasn't the problem.\" Dr. Diamond believed them. And she had a groundbreaking study to back them up \u2014 one that showed lupus could indeed impact the brain. It was just the first of many paradigm-shifting discoveries across her career. Over the past half-century, Dr. Diamond, now director of the [Institute of Molecular Medicine at the Feinstein Institutes](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/institute-molecular-medicine), has reset expectations of researchers, clinicians and patients alike, redefining how they understand lupus, an incurable disease that affects roughly three million people worldwide. Scientists had long known that rogue antibodies are the bad actors in lupus, attacking healthy tissues throughout the body. But they believed the brain was protected from these so-called autoantibodies by the blood-brain barrier, a protective network of blood vessels and tissues lined with such tightly packed cells that most harmful substances are kept from the body's chief control center. Dr. Diamond and her team had overturned that notion by finding large numbers of antibodies in the fluid surrounding the brain of a lupus patient suffering psychiatric symptoms. And when the researchers injected that fluid into the brains of mice, the antibodies promptly attacked and killed neurons. The findings caused an immediate stir among scientists. When Dr. Diamond shared her findings with patients, she expected them to be shocked or worried to hear that their disease might be directly attacking their brain. Instead, she says, most were relieved. \"Our research validated their reality,\" she says. \"It was very affirming to them to hear that their troubles were part of the disease.\" Dr. Diamond began focusing on lupus shortly after she turned away from her undergraduate studies \u2014 which had been devoted to art history and classics \u2014 to enter Harvard Medical School. She found a series of lectures on autoimmunity compelling: \"It was the time of the Vietnam War, and it reminded me of a famous line from Pogo, the cartoon character: 'We have met the enemy and he is us.' That struck me as true not just of politics but of autoimmunity.\" Other cultural tides also conspired to direct her attention. A feminist and scholar, she was enthralled by several prominent Southern women writers: Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCulloch. had [autoimmune diseases](https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-female-factor-and-autoimmune-disease); McCulloch had lupus. And as Dr. Diamond began practicing medicine, she felt a kinship with the young women coping with the disease. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/lupus.htm) about 90% of newly diagnosed lupus patients are females between the ages of 15 and 44. Hooked, Dr. Diamond began diving further into the biology of the disease. She threw herself into bench research as a faculty member at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, but discovered she liked clinical work, as well; eventually she began seeing rheumatology patients regularly. \"Bench research and treating patients provide different kinds of satisfaction,\" Dr. Diamond says. \"Both are important to me, and I've been lucky enough to be able to combine both kinds of work in my career.\" At Einstein, Dr. Diamond led the MD/PhD program and helped expand the institution's research program into rheumatologic disease. She moved to Columbia Presbyterian in 2005 as she became interested in expanding her research from mouse models to patients. And in 2007, lured by the opportunity to create clinical trials to test the hypotheses she and others had generated in basic research, she came to the [Feinstein Institutes](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/about-us). \"The Feinstein Institutes are really focused on moving basic science into clinical trials,\" she says. \"It's a wonderful fit for what I want to accomplish. There's nothing more fun and fulfilling than developing an understanding of disease mechanisms and, from that, designing a therapeutic approach.\" Last August, Dr. Diamond and a team of international researchers won the [Global Team Science Award](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/feinstein-institutes-get-3m-to-study-lupus-remission-future-therapies) from the Lupus Research Alliance. The team will use the $3 million grant over three years to study lupus patients who are no longer experiencing symptoms or taking medications. Patients in this so-called \"drug-free remission\" potentially have much to offer, but scientists and doctors have historically been so occupied studying sick patients that they've paid scant attention to the success stories. Understanding more about their biology could point to new ways to control the disease, she says. \"This is a population of lupus patients that's never been studied in depth before,\" Dr. Diamond says. \"I love this project because there is so much that we don't understand.\" Many patients in remission feel like a switch has been turned on in their brain, Dr. Diamond says: They can suddenly complete tasks that used to feel overwhelming and can easily find the right words when speaking. Yet even though everything may seem back to normal, their immune systems may still carry imprints of the disease. It's already clear that some \u2014 but not all \u2014 patients who seem to have recovered from lupus still carry the hallmarks of the disease in their blood. \"They have no evidence of [arthritis,](https://www.northwell.edu/rheumatology/conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis) rash, [heart disease](https://www.northwell.edu/cardiovascular-thoracic-services/find-care/treatments/heart-disease-prevention), or still have autoantibodies,\" she says. \"They can stay hovering in this space forever.\" Other patients in remission have slowed or stopped the production of autoantibodies. Characterizing the different types of remission will be valuable, Dr. Diamond says, providing insights that may lead to more successful treatments and fewer flare-ups and relapses (about 5% of patients in drug-free clinical remission relapse each year). Dr. Diamond's grant proposal won unanimous approval from the review panel, says Gary Koretzky, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at Weil Cornell Medicine in New York City and chair of the Lupus Research Alliance's scientific advisory board. \"As is typical for Betty, she brought together a team of outstanding collaborators around an inspired project that has the potential to break new ground,\" he says. \"I have always been incredibly impressed by her ability to identify important biologic questions that have clear relevance for our understanding of human disease.\" Dr. Diamond's work is far from finished, but her legacy is already secure. Last May, she was [elected to the U.S. National Academy of Science,](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/feinstein-institutes-betty-diamond-elected-to-the-national-academy-of-sciences) an honor reserved for top researchers in their field. The academy singled out her groundbreaking work showing the effects of lupus antibodies on the brain \u2014 not only her lab's 2001 study that first identified antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of a lupus patient and the work in mice demonstrating the neurotoxic effects of those antibodies, but all that followed. Dr. Diamond's studies have shown that antibodies in the brain stimulate microglial cells, a part of the brain's immune system that can set off [harmful inflammation](https://lenoxhill.northwell.edu/neurology/centers/autoimmune-brain-disorder-encephalitis-center#:~:text=Specialty%20areas-,Neuroinflammation,-Brain%20tissue%20injury), for instance. And in 2012, Dr. Diamond and her team reported that approximately 40% of lupus patients carry a particular autoantibody that has clear potential to enter the brain. As she helps establish the biology of brain-related lupus complications, Dr. Diamond continues to look for ways to make a clinical impact. \"Once you start to understand the mechanism of disease, you can look at interventions,\" she says. In 2018, she and colleagues announced a finding in mice that has intriguing implications for patients. [The study](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/feinstein-institute-researchers-find-hypertension-drugs-could-prevent-memory-loss-in-lupus-patients) found that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \u2014 relatively safe, inexpensive medications often prescribed to lower blood pressure \u2014 could slow the response of microglial cells in the brains of mice with an autoimmune disease similar to lupus. Not only did the mice treated with ACE inhibitors show less brain inflammation than untreated mice, they also did better on memory tests. The next step is already underway. Dr. Diamond and other researchers at the Feinstein Institutes are currently recruiting lupus patients to participate in a clinical trial designed to see whether ACE inhibitors can ease brain-related symptoms of the disease. \"We think we might be able to decrease the inflammatory processes in the brain and improve people's cognitive function,\" she says. Dr. Diamond's work with autoantibodies has also shed light on conditions beyond lupus. Certain conditions can make the [blood-brain barrier](https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/brain-cancer-treatment-using-belly-fat-is-first-in-world) \"leaky,\" she says. Infection, [hypertension](https://www.northwell.edu/katz-institute-for-womens-health/articles/hypertension-silent-but-deadly-national-health-crisis) and a smoking habit can compromise the barrier; so can trauma and extreme stress. Perhaps, she and colleagues proposed, attacks from autoantibodies contribute to the anxiety, mood swings and other psychiatric complications of [post-traumatic stress disorder ](https://thewell.northwell.edu/emotional-wellness/ptsd-awareness)(PTSD). And there's another point of vulnerability, Dr. Diamond says. The developing brain of the fetus is only partly protected by an immature vascular barrier, and yet maternal antibodies routinely circulate in the developing baby's blood. \"If a pregnant woman has anti-brain antibodies, they can enter the fetal brain, damage the developing circuitry and cause lifelong problems,\" she says. Indeed, women with autistic children are four to five times more likely than other women to have autoantibodies known to affect brain cells. \"We think that maternal antibodies are a contributing cause in up to 10% of cases of autism spectrum disorder,\" she says. In a [2017 TedMed talk,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0lCWHFKJLk) Dr. Diamond summed up her approach to the work that has absorbed her over the course of her career. Drawing on her background in classical studies, she told her audience that almost 2,000 years ago, the ancient Roman poet and satirist Juvenal asked, \"Who will guard the guards?\" He was talking about the emperor's legions, she said, but the same question can be asked when the immune system, the body's great protector, runs amok. Who will protect lupus patients, people with other autoimmune disorders, and those with autism spectrum disorder, PTSD and other conditions in which autoantibodies may play a role? Her experiences provided the answer, she said. \"When we listen to our patients, when we make them our partners \u2014 not just in treatment but also in research \u2014 then we can answer that vexing, 2000-year-old question,\" she told the audience. \"'Who will guard the guards?' We will, all of us, by working together.\" Throughout her career, Dr. Diamond has cared not just about science but also about the way science gets done. Her commitment to mentorship and teamwork has had a far-reaching impact. \"I have seen Betty as a role model for my own career and careers of many others,\" says Dr. Gary Koretzky, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Dr. Diamond has been especially focused on supporting female colleagues in a field that still seems to favor men. \"I have always been an advocate for women in science,\" she says. \"It's getting better, but there's no question that you have to work harder and do better as a woman in science to get the same rewards.\" In 2022, Dr. Diamond was [recognized by the Association of American Medical Colleges,](https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/betty-diamond-receives-women-in-medicine-and-science-leadership-award) which presented her with the Women in Medicine and Science Award. Dr. Diamond stood out for a multi-pronged approach to supporting young female scientists, says Tamara Nowling, PhD, a rheumatologist at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston and a member of the steering committee for the award. \"As a phenomenal scientist and a leader in her field, Dr. Diamond is an outstanding example of someone who lifts while rising,\" Dr. Nowling says. The committee was especially impressed by Dr. Diamond's impact in helping to create [Advancing Women in Science and Medicine](https://give.northwell.edu/advancing-women-science-and-medicine-awsm) (AWSM, pronounced \"awesome\"), a group that raises money to support young women investigators at the Feinstein Institutes. To date, AWSM has distributed more than $3 million to help recipients attend conferences and recruit talented researchers to their labs, among other things. \"Our aim has always been to increase the ability of young women scientists to network and meet other people and start being recognized,\" Dr. Diamond says. \"It's been tremendously successful that way.\" Her advocacy focuses on teamwork and results. \"I haven't done it by showing that women are paid less \u2014 though they are \u2014 or by showing that it takes women longer to be promoted \u2014 although it does,\" Dr. Diamond says. \"I've done it through getting women together so that we can advocate "}
