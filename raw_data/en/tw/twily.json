Introduction The purpose of this report is to documen t the results of cognitive testing on the 2007 Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) supplement of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Many of the survey questions were similar to those tested for the 2002 NHIS supplement and are designed to measure the use of CAM practices that are practitioner-based and those that are self-p racticed. A new series of questi ons measuring respondent perceptions about CAM, as well as new and expanded sect ions on the use of herbal supplements and vitamins were also tested. The majority of this report is dedicated to pr esenting a question-by-questi on analysis of the CAM supplement. Comments are included for all questi ons; however, emphasis is placed on items that have the potential to generate re sponse error, that is, they may not capture the information they were designed to measure. The discussion of these questions includes descriptions of how respondents interpreted question intent, explanations of why and how questions presented problems for respondents and, wher e appropriate, recommendations for question improvement. It is important to note that, due the length of the instrument and th e complexity of the topic, not all questions were able to be thoroughly evaluated. The extent to which this affected any recommendations is indicated in the analysis. The next section briefly describes the met hodology of cognitive interviewing, outlines the interviewing procedures, and discusses how responde nts were chosen to participate. The third section of the report presents general findings, question-by-question analysis, and recommendations for ques tionnaire modification. 2. Method Intensive verbal probing was the primary cogniti ve interviewing method used for the project. With this technique, interviewers administer the survey question, obt ain a response, then retrospectively probe the respondent for other information relevant to the question. This yields rich and detailed information on how respondent s answered the question, what they were thinking when answering, and how they interpreted the meaning of the question. Shedding light on the question-response process, this information allows the an alyst to determine whether the survey language is too complex in general, wh ether one word in particular is not understood by respondents, or whether respondent s have the ability to recall the requested information. The - 1 - appropriateness of response categories can also be evaluated with this procedure, as can the ability of participants to draw upon their own experiences and knowledge to answer the questions effectively. Because the intensive interviewing method provides extensive detail on the question-response process, not only doe s it allow the inte rviewer to identify which questions and/or response categories are problematic, it also shows why and how questions are problematic, leading to possible stra tegies for improving question design. Procedures Interviewing took place in the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Questionnaire Design Research Laboratory (QDRL). Because the new CAM supplement contains questions intended for both users and non-user s of alternative health practi ces, our goal was to interview respondents who met both conditions. As a resu lt, recruitment strategies varied by group. The QDRL respondent database was helpful in obta ining non-users of CAM. On the other hand, a newspaper advertisement (in the Express, a free commuter newspaper) was combined with flyers advertising the study to ta rget CAM users. Flyers were posted in area health food stores and other establishments catering to alternative health practices. Prior to participation, respondents were screened over the telephone in order to identify key demographics such as age, educational attainment, and income level, as well as the extent of the caller's use of CAM. Once chos en, respondents filled out paperwor k whereby they agreed to the interview being video- and audio-taped. The in terviewer then explained the purpose of NCHS, described the survey, and told respondents the manner in which the interview would be conducted. After these introductory remarks, in terviewers began by administering the survey questions. Upon recording an an swer, the interviewer probed re spondents' interpretation of key terms, the ease with which they chose a respons e category, and their experi ences with alternative therapies. Through respondent narr ative interviewers were able to ascertain whether or not a response error had occurred, and determine how respondents interprete d the intent of each question. Interviews were designed to last 70 minutes (10 minutes of which were devoted to paperwork), and a $50 token of apprec iation was given to participants. In total, two versions of the instrument were te sted. However, because of the complexity of the concepts being measured, the questionnaire did not undergo majo r revision during testing. We needed a considerable amount of data in or der to effectively identify response problems, diagnose the cause, and suggest a remedy. Additionally, the complexity of the new sections in particular required that emphasis be placed on those sections during the interview at the expense of the sections that appeared on the 2002 supplement. Our analys is and recommendations reflect that emphasis. Respondents We conducted a total of 19 interviews. Respondent s were selected with a purposive sample in mind. All NHIS survey respondents will receive at least some portion of the CAM questions; therefore, we were interested in participants who had never used CAM, those who used \"lightly\" (i.e., used one or two modalities), and those who used \"heavily\" (i.e., used many modalities). As interviewing progressed we discove red that nearly every respondent used some type of herbal - 2 - supplement. In order to understand how the he rbal supplement questions would function for non-users, we scheduled later par ticipants based on the criteria th at they had never used these supplements. Testing the questions on different groups of users al lowed us to better determine the chances of false positive (a \"yes\" response th at should be \"no\") and false negative (a \"no\" response that should be \"yes\") responses and evaluate whether the questions were capturing the intended group of respondents. Demographic diversity among respondents was al so sought. The breakdown of respondent characteristics appears in Table 1.

Results General Findings Identity : What became apparent throughout the course of te sting is that many people recognize a personal identity associated with CAM use, and that this identity (or l ack thereof) influences the way people interpret the questions, as well as the ease with which they can answer questions. Hence, participants both with and without a \"CAM identity\" demons trated response difficulties that were directly related to this phenomenon, but th e nature of these difficulties varied depending upon which identity the respondent had. Health identities have several dimensions that can be represented by a four-fold typology (see figure 1). This typology should be considered only a heuristic device inductively created to help understand and organize the responses elicit ed from these particular respondents. Figure 1: Typology of identitie s associated with health H e a l t h F o c u s Maintain Treat / Prevent Health Specific Problem Locus Passive Of Control A c t i v e Along one axis is the \"health focus\" of the indi vidual. Some people tend to focus on maintaining health, rather than on fixing health problem s as they arise or even in preventing a specific disease or condition. In other words, the focal point of their orientation is health and the goal is to be as healthy as possible. Health is viewed as a c ontinuum stretching to infi nity, whereby individuals move into periods of greater or lesser health, but can never actually achieve perfect health. Other people are more inclined to think about hea lth as the prevention or treatment of illness. The idea is that if they are healthy (i.e., not sick ) they cannot make themselves \"healthier.\" In a sense, health is not a matter of degree - it either is or it isn't. Even though prevention is an aspect of their belief system, the focus is on problems with health (that is, on conditions or disease) rather than on health per se. - 4 - Along the second axis is the \"locus of control\" for the individual. Those with a passive orientation generally accept what other people tell them about their health and follow recommendations. The opinions they accept come from both loved ones and health professionals who may or may not have to show \"proof\" that what they are suggesting has merit. Others have a more active orientation towards thei r health. People in this group are less likely to blindly accept what others - incl uding loved ones or health professionals - tell them, and are more likely to personally seek out informa tion to guide their decision-making process. Individuals fall into one of the four typologies. Those who are characterized best by an active locus of control combined with a focus on maintaining health are the most likely to exhibit a \"CAM identity.\" The details of this identify were unable to be fully explored due to time constraints, however, it appears to be something similar to a vegetarian identity. Respondents (with or without this identity) had no particul ar word for it; nevert heless it was clear through respondent narrative that the identity exists. The herbal supplement section was particularly vu lnerable to problems related to identity. For example, those with a CAM identity had a difficu lt time with the questions related to prevention and treatment. To a large extent this is because their focus is predominantly on health maintenance, while the questions on prevention and treatment assume a disease- or condition-oriented focus. A better approach is to ask re spondents whether they us e herb X to maintain health, prevent a condition, or treat a condition and then ask appropriate follow-up questions. (Although the problem was pronounced in the herbal section, this recomme ndation applies for all sections that have this line of questioning.) Interestingly, we also identified response pr oblems for subjects with no CAM identity; and in fact, these difficulties were a direct outcome of not having this identity. If this group understood a question as asking about behavi ors that indicate having a CAM identity, they would try to answer in a way that would make it clear they are not \"CAM users.\" For example, the first question in the section tried to ascertain whethe r respondents EVER took an herbal supplement. Moreover, the original introduction to this section asked people to include things like drinking an herbal tea to remedy a cold or flu. Many people answered yes. However, upon receiving a few more questions, those with no CAM identity wanted to be sure they weren't labeled as \"users\" and sometimes even wanted to go back and change an answer. In sum, this concern affected the way they interpreted and answered the questions. Specifically, they were inclined to omit herbal supplements they had used. A disproportionate number of false ne gative responses were obtained from respondents who had no CAM identit y, and didn't want to be labeled as having one. To minimize this problem, recommendations are to word the questions in a way that is as \"identity-neutral\" as possible. {See the quest ion-by-question section for the detailed analysis.} Perceptions Section : This section is fundamentally different from the others in the sense that the questions ask about attitudes or opinions rather than factual informati on. It proved to be a very challenging series of question for almost all respondents, regardless of their CAM identity. We detected several problems that formed the foundation of re sponse difficulties in this section. - 5 - The first (and probably most prom inent) one is a problem that attitude questions commonly fall prey to; that is, they ask respondents to answer a question without providing enough information. When this happens participants are more likel y to respond with \"it depends\" than with a definitive answer. This phenomenon manifested in the section by the inability of many people to combine alternative therap ies into one generic category and c onventional medicine into another - which is what the questions required of them. This was especially problematic for (though not limited to) CAM users because they tended to s ee complexity in the issues. We found that people's opinions are more nuanced than these qu estion allow The phr ases \"in general\" and \"on the whole\" are meant to convey the idea that respondents should thin k about each approach to health (CAM vs. conventional) as a singular category, and then compare those two categories to each other. However, while this characteri zation of CAM and convent ional medicine may be meaningful to researchers it is apparently not to respondents, and attempts to compel respondents to think in these terms ultimately failed, as ev idenced by the confusion the perceptions questions engendered. Moreover, a phrase such as \"in gene ral\" created a series of responses that have very little validity because the meanings behind the answers vary. \"In general\" became a phrase that allowed the respondent to build complexity into an overly-s implified statement. Hence, while the phrase was intended to have respondents th ink in general terms about the topic, it actually provided a strategy by which people could fit th eir view into the statement. In other words, some subjects said that sometimes they agree and sometimes they disagree with the statement. In judging how to respond, the phrase \"in general\" allowed them to say \"agree\" be cause it means that sometimes they disagree too. However, others would choose \"disagree\" for the same reason (i.e., \"in general\" means that sometimes they agree). In essence, agree and di sagree end up meaning the same thing. For others an answer of disagree meant that they were disagreeing with the premise of the statement. For still others, an answer of disagree meant that the opposite was true of what the statement was suggesting. In sum, the reliabilit y and validity of these answers is very low - there is no consistent meaning behind the respon ses. {See the question-by-question analysis for details on each item.} Some specific remedies to particular questions are suggested in the question-by-question section. However, this may not address the overarching problem as discussed here. While there is no easy solution, perhaps presenting respondents with a scenario including sp ecific details over a general statement would improve the responses. The second problem was the lack of an agreed-upon definition of alte rnative therapies. This was a major source of difficulty among non-CAM user s (although even some who used CAM were sometimes confused by what to include). Non- users have little-to-no knowledge or experience with CAM, so this section is asking them about things they do not know - which violates a cardinal rule of good question asking. This section is probably better left to respondents who use CAM in some capacity. Moreover, an opening statement providing a brief description of what is meant by alternative therapies might prove helpful. In fact, terminology shifted for both the \"alternative\" construct (e.g., alternative th erapies, natural remedies, alterna tive medical therapies) and for the - 6 - \"conventional\" construct (e.g., conventional medical treatment, conventional medicine, chemical drugs, conventional medical doc tors) - although respondents generally struggled less with interpreting language for the latter. Question-By-Question Analysis This section is dedicated to an individual review of findings for each question tested. Each item contains an analysis of the response pro cess followed by recommendations for question improvement. CONDITIONS CON.1 Have you EVER been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had ... [READ LIST] ... Attention Deficit Disorder ... Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease... gum disease... Depression... Fibromyalgia ... Irritable bowel syndrome ... Influenza or pneumonia... Lupus... Mania or psychosis... Peripheral vascular disease, including Intermittent Claudication (cramping)or poor circulation in your legs ... Phobia or fears ... Schizophrenia CON.2 Have you EVER had ... ... Problems with Acid reflux or heartburn ... Excessive use of alcohol or tobacco ... Regular Headaches... Memory loss or loss of other cognitive functions ... Substance abuse, other than alcohol or tobacco Comments: The original list included the choice s of \"dental problems, including cavities & gum disease,\" \"acid reflux/heartburn\" and \"headaches, ot her than migraine.\" However, these choices seemed to be in a different class compared to the other conditions on th is list. Many subjects viewed them as relatively minor and common (alm ost everyone has had a cavity or a headache) in relation to the other exampl es which are decidedly more serious. Hence, some subjects wondered if they should report thes e conditions when they had them. Recommendations: The problematic categories were changed to reflect more serious conditions. 'Dental problems, including cavitie s and gum disease' was changed to simply 'gum disease,' 'acid reflux/heartburn' or heartburn,' and 'headache, migraine' was change d to 'regular headaches.' Wh ile our respondents interpreted \"regular\" headaches as those that occur freque ntly, it is possible that others may interpret - 7 - \"regular\" as \"garden variety\" or \"typical\" (i.e., not migraine). Sponsors could consider using the phrase \"regularly occurring headaches\" to clarify the meaning of regular. Complementary and Altern ative Medicine Supplement Now I am going to ask you about some health s ervices you may have used. First I will ask you about some specific services for which you would have seen a practitioner. Then I will ask you about some other health practices you may have done on your own. Modalities that Require Practitioner SHOW HAND CARD (PRACTITIONER MODALITIES) PRT.1 Have you EVER seen a provider or pr actitioner for any of the following for your own health? [MARK ALL THAT APPLY] (0) None [GO TO NEXT SECTION - HERBS ] (1) Acupuncture (2) Ayurveda (3) Biofeedback (4) Chelation Therapy (5) Chiropractic Care or Osteopathic Manipulation (6) Energy Healing Therapy such as Reik i,Therapeutic Touch, or Polarity Therapy (7) Folk Medicine and Home Remedies (8) Hypnosis (9) Massage such as Swedish, Bowen, Rolfing, or Reflexology (10) Naturopathy (11) Native American Healing or Trad itional Latino Medicines, such as Botanicas, Curanderismo, (12) Movement Therapies Technique, Pilates, or Trager Psychophysical Intergration Comments: Due to the length of the instrument, combined with the fact that this section appeared in the 2002 CAM supplemen t, these questions were not ex tensively tested. However, a few issues did arise for several respondents. Th e first problem identified also surfaced in the 2002 cognitive testing. There it wa s found that respondents often do not consider home remedies to be practitioner based. The same was true he re; some respondents spoke of home remedies as practices passed down through the family. Rely ing on their own definition of home remedy, participants were tempted to include the use of home remedy in their answer, even when a practitioner wasn't used. This would rende r the follow-up questions illogical, since many assume the use of a practitioner. - 8 - This same problem also occurred for one responden t in relation to folk medicine. He does not see a practitioner for it, but included it in his answ er anyway because, as he put it, folk medicine is \"being introduced to herbs and things of that nature...nobody usually prescribes anything...that's somewhere that you go and walk into a place of business.\" Movement therapies were a new modality for this section, and posed some definitional problems. Respondents had different defi nitions of movement therapy, including yoga and, more commonly, physical therapy and did not limit their interpretation to the examples given on the hand card. Finally, the phrasing of the questi on suggests a yes/no response, yet the actual request is for the respondent to provide a list of modalities. While this did not create insurmountable problems, it did make question administ ration difficult, i.e., it required a b it of explanation on the part of the interviewer. It also demanded a somewhat s ophisticated reading leve l on the part of the respondent, who is expected to read all th e modalities on the hand card and then tell the interviewer which ones apply. Thos e with lower reading skills may not be able to complete the task that is being asked of them. Recommendations: First, drop home remedy from the practitioner-based list. Many respondents do not link this modality to a practitioner. Sin ce very little is known about how people define folk medicine, sponsors should consider dropping this category as well. Second, if movement therapies are to be limited to the examples provided on the card, then ask respondents only about those examples, rather than confusing them with a general term that has no agreed-upon definition. Finally, consider a question format here similar to that used for self-practiced modalities such as relaxation techniques. While this may literally in crease the number of questions, administration time will likely decrease (due to less expl anation and smoother interview flow) and comprehension for less-literate respondents will increase. [NEW] PRT.2 How old where you when you first saw a practitioner for _______________? (modality) _______________ [AGE IN YEARS] Comments: This was not extensively tested. Of the six people asked this question, one person had enough difficulty to not be able to provide an answer. She was a heavy CAM user for much of her life, so it was nearly impossible to re member what she started when. Not even age categories helped her - she said she was in her \" 20's or 30's\" for one modality and \"20's, 30's or 40's\" for another. Recommendations: Since most of those tested ha d to think about it and then gave an answer they knew had some margin of error (of at least a few years), age brackets were initiated. - 9 - However, an open timeframe on a recall-depende nt question is ill advised. Respondents who have been using CAM for a long time will be disproportionately burdened compared to more recent users. Estimates will be less reliable for this group. PRT.3 DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS, did you see a practitioner for ________________? (modality) (1) Yes (next question) (2) No ( GO TO NEXT MODALITY - VITAMINS ) Comments: Six respondents were asked th is question; none had trouble answering. Recommendations: None. PRT.4 DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS, how many times did you see a practitioner for __________________? (modality) (1) Only one time (4) 11-15 (2) 2-5 times (5) 16-20 (3) 6-10 times (6) More than 20 times Comments: Three respondents were asked this question. Two answered with very little difficulty, but one respondent had a hard time wi th this calculation because her visits occurred earlier in the year, prior to a car accident. Esse ntially, she had to think back to when her accident was, remember how many times a week she was seeing a practitioner (for massage) and then do the math for the 4 months prior to her surgery. Recommendations: To reduce calculation and re call challenges for re spondents, consider changing the timeframe to the past month. If this is accepted, th en PRT.3 should also adopt the past month timeframe. [NEW] PRT.5 On average, how much do you pay out-o f-pocket for each visit to a practitioner for _________________? (modality) $ ____________________________ Comments: This was asked of three respondent s. Two had no problem - one because she knew the cost exactly, the other because she had no expenses (her insurance paid all costs). However, the third respondent had trouble because his defin ition of folk medicine didn't account for seeing - 10 - _______________________________ _______________________________ _______________________________ _______________________________ a practitioner (see PRT.1). As a result, he was including items he buys at the co-op for treatment, prevention, and thi ngs like soap, deodorant and toothpaste. He said they all fall under what is labeled as \"folk medicine.\" He doesn't wait until he gets sick, and using CAM is like a lifestyle choice. Recommendations: The problem disappears if folk medicine is dropped from the list. Otherwise, a definition of folk medicine must be provided in PRT.1. Howe ver, we have no data upon which to build an accurate definition. PRT.6 Did you use ___________________ for a specific health (modality) problem or condition? (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO PRT.12) Comments: Not extensively tested; no problems identified. Recommendations: None. PRT.7 For what health problems or conditions did you use [modality]? Comments: Not extensively tested; no problems identified. Recommendations: None. [IF more than 1 condition, ask PRT.8; else go to PRT.9] [NEW] PRT.8 For which ONE of these health conditions you use ____________________ the most? (modality) _______________________________ [CONDITION] Comments: Not do you think ____________________ helped (modality) your________________________________? - 11 - (condition for which modality used the most) Would you say a great deal, some, only a little, or not at all? Comments: Tested on three people. Two had no problem. One person had difficulty assessing causality. She said her symptoms depend on a lot of things, such as the weather. Sometimes massage helps a great deal, sometimes only a little . Only after I prompted her to give me a single answer did she say \"some\" as a way of averag ing out the choices. However, she had to be coached to do this; she did not \"average out\" the categories automatically. This problem occurs for this question in other sections as well, and is, in fact more pronounced as testing was more extensive in those sections. Recommendations: Only ask this type of quest ion when the respondent is treating a specific condition, not when they are using the supplemen t for general health maintenance or for the prevention of disease. In the latter situ ations, causality is impossible to know. [NEW] PRT.10 Besides receiving _______________________ treatment, did you also (modality) receive conventional medical treatment for [ condition for which modality used the most ]? (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO PRT.12) Comments: Three respondents were tested a nd had no trouble with this question. They interpreted conventiona l medical treatment as going to a physician or taking a prescription. Recommendations: None. [NEW] PRT. 11 Did you receive convent ional medical treatment for [ condition for which modality used the most ] before, at about the same time, or after trying ________________? (modality) (1) Before trying modality (2) At about the same time you be gan receiving modality treatments (3) After trying modality Comments: Three respondents were te sted; none had difficulty answering. Recommendations: None. - 12 - [NEW] PRT.12 Did any of the ______________ treatments produce unexpected (modality) side-effects that required medical attention? (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO PRT.14 ) Comments: Three respondents were tested; none had difficulty answering, though there was no time for extensive probing to verify their answers. Recommendations: None. [NEW] PRT.13 What kinds of unexpected side effects did you experience? Comments: This question not tested. Recommendations: None. [NEW] PRT.14 DURING THE PAST 12 MONTS, did you use ___________________ (modality) for any of these reasons? Please say yes or no to each. (1) To improve or enhance energy yes no (2) For general wellness or gene ral disease prevention yes no (3) To improve or enhance immune function yes no Comments: Three respondents were tested. None had difficulty answering, though there was no time for extensive probing to verify their answers. Recommendations: None. [ASK PRT.14 IF R HAS INSURANCE; ELSE GO TO PRT.15] PRT.14a DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS, were any of the costs of using __________________ covered by insurance? (modality) (1) Yes (2) No - 13 - Comments: Three respondents were tested. None had difficulty answering, though there was no time for extensive probing to verify their answers. For one respondent it was clear that all the costs were covered jointly by Medicaid and Medicare. Recommendations: None. In fact, keep this que stion in favor of the in surance question in the perceptions section (PER.6) which is too vague . People who have never used CAM don't know if their insurance covers it anyway. Only people who have used a CAM therapy and have checked to see if their insuran ce covers the procedure can say whether or not it's covered by insurance. SHOW HAND CARD (CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS) PRT.15 DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS, did you let any of these CONVENTIONAL medical professionals know about your use of _________________________? (modality) (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO NEXT MODALITY - VITAMINS ) Comments: Three respondents were tested. None had difficulty answering, though there was no time for extensive probing to verify their answers. Recommendations: None. PRT.16 Which ones? [MARK ALL THAT APPLY] (1) Medical Doctor (including specialists) (4) Dentist (including specialists) (2) Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant (5) Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) (3) Psychiatrist (6) Other Health Care Provider Comments: Three respondents were tested. None had difficulty answering, though there was no time for extensive probing to verify their answers. Recommendations: None. HERBS and Other Non-vitamin/no n-mineral Dietary Supplements Now I am going to ask you about some additi onal health practices. You may have done them on your own OR you may h ave seen a practitioner. Th e first practice I'll ask about is herbs, then I'll ask about vitamins and minerals. SHOW HAND CARD HR B#1 (HERB LIST) - 14 - Some people use natural herbs (like St John's wort, Echinacea, garlic pills and cranberry pills) and other non-vitamin dietary supplemen ts (like omega 3 fatty acids, glucosamine and chondroitin) for a variety of health reaso ns. Some people drink an herbal tea to remedy a flu or cold. Others take a daily herb p ill to help with a health condition or just to stay healthy. Comments: Several issues are present in this sec tion. First, the herb section was initially tested AFTER the vitamin section. Because respondents sometimes didn't conceptually separate the two and tended to include herbs when answering for vitamins, we decided to move the herb section first, telling respondents that vitamins would be asked a bout next. This didn't solve the problem entirely (one respondent was still thinking of her iron supplement when answering), but did greatly diminish it. Second, this introduction is very long and not retained in memory by respondents. In fact, the only portion many respondents seemed to grasp was the sentence referencing herbal tea to remedy a cold or flu. When combined with a hand card containing well over 60 different examples, respondents were overwhelmed with the task at hand. Recommendations: Because respondents are given a hand card explicitly showing the supplements to be considered, this introducti on can be greatly simplified. We suggest the following: \"Now I am going to ask you about some additiona l health practices. The first practice I'll ask about is herbs, then I'll as k about vitamins and minerals.\" SHOW HAND CARD HR B#1 (HERB LIST) \"People use herbs and other non-vitamin suppl ements for a variety of reasons. Some people use them to treat a specific health cond ition, while others take them just to stay healthy.\" HRB.1 Have you EVER used na tural herbs or ot her non-vitamin supplements for your own health? (1) Yes (2) No (next modality ) Comments: A significant problem with this se ction is the definition of a supplement. Respondents were extremely confused about what should and should not be included in their answers. Having the hand card did l ittle to solve this problem. In fact, its length added to the confusion rather than adding clar ity. The degree of respondent uncer tainty is illustrated by five respondents either changing their answer or expre ssing a lack of confiden ce in their maybe...that would be it\"; \"not to my knowledge\"). Respondents made judgments about how to answer on the basis of four definitional dimensions: - 15 - 1. The form of the substance (e.g., food or pill) 2. the purpose for which it's taken (medicinal vs. taste) 3. where it's obtained (gro cery store vs. herb shop) 4. how it's taken (ingested vs. applied to the skin) Is a supplement a pill, power, or liquid? Food? Taken only medicinally to treat a condition or to maintain health? Purchased only from a health food store? Only ingested or used for any bodily purpose (such as a cream)? Any and all of thes e interpretations were used by respondents to make sense of this section. Self identity further complicates the problem of defining herbal supplements. This identity appears to be something akin to vegetarianis m. For some people, using herbal, non-vitamin supplements carries meaning beyond simply usi ng an herb for a specific purpose. As one respondent put it, using alternativ e therapies is a \"way of life.\" As a result, people who do not see themselves in this light define their supple ment use differently from those they view as \"users\" of supplements. For example, one resp ondent who saw herself as a CAM user defined food as a non-vitamin supplement because food is a way of healing your body. For her, purpose took priority over form. On the other hand, a us er who did NOT have a CAM identity chose not to include food as a supplement, even when used for the same purpose (that is, of healing the body). She kept referring to \"some people who use a lot of these things\" saying that she \"wasn't like that,\" and that she \"preferred to get these things through her food.\" Several respondents who had no CAM id entity wanted to be sure they weren't labeled as \"users.\" This concern affected the way they interprete d and answered the ques tions. For instance, because of the \"herbal tea to remedy a cold or flu\" sentence in the introduction, several respondents initially answered \"yes\" to quest ion HRB.1. However, by HRB.3 one respondent changed his answer to \"no\" because, he sai d, \"tea is more mainstream...not so much a supplement.\" To him, a supplement relates mo re to powder or pills that are bought from a \"health food store.\" Because this respondent's identity does not in clude being a regular user of herbal supplements, he did not want to answer yes to this question, and place himself in the category of \"supplement user\" - even though he doe s drink an herbal tea for medicinal purposes and makes his own herbal tea from boiling a ginger root for gastrointestinal health. Another respondent was inclined to answer \"no\" for si milar reasons. However, when we took time to review the list (which he initially for the most part ignored ), he mentioned that he has taken ginseng in liquid form and reluctantly changed hi s answer to yes. Anot her respondent literally said \"I'm not a pill person.\" S till another example is a person who answered no, yet has taken an \"herbal energy pill,\" lecithin, noni-j uice and various herbal teas, including those with ginseng. In the end, false negatives were elicited from respondents with this perspective; that is, the question is not capturing all people who use herbal supplements. Further, the data suggest herbal users may not be missed at random, representing a pattern that would lead to biased estimates. Recommendations: First, the herb list should be reduced to a size si milar to the vitamin list. The length alone was too much for many respondents to cognitively process, even without the self- identity issue complicati ng matters. The supplement form shoul d also be made clear - indicate whether the substance can be f ood, pill, powder and/or liquid. - 16 - Second, we recommend using the word \"taken\" instead of \"used.\" Taken may help convey the idea that the supplement must be ingested. Further, it may also be a more identity-neutral term. \"Used\" almost suggests a pattern that is part of one's identity (think \"d rug user\"), while \"taken\" implies the opposite, that the behavior is not part of self-identity (\"I've taken drugs, but I'm not a user\"). The following wo rding is one possibility: \"Have you EVER taken any natural herbs or other non-vitamin supplements for your own health?\" The phrase \"taken any\" may help to convey the me ssage that the ingestion of any herb for any reason should be included in the respondent's answer. HRB.2 How old were you when you first began using natural herbs or other non-vitamin supplements for your own health? Under 18 45-54 18-24 55-64 25-34 65 or older 35-44 Comments: The biggest challenge respondents faced in answering this question was not related to recall problems as much as to defining th e phrase \"when you first began using.\" Some participants interpreted this question as asking about when th ey first EVER took an herbal supplement, which was sometimes in childhood. Othe r respondents interpreted this as when they first made their own decision to take a supplem ent, when they first began purchasing them on their own, or when they began using them regular ly (regardless of who made the decision). For some of these respondents, taking a supplement in childhood was missed. On the other hand, those respondents who were hea vy users of supplements were more prone to recall problems. They have used so many supplem ents, often for a long period of time, that the ability to remember when it all began simply isn' t there. For these respondents, age categories are helpful, but not foolproof. (The firs t version tested asked for age in years.) Recommendations: Because multiple interpretations create data that are not comparable, the underlying construct should be made clearer to respondents. For exam ple, if \"first time ever\" is the intended meaning, then the question could be: \"How old were you the very fi rst time you took an herbal or non-vitamin supplement for your own health?\" Using the word \"took\" in favor of \"used\" may im ply that the question is not necessarily asking about regular use. - 17 - HRB.3 During the last 12 months have you used natural herbs or other non-vitamin supplements for your own health? (1) Yes (2) No (next modality ) Comments: The original wording of this ques tion was long and cumbersome (\"During the last 12 months have you used natural herbs or other non-vitamin/non-mineral dietary supplements for your own health or treatment?\"). The question was shortened, but still suffered many of the same problems as HRB.1. Recommendations: Change the wordi ng to reflect the changes to HRB.1. \"During the last 12 months have you take n any natural herbs or other non-vitamin supplements for your own health?\" HRB.4 On average, how much do you spend on natural herbs or other non-vitamin supplements per month? Nothing $76-125 Under $30 $126-200 $200 Comments: This question created judgment di fficulties for many respondents. Light users found it challenging because their use can be infre quent or intermittent. The lack of any real pattern to buying supplements caused these re spondents to provide admittedly very rough estimates, sometimes changing their answ ers the more they thought about it. Heavy users with a CAM identity also had diffi culty, but usually for different reasons. One person was trying to think of all the different form s of substances that she uses. Because this often includes food, she was trying to parse out money spent on food at th e grocery store and add that amount to money she spends at the health f ood store. Another person who works at a herb shop gets many of her products for free (or at redu ced cost) so she's always trying new things. Still another person buys her products by mail order, at the health food st ore and at the grocery store. Trying to remember how much she spends at each place and then adding up those figure was impossible for her - in fact, when asked this question, she literally put her forehead down on the table in exasperation. In addition, many pe ople use herbal supplements in combination with vitamins, and find it virtually impossible to sepa rate out what they spend on each. Sometimes they did not even realize they were combining costs unless specifically asked if their answer included the cost of vitamins. In sum, people are likely to vary the supplements they use (by either form or substance), rather than demonstrate consistent and steady use and buying that would be more conducive to estimating an average cost. Recommendations: Part of the pr oblem with this question is the fact that it asks people to calculate an average of what th ey typically use. This is ve ry difficult for reasons discussed - 18 - above. It may prove easier for respondents to estimate what they've spent on herbal supplements in the past 30 days. This is more concrete info rmation that is somewhat fresher in memory. Try changing the question to: \"How much did you spend on natu ral herbs or other non-vitamin supplements in the last 30 days?\" HRB.5 During the past 30 days did you use a ny of the following natu ral herbals and or other dietary supplements? [ MARK ALL THAT APPLY ] Comments: The problems respondents had with th is question mimic those described for HRB.1. However, heavy users and those with a CAM identity bore the extra burden of listing many supplements. The first response from one participant was \"phew!\" Three respondents mentioned at least half of the items on the hand card. Also of note is the sentence struct ure vis-\u00e0-vis the desired response. The sentence is phrased as a yes/no question, yet expects the re spondent to supply a list of herbs they use. This was administratively awkward. Recommendations: A significantly shortened herb list will minimize the problem of heavy users running through an extensive list of what they have taken. To help define what is meant to be included, use a short list of th e most analytically desired s upplements (it should be no longer than the vitamin list), and tell respondents to pick items solely from this list. Ideally, the list should specify every form sponsors want respondent s to consider. For example, if garlic is mentioned, indicate all forms that are acceptable fo r respondents to include (pill, liquid, food, etc.). We suggest ch anging this question to: \"During the past 30 days, did you take any of the herbs or other non-vitamin supplements listed on this card?\" \"[IF YES] Please tell me whic h items on this list you took.\" SHOW Hand Card HRB#2 (HERB REASONS) HRB.6 If you had to pick only one, which of these is the MAIN reason you used ___________________? (herb) (1) to stay healthy (4) prescription or ov er the counter drugs (2) to have more energy are too expensive (3) to feel or look better - 19 - Comments: The beginning clause was initially abse nt from this question. However, the word MAIN alone did not communicate the idea that respondents were to pick just one reason. Adding \"if you had to pick only one\" seemed to fix this problem. Another problem was with the response options. Originally, they read: 1. it's good for me 2. to stay healthy 3. to have more energy 4. to feel or look better 5. prescription or over-the-counter drugs are too expensive As one respondent put it, it was hard to pick one because \"they all mean the same thing.\" Another three participants said this was especial ly true of options 1, 2 and 4. Even after the change, one respondent sa w 1 and 2 as similar. Recommendations: Since these response options are not induc tively created, sponsors could consider dropping this question altogether, particularly with cha nges being made to the questions on treatment vs. prevention. HRB. 7 Were you trying to improve a ny of the following with your use of ___________________? Please say yes or no to each. ( h e r b ) (1) physical performance yes no (2) sports performance yes no (3) immune system function yes no (4) sexual performance yes no (5) mental ability or memory yes no (6) wellness or gene ral health yes no Comments: This question originally had a l ead-in question that rea d, \"Did you use ______ to improve function or performance?\" This questio n did not work well at all because function and performance are never defined, leaving them open to interpretation. This confused many people. Some said \"I guess\" or \"for cells?...of what?...of HRB.7, one person commented \"now this explains what they mean by function and performance!\" Recommendations: Dropping that original question and using only HRB.7 was more understandable to participants. Category 6, well ness or general health, was added as well and seemed to work fine. - 20 - HRB.9 Did you use _________________ for a health problem or condition? (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO HRB.15 ) Comments: This line of questioning was initially separated into two paths, one asking about use for prevention, the other use for treatment. However, this proved difficult for some respondents. Those with a CAM identity sometimes had a ho listic approach that makes it difficult to disentangle prevention from treatme nt. One person said it's impo ssible to prevent some things, and you can't treat the flu with just herbs. Plus , many factors play a role in health, such as genetics and behavior (apart from taking herbs). She uses green tea \"for a healthier life, not for a specific problem.\" The follow-up questions were especially problema tic for people who were not thinking of a specific condition they are trying to prevent, but rather are trying to stay healthy in general - a problem more likely experienced by those with a CAM identity. If this was the case, they tended (after considerable thought) to answer yes to \"did you use _____ to PREVENT a health problem or condition?\" This could be viewed as res ponse error because prevention is not really the reason they take the herb in que stion - they take it to maintain health. While prevent and maintain could be defined as conceptually similar, they are in fact quite different. The focus of each is the inverse of the other: prevention focu ses on a disease; maintenance focuses on health. In addition, when questions started asking about how helpful the herb was in preventing that condition, respondents had a difficult time answeri ng because they ostensibly didn't know. In that regard, the treatment questions worked better if people said yes to the initial question \"did you use __________ to TREAT a health problem or condition.\" However, even then, respondents often used multiple remedies and ha d no way of knowing which one did the trick. Caution should be used in asking respondents to assess causality, because this is frequently information they don't have. Recommendations: This question should include the reasons of maintain health, prevent a condition or treat a condition in a yes/no format for each. Then follow-up questions should be administered appropriately, depend ing on the respondent's answers. HRB.10 For what specific health problem or conditions did you use ______________________ ? (herb) - 21 - Comments: Not extensively tested, but no immediate problems detected. Recommendations: None. [if more than 1 condition, ask HRB.11; else If only 1 condition go to HRB.12] HRB.11 For which ONE of these health problems or conditions did you use __________________________ the most? (herb) __________________________ [CONDITION] Comments: Not tested. Recommendations: None. HRB.12 How much do you think the use of _____________________ helped your _______________? (herb) Would you say a great deal, some, onl y a little, or not at all? Comments: This form not tested. (When this question was for prevention only, it did not work well - if there was no specific condition, it was hard for the interviewer to fill in the (condition) blank, and causality was difficult for the respondent to assess.) Recommendations: Only ask this type of quest ion when the respondent is treating a specific condition, not when they are using the supplemen t for general health maintenance or for the prevention of disease. In the latter s ituation, causality is impossible to know. HRB.13 Besides using ____________________, (herb) did you also receive conventi onal medical treatment for _____________________? (condition) (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO HRB.15 ) Comments: Not extensively tested, but no immediate problems detected. (One person interpreted conventiona l medical treatment as receivi ng a prescription from a doctor.) Recommendations: None. - 22 - HRB.14 Did you receive this conventional medica l treatment before, at the same time, or after you began using _______________________? (herb) Comments: Not extensively tested, but no immediate problems detected. Recommendations: None. HRB.15 Did you use _________________ because it was suggested or recommended? (herb) (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO HRB.17 ) Comments: This was tested on only seven subj ects, but some interpretation problems were evident. While one person thought of family members and another thought of a doctor, two read about the product on the store shelves and wondere d if that counted as a recommendation. They both ultimately decided that it didn't count, but the potential for confusion is clearly present. Recommendations: Since \"suggested or recommended\" is open to interpretation, consider shortening the list in HRB.16 and combining it w ith HRB.15 into a yes/no format similar to HRB.7. HRB.16 Who made the suggestion or recommendation that you use _____________? (herb) (1) Medical doctor (2) Other conventional health care provider (3) Alternative therapies provider (4) Family member or friend (5) Worker at health foods store (6) Heard about in media (7) Heard about on Internet Comments: See HRB.15.

Recommendations: None. VITAMINS The next questions are about any vi tamins and minerals you may take. SHOW HAND CARD VIT #1 (VITAMIN LIST) VIT.1 Have you EVER used vitamins or minerals for your own health? (1) Yes (2) No (next modality ) Comments: This section did not suffer from the id entity issue to the same extent as the herb section; nor was it plagued by pr oblems of definition. There exists more agreed-upon notions of what a vitamin is when compared to herbal supplements, and vitamins are seen as more mainstream in general. Recommendations: None. VIT.2 How old were you when you began using vi tamin and mineral supplements for your own health? Under 18 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65 or older - 25 - Comments: Recall was a minor problem, especial ly when respondents were offered the choice of categories. However, judging what \"when yo u began using vitamins\" means was problematic and inconsistent among participants. The main source of confusion was whether or not to include childhood. Some people did, others didn't. Thos e who didn't include childhood interpreted the question to mean wh en they first made the decision as an adult, when they first started taking vitamins regularly, or when they first took a vitamin for a specific purpose (one respondent remembers taking them for a cold; another for improved sports performance). Recommendations: We recommend a remedy here similar to the one suggested for herbs. Because multiple interpretations create data that are not comparable, the underlying construct should be made clearer to respondents. For exampl e, if \"first time ever\" is the intended meaning, then the question could be: \"How old were you the very firs t time you took a vitamin or mineral supplement for your own health?\" VIT.3 During the last 12 months, have you used vitamins or minerals for your own health? (1) Yes (2) No (next modality ) Comments: The first version of this question ended with \"for your own health or treatment.\" This was problematic in the first round because the conjunction \"or\" conveys the idea to some participants that they must choos e one or the other - health or tr eatment. We deleted the word treatment. In the second round we detected at least one su bject with response error. She answered \"no\" even though she occasionally takes a multi-vitamin. She did not include this because she felt the question required that she be on a daily or week ly regimen of vitamin use. Because she often forgets to take her vitamin, she said no. Recommendations: In the herb question, the word \"used\" was potentially problematic to the extent that it communicates a consistent patter n of use, hence linking th e user to a specific identity. A similar problem may exist here, not so much for self-identity as for implying regularity of use. Consequently, we recommend wording that is si milar to its herb al counterpart: \"During the last 12 months have you taken any vitamins or minerals for your own health?\" The phrase \"taken any\" may help to convey the me ssage that the ingestion of any vitamin for any reason should be included in th e respondent's answer - in other words that use need not be consistent or regular. - 26 - VIT.4 On average, how much do you spend on vitamins and minerals per month? Nothing Under $30 $30-75 $76-125 $126-200 Over $200 Comments: Problems emerged here that are simila r to those observed in the herb section. This question is particularly difficu lt if respondents take vitamins irregularly (vs. consistently everyday), if they buy different vitamins (rather than the same set every time), if they buy from different places, or if they also take herbs (b ecause they cannot separate the cost of each). As a result, participants admitted to providing ve ry rough - as one person put it \"ballpark figure\" - estimates. One respondent said she literally couldn't remember what a bottle of multi-vitamins costs. Others changed their answers as th ey thought about it (\"none really...maybe $20\"). Recommendations: Part of the pr oblem with this question, as with the herb question, is that it asks people to calculate an average of what they typically use. This is very difficult for reasons discussed above. It may be easier for respondents to estimate what they've spent on vitamins and minerals in the past 30 days. This is more concrete information that is somewhat fresher in memory. Try changing the question to: \"How much did you spend on vitamins a nd minerals in the last 30 days?\" VIT.5 During the past 30 days did you use any of the following vitamins and minerals for your own health? If you take a mu lti-vitamin or mineral, include it as one supplement. If you take a SINGLE vitamin or mineral that is NOT part of a combination multi-vitamin, please include it separately. Comments: The original wording to this question was excessively verbose, causing a tremendous amount of confusion. It read, \"Durin g the past 30 days did you use any of the following vitamins and minerals for your own hea lth or treatment? Be sure to include ALL vitamins that you use. If you take a SINGLE vitami n or mineral supplement, such as niacin, that is not part of a combination multi-vitamin/mineral supplement, include it separately.\" Three respondents who were heavy users simply could not answer the question because they didn't know how it was asking them to formulate their answer. The following passage is a good example. \"So how do they want me to characterize this? I've taken them all, but not separately.\" [Interviewer question.] \"Include it separately...what what he thi nks they're asking.] \"They want to know if I've used these, and the answer is yes. How do they want me to split it up? I don't know.\" - 27 - Respondents who took only one vitamin had less tr ouble with the question, because they didn't have to worry about how to report the different supplements they take. To help clarify, the question was shortened. In addition to the length bei ng excessive, the question is po sed as a yes/no question, yet is actually asking for a list of vitamins they take. Recommendations: We suggest ch anging this to match the yes/no format, much like that of the herb question. \"During the past 30 days did you take any of the vitamins and minerals listed on this card?\" \"[IF YES] Please tell me which items on th is list you took. If you take a multi-vitamin or mineral, include it as one supplement. If you take a SINGLE vitamin or mineral that is NOT part of a combination multi-vitamin, please include it separately.\" Further testing would be benefi cial to determine whether respondents are confused about the form of the vitamin (pill, liquid, powder, even vitamins added to food, e.g., calcium added to orange juice). SHOW HAND CARD VIT#2 (VITAMIN REASONS) VIT.6 If you had to pick only one, whic h of these is the MAIN reason you used _____________________? Vitamin/mineral (1) It's good for me (2) to get all needed vitamins and minerals (3) because I don't eat right (4) to have a dietary insurance policy (5) to stay healthy (6) to have more energy (7) to feel or look better (8) prescription or over the count er drugs are too expensive Comments: The beginning clause was initially abse nt from this question. However, the word MAIN alone did not communicate the idea that respondents were to pick just one reason. Adding \"if you had to pick only one\" seemed to fix this problem. Another problem was with the response options. As one respondent put it, many of the options \"blend together\" so it's difficult to choose one. Another said that the first and second choice \"almost mean the same thing.\" - 28 - Recommendations: Since these response options are not induc tively created, sponsors could consider dropping this question altogether, particularly with cha nges being made to the questions on treatment vs. prevention. VIT. 7 Were you trying to improve a ny of the following with your use of ___________________? Please say yes or no to each. (vitamin/mineral) (1) physical performance yes no (2) sports performance yes no (3) immune system function yes no (4) sexual performance yes no (5) mental ability or memory yes no (6) wellness or genera l health yes no Comments: This originally had a lead-in question similar to the herb section that read, \"Did you use ______ to improve function or performance?\" Th is question did not work well at all because function and performance are never defined and are open to interpreta tion. This diminishes the validity of the data. Recommendations: Dropping that original question and using only VIT.7 was more understandable to participants. Category 6, well ness or general health, was added as well and seemed to work fine. VIT.9 Did you use _________________ for a health problem or condition? (vitamin/mineral) (1) Yes (next question) (2) No (GO TO VIT.15 ) Comments: Like the herb secti on, this line of questioning was init ially separated into two paths, one asking about use for prevention, the other use for treatment. However, this proved difficult for some respondents. Two of the first 10 respondents had difficulty with the prevention question (three skipped out and there was no time to probe for the others). One respondent takes calcium and had to think about whether or not it prevents a condition. This respondent has a CAM identity and, therefore, doesn't have a problem-oriented appr oach to health. Rather, he takes calcium to maintain his health. After some self-debate, he changed his answer from no to yes after reasoning that calcium must in fact prevent some specific condition. Note that his final answer of \"yes\" represents response error, because he, himself, does not take calcium to prevent a health problem or condition. His answer means, yes, calcium (in general) does prevent a health problem or condition. Another respondent had diffi culty for similar reasons - he takes vitamins for energy, not for a specific problem and ha d to think through what the question meant. The follow-up questions were especially problem atic for people (some of whom had a CAM identity) who were not thinking of a specific cond ition they are trying to prevent, but rather are - 29 - trying to stay healthy in general. One person vi ewed the treatment question as repetitive because it's not a health problem that he's preventing or treating - it's an enhancement of health. In response to these early problems, the concept of prevent and treat were dropped from the language, and \"use\" was inserted instead. We were hoping to convey the idea that any use of this vitamin for a health problem or condition should be included. However, this wording created even more problems because it shifted the focus of the question to a health problem or condition. This was difficult for one respondent because she said it sounded like this was a problem or condition she already had. However, she took vitamin C \"not in original starting use\" for a cold. She takes it more for prevention or to perhaps reduce th e severity of a cold, should she get one. But after thinking about it, sh e said yes because she was using it to prevent a cold. Another respondent struggled with the question because he wasn't sure if the reason he took vitamins counted as a health problem or cond ition. He suffers from what he called chronic fatigue, but that the question sounded like it meant \"a bad illness.\" He ultimately decided fatigue did count because it was chronic and becau se doctors have not diagnosed its cause. Recommendations: This question should include the reasons of maintain health, prevent a condition or treat a condition in a yes/no format for each. Then follow-up questions should be administered appropriately, depend ing on the respondent's answers. VIT.10 For what specific health probl em or conditions did you use ___________________ ? Comments: Not tested. Recommendations: None. [if more than 1 condition, ask VIT.11; el se if only 1 condition go to VIT.12] VIT.11 For which ONE of these health problems or conditions did you use ____________________________ the most? (vitamin/mineral) ______________________________ [CONDITION] Comments: Not tested. Recommendations: None. - 30 - VIT.12 How much do you think the use of _____________________ helped your _______________? (vitamin/mineral) (condition) Would you say a great deal, some, only a little, or not at all? Comments: Similar to the herb section, this question asks respondents something they don't know. As one respondent replied, \"that's difficult to answer...I honestly don't know.\" She hasn't had a cold in a long time, but she doesn't know if she would have contracted one without taking vitamin C. She just keeps taking it in case it is helping. Another re spondent said he still has symptoms, just maybe not as many while taking vitamins. He thinks they help sometimes, but he doesn't know how much. Recommendations: Suggest only asking this question for treatm ent reasons, not prevention- based reasons. VIT.13 Besides using ____________________, (vitamin/mineral) did you also receive conventi onal medical treatment for _____________________? (condition) (1) Yes (next question) (2) No ( GO TO VIT.15 ) Comments: We didn't have time to adequately test this, but for at least two respondents this was an odd question. One participant was taking iron upon her doctor's recommendation and another person was taking calcium after menopause (also upon the advise of her doct or). Both of these therapies already seem like conventional medi cal treatment, which caused them to wonder exactly what conventional medical treatment is. Recommendations: Since vitamin use is not tied to a CAM identity the same way herb use is, and because using vitamins is common enough to be considered \"conventional\" by most people's standards, consid er dropping this question. VIT.14 Did you receive this conventional medica l treatment before, at the same time, or after you began using __________________?

Recommendations: Sponsors may want to consider changing this question to match the vitamin and herb format.

(1) Yes ( GO TO COU.2) (2) No ( GO TO NEXT SECTION - PERCEPTIONS ) Comment: Due to time constraints, we could not probe four respondents. Most others didn't seem to have trouble with the question. Howe ver, several respondents gave answers that are suggestive of problems. The first relates to the st ructure of the sentence. For one participant, the word \"or\" caused him to interpret the question as a list of items from which he had to choose. He did not understand it as a yes/no question. Another respondent had difficulty discerning what \"pastoral counseling\" meant. In one sense it could mean wanting to \"hear the word\" from a pastor, and in another it could mean asking a pa stor to pray for you when you're sick. He decided it must mean the latter because this wa s a health survey. A third respondent focused on the phrase \"group support\" and said no. This was response error because upon probing it was discovered that he regularly sees a psychiatrist. Recommendation: Further testi ng is needed, but perhaps simp lifying the question would help: \"Have you EVER used individu al counseling, group counseling or pastoral counseling?\" COU.2 Which of these was the reason you used counseling? To help with mental health issues such as anxiety or depression OR to treat a speci fic physical health problem such as cancer or heart disease? (1) Mental health issues ( GO TO NEXT SECTION - PERCEPTIONS ) (2) Specific health problem (GO TO COU.3 ) (3) Both ( GO TO COU.3 ) (4) Neither ( GO TO NEXT SECTION - PERCEPTIONS ) Comment: Early on it became apparent that a \"neither\" category was necessary (it was originally absent from the c hoices). One respondent said she didn't know how to answer because she went to Catholic school and to her, confession was very much like counseling. Once \"neither\" was offered as a category, another resp ondent chose it because her visits are to a holistic health counselor. During these visits they discuss how to balance spiritual and physical health in general. One respondent demonstrated false positive response error with his answer of #2, \"specific health problem.\" This respondent is a TANF r ecipient and speaks of his case worker as his counselor. During their discussi ons, his case worker helps with all of life's difficulties and makes sure he's staying healthy - that he 's able to buy food and get his medicines. - 56 - Recommendation: More testing would be needed , but preliminary data suggest that respondents don't understand what is meant by \"specific health problems\" and that various interpretations exist for \"counseling.\" [NEW] COU.3 How old where you when you firs t saw a practitioner for counseling? ________________ [AGE IN YEARS] Comment: Not extensively tested.

PER. 1 Do you think there is scientific evid ence showing that SOME alternative therapies do the following? Please say yes or no to each. (1) Improve overall health and wellness yes no (2) Prevent illnesses or diseases yes no (3) Reduce pain yes no (4) Treat or cure illne sses or diseases yes no Comments: The length of this question could not be processed by many respondents. Eight of the participants lost sight of the root questi on. This problem was compounded when respondents lacked experience with alternative medici ne. Those who had trouble understanding the question's intent drew upon their own experience to help them impart meaning. This created several different interpretations. Five respondents interpreted th e question as asking whether or not they believe alternative therapies work in general. People answered \"y es\" when either they or someone they knew successfully used alterna tive therapies for a health problem. Two other participants thought the question was asking if they thought conventiona l medicine worked. These were respondents who had little-to-no experience w ith alternative therapies, and didn't have a clear understanding of the meaning of the phrase. In these cases , respondents were referr ing to prescription medication they had taken for a medical prob lem. Another person thought the question was asking \"does science do these things \" (i.e., prevent or cure illness or reduce pain). He answered \"yes\" because science had cured the mumps and polio. It is important to note that re spondents did have an understandi ng of what \"scientific evidence\" meant. However, because the question was long and convoluted, AND because scientific evidence was not the criteria responden ts use to judge the abilities of various therapies, they used their own experience to give meaning to the question. Recommendations: Do not ask th is question of people who are not using CAM. It in no way relates to their experience, so th ey struggle with interpretation, usually arriving at an unintended one. For CAM users, define \"alternative therapies\" mo re explicitly in the introduction to the section, and simplify it into one question. \"Finally, I'd like to as k you some general questions about alternative therapies. These are therapies like the ones mentioned in the previous questions. Acupuncture, naturopathy, massage, yoga and meditation are a few examples of what I mean.\" - 61 - PER.1: \"Do you think there is sc ientific evidence showing that some alternative therapies do what they claim to do?\" PER. 2 Please say whether you agree or disagree with the fo llowing statements: (1) The use of SOME alternativ e therapies for healing and wellness since ancient times provides the necessary support to justif y the use of these therapies Comments: That this question had to be read to most respondents more than once is evidence that it demanded a high level of cognitive ski ll to comprehend. One person even exclaimed \"that's a very complex sentence!\" After heari ng the question for the third time, she asked \"what therapies?\" In fact, two people couldn't ev en guess what the question was asking and, consequently, gave no answer. Others were able to give the statement meani ng, just not the meaning intended by the designer. For example, one respondent guessed that the question was asking \"whether you believe that there are forms of treatment other than medical th at work.\" Another respondent said he thought it was asking whether he thought that \"medicine uses things like herbs to make prescription drugs.\" Others said the question meant that \"a lternative therapies have been proven\" or that \"you are getting the care that you ne ed.\" In other words, interpre tations were scattered and often very different as responde nts struggled to give meaning to this statement. A few participants did seem to grasp the intent of the question, yet stil l demonstrated response problems. One person couldn't answer at all, claiming that \"just because people use something doesn't make it right - some alternative therap ies work and some don't.\" She could not place every CAM therapy into the same category. Anot her respondent said \"I could put agree, but there are a lot of other things taking place at this point in time...what about modern technology that supports the ancient?\" Given his beliefs, an answer of disagree would have been the appropriate response, yet he chose to answer \"agree.\" Recommendations: This sentence should be grea tly simplified. The following is one suggestion: \"Alternative therapies are proven useful because they have been around since ancient times.\" (2) On the whole, alternativ e therapies are safer than conventional medical treatment Comments: Most respondents had an easier time assigning meaning to this question than they did to the previous one; however, answers still lack any validity. Six participants had a difficult time arriving at an answer because the question was too hypothetical. Initial reactions included \"I'm not sure\" or \"that's a tough one.\" One pe rson argued \"some of these therapies can cause harm, especially when you don't know what you're doing,\" another said it depends on which ones. Some are \"far fetched, for example magne ts are a sham\" and still another person reasoned, \"different things work for different people.\" - 62 - These interpretations meant that four participants could not provide answers. For those that did manage to supply an answer, meaning is varied. Specifically, an answer of \"disagree\" meant different things to different people. For some disagree meant that the sentence was untrue - that is, CAM is not safer. Yet, there was no valid ity among these answers because by extension some people meant that medical treatment was safer (\"why try something new when you don't know what results you'll get?\"), and others meant th at both are equally safe (\"anything you can use too much of\"). For other respondents, \"disagree\" meant that the premise of the statement was faulty. In this case, \"disagree\" meant that one cannot draw a general conclusion about safety. As one respondent argued, \"That's too broad - both are dangerous and not dangerous.\" She couldn't say \"agree\" because she did not be lieve CAM was safer; she wouldn't answer \"disagree\" either because she didn't believe that conventional medicine was safer - which is what she thought an answer of disagree implied. To summarize, for some people \"disagree\" mean t that the opposite of what the sentence suggested is true. For others, di sagree meant that the sentence itself is faulty and, therefore, cannot be agreed with (i.e., because CAM and conventional medicine are used in different situations, they cannot be compared). Recommendations: Drop this question. While respondents did understa nd the intent of the question, they could not categor ically compare CAM to conventional medicine. This caused variation in the meaning of the responses. (3) Some alternative therapies can interact with prescription or over the counter drugs Comments: The biggest source of response erro r for this question was the word \"interact,\" which was assigned different meanings by respondents. For example, some people defined interact in a positive way, essentially evalua ting whether CAM and conventional medicine can compliment one another. As one person asked, \" you mean assist?\" In sum, four participants said \"agree\" because they believed the two appr oaches can be successfully used simultaneously. One respondent who had a clear CAM identity argued that the question was difficult because there were no specific examples to think of, and that the principles of CAM are different from those of conventional medicine (CAM is for \"gen eral health\" while conv Recommendations: It won't solv e the problem for CAM users w ho can't answer categorically, but, it may help to offer some specifics for the word interact: \"Some alternative therapies can negatively interact with prescription drugs.\" (4) Some alternative therapies can be recommended as a last reso rt when conventional medicine has nothing to offer Comments: Because of time constraints this question was not extensively tested. However, there are indications that this question suffers from the same problem as #2, that is, answers may - 63 - have questionable validity. For at least one re spondent, \"agree\" meant that the statement is true (\"some people will take anyt hing if medical treatment isn't working\"), not that he agrees with it. Another concern is response va riation - there was none. Give n the wording everyone agreed with the statement, even when they were not proponents of CAM. On e participant's reaction was \"I think I'd agree...I guess if you're si ck enough\", while another said \"you gotta do something to keep 'em going.\" Recommendation: Drop this question. Response va riation is likely to be very low and answers analytically meaningless. (5) In general, alternative ther apies should not be used for th e treatment of serious disease Comments: Because of time constraints this question was extensively tested. The only problem observed was for one respondent who had trouble w ith the entire section because he had no idea what alternative therapies meant. Recommendations: None. (6) For some problems, alternative therapies ar e more effective than conventional therapies Comments: Answers to this statement have que stionable validity. For example, answers of \"disagree\" given by two non-users who had no knowledge of CAM actually meant \"don't know.\" Another non-user answered agree, with the caveat that \"I wouldn't say all witchcraft practices work.\" Questions of her definition of CAM aside, her opinion actually depends on the circumstances. In the interview she went on to say that sometimes CAM therapies are more effective, while other times they're not. In essence, sometime she would agree and sometimes she would disagree. Another person with a simi lar perspective answered agree and proclaimed, \"you can't say alternative therapies won't work.\" For her, to disagree would mean that conventional therapies are more effective, impl ying that CAM therapies don't work. Her answer of \"agree\" basically means she is NOT choosing disagree. Another person had a difficult time answering because he doesn't always see the two approaches as separate. In some cases the medical professi on is taking part of an alternative practice and \"mixing it\" with conventional treatment. He believes that sometimes this works well and sometimes it doesn't. This res pondent, then, is disagreeing wi th the premise of the question. Recommendations: Respondents need more speci fic information for th is question to be meaningful and to yield re liable and valid answers. (7) Health claims for many type s of alternative therapies are exaggerated or unsubstantiated Comments: In this statement, respondents had different interpreta tions of \"health claims.\" At least six people equated health claims with insura nce claims. The first reaction of one participant - 64 - was \"I wasn't even aware that insurance companies would pay for alternative treatments.\" These subjects thought the question wa s asking whether the insurance cl aims are exaggerated (i.e., too expensive). One person couldn't answer because he saw two possible interpretations, one related to insurance claims and the other more closely matching the question intent . He asked, \"is this insurance or health statements by an organization?\" Recommendations: Simplify the language in this statement to something like: \"Alternative therapie s don't always do what they say they will do for your health.\" (8) In general, advertising about a lternative therapies is usually true Comments: Most respondents understood the intent of this question. However, since no one could think of a single example of CAM advertising they had seen, most said they were thinking about advertising in general. Hence, the unde rlying construct being measured is more about advertising in general than it is of CAM. Additionally, this is another in stance where the words \"in general\" present a problem. One respondent said \"agree.\" He ha d trouble with this section be cause it was too hypothetical for him. In this case, for example, he said \"maybe it is, maybe it isn't.\" When prompted for an answer, he gave \"agree\" and explicitly stated that the words \"in general\" left \"room for error\" in the sense that he isn't completely agreeing. \"In general\" suggests to him that sometimes this means he disagrees. Recommendations: Delete this question. Many of the responses are not related to the underlying construct. (9) I prefer natural reme dies to chemical drugs Comments: The primary source of confusion in this question is the word \"prefer.\" For example, one respondent wondered if prefer meant that she actually used CAM. In theory she would always prefer a natural remedy if it worked. However, there have been many times when it didn't work and she had to use a conventional re medy; so in practice sh e's used conventional remedies more often. Other part icipants indicated a similar perspective: \"I prefer whatever works best\"; \"sure I would prefer it, but they might not do the job\"; \"I guess everyone would\". For still another respondent, her preference depe nds on what she's treating and her evaluation of which approach would be most effective for that particular condition. Recommendations: Drop this question. Nearly everyone would prefer something natural to something chemical, but realize that life is more co mplicated than that, and that decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis. (10) Alternative practitioners pa y more attention to their pati ents than conventional medical doctors - 65 - Comments: This question was difficult for t hose who had no experience with CAM because they had no idea how alternative practitioners be have. For others, their answers mean various things, as they do in most other questions in this section. For example, for some participants \"disagree\" means that there is no difference betw een the two types of practitioners; it depends more on the person than on the medical approach . As one respondent maintained, \"one isn't better than the other,\" regardless of who you go to, you have to be responsible and ask the right questions. For others, \"disagree\" means that co nventional doctors pay more attention to their patients. These were respondents whose experi ence with doctors and hospitals has been good. Recommendations: Because analysts have no wa y of knowing what the answers mean, consider dropping this question. (11) Most alternative therapies give the pati ent more control over their health problems Comments: This question was not extensively test ed due to time constraints. Two people who had no knowledge of CAM, and who had difficulty with this entire section, had trouble answering this question too. Another respondent felt as though she couldn't issue a blanket statement - it depends on the illnes s. Otherwise, a few others in terpreted this as asking whether alternative therapies give the patient more \"choi ces\" in their treatment options and ability to administer their own treatment. Recommendations: None. (12) When I am ill, I try to learn all I can about my illness and the range of treatment options Comments: Respondents did not seem to struggle with interpreting this question, however, there was no response variation. Everyone agreed. Recommendations: Consider dropping this questi on, as it is highly unlikely that many people will respond with \"disagree.\" PER. 3 Would you be more inclined to use alternative therapies if people important to you recommend it? (1) Yes (2) No Comments: Due to time constraints this question was not extensively teste d. Of note is that two respondents had difficulty saying eith er yes or no. To them an important caveat was that the answer world be yes only if the people who recommended it had actually tried the therapy for themselves and it worked. Recommendations: None. - 66 - PER.4 Would you be more inclined to use alternative therapies if your medical doctor or other conventional health care provider recommends it? (1) Yes (2) No Comments: Due to time constraints th is question was not extensively tested. Recommendations: None. SHOW HAND CARD 1 (INFORMATION) PER.5 From which of the following do you ge t information on alternative therapies? [MARK ALL THAT APPLY] (1) family members (11) dentists (2) friends (12)other conventional health care provider (3) co-workers (13) Alternative providers (e.g., (4) magazines acupuncturist, chiroprac tor, herbalist, (5) newspapers massage therapist, etc.) (6) TV (14) pharmacist (7) radio (15)health food store employees (8) Internet (16)government agencies or offices (9) physicians (17)other (specify) (10) nurses Comments: Many respondents do not \"actively\" collect information on CAM, and some indicated that they do not do a \"specific search\" on these things. Instead, this information is accidentally or inadvertently happened upon by the respondent. Others do seek out information on CAM, and in this case suggested that the response op tions \"just about all apply at some point in time.\" Recommendations: This questi on is double-barreled. It assume s that the respondent does get information on CAM. However, some people are pa ssive participants in their health, and do not seek out this kink of information. Additionally, this list could probably be shortened, depending upon analytical needs. More testing is needed. [ASK PER.6 IF R HAS HEALTH INSURANCE; ELSE GO TO PER.7] PER.6 Are any alternative therapie s covered by your insurance plan? (1) Yes (2) No - 67 - Comments: The only respondents who knew this in formation were those who have checked into it and have received payment for their use of CAM. Recommendations: Drop this question. This information can be obtained, and is more reliable, in the other modality sections (see, for example, PRT.14a). PER. 7 Have you ever used alternative ther apies because conventional medical treatments were too expensive? (1) Yes (2) No Comments: Due to time constraints, this question was not extensively teste d. Of the participants who answered, all but one answered no. Moreover, an answer of \"no\" for three respondents meant that they never felt the need to seek out alternative treatment. Conventional medicine to this point has worked satisfactorily. Note that these answers are NOT based on the expense of medical treatments, but rather on their effectiveness . In fact, one respondent even acknowledged that \"money is never the issue\" when it comes to health. If she couldn't afford something that needed to be done, she would find a way to pay for it. Another respondent who grappled with the defi nition of alternative treatments had a very difficult time answering this que stion. In her own words: \"What would that include? What exactly is alternative treatment? I guess 'no' because diet pills wouldn't be alternative therapy...does pre-nata l vitamins count?\" Recommendations: More testing is recommende d; it appears as though the underlying construct is not being measured. - 68 - Appendix A: Initial Questions Complimentary and Alternative Medicine Supplement NHIS Thank you for agreeing to meet here today.
