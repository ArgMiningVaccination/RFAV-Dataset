Disease prevention is an integral and important part of human health. The focus and practice of disease prevention is different from medical intervention for the treatment of an illness after clinical diagnosis. Preventive medicine is mainly targeting healthy populations, with goals to encourage healthy lifestyles through public education, vaccination programs, and early recognition of illness. The vaccination approach works to boost human immunity in family and public health settings. Vaccinations or immunization are proven effective and efficient in preventing some major human illnesses including communicable and non-communicable diseases such as viral hepatitis, cancers, and some major degenerative human diseases like major dementias in Alzheimer's Disease and atherosclerosis in cardiovascular diseases(1-2). Vaccinations can strengthen the human body's natural immunity to a disease which may prevent disease onset, but also, and perhaps more importantly, it may prevent spreading the disease in communities. Over the past century, since the first vaccine for smallpox was discovered and applied in disease prevention, smallpox, which used to be a deadly illness and killed 300 million to 500 million people around the world in the last century, has been virtually erased. Currently, more than 20 life-threatening diseases can be prevented by immunization (3). This was a remarkable achievement and success story in the global health fight against contagious, dangerous, and deadly diseases. It represented the first proof-of-principle that immunization by vaccination would work. Since then, we have witnessed significant progress in vaccine developments for many major human diseases including measles, polio, mumps, chicken pox, whooping cough, diphtheria, and HPV, etc. The purpose of this white paper is to provide a brief description of human immunities that vaccines could potentially manipulate for preventive or therapeutic purposes. In addition, we offer some thoughts on the challenges that vaccine study design and execution presents. Vaccine Type and Categorization Vaccines are immunological agents which are further classified as immune stimulants. Traditionally, there are 2 main types including live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines (4)(Table 1): In recent years, intensive research on human immunology has led to mechanistic insights for activation of human B and T lymphocytes in responding to antigenic challenges from environmental origins and other degenerative changes in human tissue and organ systems in aging and disease. This, in return, allowed for the development of newer types of vaccines, which include nucleotide-based (DNA/mRNA) vaccine, and recombinant vector vaccines (platform-based vaccines)(4-5). The immunization by vaccination approach leads to active immunity which stimulates the human immune system to produce antigen-specific humoral (antibody) and cellular or cell-mediated immunity. Active immunity relies on functional memory T cells in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs which are of lower activation threshold upon re-challenging by the same pathogen, and for this reason, active immunity usually lasts for many years, often for a lifetime. Immunity can also be transferred through passive actions such as through blood or blood products such as human immune globulins. Unlike active immunity, passive immunity offers only temporary protection. Clinically, vaccines can be also categorized as preventive or therapeutic vaccines or both. The preventive vaccine is prophylactic when the natural history of a human disorder is well-known, such as the Hepatitis B vaccine in the prevention of liver cancer. However, some vaccines are designed for dual purposes, preventive and therapeutic such as human HPV vaccine is used for such a clinical setting that it can offer protection against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection through cell-mediated immunity of cytotoxic T cells and humoral immune response preventing pathogenesis of cervical cancer which HPV infection is causative (6-7). The characteristics of the live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines are also different in terms of mechanisms and actions which have practical implications relevant to their clinical use (8-9) (Table 2). Furthermore, there are therapeutic vaccines which are cell-based for treating cancer. There are two main types of such therapeutic vaccines: autologous vaccines and allogenic vaccines. Autologous cancer vaccines are a personalized vaccine which is made from cells from the same individual. On the other hand, the allogenic cancer vaccines are made from cells of non-self which are cultured in a laboratory environment (10). Human immune systems and response to vaccinations 1. Innate and adaptive immune system and constituents Biologically, human immune systems consist of innate and adaptive immunity (Table 3). The innate immunity is primitive and attributable largely to the cell-mediated functionality from interaction of antigen presenting cells (macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells (DC)), as well neutrophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. The cell network of the innate immune system is to recognize and react to invading pathogens via the cell surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The PRRs are relatively non-specific but their evolutionary advantage is that they are capable of detecting a wide range of potential pathogens. As a result, the foreign antigens are processed and presented to T cells through T cell receptor (TCR) complex in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on macrophages and DCs. This causes the release of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to the downstream activation of naive T cells of the adaptive arm of the immune response (11-12). The adaptive immunities, including the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses generate functional and activated immune cells and antigen-specific antibodies and cytokines which are aided by interactions of lymphoid cells i.e. activated DCs, T helper cells and B lymphocyte via B cell receptors. The adaptive immunity is influenced and controlled by the innate immunity through memory cells and other cellular functions of the innate immunity (Fig. 1)(13). The antibody binds to foreign antigens and renders them better targets for cytotoxic T cell to be eliminated by cell lysis, or for them to be engulfed and degraded by macrophages or monocytes. Other cell components of the adaptive immunity also include memory and regulatory T cells. The T cells secrete many cytokines during the lymphocyte activation. These cytokines which could serve as surrogate biological markers for the adaptive immunity, the same as the end products of B cell activation which are the antibodies generated during the process. Therefore, innate immunity is cell-mediated and adaptive immunity is largely a humoral biological reactions i.e. antisera-mediated immune response. Nonetheless, the immune responses from lymphocyte activation for disease prevention and protection is coordinated through the cell-mediated and humoral immunity, which could be fundamental towards understanding of vaccine immunology and future success of vaccine clinical developments (8). The human vaccines for therapeutic purposes, such as their use in cancer treatment are likely based on cell-mediated immunity involving phagocytic cells and T lymphocytes inducing apoptosis, while the other types of vaccines mostly elicit humoral immune responses for disease prevention involving both concerted actions of the cell-mediated and adaptive immunity. 2. How we determine the cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity? Both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity can only be ascertained by clinical laboratory methods. There are many sophisticated assays which can be utilized. For instance, in case of immunogenicity by cell-mediated immunity, flow cytometry is used to determine activation markers on the cell surface such as T cell activation markers of CD25 (i.e. IL-2 receptor) and CD71 (i.e. transferrin CD154 or CD40L, CD80, CD86, CD44, CD69, assay such as Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for measuring antibody titer in plasma or serum, or alternatively, cell-based functional assays such as a cell-lysed assay can be used (8, 14-16). However, it should be noted that the invitro assays for cell-mediated and humoral immune response are generally considered surrogate biomarkers, and not for outcome determinations. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the laboratory data for safety and efficacy in the setting of clinical vaccine trials. Design challenges in vaccine clinical trials The clinical developments for vaccines face unique challenges compared to other therapeutic agents for immunomodulation, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. There are many variations which need to be considered in the target disease and the recipient population for the vaccine study. These include the randomization schemes, comparators, the endpoint measurement for outcome determination, as well as biosafety considerations, to name just a few. The fundamental difference between the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents are that vaccinations must actively engage and manipulate the immune system to modulate human physiology for building up specific cell-mediated and humoral or antibody-mediated immunity. This may disturb homeostasis in recipients causing some vaccine-related adverse events such as autoimmune diseases (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis)(17). The host immune status against the antigenic determinants and the adjuvants used for vaccinations are among the potential biosafety concerns or factors for vaccine development. Accordingly, clinical study designs for vaccines could serve as a risk identification and mitigation process which requires thorough understanding of lymphocyte activation in vaccine immunology and careful planning in pre-clinical and clinical stages of the investigational medicinal product for further development (18-22). The endpoints of clinical vaccine trials should be suitable for the proposed indication of use of the vaccine in prevention and/or treatment. Sometimes, the observation period for a vaccine can be long. Under such circumstance, other approaches for outcome determination alone or in combinations can be employed, such as measurements of surrogate biomarkers for longitudinal immunologic surveillance and long-term follow-ups with the volunteers for clinical outcomes. Vaccine registration Vaccines require registration with regulatory authorities before marketing, i.e. EMA in Europe and the FDA in the US, with data collected from well-planned clinical studies that demonstrate their safety and efficacy. The vaccine clinical program is divided into phases in a manner of orderly transitions, each predicated on the satisfactory results of the previous one: Phase 1 usually involves 20-100 volunteers for safety, and examines dose range and intervals in dose administration; Phase 2 typically enrolls several hundred healthy subjects for observation of short-term side effects and preliminary effectiveness; Phase 3 expands the scale of the phase 2 trial study with the same design by recruiting typically several hundred to several thousand of subjects to determine efficacy of the vaccine compared to suitable controls as valid comparators. The efficacy of a vaccine is the reduction of incidence of a targeted disease in comparison to the comparator. Alternatively, the vaccine clinical study may include a human challenge design that may expedite the development. However, the human challenge studies are not commonly utilized, and the ethical discussions of such design are ongoing (23-26). Vaccine safety is continuously monitored after approval during the large-scale distribution of immunizations applied in healthy subjects for disease prevention. Multiple established mechanisms for surveillance and monitoring adverse events from vaccinations are operational. For example, in the US, the CDC has the following systems: a) the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which collects and analyzes reports of adverse events occurring after vaccination; and b) the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and c) the Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) system. The VSD can analyze healthcare information from over 24 million people, and PRISM can analyze healthcare information from over 190 million people. In addition, there is also a Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project (CISA). CISA conducts clinical research studies to better understand vaccine safety and identify prevention strategies for adverse events following immunization (27-28). Conclusion Different vaccines are of immunogenicity from their unique biological features. They are manipulated in vitro to induce in vivo immune responses for prophylactic and therapeutic use by vaccination. Effector functions of prophylactic vaccines rely on coordination between cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Current therapeutic vaccines for immune-oncology applications are on multiple platforms and their study designs should be appropriate with potential indications for use in clinical developmental considering the efficacy vs. their risk profiles.
