She is a resolute and kind woman of greathumor, never far from a mischievous twinkle. She is also along-time friend of Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. Last year,she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and her medicalchallenges have motivated her to do some very interest-ing, and beneficial, healing work. Living with cancer,and growing from the experience, is such an importantissue in our society, and we are grateful to Molly for herwillingness to talk about her own growth and healing.The interviewer is Molly's good friend, Jonathan Ellis, aFlorida-based spiritual director with strong ties to AnnArbor, and to Crazy Wisdom.) Jonathan Ellis: When I was a child, a relative gave me a very old camera. It was so old that it took me a while tofind the right size film for it, but when I did, I spent thewhole next week looking for things to take pictures of. Ican remember how excited I was when the pictures cameback and I got to see something I actually photographed. Imounted the photographs in an album and was so excitedby the process and the result. Tell me about your interestin photography and how it developed. Molly Reno: My interest in photography took off last year when I attended a Healing Retreat in Maineentitled Photography as Meditation. The premise of theretreat was that taking a good photograph requires beingpresent to what is in front of you \u2014 thus photography as a form of mindfulness meditation. One of the course leaders was Elizabeth Opalenik, a professional photographer.Elizabeth believes that every photograph is a self-portrait,that every photograph reveals the photographer. Jonathan Ellis: Tell me about the photography aspects of the Healing Retreat. Molly Reno : Photography was used as the primary form of expression at the retreat. Each day we were givendigital cameras and a photography assignment. The firstday's assignment was 'Using nature as a metaphor, take apicture of yourself as you are now and another picture ofyourself as you would like to be.\" So we were asked tophotograph an aspect of nature that illustrated a character-istic of our current lives which we found problematic. The retreat center is located in the woods and on the ocean so there were many beautiful areas to walk incontemplation and take pictures of nature. I was feelingburdened by too many work commitments and I photo-graphed a rock formation which had a tree growing aroundand leaning on it to express my sense of being weighted down by commit-ments. Each day, the photographswere printed. We met as a group andused the photos as a springboard todiscuss our lives, changes we wantedto make and ways to bring aboutthose changes. It was an innovativeway to get to know each other and toengage in deep personal learning. Jonathan Ellis: What were some of the other photographyassignments? Molly Reno : One exercise was to photograph both 'the death ofbeauty' and 'beauty in death'. Wewalked to a bog where there weredead trees, decay and new life. Peopletook some amazing pictures. In ourdiscussion afterwards we discussed the cycle of life, ourimages of death and our feelings about our own death. Another day, we examined the shadow side of ourselves using the Jungian concept of shadow andcontrasted it with our higher selves. Two of the co-leaderswere professional photographers, and they posed eachindividual so as to show her shadow side and then took asecond photograph of each person's higher self. We weregiven copies of these photos with a recommendation thatwe look at them each day to remind ourselves that with intention we can choosewhich aspect of self we wantto operate from. Jonathan Ellis: The Healing Retreat you went towas offered particularly forwomen with cancer? Molly Reno : Yes. The Healing Retreats are offeredto women with cancer orother life threatening illness.Doctors, nurses and othercaregivers can also attendthe retreats to replenishthemselves. Jonathan Ellis: Molly, when were you diagnosedwith cancer? Molly Reno : I was diagnosed with breastcancer in December 2003. Jonathan: Those who encounter cancer often gothrough a number of stagesfrom the first suspicions todiagnosis to treatment,hopefully, to cure orremission. What was it likefor you? What were thestages of your experience? Molly: I had what I thought was a routine call back on a mammogram. I wassomewhat annoyed because I had been called back 4months earlier and had a biopsy for what turned out to becalcification. I assumed I was stuck on the medicaltreadmill and more of my time would be sucked up overnothing. I was totally blown away when the surgeon toldme it was breast cancer. I have been a vegetarian for manyyears, I exercise, I meditate, do yoga. I did not considermyself a candidate for breast cancer. Jonathan: As you began to deal with the shock of it, what helped you, I suppose first, with the acceptanceof it? The reality of it? Molly: My first thought was to get on the phone and call my brothers and sisters and close friends. As Itried to decide whom to call first, I experienced a moment ofgrace. I realized that rather than stepping into action, Ineeded to just sit with the news that I had cancer and try tolet it sink in. I needed to ponder what it would mean to meto undergo treatment over the next few months before Iexternalized my experience in conversation with others. My partner, Susan, and I lit a fire and sat down in front of the hearth with our best bottle of wine, fruit, somebread and cheese. As we tried to absorb the breast cancer diagnosis, it came to me that there were many things in mylife that I still had to be grateful for starting with having apartner like Susan with whom to face this challenge. We began to name all of the things in our lives that we were grateful for, realizing that these things wouldstill be present despite my cancer diagnosis. I consider it amoment of grace to have focused on things we weregrateful for in order to create an overall context in which toapproach the news of cancer and the upcoming treatments. The other thing you have to do when you get diagnosed with cancer is to become an 'expert' on availabletreatments so you can make your own treatment decisions.So first you are hit with this stunning news and then youare galvanized into action in order to understand what isbeing recommended and to be able to make wise decisions. My first surgeon made a treatment decision to do a lumpectomy instead of a biopsy without discussing itwith me. I thought I was having a biopsy and only foundout later that he did a lumpectomy. That was a wake up callfor me to do my own research and to take charge of mytreatment decisions. Needless to say I got a new surgeon. Jonathan: You underwent cancer treatments?Molly: I was fortunate that my cancer was detected early - it was Stage 1 so I had a lumpectomy and are-excision but did not have to have chemo. I declinedradiation treatments but I take tamoxifen. Jonathan: Some people speak of the gifts of cancer. Molly: I would not describe cancer as a gift. Too many people's lives are ravaged or ended by cancer to callit a gift. However, facing the personal challenges thatcome from cancer or other life threatening illness can bringabout personal transformation. For me being diagnosedwith cancer triggered a feeling of deep vulnerability, whichalthough very disturbing and tremendously uncomfortablehas overall been good for me. I think I have avoided feelings of vulnerability all of my life. In retrospect becoming a lawyer was probably ahedge against feelings of vulnerability, a way of protectingmyself by becoming more powerful. Being diagnosed withcancer was such a jolt; my illusions of control over my lifewere decimated. I could not help but face my vulnerability. One exercise was to photograph both 'the death of beauty' and 'beauty in death'.We walked to a bog where there were dead trees, decay and new life. People tooksome amazing pictures. In our discussion afterwards we discussed the cycle oflife, our images of death and our feelings about our own death.I was totally blown away when thesurgeon told me it was breast cancer.I have been a vegetarian for manyyears, I exercise, I meditate, do yoga.I did not consider myself a candidatefor breast cancer.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2005 Page 14 An Interview with Ann Arbor Attorney and Activist, Molly Reno, on Cancer, Photography and HealingPhoto by Molly RenoPhoto by Nina Hauser When I was at the Healing Retreat, I had an even deeper experience of my own vulnerability.Something about the setting of Retreat, the exquis-ite natural beauty, watching the tides come in andout, witnessing the sun rise over the ocean everymorning, having someone prepare delicious, healthyfood, morning yoga and meditation all served tocreate a very deep sense of safety which in turnallowed me to experience my vulnerability on adeeper level. I came to understand that for meowning my vulnerability is tied to self-acceptance.I think feelings of vulnerability have softened me ina good way. Being diagnosed with a life threatening disease has forced me to face my mortality. Life isfinite and my life is finite. From this understanding Ihave new motivation to make sure I use my timewell. The cancer diagnosis has provided me withmotivation to pursue new paths now rather thanlater. Jonathan: What are the life changes you have made that you attribute to cancer? Molly: Cancer has given me motivation to make certain changes in my life. I have been alawyer for over 25 years. As a lawyer, I rely to agreat extent on my intellect. This is not to say Idon't use my heart when practicing law but mostoften people come to lawyers to analyze legalproblems. I brought a certain intellectual capacityto the law and practicing law has served to furtherdevelop my mind. For some time, I had beenlooking for an opportunity to focus more onfeelings and have more heart based connections. I resonated in such a deep way with the experiences at the Healing Retreat Center in Mainethat I asked if there might be a role for me. I wasoffered the opportunity to train to lead HealingRetreats. I have gone to a couple of trainingsessions including a weeklong training in somatics at theFeathered Pipe Ranch in Montana. This summer and fall Iam apprenticing at the 5 Healing Retreats in Maine. I amexcited by the work of the Retreats. Jonathan: What's the training like? Molly : The training is very humbling. Very humbling because to be a good retreat leader, you have to speak fromthe heart. I am used to speaking from my intellect. As alawyer, when I speak to juries and other groups, I'm always talking about an issue outside of myself. I'm talking about what happened to other people. I'm reciting facts. I'madvocating on someone else's behalf. In the training, it's very clear that I have to speak from my heart and I have to self-disclose my own processand share my struggles and ways in which I learned certainthings. The concepts of the retreat \u2014 healing, forgiveness,conditioned tendencies and assessments are all illustratedthrough one's personal experience. I found that at the firsttraining I stood up in front of the group and my mind wentblank and I just froze. I was overcome with fear. I didn'tknow where to go. I couldn't rely on my usual skills, myintellect, in presenting this information. It's traumatic to just go from being an attorney for more than twenty-five years; I've developed a certaincompetence as an attorney and now I'm a beginner. Abeginner makes mistakes because, by definition a beginnerdoesn't know. A beginner has to learn. It's humbling to gofrom a feeling of competence to being a beginner. Jonathan: Tell me some about what is meant by a Healing Retreat? Molly: The retreat center was started by a Harvard trained internist, Matthew Budd, who prior toretirement taught at the Harvard Medical school and wasan architect of the Body Mind program at the HarvardCommunity Health Plan. Matthew has led courses workingwith the body mind connection for over 25 years. In the retreats, Matthew helps people to see thatemotions live in the body and emotions such as anger, anxiety, grief and depression cause chemical changeswhich have many negative effects on the body such asraising blood pressure and/or depressing the immunesystem to name a few. Other emotions such as joy or peaceof mind serve to stimulate the immune system. This is not to say we are to blame for our cancer or illness\u2014\u2014 genetics, environmental contamination andsome traumas are beyond our control. However we cancreate an interior environment to promote healing and theoptimal functioning of the immune system. At the retreat we explore what it means to heal. A premise of the retreat is that healing occurs on the emo-tional, spiritual and physical levels. We can take responsi-bility for healing on the emotional and spiritual level andsuch healing will not only make us feel better and allow usto lead more fulfilling lives but spiritual and emotionalhealing serve to promote an internal environment whichsupports the immune system and promotes its optimalfunctioning. We do not have control over whether we heal on the physical level due to factors such as genetics andenvironmental contamination. However, spiritual andemotional healing enhances the likelihood of physicalhealing or cure. Jonathan: Are all of the retreats aimed at women with cancer? Molly: All of this year's retreats are aimed at women. Next year there may be some retreats for menincluding a retreat for men who have had heart attacks.Research shows that anger is more of a determinate thancholesterol as to who is a candidate for a heart attack Jonathan: Some of the retreats include photogra- phy as an element, or do all of them? Molly: All of the retreats include some form of creativity \u2014 photography, writing, story telling, andmovement. Creativity is important because to createsomething is to bring an idea or concept from the realm ofpossibility into existence. In the retreats we exercise thesame creative muscle needed to become the creators of ourown lives and bring things from the realm of the possibleinto being. Jonathan: Tell me about the location of the retreat center you attended. Molly: It's located in Georgetown, Maine on an island in Boothbay Harbor about an hour north of Portland.It is a relatively undeveloped area. Lots of space betweenthe houses and lots of trees. You don't really see otherhouses from the retreat center. Jonathan: What's the retreat center itself like? Is it one building? Molly: It's one building. It's a wooden chalet that was built around the turn of the last century by aBoston photographer, F. Holland Day. Fred, as he wascalled, often brought immigrant children from thetenements of Boston to his chalet to spend a coupleof weeks during the summer. One of the children hementored was the poet, Kahlil Gibran. Jonathan: Yes, who went on to be an author ofThe Prophet and so many other books. Molly : Yes, so the house has a history and a certain energy and presence to it. Jonathan: How would someone find out about theretreats? Molly: There is a web site www.fhollanddaycenter .org and anybody who might be interested could contact me. I would be glad to talkwith them about it and there are scholarships avail-able. Jonathan: Do you feel that since you are a womanwho has had a serious illness that this gives you aparticular base to work with other women who areconfronting serious health challenges? Molly: Yes, I think that it does. One of the powerful aspects of the retreat for me was being witheight other women, all of whom had a diagnosis ofcancer. All of us had faced the fear or been con-fronted by the fear of death and it felt like a safe spacein which I could look at the ramifications of mymortality. Because I have done that, because Icontinue to wrestle with my personal mortality,continue to be aware that life is finite, that my life isfinite, I think that I can be present with other women intheir journey in a way that I couldn't have been if Ididn't have a cancer diagnosis. Without such adiagnosis I really wouldn't know. I could only guess. Jonathan: You went from being a person who discovered they have cancer, through it's treatment, findingthis retreat using photography as a creative way to supportwomen with major illness, and now to training to help withsuch retreats in the future. Molly: Yes. Jonathan: Sounds like a pretty full circle. Molly: Yeah, I couldn't have asked for more. Through the challenge of the cancer diagnosis, I feel like a path hasopened before me. I don't know what will come of it, but atleast I have a direction, a road I'm starting down. Susan, mypartner, is also involved in the retreats. She creates a ritualfor the end of each day and selects poems and readings forthe start of the daily meditation. It is a real gift to be part ofthis together. Jonathan: Will you continue to practice law? Molly: Yes. I expect to continue practicing law as well as leading retreats for at least another 5 years. For the past 10years, I have represented women prisoners who have beensexually assaulted or sexually harassed by prison guards in alarge class action lawsuit. I want to see that case through tothe end. Jonathan: I want to go back to the use of photography at the Healing Retreats. How does what you see, as the basisof a photo, effect your ability to deal with cancer? Molly: I don't dwell on cancer, although the fear of recurrence is always in the back of my mind. I use theawareness of the risk of recurrence as a springboard and amotivation to try to live life as fully as I can and to realizethat life is finite and to take responsibility for creating my lifeand using each and every day. Photography is one way to focus on the small aspects of life. To slow down and look at what's in front ofyou. To look at a flower. To look at a leaf. To look at a tree.To look at the play of light on water. To look at the reflectionin a puddle. To look at... Just to look and to see all of thebeauty that is in front of me that I don't see when I get busyand I'm just trying to accomplish more, rushing around andputting too much on my plate. Then I don't see what's rightin front of me. When I have a camera and I'm looking through thatcamera lens, there's only a limited space that I can see at onetime. So it really helps to focus me on the micro. Thatenhances my appreciation of the present moment. It hasreally been a great gift. Jonathan: Thank you. ### I would not describe cancer as a gift.
