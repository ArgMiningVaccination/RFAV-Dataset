I hope you are well and enjoying the glorious SUN we've been having for the last few days. It is funny, we did an activity in 4th grade guidance this week where students voted on various topics. On rainy days, snow>sun, but once the sun came out on Wednesday, sun votes far outshone snow. (Also, FYI: pizza>tacos and Roblox>Minecraft) I hope to see everyone dressed up for our [Animal Spirit Day](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JSdkKs4o6J3RcjNPwt7K9BFbacm8b5K7/view?usp=sharing) on January 28th! Our story this week is Snail Crossing, by Corey R. Tabor. It is mostly just pure fun, but comes with sides of friendship and persistence. I'm really hoping Snail and the rowdy Ants have more adventures in the future - what do you think they might get up to next?? On Monday, we will start learning about our newest toolbox addition, the Personal Space Tool. All of us have a right to our personal space and the responsibility to give others the same right. When we are aware of the physical space around us, we can better understand our needs and how we impact others. Remember that personal space is physical, but also emotional. When the words or noises one person makes enter the space of another, it can make them feel uncomfortable. Respecting others' personala space is a respectful, responsible and safe thing to do!
