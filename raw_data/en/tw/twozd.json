Here are the reasons why. 1) The Covid vaccines are immorally developed through the use of aborted babies' \"immortal\" cell lines. We are told in Scripture \"to have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness.\" The use of these vaccines also promotes further abortions \"in the name of research.\" Because of the abortion connection, I and my family are opposed on religious grounds to the existing Covid vaccines. 2) The existing vaccines are not truly vaccines, they are therapeutics. A vaccine causes sterility for the underlying virus. The Covid \"vaccines\" only lessen the symptoms of infection. They do not prevent the vaccinated from infection. They do not prevent the vaccinated from a viral load equivalent to non-vaccinated people, per the CVC. They do not prevent transmission of Covid to others. In short, their only benefit is to lessen the effects of infection to the individual taking the vaccine, and their efficacy lasts a short time, believed to be about 6 months. 3) The vaccines are not FDA approved. Currently they are under Emergency Use Authorization, and it is not legal to try to mandate this for anyone per the Nuremberg Agreement a form of which is incorporated into federal law. 4) The vaccines have almost no value for young people of college age. Per studies, college age students (regardless of health) have a survival rate from Covid of 99.998+%. Conversely, the Infection Fatality Rate for the young is 0.002%. For healthy young people with no underlying health issues, the chance of dying is even less, considerably less than 1 in 100,000. With these odds, this is NOT A PANDEMIC for young, college-aged people! 5) On the other hand, per the Israeli study attached, the chance of dying, as a side effect, from the Covid vaccine is approximately 1 in 18,000 for young people! The chance of dying generally from full vaccination is some 1 in 3,000 in the general population, per the America's Frontline Doctors legal motion attached as well as the Israeli study. Getting vaccinated, per data from multiple countries, is a form of Russian Roulette. 6) The mRNA technology has never before been used in human vaccines, and its long-term effects are completely unknown! There is growing evidence that the mRNA travels throughout recipients' bodies and leaves spike proteins in various organs where it doesn't belong. 7) My body my choice! Forcing a vaccine on people who don't want it is immoral. 8) Forcing these vaccines, with their ever-increasing side effects as being reported, on people will lead to lawsuits against the higher education system from the inevitable side effects (including death) from the vaccines. We taxpayers should not foot the bill for such a foolish mandate that causes harm. 9) The risk-reward for young people is decidedly in favor of NOT taking the vaccines. To try to force this on young people is an unethical overreach, playing politics with people's health. 10) There are alternative health protocols, both as prophylaxis and treatment, that are proven by studies to be effective and safe.
