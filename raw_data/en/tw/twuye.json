Bizarre video shows a 'doctor' puncturing a patient's forehead in medieval bloodletting treatment... for HEADACHES - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - The amateur footage was posted on social media site Weibo on October 3 - It shows a man having his head drained of blood in a medieval treatment - He has a band tied around his neck and strains the blood out into a bowl A bizarre video has emerged of a man receiving medieval style treatment to drain his head of blood. According to reports, the procedure can be used to treat headaches in traditional Chinese medicine. But while the treatment has existed for hundreds of years, the video, which is believed to have been filmed in China, has shocked viewers on the country's social media websites. Preparation: The man is seen laughing and joking while the doctor prepares him by wrapping a band around his neck (left and right) Getting ready: The 'doctor' is then seen touching the man's head (left) before puncturing it with what appears to be a tube or needle (right) In the footage, the man can be seen smiling and joking with a band wrapped around his neck. Another person, who appears to be the doctor, is then seen touching his forehead before puncturing it with what appears to be a tube or a needle. As soon as the puncture was made, the blood came pouring out of his head into a bucket. The man can be seen squinting as the blood continues to pour out from his forehead for about a minute. One report on video sharing site QQ, where the footage has been viewed more than 49,000 times, said the treatment is known for alleviating headaches. The video was posted to Chinese social media site One user wrote: 'I have heard of this therapy but is he bleeding too much?' While another commented: 'Why didn't he go for blood donation?' And one user said: 'I am curious if the man is still alive.' Treatment: As soon as the instrument is moved away, the man starts bleeding (left). He then sits over a bowl as the liquid drains from his head (right) Michael Chung, a lecturer at the School of Chinese Medicine at Chinese University of Hong Kong, told MailOnline: 'Venipuncture, meaning cutting a vein to remove blood from the body, for therapeutic purposes is a commonly-used method in Chinese Medicine. 'It is quite commonly used in the treatment of pain, swelling, or other disorders that related to blood congestions. 'Usually, TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) practitioners will use lancets to let go a few drops of blood, or by means of \"wet cupping\".' Chung believes the treatment might have been used to reduce eye swelling in this case. He added: 'The possible risk of venipuncture, in such scale as in the video, may include pain and bruise after puncture, dropped blood pressure, shock and infection.'
