An Australian research organisation, The Aurum Project, a not-for-profit dedicated to natural medicine research, conducted a study into the use of Homeopathy for their patients in Australia. The study found that 27% of all people having homeopathy consults for coming for mental health reasons. Led by Dr Celeste Salter and Linlee Jordan, the study was established to understand why people visit homeopaths. Data was collected over a two month period, including demographics of age, gender, ethnicity, state or territory of residence as well as basic homeopathic data. Not only is mental health the most common reason to visit a Homeopath, but it is also by far the most widespread. Patients visit almost three times more for mental health purposes, compared with the next greatest singular reason - skin conditions. \"Even when there are physical issues a client comes in with, the conversation usually always turns to the emotional and mental links to their disease.
