Bedrick, PhD6; Brian Sokol, MPA5; Lopez, MSPH5; MBBS7,10 On March 11, 2022, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). The BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was recommended by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for persons aged 12-15 years (referred to as adolescents in this report) on May 12, 2021, and for children aged 5-11 years on November 2, 2021 (1-4). Real-world data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) in these age groups are needed, especially because when the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant became predominant in the United States in December 2021, early investigations of VE demonstrated a decline in protection against symptomatic infection for adolescents aged 12-15 years and adults* ( 5). The PROTECT prospective cohort of 1,364 children and adolescents aged 5-15 years was tested weekly for SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of symptoms, and upon COVID-19-associated illness during July 25, 2021-February 12, 2022. Among unvaccinated participants (i.e., those who had received no COVID-19 vaccine doses) with any laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant infections were more likely to report COVID-19 symptoms (66%) than were those with Omicron infections (49%). Among fully vaccinated children aged 5-11 years, VE against any symptomatic and asymptom - atic Omicron infection 14-82 days (the longest interval after dose 2 in this age group) after receipt of dose 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 31% (95% CI = 9%-48%), adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, health information, frequency of social contact, mask use, location, and local virus circulation. Among adolescents aged 12-15 years, adjusted VE 14-149 days after dose 2 was 87% (95% CI = 49%-97%) against symptomatic and asymptomatic Delta infection and 59% (95% CI = 22%-79%) against Omicron infection.

All eligible children and adolescents should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations. PROTECT is a prospective cohort study monitor - ing SARS-CoV-2 infections among participants aged 6 months-17 years in jurisdictions in four states (Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Utah), initiated in July 2021 ( 6). Upon enrollment, parents or legal guardians provided the par - ticipants' demographic, health, vaccination history, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection information; the number of hours and percentage of time participants wore masks in school and in the community were reported monthly. \u00a7 Vaccination was verified by vaccine cards, electronic medical records, and state immunization registries. Active surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection and any COVID-19-associated symptoms \u00b6 within the preceding 7 days occurred through weekly submission of a survey and nasal swab for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing and viral whole genome sequencing.** Specific symptoms and duration, hours of school missed \u00a7 P arents or legal guardians were asked, \"In the past 7 days, how many hours did [participant] spend in the community, meaning outside the home and NOT at school, daycare, or before-/after-school care? (For example: in stores, at parks, at work, playing sports, or at summer camp)\" followed by, \"In the past 7 days when [participant] was in the community, for what % of time did they wear a face mask?\" \u00b6 CO VID-19-associated illness signs and symptom included fever >100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, muscle or body aches, change in smell or taste, runny nose, fatigue or being run-down, decreased activity, and irritability or crankiness were also included for nonverbal children. A short survey submitted with the specimen asked the parent or guardian if the child had any COVID-19 symptoms in the previous 7 days. ** S pecimens not eligible (cycle threshold [Ct] value >30) for sequencing were assumed to contain the Delta variant from July 25, 2021, to the date when the Omicron variant accounted for >50% of sequenced viruses at each study site. During weeks of Omicron and Delta cocirculation, 62% (38 of 61) of SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced. Point estimates of VE changed <5% when unsequenced samples were removed; however, 95% CIs were wider because of decreased sample size and precision.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / March 18, 2022 / V ol. 71 / No. 11 423 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionbecause of illness, and receipt of medical care were documented through the electronic surveys. For the calculation of VE, person-time for adolescents aged 12-15 years began at the start of active surveillance on July 25, 2021, and ended February 12, 2022, or, for adolescents eligible for a third (booster) dose (5 months after second mRNA vaccine dose receipt), person-time ended when a booster dose was authorized on January 3, 2022. For children aged 5-11 years, person-time for Omicron models began 6 weeks after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was recommended on November 2, 2021, and ended February 12, 2022. COVID-19 characteristics and comparisons between Delta and Omicron infections were assessed. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying vaccination status were used to calculate hazard ratios of unvaccinated to vaccinated participants with no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (14 days after receipt of a second Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose), weighted for inverse probability of vaccination using sociodemographic character-istics, health information, frequency of social contact, mask use, location, and local virus circulation. Characteristics of Omicron infections among vaccinated and unvaccinated par - ticipants were also compared. \u00a7\u00a7 All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) or R software (version 4.1.2; R Foundation). This study was reviewed by CDC and approved by the institutional review boards at The F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents aged 12-15 years on May 10, 2021 ( https://www.fda.gov/news-events/ press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use ), and CDC recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for this age group on May 12, 2021 ( https://www. cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0512-advisory-committee-signing.html ). FDA amended EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to expand the use of a single booster dose to include use in persons aged 12-15 years, 5 months after receipt of the second primary series mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose on January 3, 2022, and CDC recommended a third dose for this age group on January 5, 2022 (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0105-Booster-Shot.html ). FDA authorized EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 5-11 years on October 29, 2021 ( https://www.fda.gov/news-events/ press-announcements/fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-children-5-through-11-years-age), and CDC recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for this age group on November 2, https:// www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1102-Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine.html ). \u00a7\u00a7 S everity of infection was assessed by variant type among unvaccinated children and by vaccination status among Omicron infections because of limited number of Delta infections among vaccinated persons. Logistic and linear regression models were used for dichotomous and continuous outcome measures, respectively, weighted for inverse probability of vaccination by site, sociodemographic characteristics, health information, including number of chronic medical conditions, number of daily prescription medications, and influenza vaccination history, and SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine knowledge, attitudes, and practices. For VE and severity of infection models, any variable that was unbalanced (standardized mean difference 0.2) after weighting and that modified the model outcome point estimate 5%, was added to the model as a covariate. Participants with partial vaccination or <14 days after second dose were excluded from VE and attenuation analyses.participating sites or under a reliance agreement with Abt Associates institutional review board and was conducted con - sistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.\u00b6\u00b6 The study sample comprised 1,364 participants, includ - ing 1,052 (77%) children aged 5-11 years and 312 (23%) adolescents aged 12-15 years (Table 1).*** Overall, 76% of participants lived in Arizona, 52% were female, 76% were White, 34% were Hispanic, and 10% had at least one chronic medical condition. Of 381 SARS-CoV-2 infections among children aged 5-11 years, and 127 infections among adoles - cents aged 12-15 years, 352 (93%) and 97 (76%), respectively, were Omicron infections. Participants who received 1 doses of vaccine were reported to have worn a mask during 84% of school hours and 70% of hours in the community, whereas unvaccinated children were masked during 60% of school hours and 48% of hours in the community (p <0.001 for both). Lower percentages of masked time in school (71%) and in the community (58%) were reported for participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with those of participants who had no infection (82% and 68%, respectively) (p <0.001). Among 252 unvaccinated participants with SARS-CoV-2 infections throughout the study period, 112 (44%) were asymptomatic; unvaccinated participants with Omicron infec - tions were less likely to report COVID-19 symptoms (49%) than were those with Delta infections (66%) (crude odds ratio = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3-0.8) ( Table 2). Overall, unvac - cinated participants with COVID-19 symptoms experienced an average of 6.9 days with illness symptoms, spent an average of 1.9 days sick in bed, and missed an average of 24.0 hours of school because of illness. Omicron-associated COVID-19 symptoms lasted an average of 5.3 days and resulted in an aver - age of 18.8 hours of missed school, which was 3.4 fewer days of symptoms (95% CI = -5.7 to -1.0) and 10.6 fewer hours of school missed (95% CI = -18.6 to -2.7) than Delta-associated COVID-19. Among the 1,052 participants aged 5-11 years, 682 (65%) received 2 vaccine doses, 69 (7%) received 1 dose, and 301 (29%) were unvaccinated. Adjusted VE against symptom - atic and asymptomatic Omicron infection 14-82 days after receipt of dose 2 (the longest interval after dose 2 in this age group) was 31% (95% CI = 9%-48%) (Table 3).

I ncludes all participants aged 5-15 years, and infections that occurred at any time during the cohort study (July 25, 2021-February 12, 2022). However, of 275 total infections among unvaccinated participants, only 252 completed a post-illness survey capturing symptoms. \u00a7 S everity of infection, comparing Delta infections as the referent group with Omicron infections, was assessed by variant type among unvaccinated children and adolescents. Logistic and linear regression models were used for dichotomous and continuous outcome measures, respectively. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. \u00b6 O f 198 total infections in persons that occurred 14-149 days after dose 2 receipt, 186 completed a post-illness survey to report symptoms. This excludes four Omicron infections in persons aged 12-15 years with infection 150 days after receipt of dose 2. ** S everity of infection was assessed by vaccination status, comparing unvaccinated children as the referent group with children vaccinated 14-149 days earlier, among Omicron infections. Comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated participants with Delta infections was not included because of the limited number of vaccinated children with Delta infections. Logistic and linear regression models were used for dichotomous and continuous outcome measures, respectively, weighted for inverse probability of vaccination by site, sociodemographic characteristics, health information, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine. C OVID-19-associated illness signs and symptoms included fever >100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, muscle or body aches, change in smell or taste; runny nose, fatigue or being run-down, decreased activity, and irritability or crankiness were also included for nonverbal children. \u00a7\u00a7 F ebrile symptoms were defined as symptoms of feverishness or chills, or a measured temperature >100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C). 85 (27%) were unvaccinated. The adjusted VE at 14-149 days after receipt of dose 2 was 87% (95% CI = 49%-97%) against Delta infection and 59% (95% CI = 22%-79%) against Omicron infection. Adjusted VE 150 days after dose 2 was 60% against Delta infection and 62% against Omicron, with wide CIs that included zero. Among 186 vaccinated participants with Omicron infections (174 [93%] in children aged 5-11 years and 13 [7%] in ado - lescents aged 12-15 years), 37.6% were asymptomatic; those reporting COVID-19 symptoms spent 1.4 days in bed, which was 0.6 days fewer than reported for unvaccinated participants (95% CI = -1.1 to -0.1) ( Table 2), after adjusting for the pro - pensity to be vaccinated. Conversely, vaccinated participants with Omicron infections stayed home from school 26.2 hours, an adjusted mean of 11 hours more than that reported for unvaccinated participants (95% CI = 4.6-17.6). Overall, medical care-seeking was reported for 16.4% of unvaccinated participants with Omicron infections and 15.5% of vaccinated participants, which was not significantly different.Discussion In this prospective cohort study of children and adolescents aged 5-15 years that included routine weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing, irrespective of symptoms, 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were effective in preventing symptomatic and asymp - tomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, although effectiveness varied by variant. VE point estimates were highest against Delta variant infections among adolescents aged 12-15 years and lowest against Omicron variant infections among children aged 5-11 years. The SARS-CoV-2 infections prevented by vaccination dif- fered by variant. Approximately one half (51%) of all Omicron infections were asymptomatic compared with approximately one third (34%) of Delta infections. However, when chil - dren or adolescents experienced symptomatic COVID-19, the illnesses disrupted life at home and school; on average COVID-19 lasted 7 days, two of which were spent sick in bed, and resulted in 24 hours of missed school.

V accination status varied with time, therefore, contributing participants in vaccination categories do not equal the number of participants in the study because participants could contribute to more than one vaccination category. \u00a7 O f 275 SARS-CoV-2 infections among unvaccinated participants, 98 occurred among children aged 5-11 years either before vaccine availability (n = 60) or were Delta infections (n = 17) for whom VE was not calculated. Among vaccinated participants, 61 occurred after receipt of dose 1 and <14 days after dose 2; two children aged 5-11 years were vaccinated before authorization, and two had Delta infections among children aged 5-11 years for whom VE was not calculated. \u00b6 A djusted VE is inversely weighted for propensity to be vaccinated. Among children aged 5-11 years, all covariates met balance criteria of SMD <0.2 after weighting for the Delta variant model. For the Omicron variant model, all covariates met balance criteria of SMD <0.2 after weighting, except local virus circulation and social (school or community) mask use, which both changed the VE estimate by 5% when added to the model, and thus remained in the final model as covariates. Among adolescents aged 12-15 years, all covariates met balance criteria of SMD <0.2 after weighting except social mask use, which also changed the VE estimate by 5% when added to the Delta variant model, and thus remained in the final model as a covariate. For the Omicron variant model, all covariates met balance criteria of SMD <0.2 after weighting, except local virus circulation, social (school or community) mask use, and number of medications. Only local virus circulation changed the VE estimate by 5% when added to the model, and thus remained in the final model as a covariate. aged 5-11 years and 59% effective among adolescents aged 12-15 years. The wide and overlapping CIs indicate that these age-specific VE point estimates might not be significantly dif - ferent and are similar to a recent report of VE of 45%-51% for 2 doses, received within 150 days, against Omicron COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care visits among children and adolescents aged 5-15 years (7). Participants who were infected with Omicron despite receipt of 2 vaccine doses spent an average of one half day less sick in bed than did unvaccinated participants with Omicron infections. Also, similar to studies of children (7) and adults (6), among adolescents aged 12-15 years, point estimates for VE of 2 doses received within the previous 150 days were lower against Omicron than Delta infections, although these differences were not statistically significant. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita - tions. First, despite the use of robust adjusted models previ - ously applied in other cohort studies ( 8), VE estimates might have been biased by residual confounding due to other differ - ences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. For example, vaccinated participants reported wearing face masks significantly more often at school and in the community than did unvaccinated participants. Second, although PROTECT is among the largest studies with routine weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing, the relatively small number of infections within vac - cination categories among certain age groups reduced precision of VE estimates. Estimates of VE at 150 days after dose 2 had very wide CIs, and thus it is unclear whether VE wanes with increased time since vaccination. Third, data were not avail - able to assess possible reasons that vaccinated participants with COVID-19 might have missed more school than did unvacci - nated participants despite unvaccinated participants reporting more days sick in bed. Fourth, these interim estimates do not include separate analyses of VE against asymptomatic infection and symptomatic infection at this time. Finally, although this study was conducted in multiple sites and included more than 1,300 participants, findings from the study sample might not be generalizable to all populations. This study provides evidence that receipt of 2 doses of Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine is effective in preventing both asymptomatic Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / March 18, 2022 / V ol. 71 / No. 11 427 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionand symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Omicron variant among children and adolescents aged 5-15 years.

Receipt of 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing infection with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in persons aged 12 years. What is added by this report? Children and adolescents aged 5-15 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2 weekly, irrespective of symptoms, during July 2021-February 2022. Approximately one half of Omicron infections in unvaccinated children and adolescents were asymptomatic. Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of Omicron infection by 31% among children aged 5-11 years and by 59% among persons aged 12-15 years. What are the implications for public health practice? All eligible children and adolescents should remain up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations. 1CDC COVID-19 Emergency Response Team; 2Rocky Mountain Center for Occupational and Environmental Health, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Utah H ealth, Salt Lake City, U tah; 3College of Medicine - T ucson, University of Arizona, T ucson, Arizona; 4Leonard M.
