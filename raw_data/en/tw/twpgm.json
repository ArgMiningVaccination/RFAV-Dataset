Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is simple and relatively inexpensive. Yet it is underused in every-day practice, leaving some HBV-positive patients un- aware and at risk for serious health consequences, including cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 1 In addition, many primary care providers do not follow exist - ing guidelines for HBV screening and management.2 Yet they are often the first, and sometimes the only, clinicians that in-fected individuals will see. zWhy chronic HBV is still a problem. Although the in- cidence of acute HBV infection has declined significantly as a result of universal infant vaccination in the United States, chronic infections are still prevalent in this country due to such factors as immigration from areas where HBV is endemic, perinatal transmission, transmission among household con-tacts, and risky behaviors. In most adolescents and adults, HBV infection leads to acute hepatitis from which they fully recover; chronic infection ensues in only 5% to 10% of cases. However, 90% of infants and 25% to 50% of children younger than 5 years who become infected with HBV go on to develop lifelong infection. Most people with chronic HBV infection do not exhibit any signs of clinical illness, which makes screening all the more important\u2014particularly since effective antiviral treatments are available. 1,3 To help primary care providers address the issues of screening for HBV , the Hepatitis B Foundation convened a work - shop of prominent primary care practitioners and specialists in hepatitis and liver diseases. The workshop panel reviewed evidence-based guidelines and reports from the American Asso - ciation for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), as well as a PRACT iCE RECoMMENDAT ioNS Screen patients at risk of contracting hepatits B virus (HBV), especially those from HBV-endemic regions of the world, by testing for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody (HBsAg and anti-HBs).

Those in the immune tolerant phase also have high levels of circulating virus, indicated by HBV DNA levels. However, the body does not mount an immune response to the virus; there is no active liver disease, and the serum ALT level is normal. When the immune system recognizes HBV as foreign, the patient enters the immune active phase, wherein liver inflammation and fibrosis can develop and ALT is correspond-ingly elevated. HBV antibody (anti-HBe) may be present. In nearly all patients, HBeAg seroconver - sion to HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive status occurs spontaneously or as a result of antiviral treatment. After seroconversion, most patients enter the HBsAg inactive carrier phase, in which a strong cellular im- mune response is able to suppress, but not eliminate, the virus. This phase typically features low or undetectable serum levels of HBV DNA and normal ALT levels. Over time, liver inflammation and fibrosis improve, and the risk of cirrhosis and HCC declines. 7 However, some patients do not enter the inactive phase after HBeAg seroconver -TABLE 1 Phases of labs Dna >20,000 iu/ml* alT normal hBeag detectable no or minimal liver inflammation and fibrosis immune activehBV Dna usually >20,000 iu/ml*alT elevated hBeag may be detectable or not; anti-hBe may be present liver inflammation and fibrosis can inactive hBsag carrier no liver inflammation; fibrosis may regress ReactivationhBV Dna levels increase alT, alanine aminotransferase; iu/ml=105 copies/ml.CHRONIC HEPATITIS B INFECTION jfponline.com Vol 60, no 9 | SepTemBeR 2011 | The jouRnal of family pRacTice E3 jfponline.comsion. They instead continue to exhibit active viral replication and liver disease due to the emergence of one or more HBeAg-negative viral mutants. Moreover, in as many as 20% of those who enter the inactive HBsAg car - rier state, infection will reactivate and pos - sibly return the patient to HBeAg-positive status. HBV infection is a dynamic condition: Individuals can go from active disease to the inactive phase and then have reactivation of liver disease at any point during their life-time. Thus, patients require lifelong monitor - ing of their chronic infection. 8 zSince chronic HBV infection cannot be cured, the desired clinical outcome is for patients to enter and remain in the inactive HBsAg carrier phase. Evidence suggests that, in this phase, the risk of decompensated cir - rhosis may also significantly decrease.9 A few inactive HBsAg carriers (0.5%/year) will clear the surface antigen and may develop protec - tive antibodies (anti-HBs). Development of cirrhosis after loss of HBsAg is extremely rare; however, the risk of HCC, although reduced, is not eliminated. 10 If a patient is unable to suppress the vi - rus, or if infection reactivates after the pa - tient achieves inactive carrier status, antiviral therapy may still decrease the risk of cirrhosis and HCC through durable suppression of HBV DNA to low or undetectable levels and nor -malization of ALT. Seven drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in - fection ( TABLE 2 ).3 The decision to treat must take into account multiple factors, including phase of disease, age of the patient, extent of liver involvement on biopsy, potential efficacy of and adverse events associated with avail - able therapies, cost of long-term medication, and, importantly, the high risk of development of nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant viral strains. Many studies have demonstrated the benefit of treating patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. 9,11-13 However, no study has shown a benefit of treating those in the immune toler - ant or inactive carrier phases. Key opportunities to make a difference Primary care providers can form an effective first-line of defense against morbidity and mortality associated with chronic HBV infec - tion by: immunizing all infants, children, and ado - lescents, as well as adults at risk to acquire HBV , following guidelines from the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics; screening those at high risk, as per CDC guidelines; performing clinical and laboratory evalua -Vaccinate children and adolescents according to CDC guidelines, as well as at-risk adults who test negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs.TABLE 2 FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of chronic HBV infection 3 Drug labeled for use in: interferons (intron hepatitis B virus.The jouRnal of family pRacTice | SepTemBeR 2011 | Vol 60, no 9 E4tion of patients who have chronic HBV infec - tion, to determine current phase of disease; monitoring patients in the immune toler - ant or inactive phases every 6 to 12 months for disease progression; and consulting with a liver specialist or HBV-experienced provider for patients in the immune active phase, to determine treat - ment strategies.

Although the algorithm cannot anticipate all possible clinical circumstances, it offers a general path forward based on the results of routine laboratory tests. Ideally, an office system\u2014whether using electronic medical records or not\u2014would incorporate guideline-based prompts for screening and management.underuse of screening means many infected individuals are missed The CDC has identified high-risk groups for HBV screening, including all individuals born in geographic regions where HBsAg preva- lence is 2% (FiGuRE, No TE A).4 Screening is simple and relatively inexpensive (commer - cial diagnostic laboratories currently charge $150-$250 to screen for HBsAg and anti-HBs). con Tinue D Blood or tissue donors hemodialysis patients hiV-positive patients household members or sexual contacts of infected individuals individuals with conditions that may require immunosup- pressive or immune-modifying therapy (beyond 2 weeks of corticosteroids) individuals with elevated al T/aST of unknown cause infants born to hBV-infected mothers injection drug users men who have sex with men pregnant women individuals born in regions where hBV prevalence is 2%: -africa -asia- caribbean: antigua-Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. lucia, Turks and caicos -central america: Guatemala and honduras -eastern europe, except hungary-middle east, except cyprus and israel - north america: indigenous peoples of alaska, northern canada, and mexico - South america: amazonian areas of Bolivia; Brazil, columbia, ecuador, Guyana, peru, Suriname, Venezuela -South pacific, except australia and new Zealand Screen close family members, household contacts, and sexual partners Vaccinate uninfected close family members, household contacts, and sexual partners provide infected individuals with disease-management information and consult with a specialist measure al T every 6 months, hBV Dna at baseline and every 6 months if al T is elevated 19 iu/l (women) or 30 iu/ml (men) measure hBeag yearly measure alpha-feto protein and perform liver ultrasound every 6-12 months for those at high risk for hcc: -family history of hcc-cirrhosis-man 40 years or woman 50 years->20 years old and born in africa-co-infection with hcV or hiV hBeag-positive, al T elevated; with or without advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis hBeag-negative, al T elevated, hBV Dna >2000 iu/ml; with or without advance fibrosis or patients undergoing immunosuppressive or sustained immune-modifying therapy (eg, >2 weeks of corticosteroids or other modifying agents) Potential candidates for referralD Recommended management of chronic HBV infectionC Postdiagnosis education and infectionAFiGuRE (continued ) Algorithm notesThe jouRnal of family pRacTice | SepTemBeR 2011 | Vol 60, no 9 E6Despite these recommendations, the recent IOM report confirms that screening is under - used or is not being done appropriately.2 Screening is also recommended for in- dividuals about to undergo immunosuppres - sive or immune-modifying therapy (eg, for treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease, or in prepara-tion for bone marrow or other transplant). For these patients who are also asymptom- atic inactive carriers of HBV, the risk of re- activation can be as high as 50%, especially in patients receiving chemotherapy for lym- phoma. Deaths from fulminant hepatitis have also been reported; however, preemptive HBV antiviral treatment can reduce this risk to about 10% or less. 14,15 The workshop panel recommends that providers screen for HBV under these circumstances, and that HBsAg- positive patients should start preemptive oral HBV antiviral therapy before receiving immu-nosuppressive or immune-modifying therapy (including systemic corticosteroids >2 weeks) to prevent a flare of hepatitis. 2 Differentiate those who are chronically infected, immune, or susceptibleThe CDC recommends screening for both HBsAg and anti-HBs. Taken together, the re - sults of these tests can help you discern if the patient is actively infected (HBsAg-positive); immune (HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs-positive); or susceptible (negative for both seromarkers). Testing for the antibody to HBV core an- tigen (anti-HBc) is occasionally included in screening panels. Its presence cannot distin- guish between current and previous infec - tion. False-positive test results also occur. Vaccinate seronegative individuals who are at risk for HBVAlthough the CDC recommends vaccination of all HBsAg-negative individuals at risk for acquiring HBV, vaccine coverage of adults in the United States remains low. 2,16 The work - shop panel recommends that all primary care offices treating adults stock HBV vaccine. Of course, routinely stocking vaccine may pres - ent financial challenges, including purchase cost, storage, unused expired product, and re-imbursement. Your practice may want to co-ordinate coverage with the local department of health, area hospitals, or large practices that stock vaccine, to ensure timely vaccina- tion of patients. No further follow-up is needed for patients immune to HBVIf the screening result for HBsAg is negative but anti-HBs is positive, the patient is immune to HBV . If the screening panel also included testing for anti-HBc and it is positive, the pa - tient has natural immunity. A positive result for anti-HBs alone indicates prior vaccination or prior infection and seroconversion. A positive HBsAg screening test calls for further patient work-upIf a patient tests positive for HBsAg, collect baseline data for ALT, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA levels. In addition, encourage screening and vaccination of sexual partners and close household contacts of infected individuals. Patient education and counseling are impor - tant to dispel myths about HBV transmission (eg, HBV is not spread through casual contact such as handshakes or food sharing) and to reinforce the importance of regular care to prevent disease progression. Evaluating and monitoring the chronic HBV patient Use serum ALT levels, HBeAg and anti-HBe serology, and HBV DNA levels to identify the phase of HBV infection and guide patient management ( FiGuRE). interpreting viral DNA levels: Knowing when not to treat The presence of HBeAg in serum indicates viral replication. Although HBeAg-positive patients in the immune tolerant or immune active phases generally have high levels of circulating HBV DNA (>20,000 IU/mL), these DNA levels do not necessarily correlate with active liver disease. In the immune tolerant phase, there is no clearly established benefit of antiviral treatment regardless of HBV DNA levels, and the risk of development of viral resistance to oral antiviral drugs is a serious concern. There is also no indication for treat -if a patient tests positive for HBsAg, pursue further evaluation and recommend lifetime follow-up as well as screening and vaccinating sexual partners and close household contacts.CHRONIC HEPATITIS B INFECTION jfponline.com Vol 60, no 9 | SepTemBeR 2011 | The jouRnal of family pRacTice E7The most common adverse outcome of chronic HBV infection is hepatocellular carcinoma, occurring in up to 25% of men and 15% of women over their lifetimes.ment in the inactive carrier phase. Discuss with patients why treatment is inappropriate in these phases and how the development of resistance to antiviral thera- pies can have serious negative consequences for their future treatment needs. Also explain that, because chronic HBV infection is dy-namic, they will require lifetime follow-up care, even if they are currently in the immune tolerant or inactive phase. 1,3 Surveillance for HCC in patients with chronic HBV infectionThe most common adverse outcome of chronic HBV infection is HCC, occurring in up to 25% of men and 15% of women over their lifetimes. 17 Because early detection and effective treat - ment for HCC can prolong life in HBsAg-posi - tive individuals who have HCC or are at risk for acquiring it, the workshop panel recommends that primary care providers perform periodic screening for HCC according to the current AASLD guidelines. 3,17 Candidates for HCC screening are those with family histories of HCC; those with cirrhosis or co-infection with HCV or HIV; and men >40 years and women >50 years. HBV-infected men born in Africa may acquire HCC at a younger age due to pos - sible environmental exposure to aflatoxin, a carcinogenic mold. The AASLD guideline sug - gests screening this group with liver ultrasound every 6 months, starting at age 20. Although the AASLD guideline does not specifically rec - ommend measuring serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), many practitioners monitor AFP , which improves sensitivity but has low specificity. 17 Rising ALT suggests active liver diseaseSerum ALT is a surrogate indicator of possi-ble liver damage or disease. Generally, when an HBsAg-positive patient's ALT rises above normal (19 IU/L for women and 30 IU/L for men, when standard reference ranges are 0-40), they have moved into the immune ac -tive phase, where liver inflammation and fi-brosis can develop. Also consider other potential causes of ALT elevation, especially when it occurs in association with low or undetectable levels of HBV DNA. Alternative causes include hepa-titis C, heavy alcohol use, medications, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Consultation with a liver specialist may be helpful to rule out or confirm these comorbidities. Seeking out expertise in HBV patient management When a patient with chronic HBV infection has moved into the immune active phase, consult with a provider who has expertise in HBV\u2014whether you choose to refer or to co- manage the patient with the specialist\u2014to obtain advice on further work-up and de-velopment of a long-term management and treatment strategy. Individuals with small liver tumors identified on ultrasound or an elevated AFP level require immediate referral to a clinician who treats HCC, such as a trans - plant hepatologist. Ensuring the health of pregnant women The CDC recommends that all pregnant women be tested for HBsAg at an early pre-natal visit. Counsel women who are HBsAg- positive on what this status means for their own health, in addition to that of their new-born. If you are providing prenatal care, col-lect baseline data for ALT, HBe serology, and HBV DNA levels. Promptly refer any patient with an elevated ALT level to a specialist for care during pregnancy.
