Spinal adjustment is a primary chiropractic care tool used to relieve chronic pain, improve nervous system function, and restore musculoskeletal balance. During your consultation at True Function Chiropractic, Dr. Madsen will conduct various tests to determine if you may benefit from adjustments. The spine controls communication between the brain and body through the spinal nerves. The vertebrae also provide a range of motion, including bending and twisting. However, repetitive movement, poor posture, and a sedentary lifestyle can eventually lead to joint restrictions, misalignment, nerve compression, inflammation, or pain. Dr. Madsen may use the diversified technique, Thompson (drop table) technique, or the Arthostim instrument adjustment to correct the imbalances. Keeping the spine in alignment helps to maintain proper posture and optimize mobility. A healthy spine reduces the risk of overuse injuries, degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and pain from nervous system interference. A chiropractic adjustment is non-invasive, drug-free, and gentle enough for pediatric patients, including newborns. It helps with nervous system development and builds their immunity. Pregnant women can also benefit from adjustments to alleviate back pain from a growing uterus or sciatica. Types of Adjustment Techniques Our chiropractor uses different techniques to manipulate and realign the spinal joints, bones, and surrounding soft tissue. Here are three commonly used and effective methods: - Diversified Technique: The diversified chiropractic technique is performed by hand (manual). It involves applying a short (low-amplitude), quick (high-velocity) thrust over each restricted joint. - Thompson (Drop Table) Technique: The patient lies on a special drop table that has sections that raise and lower you. The table drops a fraction of an inch each time our chiropractor applies a sudden thrust to the spine during the adjustment. - Arthrostim Instrument Adjustment: The Arthrostim is a hand-held device that can deliver 12 to 14 thrusts per second during the adjustment session. It delivers controlled force to the precise joint being treated. Arthrostim instrument adjustment offers a faster, gentler, and effective way to realign the spine or extremity joints, without the \"popping\" and \"cracking\" sounds. Combining Chiropractic Wellness Therapies Chiropractic adjustments can be a stand-alone treatment or combined with other therapies. In many cases, Dr. Madsen will recommend massage therapy, corrective exercises, proper nutrition, or practical lifestyle changes to help sustain the results of spinal manipulation, improve immune system function, and restore balance. Schedule Your Chiropractic Care Appointment At True Function Chiropractic in Kaysville, UT, we help patients manage or eliminate pain caused by injury or degenerative conditions. Some individuals also use routine adjustments as preventative wellness care. Call us at (801) 540-4226 to find out more or to request an appointment. Physiotherapy It is important to understand that often times where the pain presents is not the area that needs to be treated. The pain may be due to that area compensating and being over-worked from another area not pulling its weight. Our rehabilitation program includes strength, flexibility and agility training as well as training focused on coordination of body parts and motion to prepare the individual to return to full participation. Nutrient Therapy WHY WHOLE FOOD SUPPLEMENTATION Dr. Madsen uses high quality organic whole food supplements from Standard Process and Mediherb to help her patients maintain health, recover faster from physical injury (such as sprain/strains, traumatic brain injuries), activate muscles, improve hormone levels and support the body during chronic illnesses and diminish their symptoms. When prescribed properly these nutrient-dense therapeutic supplements can help the body function as it was meant to and yields clinical results. \"It's not a pill...it's a food tablet.\" ~ Dr. Aubrey Madsen 1. Food just ain't what it used to be. There has been much talk over the past few decades about soil depletion because of the modern techniques used in commercially grown produce. The vitamin, mineral, and phytochemical content of fruits and vegetables available in grocery stores today have significantly less nutritional value than produce grown hundreds of years ago and even just decades ago. [Read More](/food-just-aint-what-it-used-to-be/) 2. We don't know how to eat better. Modern American eating habits are incredibly morphed from how humans were meant to eat. Fast paced lives have necessitated a convenience never before seen with fast food options, microwave dinners, and instant snacks and meals. Just as our fruits and vegetables are lacking needed nutrient levels, so are these other \"food-like products\" our diets are made of. So from the get-go, dare we say, all of us are ending each day in a severe nutrient deficient state. [Read More](/we-dont-know-how-to-eat-better/) 3. We don't have time to eat better. As ideal as it would be, always planning and fixing balanced nutritious meals that taste great is not realistic for many people. Dozens of things seem to occupy our time and easily eliminate the opportunity. Making homemade bread from freshly ground grains, finding healthy recipes and their ingredients at the store; chopping, cooking and preparing vegetables takes extra time and energy that most people don't have. [Read More](/we-dont-have-time-to-eat-better/) 4. We don't even WANT to eat better. There are some foods that are uniquely nourishing and healing in ways that don't really compare to other foods. The problem is, no one wants to eat them. We primarily consume the muscle tissue of animals but hunter-gatherers and many other cultures throughout the history of time did something many today would find utterly discussing. They ate organ meats. Some of these highly prized foods like heart, liver, brain, tongue, pancreas, thymus gland, kidneys, and stomach lining were consumed on a regular basis. [Read More](/we-dont-even-want-to-eat-better/) NO PAIN, NO GAIN? Well, maybe not. Standard Process and Mediherb products are packed full of the many foods we don't want to eat, simply can't find in the average grocery store, and frankly, healthy foods most people haven't even heard of; like Spanish Black Radish. Whole food supplements can be one of the cheapest, most convenient and painless ways to start to regain and maintain your optimal health today. Dr. Madsen can help you navigate your healing journey and prescribe the products your body needs the most. Want to find out which systems your body needs nutritional help with the most?

One of the most important things to understand about vitamin and mineral supplementation is that not all supplements are built the same. In fact, some are actually toxic for the body. Whole food supplements contain, well, just that. Whole foods. This is important because nature has provided highly complex food structures with many components that rely on each other to be properly utilized by the body. Some of these components include proteins, enzymes, coenzymes, bioflavonoids, trace elements and factors yet to be discovered. It is very common in the supplement industry to isolate these components from their original whole food source but doing so renders them unable to do their job in the body. Isolating nutrients from their original state is like expecting to tell time from looking at the face of a clock with no hands. For example, vitamin c is a beautiful complex structure in nature, as found in an orange or carrot. Ascorbic acid is only one part of the whole complex of vitamin c. Consuming supplements with only ascorbic acid leaves ascorbic acid unable to complete its full responsibilities and of course you don't get the benefits of the other vitamin c components. In essence, you are deprived of the optimal healing potential vitamin c can offer. As Dr. Madsen likes to say, \"You don't make a cookie with just flour.\" Another factor to consider with whole food supplements verses synthetic isolates is the dosage or concentration of a nutrient and potential harm. Consuming high doses of isolated nutrients, as found in most supplement formulas, is not natural and the body deals with them more like it would a pharmaceutical drug. Vitamin E is a perfect example of a nutrient that, if consumed in high doses of its isolated form (alpha tocopherol), can be toxic and does more harm than good. There have been no adverse effects seen with consuming vitamin e in food, which provides a proper concentration of the vitamin. However, consuming high doses of alpha tocopherol in supplement form can cause hemorrhaging and blood clotting problems. Isolated nutrients are never found by themselves in nature. We can't go out to a tree and pick a bowl of alpha tocopherol so we shouldn't be swallowing it in high dose pill form. Whole food supplements are the easiest, least expensive, most convenient way to obtain optimal nutrition amongst the modern diet of nutrient deficient processed foods. Standard Process supplements are filled with organ meats, organic vegetables, healthy grains and oils. To buy these foods would cost an enormous amount of time, money and for most of us, pain...of having to eat them. Organic whole food supplements not only fill in the nutritional gaps that our modern day diets cannot supply but also support and heal organs so they can return to their true function. When organs function properly, everything else can function properly; hormones, digestion, even brain function and mood. Energy Work We always look for ways to increase our energy levels. While there are some quick fixes such as coffee and energy drinks, they help only a couple of hours. There are also natural practices that can increase energy levels. For example, getting more sleep and seeing a chiropractor in Kaysville can both increase your energy levels. If you experience the following, then it is time to consider a boost of your current energy levels using chiropractic care: - Feeling sluggish - Constantly trying to catch up - Fatigued no matter how many hours of sleep you get Massage Therapy and Chiropractic Work Hand-in-Hand to Boost Energy Regular massages and routine chiropractic adjustments improve overall wellness, which in turn boosts energy. Chiropractors use massage therapy in tandem with chiropractic treatment regularly. Muscle activation. Massage therapy manipulates the soft tissues like muscles, ligaments, and tendons. This improves blood circulation and flow, which warms the soft tissues. As a result, muscles loosen and relax. Muscle activation ensures we have more elasticity and function, which prevents the likelihood of spasm post-adjustment. That is one of the reasons why massage and chiropractic care are such great complements. General wellness. Massage therapy relaxes the body, decreases stress, and reduces anxiety. This aids in chiropractic treatment in that the body is relaxed and calm. A chiropractor in collaboration with massage therapy helps breaks down built-up toxins. This clams the body, which helps to relieve stress and anxiety. Blood circulation. Chiropractic treatment and massage therapy in collaboration improve blood circulation. Consequently, our body system feels rejuvenated and healed. Improved circulation of blood in the lymph and interstitial fluids is critical to the natural homeostasis throughout the body. Quick recovery. Quick recovery, especially from conditions of pain, brings us to a state of boosted energy. Chiropractors also employ muscle activation to simultaneously tackle multiple origins of pain. In collaboration, chiropractic care and massage therapy gets us back to a state of health and well-being as quickly as possible.

Low Level Lasers Our Office is Excited to Provide Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) Low level laser therapy is an FDA approved medical technology that has been used for over 40 years to relieve pain, remove scars, heal wounds, regenerate nerves and solve addictions. Erchonica, the first U.S. low level laser therapy company, received FDA clearance in 2002 through the gold standard \"double blind\" clinical trial. These Erchonia lasers are used here at True Function. Over 2000 published studies exist on LLLT, all reporting no negative side effects. Visit www.erchonia.com for in depth research. According to FDA studies, LLLT helps tissues such as muscle, skin, and nerve to heal 66% faster. It addresses medical conditions in a multifaceted way by restoring proper function to cells through many mechanisms. As a result, pain levels and range of motion can improve quickly. Any physical trauma will cause the body to respond by restricting movement. This is done to prevent the injured tissue from aggregating. Fewer neuropeptides are released and blood and oxygen flow is restricted, all of which slows the body's healing process. Laser therapy speeds recovery by stimulating the nervous system, suppresses inflammation, increases oxygen and blood flow, improves muscles' ability to utilize calcium, and increases neurotransmitter release. As a diverse tool, low level lasers work on multiple healing levels to more quickly and effectively heal medical conditions. How does LLLT work? Our body cells have the built-in ability to respond to light. They do this through a process called photochemistry which involves biochemical reactions when photons of light energy are absorbed. Deep within the cell's energy factory (the mitochondria) are receptors capable of absorbing certain parameters of light. These receptors, instead of absorbing a prescription medication as a drug receptor does, they absorb light. Once photons of light have connected with these light receptors, a chemical reaction takes place within the cell. During a laser treatment, light is absorbed by these receptors. In order for the body to carry out any process, including repairing injured body tissues, it needs energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Creating ATP is the job of the mitochondria who also houses the light receptors. When low level lasers are used on injuries, the mitochondria of those injured tissue cells produces slightly more ATP thereby boosting the cells' energy and ability to heal. This increased energy enhances a cascade of other chemical reactions needed in the healing process; protein and growth factor synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, increased blood and oxygen flow, it even prevents cells from dying. Being able to improve multiple cellular impairments with one therapeutic modality makes LLLT a very efficient and effective healing strategy. BONUS! Additional benefits other than those intended for the condition being treated are often seen when using alternative therapies. LLLT is no different. The increased ATP production occurs not just locally at the sight of laser application, but \"systemically\" throughout the entire body. There is a growing number of symptoms that seem to respond to LLLT that is continually being researched. Can a laser pointer do the same thing? Although a laser pointer is an actual laser, there are a few major factors that come into play in order to obtain therapeutic effects. Laser therapy and pharmaceutical drugs have similarities in how they work in the body. The correct molecular structure of a drug is required for therapeutic success and the correct wavelength or color of a laser device must be used. Another aspect of laser therapy is dosage. Just as we need sufficient and proper dosing of a drug, we also need an appropriate dose of laser light. A laser pointer does not provide enough energy to be therapeutically beneficial. Conversely, clinical responses will not be obtained if lasers are too powerful and in fact may cause a damaging or an inhibitory response. Healing laser therapy must fall within specific parameters to be clinically beneficial. When should LLLT be used? Laser therapy should be applied immediately after an acute injury. How the brain functions in association with the injured tissue can change after trauma. The body's ability to do this is known as plasticity. This change in the function of how the brain controls the muscles and surrounding tissues is not optimal and can cause an acute injury to transition into a chronic state. Low level laser treatments can prevent this chronic condition by restoring range of motion, preventing injury progression on a cellular and chemical level, and even prevent muscles from becoming \"inactive\". This is why we sometimes use LLLT to activate muscles that have shut down. Laser therapy can certainly help heal long standing conditions, but is best utilized early and often after trauma to prevent the injured tissue from transferring to a chronic injury state. How long does treatment last? Low level laser therapy, especially when utilized with other musculoskeletal modalities (i.e. muscle activation, chiropractic adjustments, nutritional support) is addressing multiple root causes of an injury or condition and the healing benefits can potentially last until another injury occurs. Positive effects and symptom improvement can often happen immediately and last several weeks; but like many therapies, multiple treatments are required to fully resolve the remaining etiologies that produce pain. While laser therapy addresses healing at the chemical level, it is important to combine it with therapies that address the issue at the mechanical level such as muscle activation, chiropractic adjustments, etc. For long term results, joints or a group of muscles must have proper mechanical function or the cascade of chemical responses will start all over again. TOP 10 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS of Low Level Laser Therapy Anti-Inflammatory - dilates blood vessels and activates the lymphatic drainage system to reduce swelling in areas of trauma or inflammation. Anti-Pain (Analgesic) - multiple pain reducing effects: partially blocks neural transmission of pain signals to the brain, decreases nerve sensitivity, produces high levels of pain killing chemicals (endorphins, enkephalins and opioids) from the brain and adrenal glands. Accelerated Tissue Repair and Cell Growth - photons of light emitted from lasers penetrate deep into tissues and accelerate cellular reproduction and growth, increased energy is available to the cell from increased ATP production (the cell is then able to take on nutrients faster and get rid of waste products), all cells repair faster including ligament, tendon, and muscle cells. Improved Vascular Activity - increased formation of new capillaries and vasodilation (diameter of blood vessels increases) improves the delivery of blood and healing elements to damaged tissues. Increased Metabolic Activity - stimulates a higher out-put of specific pro-healing enzymes in blood cells, nutrient and oxygen delivery is improved. Trigger Points and Acupuncture Points - stimulates muscle trigger points and acupuncture points on a non-invasive level which helps relieve musculoskeletal pain. Reduced Fibrous Tissue Formation - reduces formation of scar tissue following tissue damage from cuts, scratches, burns, surgery, etc. Improved Nerve Function - speeds up axonal regeneration and nerve cell reconnection, increases the amplitude of action potentials to optimize muscle action. Immunoregulation - stimulates production of immunoglobulins and lymphocytes, helps white blood cells more easily enter damaged tissue. Faster Wound Healing - stimulates fibroblast (building blocks of collagen, needed for wound healing) development in damaged tissue, collagen is required to replace old or injured tissue, low level laser therapy is effective on open wounds and burns. Muscle Activation Why Would I Need Muscle Activation? Proper functioning muscles are crucial for everything we do in life from sitting down in a chair to executing an intricate gymnastics routine. What most people don't understand is that muscles can be functioning improperly; where the muscle can't fully lock down or contract. In the office, we call this \"shut down\". The message from the brain to the muscle is disrupted and can be restored through muscle activation. Muscle activation is an acupressure (not acupuncture, there are no needles involved) technique that corrects muscle dysfunction and imbalances that result from injury and promotes the body's ability to carry out physical tasks. It supports traditional chiropractic care and addresses the root cause of musculoskeletal conditions. Muscle activation tends to be a quicker, more permanent solution to a myriad of muscle and joint problems. In many cases, frequent chiropractic treatments for long periods of time are typically not necessary to resolve these conditions. How Do Muscles Become Inactive? - Physical Injuries - Emotional Trauma - Nutritional Deficiencies - Fascial Adhesions Consequences of Inactive Muscles: When muscles become inactive, other surrounding muscles are left to compensate. It's like having a factory of 100 workers but only 10 are doing their job. Those 10 workers will get tired and ornery. The muscles that are working will likewise become tired, achy, and be at an increased risk of injury. Trigger points or knots in the muscles may develop. Optimal blood flow to the involved set of muscles can be disrupted which reduces oxygen and other nutrients. Inactive muscles can also increase the risk of osteoarthritis. All of these things can just result in PAIN. Swelling may also be a result of inactive muscles in some situations. How Are Muscles Activated? Dr. Madsen activates muscles in a variety of ways according to what a particular muscle needs. Many times a series of acupressure points (not acupuncture, there are no needles involved) are used to active muscles. Each muscle has a \"recipe\" of 6 points that, when utilized, restore the muscle to its optimal function. If indicated, muscles may need nutritional supplementation. In this case, Dr. Madsen will prescribe organic whole food supplements that will need to be taken over the next few weeks. It is not uncommon for muscles to need to be activated by releasing trapped emotions. Clearing muscles of negative energy is done with simple steps. Often specific emotions can be found and released with the use of magnets or tapping. When fascial restrictions are inhibiting muscles from firing properly, Dr. Madsen will use a variety of fascial tools to release adhesions in the muscle tissue. Low level lasers are another way muscles may need to be activated. Osgood-Schlatters Treatment Osgood-Schlatter syndrome is a common problem experienced among young people, most especially among athletes. It can sometimes be a tricky problem to treat. At True Function Chiropractic and Health, serving Kaysville, UT, we are happy to offer treatment for this condition as well as others. Keep reading to learn about the services we can offer you. Osgood-Schlatter Syndrome is often seen in active boys between the ages of 10 and 14. This condition is understood to be caused by stress on the patella tendon. This tendon attaches the muscle located at the front of the thigh to the rest of the lower leg. The symptoms which manifest with this condition include swelling of the bony bump on the shinbone just below the knee. The area will feel tender and painful when the knee is used. This condition usually occurs during growth spurts or if there is stress from a repeated action. You can experience inflammation and even an avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity. What Symptoms Should I Look for? Often with this condition you will experience pain in one or both knees. You can also experience pain when straightening the leg or squatting. Going up and down stairs can also be painful. You will notice this pain decreases when you rest the leg. How Can Chiropractic Care Help? If you visit a chiropractor for this condition, you will most likely have an x-ray or an MRI of the area done. This can help the doctor to pinpoint the exact cause of your pain and give you a correct diagnosis. Treatment options for this problem can include rest and ice until the inflammation subsides enough for treatment. Once the inflammation has gone down, the doctor will be able to conduct therapies such as cross friction and PIR stretching. Low level laser therapy has also been shown to be effective for this condition as well. As the condition becomes less painful, stretching and strengthening exercises can be incorporated. These muscle activation exercises will focus on the quadriceps, hamstring, and calf muscles. With appropriate treatment, the patient can be expected to return to normal activities. Some patients find that using an infra-patella strap is useful for relieving pressure on the tendon. In addition to these treatments, your chiropractor can also give you counseling on how to better care for your body during athletics and adolescent growth spurts to avoid future strains, breaks, or injuries.
