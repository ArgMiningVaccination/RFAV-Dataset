For Massachusetts, this includes Cape Cod and the islands. EPA's New England administrator, Curt Spalding, states that \"EPA and the medical community suggest that people limit their strenuous outdoor activity.\" Ground-level ozone is expected to exceed healthy limits which prompted the official warning by the EPA. Children and those with respiratory conditions are at the highest risk of damage due to elevated ozone levels. Nearly all of the high ozone level days have occurred in July for New England. However, areas of Connecticut such as Cornwall, Danbury, and Middletown had elevated levels of ozone as early as May. Other areas getting hit by high ozone levels in May include Acadia NP (Cadillac Mountain) in Maine, the Ware area in Massachusetts, and Miller State Park in New Hampshire. Vermont has not had a single day of high ozone levels, Massachusetts has had 9 days exceeding healthy limits, and Connecticut tops the list with 17 days reaching hazardous levels to human health. The highest readings of ozone were recorded in Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts on July 4. For Massachusetts, Martha's Vineyard exceeded healthy limits 5 times between June and July followed by Fairhaven at four times and East Milton, Truro, and Ware at two times. Areas of Connecticut exceeding healthy limits several times were Greenwich, Stratford, Westport, Danbury, Madison, and Middletown. First Lady Michelle Obama, Dr. Jill Biden, and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced a new preventative health care program wherein many medical services will be provided by insurance companies without a deductible, co-pay, or co-insurance. The estimated cost savings by initiating preventative healthcare is expected to exceed $100 billion per year. Over 100,000 deaths per year will be prevented by increasing access to \"colorectal and breast cancer screening, flu vaccines, counseling to help them quit smoking, and regular aspirin use to prevent stroke,\" according to Secretary Sebelius. As of September 23, 2010, new rules will force private health insurance plans to remove the extras fees such as deductibles and co-pays for preventative healthcare services on new health insurance plans. These rules are a direct result of the comprehensive helath care reform package that was recently signed into law by President Obama. Michelle Obama noted that \"too many people aren't getting the checkups and screenings they need to prevent cancer.\" She adds that this reform will help lower costs and hold insurance companies accountable and \"it will give our families the security that our insurance coverage will be there when we need it most.\" Michelle Obama notes that healthcare reform \"makes it illegal to drop your coverage when you get sick or to drop your children from a plan due to a preexisting condition\" and that \"the best way to control healthcare costs is to prevent people from getting sick.\" She listed a few of the services that will no longer be subject to co-pays and deductibles on new private healthcare insurance plans: high blood pressure treatment, measuring BMI (body mass index), mammograms, colonoscopies, cervical screenings, childhood immunizations. Michelle Obama paid special attention to BMI measurements as a means to reduce childhood obesity noting that this health issue is urgently needing attention. Workers helping to clean up the oil spill are at high risk due to direct exposure from chemicals and toxic vapors near areas where the oil plumes are surfacing. Chemical dispersants used by BP in the cleaning process pose health risks as do vapors such as benzene, one of the volatile hydrocarbons in oil. One concern is that BP is using Corexit 9500 as a chemical dispersant. It is toxic at 2.61 PPM (parts per million) and can go through a phase transition from liquid to gas and return to earth as toxic rain. It is estimated the BP has released over 1,000,000 gallons of dispersant. Crude Oil Exposure Blanca Laffron, a genetic toxicologist and her colleagues from the University of Coru\u00f1a in Spain, notes that studies show that exposure to crude oil from coated birds and from cleaning rocks and beaches for under five days causes temporary DNA aberrations. However, workers exposed for several months contract permanent chromosomal DNA damage. Continuing education and research into long-term exposure will inform doctors and nursing professionals as to proper medical protocols for future healthcare. Government Warning The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued continuing educational warnings on air quality, food, water, and chemical dispersants. CDC warns that upon smelling gas or visibly spotting smoke from nearby fires one should \"stay indoors, set your air conditioner to reuse indoor air, and avoid continuing physical activities that put extra demands on your lungs and heart.\" CDC warns to avoid swimming, boating, and fishing near affected areas and to avoid contact with the oil spill dispersants which are used to break the oil slick into small droplets. Dispersant Controversy The EPA and the US Coast Guard have authorized BP for continuing use of dispersants at the underwater location of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The EPA notes that smaller droplets formed by dispersants will biodegrade faster than untreated crude oil. The EPA has also released a directive for BP to \"significantly scale back the overall use of dispersants\" and to \"analyze potential alternative dispersants for toxicity\" to \"determine whether a less toxic, more alternative dispersant existed in the quantities necessary to address this crisis.\" EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson wrote to BP that she and Admiral Landry of the Coast Guard maintain that \"...your response to the directive was insufficient. We believe the response lacked sufficient analysis and focused more on defending your initial decisions than on analyzing possible better options.\" EPA is asking BP for continuing education and research into dispersant alternatives and BP maintains that Corexit 9500 is the best option. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) reports that their ongoing study reveals that children who get an MMRV vaccine are \"twice as likely to have a febrile seizure 7-10 days after getting the shot than children who get MMR and varicella vaccines (2 shots) at the same health care visit.\" These concerns affect doctors and nurses concerning publich health and education policies. The MMRV shot is the measles-mumps-rubella-chickenpox combination vaccine and febrile means \"relating to fever.\" MMRV vs. MMR Safety The MMRV vaccine caused 77 febrile seizures out of a sample size of 63,000 children. That is a rate of approximately 1.2 children out of every 1,000 who will have seizures due to the vaccine. The study also looked at children who received the MMR vaccine and a separate V vaccine on the same day instead of the four-in-one combination vaccine. The MMR + V two-shot combination caused 174 febrile seizures out of a sample size of 376,000 children. This is approximately 1 child out of every 2,000 who experience this adverse side effect. The four-in-one MMRV has approximately doubled the chance that a child will have a febrile seizure compared with the two shot combination of MMR + V. The CDC also notes that \"children who receive the MMR vaccine are more likely to have febrile seizures 8-14 days after vaccination than children who are not vaccinated at all.\" ProQuad is the trade name for the MMRV vaccine produced by Merk pharmaceuticals. It is licensed for use in children from the ages of 12 months to 12 years old. One in five children have the following side effects from the vaccine: soreness or swelling at the injection site, fever, and rash. The MMRV four-in-one combination shot has a higher incidence of fever and rash compared with using 2 separate shots (MMR + V) to achieve the same level of vaccination protection. The CDC notes that \"febrile seizures cannot be prevented\" due to the MMRV vaccine. with the chickenpox vaccine (varicella). It is often given to children between 1 and 2 years of age. ProQuad side effects are rare but include allergic reactions, difficulty breathing and closing of the throat, hives, weakness, paleness, dizziness, a rapid heart beat, deafness, long-term seizures, coma, brain damage, febrile seizures, acute and chronic arthritis, and a temporarily low platelet count. MMR Vaccine Development The measles and mumps component of the vaccine are grown in hens' eggs and from chicken embryo cell cultures. These strains of the virus are less virulent than those affecting human cells and are therefore called attenuated strains. The rubella (German measles) component of the vaccine is propagated using a cell line developed from human embryonic lung tissue originally from aborted human fetuses. Chickenpox-Only Vaccine The chickenpox component of the vaccine (varicella) contains live attenuated virus. In the US, 9.7 million doses of the chickenpox-only vaccine were distributed between 1995 and 1998. 6,580 reports of adverse effects were reported and only 4% were determined to be serious side effects. About of the side effects occurred in children under the age of 10. Rashes were the most commonly reported side effect. Serious side effects were rare but included encephalitis, ataxia, erythema herpes zoster. Public Health Policy Public health policy weighs the risks of contracting measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox against the risks of adverse effects due to vaccinations. The CDC opines that the dangers of illness due contracting the live diseases is greater than the risk of side effects due to vaccinations. The FDA is responsible for approving the types of vaccines made available to the US public. Evidence suggests that separate vaccines for each disease may be safer than combination vaccines. In Japan, MMR vaccination has been discontinued and has been replaced with single vaccines for each disease. Many healthcare professionals in the US are concerned that if individual vaccines are made available that many children will not receive immunizations for all four diseases. Therefore, a combination vaccine ensures that children are protected from measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox simultaneously without any risk that they may not receive all of these shots individually. However, this also increases the risk of side effects due to the vaccination process. Nursing professionals and doctors can base their educational recommendations on balance between broader public health concerns and the individual health concerns of each patient. The CPSC (US Consumer Product Safety Commission), in cooperation with Sprout Stuff of Austin, Texas; has recalled 40 Sprout Stuff infant ring slings. The CPSC urges consumers to discontinue use of these slings since they pose a risk of suffocation to infants. A 10 day old boy in Texas died due to the use of this sling. Consumers can get a full refund for these slings from the company. They sold for about $35 to $45 from October 2006 to May 2007 and were sold directly from the manufacturer. The company is working to contact all purchasers. This recall follows on the heels of other major recalls for baby sling carriers. The CPSC previously recalled 1,200 Ellaroo Ring Sling baby carriers, 165 ZoloWear Infant Carriers/Slings, and approximately 100,000 Infantino SlingRider infant carriers. In general, infant baby slings present two suffocation dangers. Since babies cannot control their heads in the first few months of life due to weak musculature, the sling can press against the nose and mouth. This can lead to suffocation within one to two minutes. Also, the sling may rest the baby in a curled position with the chin bending toward the chest. In this scenario, airways are restricted and the baby cannot cry for help while slowly suffocating. The CPSC has also noted that improper use of even the best sling carriers for infants is dangerous. The US CPSC provides important instructions on proper use. The CPSC \"recommends that parents and caregivers make sure the infant's face is not covered and is visible at all times to the sling's wearer. If nursing the baby (is) in a sling, change the baby's position after feeding so the baby's head is facing up and is clear of the sling and the mother's body.\" Frequent checking of the baby's position is urged, especially after nursing. \"CPSC has determined that a mandatory standard is needed for infant sling carriers. While a mandatory standard is being developed, CPSC staff is working with ASTM International to quickly develop an effective voluntary standard for slings. There currently are no safety standards for infant sling carriers.\" Below is a photo of the Sprout Stuff sling that has been recalled and the other diagrams demonstrate proper and improper ways to use a baby sling. The diagrams are provided by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with Sony Electronics Inc. of San Diego, California; has recalled 233,000 Sony VAIO laptop computers due to the possibility of burn hazards. The computers may overheat and reports of units overheating resulting in deformed keyboards and casings prompted the recall. The overheating problem is caused by a malfunction of the computer's internal temperature management system. These computers were sold from January 2010 to April 2010 at places such as: Best Buy, Sony Style, Costco, Frys, and Amazon.com . They came in many colors and are part of the VPCF11 and VPCCW2 series of notebook computers. Owners can check with Sony to see if their computer is part of the recall at telephone number 866-496-7669. These computers were manufactured in China and the United States, have VAIO clearly marked on the outside panel, and it is illegal to resell the affected units. The US CPSC urges consumers to discontinue using these units and to perform an update on the BIOS firmware to remedy this hazard. Consumers can call Sony or visit a Sony Style retail store for help with installing the update. This firmware update fixes the overheating problem in all of the affected computers. To date, no injuries have been reported. However, both Sony and the US CPSC warm against using these computers until the firmware update has been performed. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) has asked permission for a rate hike of up to 15% for nearly 200,000 individual subscribers. Hikes for group subscribers will range from 8-12%. The premium increase must be approved by the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation for it to take effect. BCBSM claims that they will lose over $50 million dollars without the hike. This may come as a surprise to many policy holders since Michigan's insurance commissioner approved a 22% increase last year for both individual and group policy holders. Despite the increase, BCBSM claims to have lost nearly $100 million last year. Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox has questioned the loss claims since BCBSM increased its surplus by $528 million in 2009. That is profit on top of the already $2 billion surplus that the company holds. Cox has also questioned the purported losses because the State of Michigan gives the company $100 million in tax breaks every year to help control costs and prevent losses. Last year, Attorney General Cox asked Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan pointed questions about their finances. In a letter to BCBSM, Cox asked about bonuses and salaries to board members, perks such as entertainment expenses, and the total value of the BCBSM art collection. Cox also asked for BCBSM to state the amount of funds transferred to affiliated companies. The Attorney General estimated the transfer of funds out of BCBSM to be over $450 million since 2005. Such a transfer would then show up as a loss for the company even though the funds are received by affiliates. This line of inquiry shows that the Michigan Attorney General suspects clever accounting techniques and financial manipulation to help show a loss for BCBSM. At the same time, Michigan Congressmen John D. Dingell and Sander Levin questioned Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan President and CEO Daniel J. Loepp about proposed rate hikes. The Congressmen asked questions concerning how much of the rate hikes will go towards paying benefits to subscribers, why the BCBSM massive surplus is not used to offset any losses, and what types of bonuses did employees making more than $500,000 per year receive. This line of inquiring was partially triggered by BCBSM paying enormous bonuses to executives prior to announcing a reduction of its workforce, salary freezes, and rate hikes. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan CEO Leopp had a 23% increase in salary in 2009 to $1.12 million. However, his bonus pay has now dropped to approximately $650,000 down from last year's $888,269. The FDA has just approved a new treatment for advanced prostate cancer. The FDA has approved Provenge, a cellular immunotherapy drug. It is the first drug approved by the FDA in its class. Provenge works by stimulating the body's own immune system to attack the cancer. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer amoung men in the U.S and prostate cancer is the second most common form. The National Cancer Institute reports that in 2009 approximately 27,000 men died from prostate cancer and 192,000 new cases were reported. Provenge is manufactured using the patient's blood. Immune cells from the blood sample are processed to enhance their ability to fight cancer in a process known as leukapheresis. The cells are then re-administered to the patient intravenously in three doses. The FDA was prompted to approve this therapy following a study of 512 patients with advanced prostate cancer. Patients taking Provenge lived an average of 4 months longer than those who did not receive the treatment. Nearly every patient who received the Provenge therapy experienced adverse reactions including back pain, joint pain, chills, fatigue, fever, headache, nausea, or stroke. Provenge costs $93,000 for a total of three required dosages. President Obama has nominated Donald Berwick to run Medicare and Medicaid. Dr. Berwick, M.D., M.P.P. is a Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard School of Public Health, a pediatrician, President of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), and a consultant in pediatrics to Massachusetts General Hospital. He is widely published on the topic of health care systems with a focus on improving access to quality medical care. His books include Curing Health Care, New Rules: Regulation, and Markets and the Quality of American Health Care. His scientific articles have been published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, The British Medical Journal, and many other prestigious medical periodicles. President Clinton appointed Dr. Berwick to serve on the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Healthcare Industry. He received his MD from Harvard Medical School and his MPP from the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Dr. Berwick is controversial for the statement, \"...any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized and humane must, must redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and the less fortunate. Excellent health care is, by definition, redistributional.\" Central medical ideas to the IHI and Dr. Berwick are no needless deaths, pain, or suffering; no waiting, no waste, and access to medical care for all. He has numerous awards and honors for his achievements in healthcare including the Heinz Award for Public Policy, the Award of Honor from the American Hospital Association, and the Alfred I. DuPont Award. Many of Dr. Berwicks's achievements seek to not only improve the quality of medical care but also to improve the safety of the healthcare setting for both patients and healthcare workers. "}
