The regulated substance inputs are reconciled with delivery receipts by measurement of the tank inventory volume before and after delivery; d. Deliveries are made through a drop tube that extends to within one foot [0.30 meters] of the tank bottom; e. Product dispensing is metered and recorded within the local standards for meter calibration or an accuracy of six cubic inches [98.32 milliliters] for every five gallons [18.93 liters] of product withdrawn; and f. The measurement of any water level in the bottom of the tank is made to the nearest one-eighth of an inch [3.05 millimeters] at least once a month. (NOTE: Practices described in the American Petroleum Institute Publication 1621, \"Recommended Practice for Bulk Liquid Stock Control at Retail Outlets\", may be used, where applicable, as guidance in meeting the requirements.) 2.

Level measurements are based on an average of two consecutive stick readings at both the beginning and ending of the period; c. The equipment used is capable of measuring the level of product over the full range of the tank's height to the nearest one-eighth of an inch [3.05 millimeters); d. A leak is suspected and subject to the requirements of sections 33-24-08-40 through 33-24-08-43 if the variation between beginning and ending measurements exceeds the weekly or monthly standards in the following table: Nominal Tank Weekly Standard Monthly Standard Capacity (one test) (average of four tests) 550 gallons or less 10 gallons 5 gallons 551-1,000 gallons 13 gallons 7 gallons 1,001-2,000 gallons 26 gallons 13 gallons; and e. Only tanks of five hundred fifty gallons [2081.98 liters] or less nominal capacity may use this as the sole method of release detection. Tanks of five hundred fifty-one to two thousand gallons [2085. 76 to 7570.80 liters] may use the method in place of manual inventory control in subsection 1 of section 33-24-08-33. Tanks of greater than two thousand gallons [7570.80 liters] nominal capacity may not use this method to meet the requirements of sections 33 24 08 40 33-24-08-30 through 33 24 08-45 33-24-08-35. 3. Tank tightness testing.

Testing or monitoring for vapors within the soil gas of the excavation zone must meet the following requirements: a. The materials used as backfill are sufficiently porous (~ for example, gravel, sand, crushed rock) to readily allow diffusion of vapors from releases into the excavation area; b. The stored regulated substance, or a tracer compound placed in the tank system, is sufficiently volatile (~ for example, gasoline) to result in a vapor level that is detectable by the monitoring devices located in the excavation zone in the event of a release from the tank; c. The measurement of vapors by the monitoring device is not rendered inoperative by the ground water, rainfall, or soil moisture or other known interferences so that a release could go undetected for more than thirty days; d. The level of background contamination in the excavation zone will not interfere with the method used to detect releases from the tank; e. The vapor monitors are designed and operated to detect any significant increase in concentration above background of the regulated substance stored in the tank system, a component or components of that substance, or a tracer compound placed in the tank system; f. In the underground storage tank excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements in subdivisions a through d and to establish the number and positioning of monitoring wells that will detect releases within the excavation zone from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product; and g. Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering. 6. Ground water monitoring. Testing or monitoring for liquids on the ground water must meet the following requirements: a. The regulated substance stored is immiscible in water and has a specific gravity of less than one; 32 b. Ground water is never more than twenty feet [6.07 meters] from the ground surface and the hydraulic conductivity of the soils between the underground storage tank system and the monitoring wells or devices is not less than one one-hundredths centimeter per second (e:g-: for example, the soil should consist of gravels, coarse to medium sands, coarse silts or other permeable materials); c. The slotted portion of the monitoring well casing must be designed to prevent migration of natural soils or filter pack into the well and to allow entry of regulated substance on the water table into the well under both high and low ground water conditions; d. Monitoring wells must be sealed from the ground surface to the top of the filter pack; e. Monitoring wells or devices intercept the excavation zone or are as close to it as is technically feasible; f. The continuous monitoring devices or manual methods used can detect the presence of at least one-eighth of an inch [3.05 millimeters] of free product on top of the ground water in the monitoring wells; g. Within and immediately below the underground storage tank system excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements in subdivisions a through e and to establish the number and positioning of monitoring wells or devices that will detect releases from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product; and h. Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering. 7. Interstitial monitoring. Interstitial monitoring between the underground storage tank system and a secondary barrier immediately around or beneath it may be used, but only if the system is designed, constructed, and installed to detect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product and also meets one of the following requirements: a. For double-walled underground storage tank systems, the sampling or testing method can detect a release through the inner wall in any portion of the tank that routinely contains product; (NOTE: The provisions outlined in the Steel Tank Institute's \"Standard for Dual Wall Underground Storage Tanks\" may be used as guidance for aspects of the design and construction of underground steel double-walled tanks.) 33 b. For underground storage tank systems with a secondary barrier within the excavation zone, the sampling or testing method used can detect a release between the underground storage tank system and the secondary barrier; (1) The secondary barrier around or beneath the underground storage tank system consists of artificially constructed material that is sufficiently thick and impermeable (at least 1 o-s centimeter per second for the regulated substance stored) to direct a release to the monitoring point and permit its detection; (2) The barrier is compatible with the regulated substance stored so that a release from the underground storage tank system will not cause a deterioration of the barrier allowing a release to pass through undetected; (3) For cathodically protected tanks, the secondary barrier must be installed so that it does not interfere with the proper operation of the cathodic protection system; (4) The ground water, soil moisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling method used inoperative so that a release could go undetected for more than thirty days; (5) The site is assessed to ensure that the secondary barrier is always above the ground water and not in a twenty-five-year floodplain, unless the barrier and monitoring designs are for use under such conditions; and (6) Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering. c. For tanks with an internally fitted liner, an automated device can detect a release between the inner wall of the tank and the liner, and the liner is compatible with the substance stored. 8. Other methods. Any other type of release detection method, or combination of methods, can be used if: a. It can detect a two-tenths gallon [. 76 liter] per hour leak rate or a release of one hundred fifty gallons [567.81 liters] within a month with a probability of detection of ninety-five hundredths and a probability of false alarm of five one-hundredths; or b. The department may approve another method if the owner and operator can demonstrate that the method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed in subsections 3 through 8. In comparing methods, the department shall consider 34 the size of release the method can detect and the frequency and reliability with which it can be detected. If the method is approved, the owner and operator must comply with any conditions imposed by the department on its use to ensure the protection of human health and the environment.

History: Effective August 1, 1980; amended effective June 1, 1983; May 1, 1990; June 1, 1997; January Permit applications -Criteria for permit approval or denial. 1. The commission will not issue the permit if any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant is currently in violation of any law or rule of this state, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [Pub. L. 95-87; 91 Stat. 445; 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.], or any law or rule in any state enacted under federal law or regulation pertaining to air or water environmental protection, incurred in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation, or if any of the following are outstanding: a. Delinquent civil penalties under North Dakota Century Code sections 38-12.1-08 and 38-14.1-32, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [Pub. L. 95-87; 91 Stat. 445; 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.], or any law or rule in any state enacted under federal law or regulation pertaining to air or water environmental protection, incurred in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation. b. Bond forfeitures where violations upon which the forfeitures were based have not been corrected. c. Delinquent abandoned mine reclamation fees. d. Unabated violations of federal and state laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation. e. Unresolved federal and state failure-to-abate cessation orders. f. Unresolved imminent harm cessation orders. 2. If a current violation exists, the commission will require the applicant or person who owns or controls the applicant, before the permit is issued, to: a. Submit proof that the violation has been or is being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation; or b. Establish that the applicant, or any person owned or controlled by either the applicant or any person who owns or controls the applicant, has filed and is presently pursuing, in good faith, a direct administrative or judicial appeal to contest the validity of that violation. If the administrative or judicial authority either 168 denies a stay applied for in the appeal or affirms the violation, then any operations being conducted under a permit issued under this section must immediately cease, until the provisions of subdivision a are satisfied. 3. Any permit issued on the basis of proof submitted under subdivision a of subsection 2 that a violation is being corrected, or pending the outcome of an appeal under subdivision b of subsection 2, will be conditionally issued. 4. The commission will not issue a permit if it finds the applicant, anyone who owns or controls the applicant, or the operator specified in the application, controls or has controlled surface coal mining and reclamation operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations of any law or rule of this state, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [Pub. L. 95-87; 91 Stat. 445; 30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.], or any state or federal program approved under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, of such nature and duration, and with resulting irreparable damage to the environment as to indicate an intent not to comply with those laws, rules, or programs. The applicant, anyone who owns or controls the applicant, or the operator must be given an opportunity for hearing on the determination under North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-30. 5. After an application is deemed ready for approval, but before the permit is issued, the commission's decision to approve or disapprove the application will be made, based on the compliance review required by subsection 1, in light of any new information submitted under subsection 2 of section 69-05.2-06-01 and subsection 6 of section 69-05.2-06-02. 6. In addition to the requirements of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-21, no permit or significant revision will be approved, unless the application affirmatively demonstrates and the commission finds, in writing, on the basis of information in the application or otherwise available, which is documented in the approval and made available to the applicant, that: a. The permit area is not on any lands subject to the prohibitions or limitations of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-07 or the area has met the application review procedures of section 69 05.2 04 01 69-05.2-04-01.1. b. For alluvial valley floors: (1) The applicant has obtained either a negative determination; or 169 (2) If the permit area or adjacent area contains an alluvial valley floor: (a) The operations would be conducted according to chapter 69-05.2-25 and all applicable requirements of North Dakota Century Code chapter 38-14.1. (b) Any change in the use of the lands covered by the permit area from its premining use in or adjacent to alluvial valley floors will not interfere with or preclude the reestablishment of the essential hydrologic functions of the alluvial valley floor. (3) The significance of the impact of the operations on farming will be based on the relative importance of the vegetation and water of the developed grazed or hayed alluvial valley floor area to the farm's production, or any more stringent criteria established by the commission as suitable for site-specific protection of agricultural activities in alluvial valley floors. (4) Criteria for determining whether a mining operation will materially damage the quantity or quality of waters include: (a) Potential increases in the concentration of total dissolved solids of waters supplied\u00b7 to an alluvial valley floor to levels above the threshold value at which crop yields decrease, based on crop salt tolerance research studies approved by the commission, unless the applicant demonstrates compliance with subdivision e of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-21. (b) The increases in subparagraph a will not be allowed unless the applicant demonstrates, through testing related to local crop production that the operations will not decrease crop yields. (c) For types of vegetation specified by the commission and not listed in approved crop tolerance research studies, a consideration must be made of any observed correlation between total dissolved solids concentrations in water and crop yield declines. (d) Potential increases in the average depth to water saturated zones (during the growing season) within the root zone that would reduce the amount of subirrigated land compared to premining conditions. 170 (e) Potential decreases in surface flows that would reduce the amount of irrigable land compared to premining conditions. (f) Potential changes in the surface or ground water systems that reduce the area available to agriculture as a result of flooding or increased root zone saturation. (5) For the purposes of this subsection, a farm is one or more land units on which agricultural activities are conducted. A farm is generally considered to be the combination of land units with acreage [hectarage] and boundaries in existence prior to July 1, 1979, or, if established after July 1, 1979, with boundaries based on enhancement of the farm's agricultural productivity not related to mining operations. (6) If the commission determines the statutory exclusions of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 38-14.1-21 do not apply and that any of the findings required by this section cannot be made, the commission may, at the applicant's request: (a) Determine that mining is precluded and deny the permit without the applicant filing any additional information required by this section; or (b) Prohibit surface coal mining and reclamation operations in all or part of the area to be affected by mining. c. The applicant has, with respect to prime farmland, obtained either a negative determination or if the permit area contains prime farmlands: (1) The postmining land use will be cropland. (2) The permit specifically incorporates the plan submitted under section 69-05.2-09-15 after consideration of any revisions suggested by the natural resource conservation service. (3) The operations will be conducted in compliance with chapter 69-05.2-26 and other standards required by this article and North Dakota Century Code chapter 38-14. 1. (4) The permit demonstrates that the applicant has the technological capability to restore prime farmland, within a reasonable time, to equivalent or higher yields as nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices. 171 (5) The aggregate total prime farmland acreage will not be decreased from that which existed prior to mining based on the cooperative soil survey.

These principles must be applied to the individual's statements and information to determine if the requirements of good cause are met. The decisionmaking principles are: 1. The individual claiming good cause is responsible to show that good cause exists. 2. Uncorroborated statements of fact are less believable than corroborated statements. 3. Statements by persons with a reputation for being untruthful are less believable than similar statements by persons without that reputation. 4. A reputation for being untruthful exists if the files maintained by the department, the county agency, or the job opportunities and basic skills program eeerdiflater's agefley employment contractor contain evidence of untruthful statements made by the individual, or if the individual has made untruthful statements that are a matter of public record. 5. Statements by individuals with a reputation for failures or delays in furnishing information necessary for official action are less believable than similar statements by individuals without that reputation. 6. A reputation for failures or delays in furnishing information necessary for official action exists if the files maintained by the department, the county 183 agency, or the .a job opportunities and basic skills program eeereliAater's ageAey employment contractor contain evidence of any failure or delay, without good cause, to furnish reports, including monthly reports, necessary verifications, or a failure or delay in attending meetings or interviews intended to secure information necessary for official action. 7. A statement of fact, made by an individual with something to gain if that statement is regarded as true, is less believable than a similar statement made by an individual with little or nothing to gain. 8. An individual's explanations or reasons for claiming good cause must be judged by a prudent person concept. A prudent person is one who exercises those qualities of attention, knowledge, intelligence, and judgment that society requires of its members for protection of their own interests and the interests of others. 9. Statements of fact made by the individual claiming good cause, or by other individuals who support or oppose the claim of good cause, are not presumed to be either truthful or untruthful. Rather, statements of fact must be evaluated to determine if they are more likely than not or less likely than not to be true.

History: Effective December 9, 1996; amended effective July 1, 1997; June 1, 2002; June 1, 2005; January Income considerations. 1. All income that is actually available must be considered. Income is actually available when it is at the disposal of an applicant, recipient, or responsible relative when the applicant, recipient, or responsible relative has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make the sum available; or when the applicant, recipient, or responsible relative has the lawful power to make the income available or to cause the income to be made available. 2. It is presumed that all parental income is actually available to a child under twenty-one years of age. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that the child is: a. Living independently; or b. Living with a parent who is separated from the child's other parent, with or without court order, if the parents did not separate for the purpose of securing plan coverage. 3. As a condition of eligibility, an applicant, recipient, and financially responsible relative must take all necessary steps to obtain any annuities, pensions, retirement, and disability benefits to which they are entitled unless they can show good cause for not doing so. Annuities, pensions, retirement, and disability benefits include veterans' compensation and pensions; old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits; railroad retirement benefits; and unemployment compensation. a. Good cause under this section exists if receipt of the annuity, pension, retirement, or disability benefit would result in a loss of health insurance coverage. Good cause must be documented in the case file. b. Application for needs-based payments such as social security supplemental security income benefits or temporary aid to needy families benefits cannot be imposed as a condition of eligibility. 4. The financial responsibility of any individual for any other member of the plan unit will be limited to the responsibility of spouse for spouse and parents for children under age twenty-one or under age eighteen if the child is disabled. Such responsibility is imposed as a condition of plan eligibility. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the income of the spouse and parents is considered available even if that income is not actually contributed. Natural and adoptive parents, but not stepparents, are treated as parents. 210 5. Income may be received weekly, biweekly, monthly, intermittently, or annually. A monthly income amount must be computed by the department or county agency regardless of how often income is received. 6. The following types of income must be disregarded in determining eligibility for plan coverage: a. Supplemental security income benefits provided by the social security administration. b. Income disregards in section 75-02-02.1-38.2. 7. a. In determining ownership of income from a document, income must be considered available to each individual as provided in the document or in the absence of a specific provision in the document: (1) Income shall be considered available only to the individual if payment of the income was made solely to that individual; and (2) Income shall be considered available to each individual in proportion to the individual's interest if payment of income is made to more than one individual. b. One-half of income shall be considered available to each spouse in the case of income available to a married couple in which there is no document establishing ownership otherwise. c. Except in the case of income from a trust, the rules for determining ownership of income are superseded to the extent that the applicant or recipient can establish that the ownership interests are otherwise than as provided in subsection 6. 8. To determine the appropriate income level for a plan unit: a. The size of the household is increased by one for each unborn child of a household member; b. A child who is away at school is not treated as living independently, but is allowed a separate income level for one in addition to the income level applicable for the family unit remaining at home; c. A child who is living outside of the parental home but who is not living independently; or a spouse who is temporarily living outside of the home to attend training or college, to secure medical treatment, because of temporary work relocation required by an employer, or for other reasons beyond the control of the spouse, is 211 allowed a separate income level. This does not apply to situations in which an individual simply decides to live separately; d. An individual in a specialized facility is allowed a separate income level for one during all full calendar months in which the individual resides in the facility; e. An individual in a nursing facility is allowed a separate income level for one; and f. A recipient of home and community-based services is allowed a separate income level for one. 9. In afdef faf For a child to be eligible for plan coverage, the income remaining after allowing the appropriate disregards and deductions must be equal to or below ane t:lundFed fart,\u00b7 per:eent af tt:le fedeffll pavert,\u00b7 line the income level set by the department in accordance with state law and federal authorization, and must be based on the size of the household unless....Jf federal children's health insurance program funding decreases in \u00b7.vt:liet:l ease ... the department may decrease the income eligibility limit to accommodate the decrease in federal funding.
