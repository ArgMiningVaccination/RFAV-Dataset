It should be used as a guide in planning a course of study and meeting graduation requirements. It should not be regarded as a contract between students and Johnson State College, as JSC reserves the right to make changes in course offerings, degree requirements, charges, regulations and procedures as educational and financial considerations require. This catalog takes effect August 1, 2015, and remains in effect until superseded by a new issue. (To view the JSC Graduate Catalog, select that option from the drop-\u00addown menu at upper right.) Course offerings and requirements are continually examined and revised, and not all courses in this catalog are offered every semester. JSC publishes a Course Bulletin each semester listing the courses to be offered that semester, along with times, locations and other pertinent information. Because changes may occur after the Bulletin is published, students are advised to check \"Search for Course Sections\" on the MyJSC Portal for the most up-\u00adto-\u00addate information. The JSC catalog is published annually by the Office of the Academic Dean. The online catalog contains a number of features to assist users, including advanced search options, intuitive navigation and a personal \"Favorites\" folder where you can store favorite programs and courses. For earlier versions of either the graduate or undergraduate catalogs that are not available via the drop-\u00addown menu at upper right, contact the Office of the Registrar at 802-\u00ad635-\u00ad1677.

Dr. Carpenter, a Chelsea, Vermont preacher became the schoolmaster when the school was chartered in 1832 as Johnson Academy. In 1836, five communities incorporated as the Lamoille County Grammar School Association to support the school. In 1866, the State designated Johnson Academy as one of three new \"Normal Schools,\" institutions specifically for teacher training. The Johnson Normal School offered one-\u00ad, two-\u00ad and three-\u00adyear teacher training programs until 1947 when the State approved a four-\u00adyear teacher-\u00adtraining program, and the school became Johnson Teachers College. By an act of the 1961 Legislature, the Vermont State Colleges Board of Trustees was created to oversee the state college system. This new board assumed control on July 1, 1962, and Johnson Teachers College became Johnson State College. This new name signaled a change in the College's mission from a single-\u00adpurpose teacher-\u00adtraining college to a multi-\u00adpurpose liberal arts college. Since that time, the College's curriculum in the liberal arts and sciences, its enrollment and its facilities have expanded dramatically to meet this new mission. In recent years, the College has embarked on an ambitious plan to transform the campus to enhance teaching, learning and community gathering spaces. In 2008, a $7 million renovation of Stearns Student Center was completed. This renovation transformed the building into a true student union with community gathering spaces, a performance space, a cinema and excellent dining facilities. In 2009, the College completed a major renovation of its athletics facility with the creation of a new fitness center, spinning studio, yoga/exercise rooms and a transformed varsity gymnasium. In the summer of 2011, major renovations to Bentley Hall, home to JSC's environmental and health sciences programs, were completed, resulting in a new molecular lab, a fully renovated and expanded Earth sciences lab and a dedicated research lab for upper-\u00adlevel students conducting their senior-\u00adlevel thesis projects. And in the winter of 2012, the fully renovated Visual Arts Center was reopened, featuring rejuvenated studios classrooms, dedicated work spaces for BFA students, updated classrooms and offices, a new gallery and a Mac lab. The College has come a long way from that first class of 16 students in a converted cobbler's shop. Johnson State's modern, dozen-\u00adbuilding campus spreads over 330 hilltop acres and serves nearly 1900 students from Vermont and around the country. The College is accredited as a multi-\u00adpurpose public institution by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and is approved as a degree-\u00adgranting institution by the Vermont State Board of Education. The Johnson State College Mission The Johnson State College community believes in the power of higher education to transform lives. We express this commitment through an education that crosses academic and other boundaries, wherever possible; creates opportunities for students to extend their classroom learning to the field, the laboratory, the studio, the community and the local and wider world; recognizes the diverse starting points and goals of students; and sustains active participation, high standards, vigorous debate and mutual respect. The Mission of the Vermont State Colleges For the benefit of Vermont, the Vermont State Colleges provide affordable, high-\u00adquality, student-\u00adcentered and accessible education, fully integrating professional, liberal arts and career study. This integrated education, in conjunction with applied learning experiences, assures that graduates of VSC programs will: 1. Demonstrate competence in communication, research and critical thinking. 2. Practice creative problem-\u00adsolving both individually and collaboratively. 3. Be engaged, effective and responsible citizens. 4. Bring to the workplace appropriate skills and an appreciation of work quality and ethics. 5. Embrace the necessity and joy of lifelong learning. The Vermont State Colleges also offer numerous opportunities for others to engage in continuous learning to meet their specific goals. College-\u00adWide Policies VSC Policies 311 & 311A: Non-\u00adDiscrimination & Prevention of Harassment and Related Unprofessional Conduct The Vermont State Colleges (VSC) and each member college, including Johnson State College, do not discriminate based on race, color, creed, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, place of birth, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, HIV status or any other status protected by law. Sexual harassment, racial harassment and harassment based on other protected categories also are forms of discrimination and are not tolerated. Further, inappropriate sexual relationships between staff and students are prohibited even if they do not rise to the level of sexual harassment. This policy of non-\u00addiscrimination applies to the application processes for admissions and employment, academic and residential programs, employment practices and policies, scholarship and loan programs, and all programs and facilities, including athletics. JSC is an equal opportunity employer. Sexual misconduct, which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence is a form of sex discrimination and therefore is a violation of VSC Policy 311 as well as federal (Title IX) and state law and the JSC Code of Conduct, which can be found in the JSC Student Handbook. VSC Policy 311-\u00adA, adopted in September 2014, relates to sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and related conduct. It calls for prompt and appropriate remedial action to stop the misconduct shall be taken, including student suspension, dismissal or expulsion of students; suspension or termination of employment; and referral for criminal investigation and prosecution under Vermont law. VSC Policies 311 and 311-\u00adA can be read in their entirety by selecting \"Student Affairs Policies\" in the Policies & Procedures section of the VSC website at www.vsc.edu. To initiate a formal or informal complaint of discrimination or harassment, or for further information, contact Assistant Academic Dean Jo Ann Lamore, JSC's Policy 311 coordinator, at 802-\u00ad635-\u00ad1243 or by email to JoAnn.Lamore@jsc.edu. For accommodations in order to apply for admission, please contact the Office of Academic Support Services at 802-\u00ad635-\u00ad1264; If accommodations are needed for employment, please contact the Dean of Administration at 802-\u00ad635-\u00ad1208. Title IX Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on gender in any educational program or activity. The law states that \"no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\" The amendment in 1987 expanded the definition of program or activity to include all the operations of an educational institution, governmental entity or private employer that receive federal funds. Sexual misconduct, including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, are prohibited by Title IX as well as by state law and by VSC and JSC policies. The Title IX Campus Coordinator is Dean of Student Life & College Relations David Bergh, who can be reached at 802-\u00ad635-\u00ad1200 or David.Bergh@jsc.edu. Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. The primary rights afforded to each student include but are not limited to the right to inspect and review their education records, the right to amend incorrect records and the right to limit disclosure of information from the records. In accordance with federal law and regulations issued by the Department of Education, the Vermont State Colleges System (\"VSC\") has adopted policies and procedures for each of its Colleges. The Colleges within the VSC are: Castleton State College, Johnson State College, Lyndon State College, Vermont Technical College, and the Community College of Vermont. The purpose of this VSC policy is to provide guidance on the rights of inspection and the prohibitions against unauthorized dissemination of educational information. The VSC's FERPA policy is available on the MyJSC Portal under VSC Public Info and Data (see VSC Policy and Procedures / Student Affairs / Policy 312) and at the Registrar's Office.

Each major provides a different lens through which to view these topics. Anthropology examines cultural differences and similarities; sociology examines the relationships and interactions between humans and social structures; psychology examines individual human behavior and intelligences. The Wellness & Alternative Medicine major combines aspects of all three of these disciplines with the study of biology, chemistry, anatomy and other sciences to deliver a practical education in a variety of healing and health practies used throught the world. The Behavioral Sciences Department offers courses with the following designators: ANT (anthropology), CSV (community service/volunteer), PSY (psychology), SSC (social science), SOC (sociology) and WAM (wellness & alternative medicine). See full Course Descriptions. The department also offers a Master of Arts program in counseling; refer to the JSC Graduate Catalog for information. (To access the graduate catalog, chose it from the drop-\u00addown menu at upper right.) Majors & Concentrations Anthropology & Sociology (B.A.) With integrative study in anthropology and sociology, students investigate and learn to appreciate how diversities and social-\u00adstructural arrangements among people affect the distribution of power and the ability of people to live meaningful, sustainabile lives and co-\u00adexist in a fair, socially just world.

Anthropology & Sociology: Criminal Justice (B.A.) This program goes beyond the study of law and crime to explore complex issues of social justice related to crime, punishment and victimization, including race, class, gender and sexuality. Students explore current trends and controversies and gain cross-\u00adcultural competencies needed to work successfully with diverse populations. A distinguishing feature of this program is its emphasis on the growing field of restorative justice, a technique that involves working with victims as well as offenders. Students graduate with a B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice. The Anthropology & Sociology major itself develops in students an understanding of diversities and social structural arrangements among people affect the distribution of power and the ability of people to live meaningful, sustainable lives and co-\u00adexist in a fair and socially just world. (Note: Criminal Justice also is offered as a concentration in the B.A. in Political Science.) The multidisciplinary concentration in criminal justice draws on JSC's rich liberal arts tradition and commitment to high-\u00adimpact education -\u00ad-\u00ad \"learning by doing\" -\u00ad-\u00ad to explore the relationships of crime, law and social justice. It also cross-\u00adcultural competency, preparing students to communicate and work with those from a wide range of backgrounds and with disparate life experiences. Supported by a network of community partner organizations, the program offers internships in the field of criminal justice, particularly in the arenas of restorative justice and victim advocacy as well as in border patrol and other areas of law enforcement. Students complete these internships in their junior or senior year along with a concurrent senior seminar. A range of disciplines are brought to bear on criminal justice, including anthropology, political science, psychology and sociology. The program prepares student for a careers in law enforcement and criminal investigation, crime analysis, juvenile justice, victim advocacy, restorative justice and community development, social justice and public policy. A criminal justice background also prepares students to pursue careers in law, from working as paralegals and legal assistants to attending law school. Learning Outcomes In addition to meeting the learning outcomes of the B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology, upon completion of the concentration in criminal justice, students should be able to: 1. Critically evaluate key theories about crime and criminal behavior. 2. Critically assess existing criminal justice systems with the aim of improving their condition and function. 3. Identify and assess alternative solutions to problems associated with existing models of crime control. 4. Develop and demonstrate sufficient self-\u00adawareness to understand the influence of personal biases and values in interacting with diverse groups. 5. Identify and analyze ways in which oppression, privilege, discrimination, and social and economic disadvantage contribute to inequalities and injustices within criminal justice systems. 6. Understand key issues and approaches in the field of criminal justice, including mental health, substance abuse, youth development, trauma-\u00adinformed care, and results-\u00adbased accountability. 7. Demonstrate familiarity with key skill sets in the field of criminal justice, including effective communication and conflict resolution and de-\u00adescalation. 8. Apply understandings of research methods and data collection techniques for conducting research in criminal justice. 9. Apply understandings of criminal justice policy and key controversies to field experiences.

Psychology (B.A.) Students in the B.A. in Psychology program explore a wide range of theories concerning human behavior, development, thought, emotion, learning, intelligence, personality, group dynamics and abnormal behavior. Through coursework, fieldwork and research opportunities, students apply the knowledge gained in class to the real world and are encouraged to use what they learn toward understanding themselves and their relationships. Students have the opportunity to work as research assistants during the school year and in the summer. An internship is required. Elective options help students explore career possibilities, such as working with the chronically mentally ill, with children and families, and in the areas of organizational psychology, addictions, art therapy, forensic psychology and more.

Wellness & Alternative Medicine (B.S.) Launched in 2000 and updated in spring 2014 to reflect advances in medical knowledge and contemporary practice, the B.S. degree in Wellness & Alternative Medicine at JSC is based on the scientific protocols set by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine and Bastyr University's Naturopathic Medical School program in Seattle, Wash. An interdisciplinary collaboration between JSC's Behavioral Sciences and Environmental & Health Sciences departments, the program employs societal, cultural, biochemical and global frameworks to investigate the history, principles and scientific evidence for the safety and effectiveness of diverse modalities to heal disease and to create wellness. It provides the scientific knowledge and practical skills needed to make informed healthcare decisions and lifestyle choices and to prepare for careers as state-\u00adof-\u00ad the-\u00adart healthcare professionals, veterinarians and doctors. Students study conventional, allopathic medicine in the U.S. as well as alternative medical models from around the world. While completing their degrees, students may elect to co-\u00adenroll in certification programs to become massage therapists, yoga instructors, reiki masters and Ayurvedic consultants. Graduates are prepared for initial positions in the wellness and fitness industry, hospital employee-\u00adassistance programs, social-\u00adassistance programs, the diet and supplements industry and as assistants to alternative medical practitioners. Many graduates go on to graduate and medical schools to become physicians, nurses, chiropractors, naturopathic physicians, Chinese medical doctors, ayurvedic physicians and homeopathic doctors. The curriculum for this program was reviewed in 2012 by Dr. James S. Gordon, director of the Center for Mind-\u00adBody Medicine Program at Georgetown University, former chair of the White House Commission on Complementary & Alternative Medicine and a member of the Advisory Council for the NIH National Center for Complimentary & Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and in 2004 by Dr. Joseph Jacobs, former director of NCCAM. Their comments and suggestions have guided the curriculum that takes effect in fall 2015. Learning Outcomes for Wellness & Alternative Medicine Majors 1.

Our professors have the theoretical and practical background to help students become outstanding teachers and influential leaders in their field. Working as a teacher in a public school in Vermont requires a Level I Professional Educator's License with an endorsement in a specific discipline at a designated level. The license is issued by the Vermont Agency of Education to candidates who successfully complete a Teacher Education Program and are recommended by their institution. Educators' licenses issued in Vermont are accepted by more than 40 other states, districts and territories through association with the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education & Certification. The JSC Education Department offers several Teacher Education Programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The undergraduate programs are: Childhood Education (B.A.), which provides licensure endorsement in both K-\u00ad6 elementary education and K-\u00ad8 special education. Endorsement areas are anthropology/sociology, art, biology, English, environmental science, health sciences, history, mathematics, music, political science, psychology and theater. Secondary Teacher Endorsement, which prepares graduates to teach English, mathematics, science or social studies in grades 7-\u00ad12. Students must earn an accompanying bachelor's degree in their area of endorsement. Unified Arts Teacher Licensure Endorsement, which prepares graduates to teach art, dance, music, physical education or theater arts in grades PreK-\u00ad12.

In addition, a five-\u00adyear, double major in Music Performance & Music Education (B.A.) is available through the Department of Fine & Performing Arts that provides licensure endorsement to teach music in grades preK-\u00ad12. JSC also offers an M.A. in Education with several areas of specialization available. Note: Acceptance into a Teacher Education Program at JSC requires a separate application. Being accepted by Johnson State College, declaring a major or beginning a program of study does NOT constitute admission or acceptance into a Teacher Education Program. See the Teacher Education Program Handbook, available from the Education Department, for complete details. Accreditation All Teacher Education Programs at JSC are accredited by the Vermont Standards Board of Professional Educators. The accreditation process assures that candidates who are recommended for licensure meet all state standards for the license and the endorsement.

Mission Statement & Program Goals The Music Education Department of Johnson State College endeavors to create an inviting learning environment that provides a systematic, experience-\u00adbased curriculum in the areas of self-\u00adreflection, curiosity and enthusiasm in its future educators. Successful music educators exhibit personal qualities of leadership, intellectual curiosity and social commitment. They approach life, music and the teaching profession in a positive, creative and enthusiastic way. Musicians are most successful as teachers if they understand current structures, systems and practices in education. The music educator in this age of educational change and accountability must be able to express knowledge of teaching and learning through verbal communication (oral and written) and through overt, demonstrable high-\u00adlevel musical and teaching skills. Johnson graduates plan and implement effective, developmentally appropriate lessons and curricula based upon sound principles of content knowledge, skill development and pedagogy. They employ the National Standards in Music Education and use appropriate materials and strategies to develop students' critical thinking, problem solving and performance skills all while conveying their deep love of music. The JSC faculty is dedicated to preparing its candidates for careers as professional music educators and to emulate and convey the following principles: pursuing excellence in education; a commitment to diversity and cultural awareness; excellence in musicianship, pedagogy, research and scholarship. Music educators from JSC enter the field with the skills, knowledge, confidence and enthusiasm to successfully provide their future students with a complete and fulfilling musical experience. Learning Outcomes 1. Demonstrate mastery of basic skills in reading, writing and mathematics by passing the Praxis I exam according to Vermont Guidelines. 2. Demonstrate knowledge of content areas (PreK-\u00ad12 instrumental, choral, & general music) and successfully complete the Praxis II exam for the Music Content area with a score that meets the Vermont Certification Guidelines. 3. Be able to develop well-\u00adorganized, standards-\u00adbased lessons and unit plans in all content areas of certification (PreK-\u00ad12 instrumental, choral & general music), as well as use them successfully in a variety of music classroom environments as evidenced by documentation included in an approved portfolio. 4. Be knowledgeable of both child and adolescent development, various exceptionalities, literacy development, technology integration, anti-\u00addiscriminatory practice, and demonstrate skill in planning and carrying out varied instructional activities designed to support learning across a diverse student population. 5. Demonstrate skill in using reflection as a means of improving classroom teaching skills. 6. Demonstrate collaboration and advocacy skills by working successfully with colleagues, parents and the community at large for purpose of improving the music education experience for all children. 7.

Note: For students majoring in Interdisciplinary Studies (B.A.), no more than 6 credits in the major can be used to fulfill GEC requirements for the External Degree Program. Theoretical Framework & Learning Pursuits Students in Education Department programs gain both an understanding of the discipline of education and a practical grasp of effective professional practice. These two realms provide a foundation for the development of content-\u00adspecific professional knowledge, the use of action research to design pedagogical strategies, the use of critical theory to confidently serve as a progressive colleague and advocate, and the pursuit of continuous personal growth. Taken together, these four strands of learning and inquiry support the program theme, \"Teach with Intention.\" Students who successfully complete an Education Department program will: Use academic study to examine content area knowledge including established constructs, historical developments, common misconceptions, enduring questions and cross-\u00addisciplinary connections; Use action research to design and assess original, inclusive and engaging learning experiences that are meaningful and effective; Use critical analysis grounded in social, political, ethical and leadership perspectives to reframe educational endeavors toward more vibrant and just ends; and Use self-\u00adstudy grounded in an understanding of diverse world-\u00adviews to rethink longstanding, conventional notions toward an open-\u00adminded, strength-\u00adbased perspective. Applying to a Teacher Education Program at JSC 1. In order to apply to a Teacher Education Program, students must have a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA and a passing score on one of the following exams: Praxis Core tests, SAT, ACT or GRE. 2. Students should obtain a Teacher Education Program Handbook from the JSC Education Department and take EDU-\u00adTEW1 Teacher Education Workshop 1: Introduction to Teacher Education, to learn about the application process. They also should enroll in the beginning coursework for the program (EDU-\u00ad2360 or EDU-\u00ad2365) at this time. 3. Students should work with the Education Department Program Director (and their major advisor if pursuing Secondary or Unified Arts licensure endorsement) to construct a course sequence covering all requirements. Discuss course equivalents, substitutions or waivers with the Program Director. 4. Students transferring credits from other institutions (including other Vermont State Colleges) must schedule a transcript review with the Program Director to determine which courses satisfy which requirements, if any. Advancing through a Teacher Education Program at JSC 1. Advancement through a Teacher Education Program requires attending all five Teacher Education Workshops (EDU-\u00adTEW1, EDU-\u00adTEW2, EDU-\u00adTEW3, EDU-\u00adTEW4 and EDU-\u00adTEW5). These are one-\u00adtime meetings held each semester in multiple sections; see the Course Sequence Plans in the Teacher Education Program Handbook for details. Each workshop provides guidance on completing the next set of requirements for the program. Students who do not meet these benchmark requirements will not be permitted to proceed in the program. 2. Students must earn a B-\u00ad or better in all endorsement-\u00adspecific courses. Students must have a 3.0 cumulative GPA, a 3.0 GPA in the major, and a passing score on the PRAXIS II examination before applying for the Teaching Internship (i.e., student teaching). 3. Students in all Teacher Education Programs complete numerous fieldwork assignments, which take place during typical public school hours (Monday-\u00adFriday, 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.). Students are expected to arrange their own transportation to fieldwork sites. 4. Students seeking endorsement for licensure from JSC must submit a complete Level I Portfolio (see below) ready for scoring, by the due date established within the Teacher Internship semester. The Level I Portfolio The Level I Portfolio is used to assess a candidate's readiness to apply for a Level I Professional Educator's License from the Vermont Agency of Education. A collection of specific assignments that demonstrate a candidate's knowledge, skill and disposition, it also documents the candidate's competence in meeting Vermont's Five Standards for Professional Educators, the Knowledge & Performance Standards for his/her endorsement area and the Code of Professional Ethics for Vermont Educators. Portfolios must be constructed in accordance with the current guidelines established by the Vermont Standards Board for Professional Educators; refer to the JSC Portfolio Handbook for details. Portfolios that do not meet guidelines will not be accepted for review. Portfolios must achieve passing scores from two reviewers: a faculty member and the JSC Board of Reviewers. Note: In some cases, reviewers may request revisions, giving the student an opportunity for a second review. Portfolios that do not pass after the second review will be marked \"No Pass.\" While the review process typically takes a few weeks, it can last many moths to a year if a portfolio requires revision. Students may be required to enroll in a credit-\u00adbearing tutorial session to complete or revise a portfolio. Students may apply for a limited extension in submitting their portfolio due to unexpected circumstances, but requests must be made during the Teaching Internship semester. Portfolios submitted after the Teaching Internship semester or the extension due date, as well as portfolios that do not meet guidelines, will not be accepted for review. In such cases, the student will not receive a recommendation for licensure from JSC. 5. Students will participate in three interviews spread throughout the program: an entry interview, a midway interview and an exit Interview. These take place on the JSC campus and last about one hour each. 6. In order to earn a recommendation for licensure from JSC, students must meet all applicable requirements for licensure in place at the time of the recommendation. If the requirements for licensure established by the Vermont Standards Board for Professional Educators, the Vermont Agency of Education or the U.S. Department of Education change over the span of a student's enrollment, the student must consult with his or her Program Director to determine whether the changes apply and, if so, how best to meet the new requirements. For additional details, refer to the Teacher Education Program Handbook. Accreditation The Teacher Education Programs at JSC are accredited through the Vermont Standards Board for Profession Educators. The accreditation process assures that candidates who are recommended for licensure meet all state standards for the license and the endorsement. Vermont has established agreements to have educators' licenses recognized in over 40 other states, districts and territories through association with NASDTEC. The Education Department offers courses with an EDU designator. See full Course Descriptions. The department also offers a Master of Arts program in education. For further information, see the Johnson State College graduate catalog. General Education Requirements Johnson State College's General Education Curriculum (GEC), a program of integrative learning, addresses the accelerating pace of change in all areas of society at the local, national and global levels. The goals and outcomes of the GEC are designed to equip graduates with the skills to flourish in a world marked by constant innovation and global interdependence. As the mission statement for the College's GEC states, \"In order to help students enrich their lives and become fully engaged citizens of their world, the Johnson State College General Education Program strengthens the foundations of written and oral communication, mathematics and quantitative reasoning, and understanding of the scientific method. It complements the depth of the [student's chosen] major with a breadth of experiences that cross disciplinary boundaries and emphasize connections between the student and the community.\" Essential Learning Outcomes for Students: 1. Broad knowledge of human cultures and the natural and physical world, including social sciences, natural sciences, mathematics, humanities, histories and the arts; 2. Intellectual and practical skills, including effective writing, inquiry, quantitative and information literacy, and teamwork and problem solving; 3. Integrative learning, including the capacity to adapt knowledge, skills and responsibilities to new settings and questions. (Adapted from College Learning for the New Global Century, Association of American Colleges and Universities, 2007) There are two General Education programs in place at Johnson State College: General Education Curriculum for Campus-\u00adBased Students General Education Curriculum for EDP Students Degree Requirements Johnson State College offers students two pathways to an undergraduate degree: On campus at JSC, students can choose among dozens of B.A., B.S. and B.F.A. degree programs, two associate's degree programs, three certificates and 10 teacher-\u00adeducation programs that provide endorsement for a Vermont teaching license -\u00ad all while taking advantage of the College's many services, programs and activities. Off campus, through JSC's External Degree Program, students throughout Vermont with at least 60 credits can complete a bachelor's degree in one of our undergraduate majors available statewide, earn their teaching endorsement, and/or complete a Certificate of Proficiency in Accounting to earn state licensure and prepare to sit for the national Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam. Classes are offered online, on weekends in four Vermont communities, and on the JSC campus. Flexible scheduling options and EDP's maximum use of transfer credits make this program a popular option for adult learners.

Requirements for Academic Minors An academic minor consists of a minimum of 18 credits in a discipline or field, at least six of which are at the 3000/4000 level. In general, students may not use the same courses used to satisfy requirements in a major to also satisfy requirements in a minor. Any questions should be referred to the department chair of the department sponsoring the minor. (See list of Academic Programs.) Graduation Standards Johnson State College strives to ensure that all students achieve and be able to demonstrate their mastery of important skills. This commitment is consistent with the mandate of the trustees and presidents of the Vermont State Colleges (VSC), including Johnson State College, that all students must satisfy graduation standards in four areas: writing, quantitative reasoning, information literacy and oral communication. As a mandate of the Board of Trustees and the Council of Presidents, the requirement to satisfy graduation standards supersedes all other catalog statements concerning academic regulations and requirements. Successfully fulfilling graduation standards at one VSC institution is accepted as fulfilling the standards at any other VSC institution for an equivalent associate's or bachelor's degree. All students must satisfy the following graduation standards in order to graduate: Writing: All baccalaureate-\u00ad and associate-\u00adlevel students must pass ENG 3999, the Writing Proficiency Exam, or ENG 2005 The Self-\u00adSufficient Writer course. The Writing Proficiency Exam is offered every semester on a pass/no pass basis. Students should take the exam when they have accumulated between 15-\u00ad60 credits to ensure completion of this standard. Students who fail the exam once may attempt it a second time; those who fail twice must take and pass ENG 2005 The Self-\u00adSufficient Writer . Quantitative Reasoning: All baccalaureate-\u00ad and associate-\u00adlevel students must pass the Quantitative Literacy Assessment Exam (LAE) or MAT 1080 course. In addition, all baccalaureate-\u00adlevel students must pass one course designated as \"quantitatively enriched.\" (Courses with the \"QE:\" prefix are approved as quantitatively enriched.) Note: Unlike MAT-\u00ad1080, the LAE does not count toward the Foundational Skills: Mathematics component of the General Education Curriculum. Information Literacy: All baccalaureate-\u00ad and associate-\u00adlevel students must complete GRS 3000, the Information Literacy Tutorial (TILT) and score 80% or higher on each of the accompanying quizzes. TILT and the quizzes are available to students on the VSC Moodle site after registering for a section of GRS-\u00ad3000. It is recommended that students take TILT during their first year at JSC. Oral Communication: All baccalaureate-\u00ad and associate-\u00adlevel students must receive passing scores on the Oral Communication Grading & Evaluation Form. Baccalaureate students must complete two oral presentations, each at least five minutes long; associate-\u00adlevel students must complete one oral presentation. Currently enrolled students may obtain comprehensive information about JSC graduation standards by consulting \"JSC Graduation Standards,\" on the MyJSC Portal at http://MyJSC.jsc.edu. In addition, JSC occasionally may email students via their JSC email addresses about the required graduation standards and the steps required to satisfy them.

Registration Students pursuing a bachelor's or associate's degree from Johnson State College must be formally accepted through the Admissions Office before they may be registered for courses. Continuing undergraduates are expected to pre-\u00adregister for their courses in November for the following spring semester and in April for the following summer and fall semesters. Students are notified of exact dates and instructions via email one to two weeks prior to the registration period. EDP students receive registration materials well before the start of each semester. EDP students confer with their advisors, who must approve course selections and who can register the students for classes. When registering for courses at institutions outside of the Vermont State Colleges, EDP students submit a tuition transfer form available from the EDP office. A late fee may be assessed for registrations after the published deadline. Class attendance does not in itself signify registration. Students must properly register for each of their courses in order to receive academic credit for work completed. All students must meet state immunization requirements and must be cleared by Student Financial Services (see Payment Procedures section for details) in order to register for classes. Dual-\u00adEnrollment Consortium Agreement! Students matriculated at Johnson State College (their home institution where they have been officially accepted) and enrolled in JSC courses may simultaneously enroll in courses at two or more VSC institutions. With the exception of the summer term, students follow the home institution's procedures for course selection, course add/drop/withdrawals, advising, financial aid and billing. This agreement does not supersede existing External Degree Program arrangements; these arrangements remain unchanged by this agreement. For the full Vermont State College Consortium Enrollment Agreement, see \"Policies and Procedures\" and then \"Data Security and Operational Policies\" on the VSC website, www.vsc.edu. Class Membership Students are classified for academic class membership and administrative purposes on the basis of semester credits earned according to the following schedule: Number of Credits Earned Academic Class 0-\u00ad29.9 30-\u00ad59.9 60-\u00ad89.9 90 or more Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior Auditing Courses No credit or grades are assigned for audited courses. A per-\u00adcredit tuition fee of one-\u00adhalf of in-\u00adstate or out-\u00adof-\u00adstate rates, whichever applies, is charged. Courses that are audited do not count toward a student's credit load and are not eligible for financial aid. Students wishing to audit a course should follow normal registration procedures, indicating AU as their grade option at the time of registering. The choice to audit a course must be made prior to the end of the add/drop period, and it does not apply to programs/courses with already reduced tuition rates (i.e., Extension courses). Basic Skills Recognizing that basic writing and mathematic skills are essential to successful completion of college-\u00adlevel work, and in accordance with the Vermont State Colleges' Basic Academic Skills policy, Johnson State College assesses the skill level of all new students in these two areas. On the basis of this assessment, students who do not possess college-\u00adlevel skills in either or both of these areas are directed into courses designed to address their skill deficiencies. These courses should be taken during the student's first year at Johnson State College. Please note that basic skills courses whose course number begins with a \"0\" (i.e., MAT-\u00ad0410) do NOT count toward total credits required for graduation, although they do count in determining full-\u00adtime status and semester grade point average. Class Attendance Students who register for a course prior to the first week of the semester or during the first day of the semester are expected to attend at least one of the first two class sessions. A faculty member may fill absent places with students wishing to enter the course and refuse entry to absent students when they appear. Faculty members may also refuse to admit a student to the class after the beginning of the semester, if they believe the student cannot complete missed work. In this case, the registered student is responsible for dropping the course from his/her schedule. For EDP weekend courses, please note that attendance is MANDATORY at all Saturday and Sunday classes. Students should not register for these weekend courses if they know before the semester begins that they cannot attend all classes. Course Add/Drop/Withdrawal Students approved for online registration may add courses online until the start of the semester and drop courses online until the end of the second week of the semester, except for the summer semester, in which case students should refer to the policies and procedures specific to that program. All students may add or drop a course until the end of the second week of the semester by completing a Registration Adjustment Form and submitting it to the Registrar's Office. Second-\u00adhalf semester courses may be added or dropped until the end of the second week of the second half of the semester. If a course is dropped, it will be removed from the student's academic record and may result in an adjustment to a student's bill and financial aid. Students are encouraged to contact the Student Financial Services Office before dropping a course. After the second week of the semester and until the end of the ninth week of the semester, a student may withdraw from a course by completing a Registration Adjustment Form and submitting it to the Registrar's Office. If a student withdraws from a course, the course will appear on the transcript with a \"W\" grade and will not affect a student's grade point average. In most cases, a withdrawal from a course does not affect a student's bill or financial aid award. Students withdrawing or dropping all courses will be considered as departing from the college and must complete the Student Exit Notification and Leave of Absence Form. Please see Johnson State College's Refund Policy within this catalog. Students registered through JSC for courses at other non-\u00adVSC institutions must drop or withdraw from courses at both colleges. Students will be charged for any tuition and fees that the other institution charges JSC. Formally Declaring a Major Campus-\u00adBased Students Students who did not declare a major at the point of admission to the college must do so after earning 45 credit hours in a bachelor's degree program, or 12 credit hours in an associate's degree program, by submitting a Change of Major/Academic Advisor Form to the Registrar's Office, if they have not already done so. Transfer Students: Students transferring in 45 credit hours or more for a bachelor's degree, or 12 credit hours for an associate's degree program, must declare a major within the first semester of their program by submitting a Change of Major/Academic Advisor Form to the Registrar's Office. A student may declare any major officially in existence at the time the student declares a major. The Program Evaluation available on Web Services outlines all graduation requirements, including the requirements in the student's major, and monitors the student's progress toward completion of these requirements. EDP Students EDP students may choose from the following majors: business, childhood education (with both elementary education and special education endorsement, also referred to as inclusive elementary education), interdisciplinary studies, professional studies, psychology, and wellness and alternative medicine. Other JSC programs, including elementary and secondary teaching endorsement, are available if students can take courses on the JSC campus. For details on degree requirements, see the sections in this catalog on particular academic departments. Students majoring in professional studies or in interdisciplinary studies must prepare an individualized degree plan with the help of advisors during their first semester. Students in these majors may not graduate until their degree plans have received approval by the EDP Academic Review Board. If a student has not submitted a degree plan by the last review meeting of the second semester in the program, the program's director may recommend administrative dismissal for one semester. Discontinued Majors The following provisions apply with regard to discontinued majors: Students who have previously formally declared a major may not at a later time switch into a major designated as discontinued. Students failing to make a formal declaration of a major by the end of their sophomore year, as is required, may not at a later time declare a discontinued major. Former students who are not on an approved Leave of Absence and have returned may not pursue a discontinued major. Grading Johnson State College employs letter grades as indicated below: Grade Explanation Grade Points A+ High competence 4.00 A High competence 4.00 A-\u00ad High competence 3.70 B+ Good competence 3.30 B Good competence 3.00 B-\u00ad Good competence 2.70 C+ Moderate competence 2.30 C Moderate competence 3.00 C-\u00ad Moderate competence 1.70 D+ Minimum acceptable competence 1.30 D Minimum acceptable competence 1.00 D-\u00ad Minimum acceptable competence 0.70 F Failing 0.00 I Incomplete (See Incompletes below) P or NP Pass/No Pass NG No grade indicates that no grade has yet been submitted. The grade will be recorded upon course completion. TR Transfer credit CR Credit granted (non-\u00adcourse work) W Withdrawn* AU Audit *Withdrawals are recorded by the Registrar's Office only after receipt of an authorized course withdrawal. In general, faculty grades are due at the Registrar's Office 48 hours after each course's final examination. Pass/No Pass Option Students may elect to be graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. The Pass/No Pass option is designed to encourage students to take courses that they otherwise would not take for fear of receiving low grades. For performance of D-\u00ad work or better, a grade of P (Pass) is recorded on the student's record. Credit is received for P grades, but the grades do not affect the student's grade point average. Failing work is recorded as NP (No Pass). NP grades do not earn credit nor does the grade affect the student's grade point average. Students select this option by indicating P/NP as their grade option when they register. Courses taken with a grade of P do not count toward requirements of the General Education Core Curriculum, EDP General Education requirements, or in general, the requirements of a student's major or minor. In addition, students may NOT take Basic Skills courses as Pass/No Pass. Incompletes The grade of Incomplete (I) may be given to work of satisfactory quality when the amount of required work has not been completed because of illness or other reasons beyond the control of the student. A grade of I is not to be used instead of the grade of F in situations involving a student's lack of ability or negligence. Grades of I will automatically revert to an F if a final grade, or alternate default grade, is not submitted to the Registrar's Office prior to the Incomplete deadline submitted by the instructor. In general, grades of Incomplete are to be completed by the end of the seventh week of the semester immediately following the semester in which the Incomplete grade was given. Courses carried through with an I into the following semester do not count toward the student's credit load for tuition billing purposes or for additional credit toward graduation. Not Graded Work The grade of NG may be given for a course when an instructor has not yet assigned grades for the course. This may happen when a course is still in progress at the semester deadline for grade submission. Course work carried into a second semester with a grade of NG does not count toward a student's credit load for tuition billing purposes or for additional credit toward graduation in the second semester. Repeat Course Option Students may repeat any course* that they have previously taken to attempt to earn a higher grade. When a course has been repeated within the Vermont State College system (VSC), the initial grade remains on the transcript but is taken out of the student's cumulative GPA. The most recent grade will be the only one computed in the student's cumulative average. Credit in the course may be earned only once. If the credit value of the course has changed, the repeated course is worth the new credit value. When repeating a course at another institution outside of the VSC, the initial grade remains on the transcript but is taken out of the student's cumulative GPA. The grade from the repeated course being transferred to JSC will show as a transfer but will not be counted in the student's cumulative GPA. Students may choose to use the Pass/No Pass option when registering for a repeat course, except for courses in their major or minor, in the General Education Program, or for basic skills courses (see Pass/No Pass option). If a grade of NP is earned, however, the repeat will not count. If a course was originally taken under a prior grading system, the effect on the student's average will be determined by using the new system. *Some courses as indicated in the Course Descriptions section of the catalog may be taken multiple times for credit. Auditing a Course No credit or grades are assigned for auditing courses. For additional information, refer to the previous section on auditing courses. Credit Granted (CR) for Non-\u00adCourse Work Students who are granted credit on the basis of CLEP examinations, military credit, lifetime experience portfolios, AP courses or other similar circumstances (as determined by Johnson State College) will receive a CR in the grade field. CR distinguishes the credit from TR, which is used for credits that are transferred in from another college or university. Graduation Application for Degree The responsibility for your education ultimately rests in your own hands. Likewise, the timely completion of the paperwork associated with the award of your degree is your responsibility as well. Failure to take the required steps for application for degree may delay your graduation, even if all other graduation requirements have been completed. Students should access their program evaluation (via Web Services on the Portal) regularly to see where they stand in relation to degree completion. Only students who are currently matriculated may graduate. Students absent from the College and not on a Leave of Absence who are seeking to complete a degree with Johnson courses must apply for readmission. A student who anticipates completion of his/her degree requirements should file a Graduation Application through Web Services. After receiving the Graduation Application, the Registrar's Office will carry out an official degree audit. This may allow time for the student to pick up additional courses or complete outstanding paperwork during his/her last semester if necessary. In completing the degree audit, the Registrar's Office will identify where the student stands in relation to completion of degree requirements. The results of the degree audit will be given to the student and to his/her advisor. Note: A Graduation Application/Application for Degree fee will be charged to the student's account upon submission of the Graduation Application. Conferring of Degrees Degrees are conferred once each year in a Commencement ceremony at the end of the spring semester. Diplomas are dated August, December or May for students completing studies in summer, fall or spring semesters respectively. Students will receive their diplomas in the mail after completion of all degree requirements is verified by the Registrar's Office. Participation in Commencement Only students who have completed all degree requirements will be allowed to participate in the Commencement ceremony. The College recognizes that there may be occasions when special circumstances arise. Under such unusual circumstances, students may petition the Academic Dean or his/her designee to participate in Commencement. Students must, however, be within 6 course credits or a single experience (such as an internship or a Graduation Standard) of completing all graduation requirements. No other exceptions will be considered. The decision of the Academic Dean or his/her designee is final and may not be appealed to the President. Students participating in the Commencement ceremony will be required to wear a cap and gown, which can be ordered through the College Bookstore. Graduating with Distinction Effective for the graduating class of spring 2006, of the total credits required for graduation, at least 30 credits for a two-\u00adyear degree and 60 credits for a four-\u00adyear degree must be earned within the Vermont State Colleges by the end of the previous fall semester. (Credits earned before 2002 are not used in this calculation unless earned from Johnson State College.) Graduating students who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.90 or better through the fall semester of their graduation year will be awarded their degree \"summa cum laude.\" Those who earn a 3.70 average will be awarded degrees \"magna cum laude.\" Those who earn a 3.50 average will be awarded degrees \"cum laude.\" (If the above standards are obtained by the end of the spring semester of the graduating year, the appropriate distinction is recorded on the diploma and transcript but is not acknowledged at Commencement.) Graduation honors for certificate programs require final, cumulative GPA as follows: honors, 3.00-\u00ad3.49; high honors, 3.50 or above. Academic Honesty Students are expected to conform to the highest standards of academic honesty in all of their academic work at Johnson State College. Academic dishonesty in any form is prohibited and unacceptable. Acts of dishonesty for which a student may be disciplined include, but are not limited to, receiving or providing unauthorized assistance on an examination and plagiarizing the work of others in writing assignments. The American Heritage Dictionary defines plagiarism in the following way: \"To steal or use (the ideas or writings of another) as one's own.\" Students are responsible for knowing what specific acts constitute plagiarism; if students are uncertain as to whether a particular act constitutes plagiarism, they should consult with their instructors before turning in assigned work. Any faculty member who suspects that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty will bring this suspicion to the attention of the student and provide the student with an opportunity to respond. Should the faculty member subsequently determine that the student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, he/she will assign a penalty for the offense, which may be a failing grade for the specific work submitted or a failing grade for the course. The faculty member will notify the student in writing of his/her decision, as well as the penalty associated with the act of academic dishonesty, and submit a copy of that letter to the Academic Dean's Office. The student may appeal the penalty in writing to the Academic Status Committee (for campus-\u00adbased students) or the Academic Review Board (for EDP students). Upon receiving any such appeal, the Academic Status Committee/EDPAcademic Review Board will consider evidence relative to the charge and determination, and will affirm, reverse or modify the finding and/or penalty of the faculty member. Decisions of the Academic Status Committee/EDP Academic Review Board may be appealed, in writing, to the Academic Dean or his/her designee. The decision of the Academic Dean or his/her designee is final and may not be appealed to the President of the College. Records of all incidents of academic dishonesty will be maintained in the Academic Dean's Office. Repeated incidents of academic dishonesty will subject a student to dismissal from the College. Academic Standing Good Academic Standing A student who has 30 or more earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher, and whose cumulative grade point average is 2.00 or above (1.75 for students with fewer than 30 earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher) is considered to be in good academic standing. The cumulative and semester averages are calculated by including only the graded credits (A, B, C, D, F) earned during the current and past semesters. These averages do not include courses bearing other grade designators (i.e., grades of Incomplete). Incomplete Grades in Relation to GPA/Good Standing Calculation of a semester or cumulative grade point average does not include any Incomplete grade that a student has earned during the semester. Students who receive an Incomplete grade in one or more courses during a semester are held academically liable for the completion of the course. Students who have an Incomplete grade for a semester will not be eligible for the Dean's or President's Lists until a final grade has been submitted for that Incomplete. Academic Warning A student whose cumulative average is in good standing or above but whose semester average is below good standing (see above) will receive a letter of warning from the College. There are no punitive aspects to this warning status. Academic Probation Academic probation serves as an official warning from the College that a student's performance has been substandard. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below good standing (see above) shall be placed on academic probation. Students remain on academic probation until they raise their cumulative grade point average to good standing or until they fall below the dismissal standard (see \"Academic Dismissal.\") Students on academic probation who have less than 30 earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher, must work with the academic probation counselor to create a plan for academic success. When a student voluntarily withdraws from the College while on probation status or is academically dismissed and later readmitted, he/she will return on probation. Academic Dismissal Students will be academically dismissed under the following conditions: Any new, first-\u00adyear student with no previously earned credits who fails to achieve a grade point average of at least 0.70 in the first semester will be academically dismissed. Students on academic probation will be academically dismissed if they fail to achieve a semester grade point average of 2.00 having 30 or more earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher (1.75 having fewer than 30 earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher), during the semester on probation. Students academically dismissed may reapply for admission generally after two regular semesters of absence. Students must follow the regular procedure for application to the College for re-\u00adadmission and will remain on probation upon their return. Appeal Process for Academic Dismissal A student who has been academically dismissed may appeal his/her academic status by writing a letter to the Academic Status Committee (for campus-\u00adbased students) via the Registrar's Office or to the EDP Academic Review Board (for EDP students). This letter of appeal should include any mitigating or extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to the poor academic performance. Decisions of the Academic Status Committee/EDP Academic Review Board may be appealed to the Academic Dean or his/her designee, then to the President of the College. Students who successfully appeal academic dismissal may be placed on stipulated probation and may be required to sign a contract to abide by conditions set forth by the Academic Status Committee or the Academic Dean. Failure to comply with any portion of the contract/stipulations may result in immediate dismissal from Johnson State College. Academic Progress Alerts Faculty teaching 1000-\u00ad and 2000-\u00adlevel courses complete online Academic Progress Alerts during the fifth week of the semester on all freshmen in those courses. The purpose of the alerts is to let students know early on how they are doing in their classes so that they can take corrective action if necessary. Using the Academic Progress Alerts, faculty give both positive and negative feedback relative to class attendance and participation, homework assignments, tests, etc. Academic Forgiveness Johnson State College recognizes that some academically able students for various reasons have poor previous academic records. A student who has been out of college for at least two academic years may appeal to the Academic Dean or his/her designee at the end of the first semester of subsequent attendance in good standing (generally a 2.00, see Good Academic Standing policy within this catalog) at JSC to have a previous semester set aside. The decision of the Academic Dean or his/her designee, will be final and may not be appealed to the President of the College. Setting aside a previous semester is done by notation on the permanent JSC transcript, not by removing any previous course or grade. Grades of C and above, and the credits derived from those grades, will remain. Grade history will be removed from cumulative totals only, and grades cannot be ameliorated if they have already been included in calculations for awarding a degree. Academic Honors (President's/Dean's List) Matriculated (degree-\u00adseeking) students who complete 12 or more Vermont State College graded credits in a single semester and who have no Incomplete, NP, F or blank grades are eligible for the President's and Dean's List under the following standards: Students who achieve a 4.00 semester average will be placed on the President's List. Students who achieve between a 3.50 and 3.99 semester average will be placed on the Dean's List. Honors Convocation Every spring, the College hosts Honors Convocation, an event at which the College and departments award prizes and scholarships to students who have distinguished themselves in the classroom, in the community and on the playing field. Transfer of Credit Transfer within the Vermont State Colleges System College-\u00adlevel credits earned with a grade of C-\u00ad or better at any VSC degree-\u00adgranting institution prior to summer 2002 are fully transferable to JSC. These transfer credits do not count in a student's GPA. Credits earned at any VSC degree-\u00adgranting institution during and after summer 2002 are not considered transfer credit but rather institutional credit, and, therefore, grades earned are counted in a student's GPA. Each credit taken in fulfillment of a GEC requirement at another VSC institution counts toward fulfillment of GEC requirements at JSC in appropriate categories. If you leave one VSC institution while on academic probation and are accepted at another VSC institution, your academic probation status goes with you. Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions (See \"Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures\" at www.jsc.edu/TransferCreditPolicy.) In order to be eligible for the transfer of credits from other institutions, you must be a matriculated (degree-\u00adseeking) student at Johnson State College. Matriculated students at Johnson State who wish to take courses at other institutions and have credits transferred to Johnson State are encouraged to have a conversation with their academic advisor before registering. Transfer credits will not be accepted from non-\u00admatriculated students. Transfer credit may be granted by Johnson State College for college-\u00adlevel courses completed with the equivalent of a grade of C-\u00ad or better at regionally accredited or officially approved institutions of higher education. Credit for a D in a course may be granted if the second semester of a two-\u00adsemester, sequential course is completed with a C-\u00ad or better. In addition, for transfer students holding a two-\u00adyear associate's degree from an accredited institution, credits applied to that degree will be accepted as transfer credit. Credits earned in a quarter system count as two-\u00adthirds of a semester credit. The grades attached to credits accepted in transfer are not calculated in a student's cumulative grade point average. Johnson State requires that a student accumulate at least 39 credits of upper-\u00adlevel work in order to graduate. Transfer credits are normally accepted as lower-\u00adlevel credits. Students who believe that transferred credits were upper-\u00adlevel work should present documentation (usually in the form of a catalog from the transferring institution) to the Registrar's Office for consideration. Credits accepted for transfer are not necessarily accepted as meeting requirements in a student's major or for General Education requirements. The Registrar will evaluate credits for experiential learning and credits from unaccredited institutions to determine their applicability toward graduation requirements. An associate's degree and an R.N. diploma will be accepted as 60 credits. Assessment of Prior Learning Learning acquired through work or other non-\u00adcollege experiences may be assessed for college credit. The Assessment of Prior Learning (APL) course (see course listing below), taught through the Community College of Vermont, is designed for this purpose. Students are guided through the process of describing and documenting their experiential learning in a portfolio. This document is then reviewed for credit by an Advance Standing Committee composed of appropriate faculty and professionals. The credit awarded through the Office of External Programs may be transferred to JSC and the other Vermont State Colleges. The Registrar, in consultation with faculty and staff of the appropriate departments, will evaluate these credits to determine their applicability toward graduation requirements. EDU-\u00ad1240 Assessment of Prior Learning (3 cr.) (Offered through Community College of Vermont) This course is an opportunity for students to earn college credit for prior learning acquired either on the job or in other settings. Students explore past learning experiences and identify future educational goals. Students develop an individual portfolio describing and documenting prior learning. Upon successful completion of the course, students may submit their portfolio to the Office of External Programs for review of credit requests. Recommended prerequisite: ENG-\u00ad1071 College Writing or equivalent. Before enrolling, students should consult the Academic Support Services Office in Dewey Hall at 802-\u00ad635-\u00ad1259. Internships Internship placements exist for matriculated students who wish to gain practical experience in a particular field. Internships are individually designed to meet the needs of students. Each student is assigned a faculty member from JSC and a site supervisor to ensure successful completion of the work experience. The eligibility requirements for participation in an internship are established by the faculty in each academic department. Internships in every major, at both upper and lower levels, are available for one through 12 credits; each credit hour represents a minimum of 40 work hours (except for HTM internships, which require 80 hours per credit). Internships are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis only. In addition to regular, per credit tuition charges, a $45 internship fee will be assessed and charged to the student's account. [Students should make arrangements for their internship and submit the completed internship application in the semester prior to the semester in which the internship begins.] Independent Study Independent studies are more academic and research-\u00adbased in nature and often replace a regular course. Each student pursuing an independent study works under the direct and regular supervision of a faculty member. The goals, objectives and performance measures for independent studies are defined in a formal contract between the faculty supervisor and the student, and approved by the Academic Dean or his/her designee. For all students, a maximum of 21 credits of independent study can be taken during pursuit of a bachelor's degree. In addition to regular per credit tuition charges, a $30/credit fee will be assessed and charged to the student's account. Students receiving veterans' educational benefits must comply with specific V.A. regulations with regard to independent study. (See Veterans' Benefits) Summer Course Offerings Johnson State College offers a limited schedule of courses in the summer. See the Summer Bulletin and the JSC website for specific course information, rates and registration procedures. Tuition for summer is charged at the regular in-\u00adstate rate for Vermont residents and at 150 percent of the in-\u00adstate rate for all out-\u00adof-\u00adstate students. National Student Exchange The National Student Exchange (NSE), coordinated by the Advising & Career Center, is a network of nearly 200 institutions of higher education in the United States and Canada. Through NSE, JSC students who meet eligibility requirements can spend a semester or a year at one or more of these institutions, earning credits toward their JSC degree. In addition, international exchange opportunities are available through participating institutions that open their study abroad programs to NSE exchange students. Following a semester or year exchange, students return to JSC to complete their degrees. Taking Courses as a Non-\u00adDegree Student Non-\u00addegree students are students who wish to take one or more undergraduate courses at JSC for college credit but who are not formally admitted as matriculated (degree-\u00adseeking) students. To be eligible to enroll in courses as a non-\u00addegree student, students must have a high school diploma or a GED. Students who wish to enroll as a non-\u00addegree student should request registration information from the Registrar's Office. Non-\u00addegree students may enroll in all courses listed in the catalog, if space is available. In most cases, non-\u00addegree students are ineligible for state, federal or college-\u00adsponsored financial aid; however, they may be eligible for the VSAC non-\u00addegree grant. (Graduate courses are generally available only to students who have completed a 4-\u00adyear degree.) Extension Courses The College occasionally offers special courses to selected audiences at various locations. These courses are not listed in this catalog but are separately advertised or sponsored through agencies or other institutions. Army ROTC Johnson State College offers an Army ROTC program in collaboration with the University of Vermont. The program leads to an officer commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard. Scholarships are available to qualified applicants. For further information, contact the Department of Military Studies at the University of Vermont, 128 University Heights, Burlington, VT, 05401. Email: uvmrotc@zoo.uvm.edu. Website: www.goarmy.com/rotc Exiting the College Exiting from the College A student voluntarily exiting from the College must do so formally and in writing by completing a Student Exit Notification and Leave of Absence Form. The transcripts of students exiting the College after the beginning of the semester and prior to the withdrawal deadline (week nine) will show W grades for all courses enrolled in that semester. The transcripts of students exiting the College after the ninth week will show earned grades of A-\u00adF submitted by their instructors at the end of the semester. Students who exit from the College and who are not on an approved Leave of Absence or Stop Out (see below) may reapply by making formal application with the Admissions Office. The W grades received will be used in making an admission decision. For refunds on room, meal plan and tuition charges, see the Refund Policy in this catalog. Leave of Absence for Campus-\u00adBased Students Students in good academic standing, who have an approved Plan of Study on file, if required, and wish to interrupt their studies for a period not to exceed two consecutive regular semesters, may request a leave of absence. Students on a leave of absence do not need to apply for re-\u00adadmission and will be allowed to pre-\u00adregister during the regular advance registration period. Students may apply for a leave of absence by completing a Student Exit Notification and Leave of Absence Form. The leave is not official until the request is approved by the Registrar. A leave for one or two consecutive regular semesters may be requested prior to the add/drop deadline. In special circumstances, the leave of absence may be extended beyond the approved period with the approval of the Registrar. Stop Out for External Degree Program Students External Degree Program students must register for a minimum of three credits a semester to maintain active status in the External Degree Program. However, EDP students may take a semester or more off and re-\u00adenter the program when it is convenient, and do not need to complete a Leave of Absence Request Form. Any credits taken while out of the program that fit into their degree plan may count toward graduation as long as 30 of the last 39 credits are registered through JSC/EDP. There is no fee for re-\u00adentry. If a student has been out of the program longer than five years, he/she must reapply to the External Degree Program. Approval will be contingent, in part, on availability of courses and the student's access to them. Requesting a Transcript Johnson State College uses Transcripts on Demand by SCRIP-\u00adSAFE International as our trusted agent for processing transcript requests as well as delivering official academic transcripts electronically. This is a \"green initiative\" that provides the fastest delivery time and enables tracking of delivery and receipt. For more information, see http://www.jsc.edu/offices-\u00adnon-\u00adacademic-\u00addepartments/registrars-\u00adoffice/transcripts/. Transcripts for students with past-\u00addue bills or other obligations to any of the Vermont State Colleges will not be released until all bills are paid. Students requesting a transcript toward the end of any semester should indicate whether they want it sent immediately or whether it should be held until final grades are recorded. In the latter case, transcripts will not be sent out until at least the third week following the end of the semester. Appeal of Academic Policies Students may appeal any academic regulation or decision to the Academic Status Committee of the Faculty Assembly (for campus-\u00adbased students) or the EDP Academic Review Board (for EDP students) and then to the Academic Dean or his/her designee. The decision of the Academic Dean or his/her designee is final and may not be appealed to the President unless otherwise noted. Admission Johnson State College has a \"rolling admissions\" policy, which means we do not have an application deadline. We review applications throughout the year and within two or three weeks of receiving the application and supporting credentials an admissions decision will be made. In considering students for admission to JSC, the Admissions Office looks at a wide range of factors. We start by carefully evaluating each candidate's academic preparation, as reflected in transcripts, course selection, letters of recommendation and personal essay.

New England Award Johnson State College is a member of the New England Board of Higher Education, which provides for special tuition rates (50 percent over in-\u00adstate tuition) for students enrolling in academic programs not offered in their home state systems. Participation in this program is based on the student's primary intended program of study as indicated on their application. The discount is contingent upon the student's enrollment in a participating major. Students who do not enroll in the participating major, or who change majors during their college career, will no longer be eligible for the New England Award discount. Further information can be found at http://www.nebhe.org/. Following is the list of programs eligible for the New England Award discount at JSC as of August 2014. The list of eligible programs of study changes periodically. Check with the Admissions Office for the most current list of New England Award programs. Programs Eligible for the New England Award As of August 2014, out-\u00adof-\u00adstate students in New England who enroll in the following majors at JSC are eligible for the New England Award, which lowers the cost of tuition to 50 percent over the cost of in-\u00adstate tuition: A.A., B.A., Theater: CT, MA, Business, Hospitality & Tourism Management track: RI Communications & Community Media: ME, NH Musical Theater: MA Outdoor Education: CT, MA, ME, RI Wellness & Medicine: CT, ME, NH, RI Writing: Media Arts: MA, RI Studio Arts: ME, NH, RI Good Neighbor Award If you are a student who is a resident of one of the following counties in New York, New Hampshire or Massachusetts, or any province in Canada, you qualify for a special tuition rate of 50 percent over in-\u00adstate tuition: Massachusetts: Franklin, Jefferson, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, St. Lawrence, Warren, Washington.

Readmission to Johnson State College Former JSC students returning within one year of exiting need not reapply if an official Leave of Absence was granted by the Registrar's Office. All other JSC students seeking readmission are required to submit an application for readmission at www.jsc.edu/apply. International Students Applying for Admission Students from other countries may apply for admission into Associate's and Bachelor's degree programs at the college. To be considered for admission to Johnson State College, International students must apply electronically by using the Common Application at www.commonapp.org.

In addition to the completed Common Application, international students must submit the following credentials in order to be considered for admission: Academic Credentials Academic records in the original language and a certified English translation; Official secondary school transcripts and an official leaving certificate or diploma; Results of secondary external examinations (such as the West African Exam Council General Certificate of Education), if applicable; and Official transcripts of any university-\u00adlevel studies already completed. In order for Johnson State College to consider accepting transfer credits from foreign institutions, students must have their post-\u00adsecondary academic transcripts evaluated by an official foreign credential-\u00adevaluation service. Students are responsible for the credential evaluation and translation fees. A list of approved credential-\u00adevaluation services is available at www.edupass.org. Proof of Proficiency in the English Language For all students, success at Johnson State College requires proficiency in reading, writing and speaking English. For this reason, international students seeking admission must demonstrate their proficiency by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or by taking the language proficiency test offered through the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Official TOEFL score or IELTS test scores must be sent directly to Johnson State College from the testing agency; photocopies of test results are not accepted. The TOEFL institutional code for Johnson State College is 3766. For information regarding the submission of IELTS scores, please contact the Admissions Office at Admissions@jsc.edu or 800-\u00ad635-\u00ad2356. Applicants who score between 500 and 549 on the TOEFL paper-\u00adbased test or 61 and 80 on the Internet-\u00adbased TOEFL test, or whose IELTS scores are marginal, will need to improve their English proficiency if they are offered admission at Johnson State College. Typically these students will be required to enroll in a sequence of ESL courses and/or tutorials for English language learners (ELLs) during their first year at JSC. These courses and tutorials focus on Academic English: the writing, reading, listening and speaking skills necessary for success in college. Applicants who have had the opportunity to use spoken and written English for a sustained period of time either through life experiences or through post-\u00adsecondary education may ask to be excused from taking the TOEFL or IELTS test. If these applicants are accepted at Johnson State, they may still be required to enroll in ESL coursework and/or ELL tutorials depending on their level of proficiency as determined by the ESL academic skills coordinator and the director of the Academic Advising & Career Center. Financial Documentation Johnson State College is required by federal law to verify the financial resources of all international students. International students must demonstrate that funds exist at least for the student's first year of study and, barring unforeseen circumstances, that adequate funding will be available from the same or equally dependable sources for subsequent years. International applicants must complete the financial documentation form included in the International Application for Admission, and supply official financial documents, on official letterhead or with an official seal, in support of the form. Demonstrating Financial Support International applicants may demonstrate financial support the following ways: If you will be supported by your government or sponsoring agency, you must submit an official copy of your sponsorship award letter. If you will be supported by private funds, your sponsor (e.g., parents, relatives, businesses or other benefactors) must complete the Foreign Student Certification of Finances and submit supporting documents demonstrating that sufficient funds are available to cover your expenses while studying in the U.S. If your sponsor is in the U.S., the sponsor also must complete INS form I-\u00ad134 (Affidavit of Support), which is available at www.uscis.gov. Appropriate documents for financial verification include: Official proof of personal or family savings; Bank-\u00adissued certified letters stating available funds; Official bank statements; Bank books; and Official tax documents. Outside Sources of Funding Johnson State College encourages international students to seek financial assistance through outside sources and sponsors.

Letter of Recommendation International applicants must submit a letter of recommendation from someone who is not related to the student. A letter from an academic advisor or professor is preferred. The advisor or professor may complete the College Instructor Evaluation form of the Common Application or write a letter. Writing Sample & Signature Page International applicants are to submit a 300-\u00ad to 500-\u00adword essay with their application. The essay might explain the applicant's reason for choosing JSC, or it can address another subject of the applicant's choosing. Finally, applicants must include a page with their signature and printed name with their application. Priority Deadlines Johnson State College accepts and reviews applications for undergraduate study from international students on a year-\u00adround basis. However, we recommend that applicants submit their application materials by the following priority deadlines to give themselves ample time to arrange for immigration paperwork to be processed: Fall semester (August-\u00adDecember): March 1 Spring semester (January-\u00adMay): November 1 Accepting the Offer of Admission Applicants will be notified of our decision within three to four weeks of receipt of their completed application and supporting documentation. Upon acceptance to Johnson State College, a $300 deposit is required. JSC will issue INS Form I-\u00ad20 (issued by the U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Services) upon receipt of the deposit. This form allows international students to apply to the U.S. embassy in their country for an F-\u00ad1 student visa, which is needed to enter the U.S. For More Information More information about obtaining a student visa is available at www.uscis.gov. The U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services website at www.uscis.gov provides information about other immigration-\u00adrelated topics as well. The International Student Advisor in the JSC Admissions Office is available to assist as well and can be reached by emailing Admissions@jsc.edu or calling 800-\u00ad635-\u00ad2356. Admission of English Language Learners from the U.S. Johnson State College also encourages applications from U.S. residents whose first language is not English, because students from multicultural and international backgrounds and experiences enrich the campus academic community. In addition to completing the Common Application for admission to Johnson State College and following the instructions for applying (found in this Admissions section of the catalog), English Language Learners (ELLs) should be sure to request recommendation from their high school ESL teacher as well as their guidance counselor. Submission of TOEFL scores, while not required, is strongly encouraged. Proof of Proficiency in the English Language In order to succeed in college-\u00adlevel coursework and to participate fully in campus life, English Language Learners (ELLs) will need to continue to expand their proficiency in English upon admission to JSC. First-\u00adyear ELLs are therefore typically required to enroll in a sequence of ESL courses and/or tutorials. These courses and tutorials focus on Academic English -\u00ad-\u00ad the writing, reading, listening and speaking skills necessary for students pursuing an Associate's or Bachelor's degree. ELLs are assigned to this specialized, language-\u00adbased coursework as determined by the ESL academic skills coordinator and the director of the Academic Advising & Career Center. Learning More about Johnson State College In addition to completing a formal application to the College, prospective students are encouraged to schedule a visit to campus at www.jsc.edu/visit. Applicants who have any disability (physical or learning), or who have limited English proficiency, are encouraged to contact the Admissions Office so that special needs or accommodations can be made available where appropriate throughout the admissions process. Send questions by email to jscadmissions@jsc.edu or call us at 800-\u00ad635-\u00ad2356. Dual Enrollment Programs for High School Students Johnson State College offers two non-\u00adresidential programs for high school students who demonstrate the abilities and commitment to undertake college level course work. Dual Enrollment options are designed for students who show significant talent in academic area and who desire to challenge themselves on the post-\u00adsecondary level. Typically, students in these programs will be permitted to register for first or second-\u00adyear college courses, on a seat-\u00adavailable basis. Jump Start Program This program is available to juniors and seniors in high school, at least 16 years of age. Eligible students may take up to two-\u00adfree courses (8 college credits) between the end of their sophomore year and high school graduation. To be considered for admission for the Jump Start Program, students must be enrolled full-\u00adtime in high school or an approved home school program and must: Complete & Submit the Jump Start Application; Submit at least one letter of recommendation from a guidance counselor, principal or teacher; Request to have a copy of the student's high school or home school transcript sent to the program coordinator; and Provide a copy of the student's SAT or ACT scores if the exam was taken. Early College Program This non-\u00adresidential program is designed for high schools students at least 16 years of age, who wish to complete their senior year of high school and their first year of college simultaneously. Early College students may earn a maximum of 30 credits over two semesters tuition-\u00adfree. To be considered for admission in the Early College Program, students must be enrolled full time in high school or in an approved home school program and must: Complete the Early College Application, including the personal essay; Submit at least one letter of recommendation from the student's guidance counselor or home-\u00adschool coordinator; Request to have a copy of the high school or home school transcript sent to the program coordinator; Provide a copy of the student's SAT or ACT scores if the exam was taken; Discuss & review the Assurance Form with the student's guidance counselor and high school principal or home school coordinator; and Schedule an interview with the Early College Coordinator. Financial Aid Although the primary responsibility for financing students' education rests with their families, the Office of Student Financial Services at Johnson State College administers a comprehensive financial aid program to help students who would otherwise be unable to afford a college education. JSC offers various scholarships, grants, loans and part-\u00adtime employment to help close the gap between students' financial resources and their educational expenses. Since resources are limited, students should apply for federal, state and institutional aid early. All financial aid awards are dependent upon availability of funds and demonstration of financial need. All aid programs are subject to change due to changes in state or federal legislation. Financial Aid Eligibility To be eligible to receive financial aid, a student must: Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-\u00adcitizen (permanent resident); Generally be enrolled in a program leading to a degree or certificate; Be in good standing and maintaining satisfactory progress; Not owe a refund or repayment on any previously received Title IV financial aid funds; Not be in default on previously received national direct/defense (Perkins) or guaranteed (Stafford or direct student loans); and Be registered with the Selective Service (for males 18 years of age or older and born on or after January 1, 1960, if not currently a member of the U.S. Armed Forces). Eligibility for specific aid programs is determined on the basis of \"financial need\" -\u00ad-\u00ad the difference between the cost of attendance and what the family is expected to contribute. Need is determined on the basis of information submitted on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Renewal FAFSA. Continued eligibility, once students are in attendance, depends upon students meeting the general criteria listed above, documenting need for each academic year and remaining in good academic standing. Please contact the JSC Student Financial Services Office for more information on eligibility requirements. Financial Aid Application Procedures & Deadlines Applying for Need-\u00adBased Aid To be considered for any type of need-\u00adbased aid, including loans, students should file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Be sure to include the Johnson State College code number, 003688, on the FAFSA. A FAFSA or Renewal FAFSA must be submitted each year for continued consideration for assistance. Students need to apply for financial aid online by going to the FAFSA website: www.fafsa.gov. In addition to the FAFSA or Renewal FAFSA, students should also complete state grant applications. Vermont residents can apply for a Vermont state grant by completing the VSAC Grant Application online at www.vsac.org. Residents of other states should contact their higher education agency to inquire about state grant application procedures and deadlines. Application Deadlines Students can apply for financial aid after January 1, and JSC's priority deadline for new students (freshmen and transfers) is March 1. To ensure that an application has a processed date of March 1, students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA by February 1. New students must be accepted to JSC before a financial aid award will be offered, but students should not wait until they have applied for admission or have been admitted to apply for financial aid. Award notifications are sent to new students at the email address listed on the admission application. Awarding usually begins in February. JSC's priority deadline for currently enrolled students is May 1. Complete the FAFSA by April 1 to ensure that an application has a May 1 processed date. Award notifications are sent to returning student's JSC email accounts usually beginning in March. While applications received after the priority deadlines will be reviewed, federal and institutional aid is limited and late applicants may lose out on some types of financial aid. JSC may also require additional information such as federal tax transcripts, W-\u00ad2s and proof of untaxed income before aid awards are final and before any disbursements can be made to a student's account. Financial Aid for Summer College Most financial aid at JSC is awarded for use during the fall and spring semesters but, Pell Grants and Direct Loans are awarded to eligible students who have completed the FAFSA. The FAFSA must generally be received by the federal processor by April 1 for consideration of summer aid. Students must also complete a JSC Summer Payment/Financial Aid Application Form found in the summer course bulletin or on the JSC website. If the JSC Summer Payment/Financial Aid Application form is not received, Student Financial Services has no way of knowing that a student wants summer aid. Types of Financial Aid for Undergraduate Students Student must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any type of federal aid. Apply online at www.fafsa.ed.gov. The following need-\u00adbased financial aid programs are available to assist a large percentage of Johnson State College students. Programs Eligibility Award Amounts Federal PELL Grant Awarded to eligible undergraduates (determined by the federal government based on expected family contribution). Full-\u00adtime awards range from a maximum of $5,775 to $626 for the 2015-\u00ad2016 academic year. Amounts are determined on a yearly basis. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Awarded to assist undergraduates with exceptionally high financial need. Priority is given to PELL-\u00adeligible students. Awards range from $500-\u00ad$2,500 and are based on the availability of funds. Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Long term, low interest loan. No interest accrues while the student is enrolled at least half time. Visit the JSC website for loan eligibility amounts based on completed credits. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrower is responsible for interest during life of the loan. Student must be enrolled at least half time to borrow. Visit the JSC website for loan eligibility amounts based on completed credits. Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan Long-\u00adterm loan, interest rate determined July 1 of each year. Enables parents with a good credit history to borrow for educational expenses for their dependent student. PLUS Pre-\u00adApplication (available on the JSC Website) is required. Parents can borrow the difference between cost of attendance and aid awarded. Federal Work-\u00adstudy Program (FWS) Provides on-\u00adcampus employment for students to earn money to pay for educational expenses. Award is generally $2,000 (Student is allotted $1,000 per semester.) Vermont Student Assistance Corporation (VSAC) and State Incentive Grant Programs FAFSA required VSAC Grants are restricted to undergraduates who are permanent residents of Vermont. Complete the VSAC Grant Application at www.VSAC.org. Non-\u00adresidents are encouraged to contact their State Higher Education Agency for information on application procedures and deadlines for possible state funding. Grant amounts are determined by the individual state agencies that offer state grants. Note: Students who have already earned a baccalaureate degree are eligible only for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP) In order to maintain eligibility for financial aid, Federal regulations require that students make Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) at a pace that ensures they complete their degree within the maximum time frame allowed (as measured by credit completion rates). The second requirement is to maintain good academic standing (as measured by cumulative GPA). Students' records will be reviewed on an annual basis after the completion of the spring semester to assess compliance with this policy. All semesters of enrollment, including summer and periods in which the student did not receive federal student aid funds, will be considered in the determination of SAP. Students not making Satisfactory Academic Progress (either the pace and/or GPA requirement) will have their financial aid eligibility suspended for all aid types. Students whose aid eligibility has been suspended have the option to appeal to the Financial Aid Review Board for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility. Students who are academically dismissed from the college are automatically recognized as failing to meet SAP standards. Pace Requirement: Students must successfully complete at least 67% of the total credits for which they enroll. Successful completion of credit hours for undergraduate students means earning passing grades (D-\u00ad and above and P). For graduate students, passing grades (A, B, B-\u00ad and P) are calculated as successful. Unsuccessful completion of credit hours is represented by the grades F, NP, W and I (unless you inform us of a grade). Remedial courses are not counted in the SAP calculation. Transfer credits must be counted as both attempted and completed credits for the calculation of pace and maximum time frame but do not affect GPA. Undergraduate and graduate students may repeat previously passed courses just once and may repeat failed courses until receiving a passing grade and be allowed to receive financial aid for the repeat. All repeat attempts are, however, included in the pace and maximum time frame calculations. Example: How to Calculate the Pace Requirement If you attempt/enroll in a total of 30 credits during the fall and spring semesters, you must successfully complete at least 20 credits. Calculate using 30 credits x 67% = 20 credits. This is the minimum that must be completed. Grade Point Average (GPA): Undergraduate students with fewer than 30 attempted credits must maintain at least a cumulative GPA of 1.75. Students with 30 or more attempted credits must maintain at least a cumulative GPA of 2.0. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Cumulative GPA includes all terms of your enrollment at JSC. Maximum Time Frame: In order to receive aid, students must complete their degree within a time frame of no longer than 150% of the credits required. This includes credits attempted at JSC and transfer credits. See below for differences among associate, bachelor and master degrees. A.A. or A.S. degrees require 60 credits to meet graduation requirements; the maximum number of credits allowed for financial aid eligibility is 90. (60 credits x 150% = 90 credits) B.A., B.F.A. and B.S. degrees require 120 credits to meet graduation requirements; the maximum number for financial aid eligibility is 180 credits. (120 credits x 150% = 180 credits) M.A. and M.F.A. degree time frames are determined by the program. Notification of Aid Suspension: Students whose aid has been suspended will receive notification mailed to their home address and by email. The notification will explain which SAP requirement(s) has/have not been met as well as instructions for the appeal process. Students do not have to appeal if they no longer want financial aid. Academically dismissed students who are appealing their dismissal from JSC must request a SAP Appeal Form from Student Financial Services. Types of Aid Suspended: All federal aid (Pell Grants, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG), Work-\u00adstudy, Direct subsidized or unsubsidized student loans, Graduate PLUS and Parent PLUS Loan), State Incentive Grants, JSC Institutional Grants, JSC Scholarships, as well as Private Educational Loans. This may also apply to scholarships/loans from an outside resource. JSC scholarships that have specific requirements in order to maintain eligibility (GPA for example) will not be reinstated even with an appeal approval. Appeal Process: Students who elect to submit an appeal must explain why they failed to make Satisfactory Academic Progress and what has changed in their situation that will allow them to make Satisfactory Academic Progress going forward. Students should include the reason(s) their academic performance was affected, such as extenuating circumstances that had an impact. Some examples may be illness, death of a family member, etc. A typed, one-\u00adpage explanation with your name and Student ID# is required. Third-\u00adparty documentation that can substantiate the circumstances is strongly recommended. In most cases, no more than two appeals will be considered and only if the student has new information to provide. Appeals will be reviewed by the JSC Financial Aid Review Board; please note that submission of an appeal does not mean it is approved. Items considered will be the student's ability to meet the required Pace and/or GPA after a one-\u00adsemester probationary period, the ability of the student to complete his/her degree within the maximum time frame, and/or the student's ability and willingness to adhere to specific stipulations of an academic plan created with an advisor. If a student's appeal is approved, the student's financial aid eligibility will be reinstated on a probationary basis; aid will be awarded per payment period. Progress will be checked at the end of each payment period/semester to see if SAP standards are now met or an academic plan is being adhered to; this includes summer terms. Notification of Decision: Students are notified only by email, using their JSC email address. It is the student's responsibility to monitor his/her JSC email account and check for communications regarding financial aid. Students are encouraged to observe all routine application procedures and deadlines for financial aid while waiting for notification of a decision. If an appeal is not granted, a student may re-\u00adestablish eligibility to be considered for federal aid in the future by attending JSC without financial aid assistance until the SAP policy requirements are meet. The decision of the JSC Financial Aid Review Board is final and may not be appealed. How to Avoid Satisfactory Academic Progress Problems from Day One Plan your class schedule and workload carefully so you do not need to withdraw from courses. If you need to withdraw from a course, check with your advisor and the Office of Student Financial Services first. Your grades are important; take your education seriously and get assistance if you are struggling in a class. Remember that student loans must be repaid. Do not go into debt and have nothing to show for it. Veterans' Benefits Students eligible to receive veterans' education benefits must contact the Registrar's Office and arrange to have their enrollment certified with the Veterans Administration. The amount of monthly checks is determined by full-\u00ad or part-\u00adtime enrollment status. In order to receive maximum benefits, students must be enrolled full-\u00adtime in at least 12 credits during a regular semester. Those enrolled in fewer than 12 credits receive proportionately smaller benefits. Enrolling in an independent study (research, field work, internship) or in music or health and physical education courses may affect the amount of monthly checks. Students contemplating enrolling in these courses should call the V.A. to determine exactly how benefits will be affected. V.A. regulations exempt some internship experiences from reduction in benefits. Veterans enrolling in an internship should consult the Registrar's Office to determine whether their internships comply with these special regulations. In order to be considered for maximum benefit payments, the internship must comply with the following special V.A. criteria in addition to meeting JSC requirements: Each approved field experience must have a college faculty member as an assigned instructor and must be supervised by the College. The planned program of activities must be controlled by the College. Meetings must be regularly scheduled on at least a weekly basis to provide for interaction between the instructor and the student. (Class attendance is defined as any regularly scheduled meeting with the instructor, regardless of location.) Appropriate assignments must be required. The grading system must be the same as that used for in-\u00adresidence courses at the College. Required preparation and training time per credit hour must be at least as great as normally required for other courses offered at the College. The field experience approved by the College must be required for graduation. The field experience must be measured in the same unit (semester credits) as other courses. Students residing off campus and expecting a refund of financial aid funds for living expenses will not receive those funds until after the add/drop period. The student veteran is responsible for seeing that the internship contract form explicitly indicates how each of these criteria is met. Costs Tuition & Fees, 2015-\u00ad2016 Academic Year Full tuition and fees are charged to undergraduate students registered for 12 to 18 credit hours per semester. Students taking fewer than 12 credits are considered part-\u00adtime students and are billed for the credit hours they take. Students taking more than 18 credits are billed on a cost-\u00adper-\u00adcredit basis for the additional credits. During the summer, out-\u00adof-\u00adstate residents are charged the in-\u00adstate tuition rate plus 50 percent. Vermont residents who are 65 or older as of the first date of classes and who are not matriculated receive a full tuition waiver.

VSC Policy 301 may be read in its entirety here. (Select Policies & Procedures\" under \"About VSC\" at www.vsc.edu, then \"Student Affairs Policies.\") Payment Procedures Finalize Payment with the Office of Student Financial Services All students must finalize payment with Student Financial Services. \"Finalize Payment\" means that: All semester charges and any previously due balance are paid in full or covered by a monthly payment plan sufficient to cover tuition and fees for the semester; AND All financial aid (grants, loans and scholarships) is ready to be disbursed, if applicable; AND The student has either elected or waived the VSC health insurance. Monthly Payment Plan Students may sign up for a monthly payment plan by accessing Student Services on the MyJSC Portal (http://MyJSC.jsc.edu). Students using this plan will be considered to have finalized payment upon confirmation of plan participation. The plan enables the student or parent to pay all or part of the semester's charges in four, five or six equal installments starting June 1. (Participation in the plan also may start after June 1.) Visit the portal or call Student Financial Services at 802-\u00ad635-\u00ad1671 for more information. Payment Due Dates Student bills are posted to the Student Services section of the MyJSC Portal on the 1st and 15th of each month. Payment due dates are published on the student billing site. A late fee applies if payment is not finalized by the payment due date. Students owing money from prior semesters may not register for classes until the outstanding balance is paid. Current-\u00adsemester bills that are not paid in full by the end of the semester will result in withholding of transcripts and possible administrative dismissal until a satisfactory settlement is made. Students can receive supplemental charges during a semester for such items as residence hall charges or parking fines. These charges are listed on student bills and can be viewed on the MyJSC Portal. Payment is due 30 days from the date on the bill. Application of Financial Aid Awards Financial aid that has been reported to Student Financial Services is credited as follows: Grant funds authorized by Student Financial Services are credited directly to student accounts. Perkins Loans and Federal Direct Loans are credited to student accounts after promissory notes have been signed. Students who anticipate receiving financial assistance from sources other than the College are reminded to arrange for payments to be forwarded to Student Financial Services as early as possible. Students are advised to confirm these other sources of financial assistance with Student Financial Services. Paychecks are issued to students for work-\u00adstudy and other campus employment once they obtain a job and begin submitting time sheets. Anticipated employment earnings cannot be used as a credit against a student's account. Students residing off campus and expecting a refund of financial aid funds for living expenses will not receive those refunds until after the add/drop period and their aid has been transmitted. Refund Policy In the event of withdrawal, dismissal, resignation, leave of absence or the dropping of classes in a manner that affects student charges, including tuition, room and board, and course and other fees, any refund will be calculated on a daily pro-\u00adrata basis, using the same schedule used to determine the amount of the federal Title IV returns, with the following exceptions: If a student withdraws during the first seven calendar days of the semester, the amount of refund of all student charges (tuition, fees, room and board) will be 100 percent. If a student withdraws after the 60 percent point of the semester, there will be no refund of charges for tuition, fees and room. Fees paid to acquire college health insurance are not refundable under any circumstances. If a student is suspended or dismissed from on-\u00adcampus housing, there will be no credit of room charges. However, board (meal) charges will be credited for each full week of suspension/dismissal from on-\u00adcampus housing. The pro-\u00adrata calculation is the number of calendar days completed divided by the number of total calendar days included for the full semester. For all students, including External Degree Program students, the first day of the semester is the date the classes start as published in the College catalog, regardless of the date of the student's first class. NOTE: Ceasing to attend classes does not constitute the dropping of classes or withdrawal from the College. In order to be eligible for a refund or repayment as outlined above, a student MUST notify the Dean of Students and the Registrar's Office of his/her withdrawal. Tuition Adjustments Any adjustments in tuition charges will be based on the courses on record at the end of the second week of the semester. No tuition refund will be given for any half-\u00adsemester course dropped after the second week of the semester, for classes dropped during the mid-\u00adsemester add/drop period, or for approved late withdrawals. The student or parent may appeal the refund policy if he/she believes there are individual circumstances that warrant an exception. Appeals are made to the Dean of Administration. Adjustments to Financial Aid Awards Financial aid awards may need to be adjusted if a student exits the college during a semester. Federal regulations govern the return of Title IV funds for students eligible for federal financial aid. The College is guided by those regulations with regard to the return of institutional aid as well. Other aid, such as state grants and outside scholarships, will be returned as specified by the grantor. If a student stops attending all classes and does not complete an Exit Notification and/or Leave of Absence Form at that time, any Title IV funds received by that student may be adjusted or canceled, and the student will then be personally responsible for his/her bill. If Title IV money needs to be returned, it will be returned in the following sequence: Federal Unsubsidized Loan Federal Subsidized Loan Federal Perkins Loan Federal PLUS Loan Federal Pell Grant FSEOG Employment through the federal work-\u00adstudy program is terminated on the date the student withdraws. Awards from sources other than the College and Title IV funding are adjusted according to the source agency's own policy. The External Degree Program follows the same refund policies as noted above. If an EDP student withdraws from a course at another institution, the student will be charged the prorated tuition and fees due to the other institution. Administrative Dismissal Students with outstanding overdue balances on their accounts and who have not responded to inquiries from Student Financial Services about payment or who have indicated a refusal to pay that balance are subject to administrative dismissal from the College. Administratively dismissed students must cease attending all classes immediately, do not receive any credit for work done during that semester, and remain liable for the unpaid balance. If the student is administratively dismissed after the first seven days and before the end of the 60 percent point of the semester, he/she will be credited tuition, fees, aid, and room and board on a pro-\u00adrata basis. The pro-\u00adrata basis calculation will use the number of calendar days completed divided by the number of total calendar days included for the full semester. After the 60 percent point of the semester, there is no adjustment for tuition, fees or room charges. Student Services Academic & Student Life Orientation New first-\u00adyear and transfer students must attend an orientation program that occurs just prior to the start of the semester. Students will participate in a series of meetings, information sessions, small-\u00adgroup activities, social gatherings and special events intended to ensure a successful transition to Johnson State College. Administrators, faculty, staff and upper-\u00adclass students are available to assist students with their introduction to the JSC community. Students will have an opportunity to discuss academic requirements, social and recreational activities, and the regulations and rules governing college life. Office of First-\u00adYear Experience The First-\u00adYear Experience Program includes a variety of programs and services designed to help first year students make a successful transition to the demands of college life.

Services for Students with Disabilities Johnson State College is committed to providing students with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in all aspects of the educational environment. The learning specialist in the Office of Academic Support Services works with students with disabilities to obtain appropriate accommodations, such as testing accommodations, note-\u00adtaking assistance, sign language interpreters, textbooks in alternative formats, and assistive technologies. Current and comprehensive documentation of a disability is necessary to be eligible for academic accommodations. Guidelines and necessary forms are available on the JSC website and the MyJSC Portal at http://MyJSC.jsc.edu. Academic Coaching & Tutoring Academic Support Services provides a friendly and supportive environment for students seeking to improve their academic performance. Professional staff and peer coaches can help foster academic success by encouraging students to become more independent learners. Services for TRIO Students Academic Support Services is partially funded by a federal TRIO grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The purpose of TRIO is to provide support to populations typically under-\u00adserved by post-\u00adsecondary education. To be eligible for TRIO services, a student must meet at least one of the following criteria: be from a family where neither parent completed a four-\u00adyear bachelor's degree; be from a family of low or modest income; or have a documented disability. Services to students accepted into the TRIO program at JSC include priority standing for academic coaching, access to technology, financial-\u00adliteracy information, and free tickets to selected campus cultural events. National Student Exchange The National Student Exchange (NSE), coordinated out of the Advising & Career Center, is a network of nearly 200 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. Through NSE, JSC students who meet the eligibility requirements can spend a semester or a year at one of these institutions, earning credit toward their JSC degree typically at JSC tuition rates. International exchange opportunities are available through participating institutions with study-\u00adabroad programs open to NSE exchange students. Study Abroad In addition to the study-\u00adabroad opportunities available through NSE and various affiliate programs, many JSC programs and faculty sponsor short-\u00adterm international study tours, field research projects and service learning opportunities. Early planning is encouraged to assure the timely completion of all academic degree requirements. Students considering a semester abroad should meet with an advisor in the Advising & Career Center at least six months prior to the semester in which they wish to study abroad. All study-\u00adabroad experiences that are not part of a class must be arranged through the Advising & Career Center. Support for International Students Johnson State College creates opportunities for the campus community to meet and interact with students from multicultural and international backgrounds. Committed to enhancing the diversity of its student body, the College promotes the enrollment of international students, as well as U.S. residents who are English language learners (ELLs), whose participation in college life helps expand the JSC community's awareness of world and intercultural issues and events. Students at JSC have come from numerous countries, including Canada, Colombia, Jamaica, Korea, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Japan, Pakistan, France, Poland, Indonesia, Norway, Congo, Sudan, Romania, China, Gabon, Argentina, Somalia and the Philippines. JSC offers a wide range of support to English language learners to assist in a successful transition to the challenges of American college life and studies, including: orientation to campus and community life; support for cultural and academic adjustment; advice and assistance with career, immigration and visa matters; advocacy to enhance campus awareness of multicultural perspectives; and academic support to meet the needs of international students and English language learners. Public Safety The Office of Public Safety is here for the safety of all students, faculty and staff on the JSC campus. In addition to overseeing campus security and This office also coordinates the work of the Campus Crisis Response Team, a group of staff and faculty that meets regularly to plan procedures in the event of a crisis or emergency on campus. In addition, a variety of safety and security training programs are offered through the Residence Life office and the Counseling Center. Information on current JSC policies relevant to criminal actions, campus law enforcement, training programs, policies and campus crime statistics can be found on the Johnson State College website at www.jsc.edu/offices-\u00adnon-\u00adacademic-\u00addepartments/public-\u00adsafety/campus-\u00adsafety-\u00adinformation. Residence Life The Office of Residence Life facilitates student growth and development by providing a variety of options in living environments, programs and activities.
