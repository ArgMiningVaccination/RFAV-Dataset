(For more information on this, read our guide, [What You Need to Know About Measles](https://www.earthley.com/product/what-you-need-to-know-about-measles/).) As a result, measles with vitamin A deficiency can lead to complications. To prevent that, vitamin A should be supplemented. Cod Liver Oil is is a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. Elderberry Elixir \u2014 Rich in vitamin C, elderberry is a potent cold and flu fighter and may also be beneficial at countering the flu-like symptoms of measles. It can also fight potential complications that can come from co-infection with the influenza virus. Made with 100% organic ingredients, Elderberry Elixir is shelf-stable and super concentrated; doses are mere drops per day, meaning it is the most cost-effective option for elderberry immune support. Immune-Aid Vitamin C Powder \u2014 Increasing vitamin C intake during periods of sickness can support the immune system and help with recovery. Our natural vitamin C powder is made from two of the highest sources of vitamin C: camu camu and acerola berry powders. It also contains orange peel, which is rich in vitamin C and has some antibacterial properties, especially against bacteria that causes diarrhea (a common complication of measles).
