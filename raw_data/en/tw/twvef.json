Ginger also has antibacterial properties, making it an effective remedy for sore throats and other respiratory infections. Ginger can be added to tea or used in cooking. - [Turmeric](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/jiang-huang?_pos=2&_sid=7e0261a4e&_ss=r)Turmeric is not just a delicious spice to add to your favorite stir fries and curries. It is an herbal medicinal high in curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory antioxidant. Curcumin can help [support the immune system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17569218/)by reducing inflammation in the body. - [Chrysanthemum](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/ye-ju-hua?_pos=1&_sid=747a4bf99&_ss=r)Chrysanthemum tea is often consumed in fall and spring - and for good reason. This flower contains a high concentration of [antioxidants and flavonoids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19429354/)that help strengthen the immune system to fight off colds and allergies during the vulnerable change of seasons. Chrysanthemum flower has also been found to have anti-inflammatory properties, which help prevent chronic immune dysfunction. - [Huang Qi](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/huang-qi?_pos=1&_sid=62c261acd&_ss=r)Huang qi, also known as astragalus root, is a traditional Chinese herb that is best known for boosting energy and immunity. The herb contains a variety of compounds, including polysaccharides and saponins, that have been shown to enhance the immune system by [stimulating the production of white blood cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28830214/)and other immune cells. Huang qi has also been found to have antibacterial and antiviral properties, which can help protect the body against infections. Regular consumption of huang qi supplements or tea can help improve overall health and boost the body's natural defense against diseases. - [Hong Jing Tian](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/hong-jing-tian-rhodiola-rosea)Like huang qi, hong jing tian is an herbal adaptogen that supports the body's natural defenses.

Studies show that reishi contains compounds that boost white blood cells, making it easier for the immune system to mount an effective response to pathogens. Chinese Herbal Formulas for Immune Boosting While single herbs can be helpful to improve immune health, Chinese herbal formulas offer a targeted and well-rounded approach to boosting the immune system. Along with actively supporting immune health, these formulas also significantly reduce inflammation and address the underlying cause of a weak or overactive immune system. - [CytoSupport](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/cytosupport-nei-wei-qi-critical-support-herbal-extract-2-oz?_pos=1&_sid=ffc894f4e&_ss=r)CytoSupport is an herbal tincture that prevents viral infections from thriving. Herbs like huang qin and ginger work to prevent viruses from entering host cells and replicating. Their potent anti-inflammatory effects also calm the cytokine storm that often follows an infection. - [Nei Wei Qi](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/nei-wei-qi-basic-immune-support?_pos=1&_sid=d0ff28bb4&_ss=r)There are many different types of Qi that circulate in the body. One specialized type is \"Wei Qi.\" Wei Qi is the qi that circulates at the surface of the body and defends us against external pathogens and makes up a substantial part of the immune system in Chinese medicine. This formula combines a blend of herbs that both fight infection and build and support your body's Wei Qi from the root. - [Wen Bing Defense Formula](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/wen-bing-defense-immune-system-support-formula?variant=31461843206211)This formula fights what Chinese medicine considers \"wind-heat\" pathogens. These infections and allergies cause hot, painful symptoms like sore throats, dry coughs, sticky yellow mucus, and rashes. The Wen Bing Defense formula neutralizes inflammation with cooling anti-inflammatory herbs to restore your balance and bring you back to health. - [Shanghan Lun Defense Formula](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/shanghan-lun-defense-liquid-extract-formula)In contrast to the Wen Bing Defense Formula, the Shanghan Lun Defense Formula addresses immune conditions with a cold or damp nature (like chills, runny nose or aching muscles). The herbal tincture works to strengthen the immune system, eliminate cold pathogens, warm the channels and restore lung and respiratory health. - [Immuni-Tea](https://plumdragonherbs.com/products/immuni-tea?_pos=1&_sid=9e3e081f2&_ss=r)A daily tea tonic like Plum Dragon Herb's Immuni-Tea can help you boost immunity and overcome allergies all year long.
