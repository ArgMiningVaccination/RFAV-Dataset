Short-term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short-term market outlook for pulp has decreased to good/ satisfactory (previously good) and that the short-term market outlook for energy has improved to good (previously satisfactory). Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for services, flow control, automation systems, and board and paper, and the satisfactory short-term market outlook for tissue. The short-term market outlook is given for the next six months from the end of the reported period. It is based on customer activity (50%) and Valmet's capacity utilization (50%), and the scale is 'weak-satisfactory-good'. President and CEO Pasi Laine: Strong start for Flow Control as part of Valmet \"Valmet's orders received increased to EUR 1,306 million in the second quarter of 2022. Orders received increased in Automation and Services segments, and decreased in the Process Technologies segment. Our order backlog increased to EUR 4,784 million, which is EUR 688 million higher than at the end of 2021. Net sales increased in all business lines. This is a good achievement, as lockdowns in China, the w ar in Ukraine and a fire at one of our sites in Finland impacted the operations during the quarter. Comparable EBITA increased, but Comparable EBITA margin decreased. Comparable EBITA increased in Automation and Services, and decreased in Process Technologies. Cost inflation impacted Valmet's margins during the quarter. Valmet's goal is to offset the cost inflation at least partly through increased productivity, procurement savings and price increases. The merger of Neles into Valmet was completed on April 1, 2022, and Neles became Valmet's fifth business line called Flow Control. Flow Control is part of Valmet's Automation segment. The integration of Flow Control into Valmet is proceeding according to the plan. Active sales and marketing of Valmet's whole offering and i mplementation of several cost synergy actions Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 3were started during the quarter . Our customers appreciate Valmet's unique offering, which combines process technologies, automation and services.\" Merger with Neles On July 2, 2021, Valmet announced that the Boards of Directors of Valmet Oyj and Neles Corporation had signed a combination agreement and a merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger. Both companies held an Extraordinary General Meeting on September 22, 2021, and both EGMs approved the merger. Valmet and Neles had received all competition approvals for the merger of Neles into Valmet on March 21, 2022. Valmet's Annual General Meeting on March 22, 2022, resolved to pay a dividend of EUR 1.20 per share and the Neles Annual General Meeting on March 22, 2022, resolved to pay a dividend of EUR 0.266 per share in accordance with the combination agreement. In addition, Neles' Board of Directors decided on March 22, 2022, on an extra distribution of funds in total of EUR 2.00 per share in accordance with the combination agreement. The dividends and Neles' extra distribution of funds of EUR 2.00 per share were executed on March 31, 2022. The merger of Valmet and Neles was registered with the Finnish Trade Register on April 1, 2022. On July 2, 2021, Valmet entered into EUR 350 million term loan facilities agreement with Danske Bank A/S and Nordea Bank Abp. The syndication of the term loan facilities was closed on October 20, 2021. The loan was used for refinancing existing indebtedness of Valmet and Neles in connection with the merger. EUR 215 million (originally 301 million) bridge facility agreement originally entered into by Neles was transferred to Valmet in connection with the completion of the merger. The bridge loan facility was used for financing of the extra distribution to shareholders of Neles. On March 22, 2022, the Boards of Directors of Valmet and Neles approved a loan agreement between the companies concerning the part of the extra distribution of funds of EUR 2.00 per share payable to Valmet. According to the loan agreement, the part of the extra distribution payable to Valmet as a shareholder of Neles was not paid in cash to Valmet in connection with payment of the extra distribution to other shareholders of Neles, but the amount payable to Valmet was recorded as debt owed by Neles to Valmet. Valmet and Neles were separate listed companies prior to the merger. On April 1, 2022, Valmet announced that the statutory merger of Neles Corporation into Valmet had been registered and the combination of Valmet's and Neles' business operations had been completed. Neles is consolidated into Valmet as of April 1, 2022, and forms Valmet's fifth business line called Flow Control. After the merger, Valmet's business lines are Services, Flow Control, Automation Systems, Paper, and Pulp and Energy. Automation Systems business line was previously called Automation. The final Shareholders' Meeting of Neles was held June 22, 2022, in Vantaa. The Shareholders' Meeting adopted the final accounts of Neles in accordance with Chapter 16, Section 17 of the Finnish Companies Act, consisting of the financial statements and annual report for the financial period January 1 , 2022 - March 31, 2022 . The Shareholders' Meeting also resolved on discharging the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO of Neles from liability. Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 4Update on the integration of Flow Control into Valmet The integration of Flow Control (former Neles) into Valmet is proceeding according to the plan. Active sales and marketing of Valmet's whole offering was commenced, and implementation of several cost synergy actions regarding function costs, common locations and supply chain was started during Q2. Valmet expects to generate annual run rate synergies of approximately EUR 25 million, of which approximately 60 percent are expected to be achieved by the end of 2023 and approximately 90 percent by the end of 2024. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sanctions on Russia Due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Valmet reviewed key contractual obligations, project schedules, and identified risks for projects that are delivered to Russia. Based on the review, Valmet identified projects that it estimates no longer to meet the criteria of a customer contract for revenue recognition purposes, and consequently made a reversal of approximately EUR 80 million to its order backlog as at June 30, 2022 . On June 3, 2022, Valmet announced that it has initiated employee reductions, which will result in a 50 percent reduction in the number of employees in Russia in th e first implementation phase. Consequently, Valmet recorded an expense of approximately EUR 20 million in January-June for estimated restructuring costs, asset impairments and other exceptional items triggered by Valmet's decision to withdraw from Russia. These costs have been reported in cost of sales, in selling, general and administrative expenses and in other operating expenses, and have been reported as items affecting comparability. Therefore they do not impact Comparable EBITA. At the end of June 2022, Valmet had a total of approximately 80 employees in Russia , working primarily in sales, engineering, maintenance and financial administration. Valmet does not have production in Russia. Approximately 2 percent of Valmet's total net sales came from its Russian operations in 2021. Valmet will withdraw from Russia completely and will continue to implement the withdrawal in stages as the review of implementation options is fully completed. Valmet complies with all sanctions and export regulations impacting business with Russia and Belarus and monitors the development actively.

Based on the review, Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 22Valmet identified projects that it estimates no longer to meet the criteria of a customer contract for revenue recognition purposes, and consequently made a reversal of approximately EUR 80 million to its order backlog as at June 30, 2022.

The layoffs will be temporary and are estimated to last a maximum of 90 days. The negotiations involve around 340 employees.

Resolutions of Valmet's Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting 2022 was held in Helsinki on March 22, 2022. The Annual General Meeting adopted the Financial Statements for 2021 and discharged the members of Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 31the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial year 2021. The Annual General Meeting adopted the remuneration report for governing bodies. The decision is advisory.

Valmet published a stock exchange release on March 22, 2022, concerning the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting and the organizing meeting of the Board of Directors. The stock exchange release and meeting materials can be viewed on Valmet's website at www.valmet.com/agm . Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long- and short-term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 32stable business (Services and Automation segments) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long-term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10-30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effects, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Should the global issues with component availability and logistics continue, it could have adverse effects on Valmet's business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Raw material and component cost inflation has accelerated, and wage inflation is continuing. Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and price increases. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Valmet's operations, products and services rely largely on data networks, software and digital solutions. Any malfunctions and cyber security breaches in such networks, software and solutions as well as potential failures in information system development projects may adversely affect Valmet's business and financial position and lead to reputational damage. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project-specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 33on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non-current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 3.6 years . Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increase in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well-positioned to keep capital expenditure approximately at the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at June 30, 2022 , Valmet had EUR 1,625 million (EUR 716 million ) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the carrying value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements. COVID-19 pandemic Depending on the success in suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic and in case the outbreak will be further prolonged, there could be further adverse impact on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, supply chain and availability of financing for both Valmet and its customers. Epidemic outbreaks and potential other pandemics remain a risk to Valmet's operations also after COVID-19. Pandemics might have impact on the supply chain and business operations by increasing the likelihood of interruptions. Valmet's operations are dispersed all around the world, Valmet has a global customer base and our suppliers operate in several countries. This mitigates the overall impacts of risks to Valmet, should there be any disruptions in some isolated country or case. Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 34Valmet currently has a solid order backlog, strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with a flexible organization, and a structured way to operate in changing circumstances. This will support Valmet in mitigating the global challenges caused by COVID-19 and other pandemics. Valmet also has a Global Incident Management Team (IMT), and regional IMT structure established to manage Valmet's response to pandemics. Russia's invasion of Ukraine Russia's invasion of Ukraine causes significant risks and uncertainties to the markets affecting the entire global economic environment and financial markets. If the war is further prolonged or geopolitical tensions increase further, there could be additional adverse impacts on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, availability and prices of components, supply chain and availability of financing for both Valmet and its customers. Valmet has an Incident Management Team (IMT) to monitor the situation and manage company\u00b4s response to the impacts of the war. Valmet will withdraw from Russia completely. Approximately 2 percent of Valmet's total net sales came from its Russian operations in 2021. Valmet does not have production in Russia. Events after the reporting period On July 4, 2022, Valmet announced the composition of its Nomination Board. According to Annual General Meeting's decision, Valmet's Nomination Board consists of the representatives of Valmet's four largest shareholders as of July 1, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors as an expert member. Should a shareholder not wish to exercise his/her nomination right, the right shall be transferred to the next largest shareholder who otherwise would not be entitled to nominate a member. Based on the shareholder register of Euroclear on July 1, 2022, Valmet Oyj's largest shareholders represented in the Nomination Board are Solidium Oy, Oras Invest Oy, Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company and Cevian Capital Partners Limited. The following persons have been nominated as their representatives to Valmet's Nomination Board: Annareetta Lumme-Timonen, Investment Director, Solidium Oy Jari Paasikivi, Chairman the Board of Directors, Oras Invest Oy Mikko Mursula, Deputy CEO, Investments, Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company Philip Ahlgren, Vice President, Cevian Capital Partners Limited Mikael M\u00e4kinen, Chairman of Valmet's Board of Directors, will serve as the Nomination Board's expert member. The Nomination Board is to prepare proposals on the composition and members of the Board of Directors and their remuneration for the next Annual General Meeting, which is planned to be held on March 22, 2023. There have been no other subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Guidance for 2022 Valmet reiterates its guidance issued on April 1, 2022, in which Valmet estimates that, including the merger with Neles, net sales in 2022 will increase in comparison with 2021 (EUR 3,935 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2022 will increase in comparison with 2021 (EUR 429 million). Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 35Market outlook General economic outlook according to OECD The world is paying a heavy price for Russia's war in Ukraine. Besides the humanitarian disaster, the war has also triggered a cost-of-living crisis, affecting people worldwide. When coupled with China's zero-COVID policy, the war has set the global economy on a course of slower growth and rising inflation - a situation not seen since the 1970s. Global GDP growth is now projected to slow sharply this year, to around 3 percent, and remain at a similar pace in 2023. (OECD Economic Outlook, June 2022) Short-term market outlook Valmet estimates that the short-term market outlook for pulp has decreased to good/ satisfactory (previously good) and that the short-term market outlook for energy has improved to good (previously satisfactory). Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for services, flow control, automation systems, and board and paper, and the satisfactory short-term market outlook for tissue. The short-term market outlook is given for the next six months from the end of the reported period. It is based on customer activity (50%) and Valmet's capacity utilization (50%), and the scale is 'weak-satisfactory-good'.

The net sales of Coldwater were approximately EUR 15 million in the last twelve months. The acquired operations employ approximately 60 employees, who are located in Atlanta and Appleton in the United States and Kil in Sweden. The acquired business has been consolidated into the Group financials from the acquisition date onwards. The acquisition of Coldwater did not have a material impact on the results or financial position of Valmet, or its financial reporting for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Merger of Valmet and Neles On April 1, 2022, Valmet announced that the statutory merger of Neles Corporation into Valmet had been registered and the combination of Valmet's and Neles' business operations had been completed. Neles delivers mission-critical flow control innovations, technologies, and services for the continuously evolving needs of global process industries, helping customers to improve their process performance and to ensure the safe flow of materials. Net sales of Neles were approximately EUR 611 million in 2021, and Neles employed approximately 2,900 employees. The purpose of the merger was to create a leading company with a unique, competitive and balanced total offering for process industries globally. The merger was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, with Valmet determined as the acquirer of Neles. As Valmet held an equity interest in Neles prior to the merger, the merger was accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages. The total merger consideration consists of the fair value of the shares issued as merger consideration, the fair value of Valmet's previously held equity interest in Neles, and the effect from the settlement of pre-existing relationship between Valmet and Neles. Net cash inflow associated with the business combination consist of cash and cash equivalents acquired, amounting to EUR 130 million. Neles' shareholders, excluding Valmet as well as Neles with respect to treasury shares held by Neles, received as merger consideration 0.3277 new shares in Valmet for each share they held in Neles on the merger completion date. A total of 34,664,986 new shares were issued as merger consideration, for which the fair value was determined, based on the listed share price as at March 31, 2022, of 28.21 EUR, to be EUR 978 million. Valmet's previously held equity interest in Neles was remeasured to fair value at the merger date. The fair value of Valmet's previously held equity interest was EUR 411 million, and a gain of EUR 59 million was recognized in Other operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The settlement of pre-existing relationship consists of the elimination of a EUR 89 million receivable arising from Neles' extra distribution of funds, netted with the elimination of EUR 1 million of trade payables.Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 44The components of the merger consideration transferred and their fair values are summarized in the following table. EUR millionAs at April 1, 2022 Shares issued as merger consideration 978 Fair value of Valmet's previously held equity interest in Neles 411 Settlement of pre-existing relationship 87 Total merger consideration 1,476 Neles has been consolidated into Valmet as of April 1, 2022. Fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and goodwill recognized at the date of acquisition is summarized in the following table. The net assets acquired are denominated in euro. The accounting for the business combination is based on provisional amounts and is not final. Goodwill arising from the business combination is attributable to the assembled workforce, value of geographic presence and future customers, technologies and products, and synergies expected to be derived from the combined businesses. The goodwill arising from the merger is not expected to be tax-deductible. From the merger completion date, the acquired business has contributed EUR 177 million to net sales and EUR -5 million to the profit of the Group, including EUR 28 million amortization of intangibles and inventory fair-value step-up recognized at acquisition. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, management estimates that Valmet's Consolidated Statement of Income would show net sales of EUR 2,410 million and profit for the period amounting to EUR 184 million, with the assumption that the fair value adjustments as at the merger completion date would have been the same if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2022. Acquisition related costs of EUR 10 million have been charged to Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income in January-June 2022.Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 45Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and goodwill at the date of acquisition: EUR millionAs at April 1, 2022 Non-current assets Goodwill 879 Other intangible assets 830 Property, plant and equipment 77 Leased assets 47 Deferred tax asset 24 Other non-current assets 13 Total non-current assets 1,869 Current assets Inventories 202 Trade receivables 86 Other current financial assets 1 Other current assets 48 Cash and cash equivalents 130 Total current assets 466 Non-current liabilities Non-current lease liabilities 35 Post-employment benefits 18 Deferred tax liabilities 213 Total non-current liabilities 267 Current liabilities Current debt 384 Current lease liabilities 12 Trade payables 60 Provisions 9 Amounts due to customers under revenue contracts 30 Other current liabilities 98 Total current liabilities 592 Net assets acquired 1,476 Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January-June 2022 | 46Reportable segments and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet has three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Services, Automation and Process Technologies. Corporate functions are presented as Other. The Services segment provides customers with flexible and fit-for-purpose services throughout the lifecycle to improve process performance and reliability. The Automation segment delivers automation solutions ranging from single measurements to mill- or plant- wide process automation systems, and mission-critical flow control technologies and services for the process industries . The Process Technologies segment provides technology solutions for pulp and energy production, as well as for biomass conversion and emission control, and complete production lines, machine rebuilds and process components for board, tissue and paper production. Valmet adopted its current financial reporting structure on January 1, 2022. The financial reporting structure was revised to reflect Valmet's new operational model, in anticipation of the forthcoming integration of Neles into Valmet, and is aligned with the way the CODM evaluates the operational performance of the segments and allocates resources. Previously Valmet had one reportable segment. Valmet has restated segment information for comparative periods. Accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used in preparing the consolidated interim financial statements. One key indicator of performance reviewed by the CODM is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e., with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of Valmet's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expenses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as restructuring costs, and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non-current assets, and income and expenses incurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impairment charges and income and expenses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g., penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to closed lawsuits) as well as income and expenses arising from changes in legislation expected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g., customs or other tariffs imposed by authorities on Valmet's products).

Entity-wide information Valmet has operations globally in over 35 countries. Measured by net sales, the top three countries in January-June 2022 were China , the USA and Finland , which together accounted for 47 percent of total net sales. In January-June 2021 , the top three countries were China , the USA and Finland , which together accounted for 45 percent of total net sales.

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long-term capital projects, for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost-to-cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short-term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Flow Control business line's valves equipment sales are recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long-term contracts and short-term service contracts. The nature of long-term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short-term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing capital projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non-payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re-evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non-collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customers in long-term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts. Following tables provide specification of movements in amounts due from customers under revenue contracts and amounts due to customers under revenue contracts over the reporting period. Revenue recognized in the period also includes revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, the amount of which however is insignificant.
