On the few days he had off, he slept. He was struggling. And ironically, he was in charge of mindfulness resources for his coworkers also on the COVID frontlines. \"It was really traumatic, and I don't think most of us realized that until we started to see the vaccine come out,\" said Collins, who works at [Miriam Hospital ](https://www.lifespan.org/locations/miriam-hospital)in Providence, Rhode Island. The dark days of COVID-19 have pressed on, but Collins is doing much better now, thanks to a new coping mechanism. He learned transcendental meditation. Five New England hospitals are hosting the national \"Heal the Healers Now\" program with the help of a $2 million grant to bring transcendental meditation to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who've experienced magnified stress, trauma and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress 'is corrosive': [Mindfulness more important than ever for all ages, says new Calmer Choice CEO](https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/2021/09/09/mindfulness-vital-now-all-ages-says-new-calmer-choice-ceo/5683844001/) Receiving the training are health care employees at Rhode Island Hospital and Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Brigham and Women's in Boston, and Stamford Health System in Stamford, Connecticut. Transcendental meditation was created in India in the 1950s - a silent meditation done for 15-20 minutes per day. [Dr. Tony Nader](https://www.drtonynader.com/), who is leading the \"Heal the Healers Now\" initiative, said it's been extensively researched and yielded impressive results - decreased anxiety, depression and insomnia, paired with increased resilience and overall well-being. He sees the mental health and overwork crises plaguing health care workers as a prime opportunity to spread the teachings. \"Health professionals are now being exposed to huge stress because they internalize what they see, what they experience,\" said Nader, a Harvard- and MIT-trained medical doctor who leads the international [Transcendental Meditation nonprofit](https://www.tm.org/homepage). \"So much pain, so much death, so much crying.\" In partnership with the [David Lynch Foundation](https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/), Nader's trauma-informed program comes as the U.S. continues to battle the virus crisis and the medical sector experiences dire staffing shortages.

[A national survey published in May](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2589-5370%2821%2900159-0) featuring more than 20,000 health care workers revealed that nearly half were experiencing burnout, and 38% were suffering from anxiety and depression. The survey found stress scores highest among nursing assistants, medical assistants and social workers, as well as Black and Latino/Latina employees. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently pledged $100 million to address the nationwide [staffing shortages](https://www.fosters.com/story/news/local/2021/09/16/seacoast-covid-health-care-worker-shortage-straining-hospitals/8347990002/) that are leaving the remaining health care workers [exhausted](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2021/03/12/americas-healthcare-workers-struggle-covid-19-onslaught-death-and-suffering-fatigue-stress-and-fears/4543004001/). In Worcester, Massachusetts, for example, the month of August saw UMass Memorial Hospital [open a command center](https://www.telegram.com/story/news/2021/08/11/umass-memorial-medical-center-command-center-dr-michael-gustafson/8094702002/) to address a converging of crises - the labor shortage, uptick in COVID-19 cases and closure of 100 beds at neighboring St. Vincent Hospital due to an [ongoing nurses strike](https://www.telegram.com/story/news/2021/08/02/st-vincent-hospital-tenet-carolyn-jackson-massachusetts-nurses-association-union/5460668001/) there.

[And in Rhode Island](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2021/09/27/ri-hospitals-blame-vaccine-related-staff-shortages-union-says/5886879001/), the state's largest nurses union is publicly at odds with the vaccination mandate for health care workers, blaming hospitals for any staff shortages they see as a result. And on top of that, hospitals continue to care for critically ill COVID patients. \"Now that we're facing this new wave of unvaccinated patients, younger and sicker than we've seen before, there's PTSD that goes along with that,\" said Collins. \"It's reliving the pre-vaccine times, and that's definitely tough.\" How can transcendental meditation help? Transcendental meditation has been hailed by celebrities Ellen Degeneres and Tom Brady, as well as war veterans dealing with PTSD. It has documented benefits for stress and anxiety, brain function and cardiovascular health, and the technique has been studied by the Harvard School of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Defense, American Heart Association and American Medical Association. \"It's a moment of joy, really, a moment of relief,\" Nader said. \"A moment from getting away from the stressors and the problems.\" Vaccine mandate debate: [Nurses union says hospitals to blame for staffing shortages from RI vaccination mandate](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2021/09/27/ri-hospitals-blame-vaccine-related-staff-shortages-union-says/5886879001/) Preliminary findings from trials at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Duke University Medical Center and three hospitals in Miami, Florida showed marked reductions in anxiety and burnout for doctors and nurses. From there, other hospitals started requesting it, Nader said. The Transcendental Meditation nonprofit describes the practice as \"allowing your active mind to easily settle inward, through quieter levels of thought, until you experience the most silent and peaceful level of your own awareness \u2014 pure consciousness.\" In its simplest form, Nader said, transcendental meditation is sitting in a chair and closing the eyes, allowing yourself to naturally follow the mind's course. It requires very little effort, he said, and can be done in 15-20 minutes per day. There's \"absolutely no prerequisite,\" said Nader, and it's likely the people who say \"meditation is not for me\" are the ones who might benefit from it the most. \"If you're the kind that says, 'I can't get my mind to settle for a minute, my mind is rushing all the time,' then meditation is absolutely for you,\" he said. Miriam Hospital now has 5-6 rooms dedicated to employee meditation at any given time, said Collins, and the technique is being talked about among staff - creating a new culture of attention to self care. First, bedside nurses were trained, and then the hospital opened up opportunities for other staffers. \"I've definitely slept better, I feel more engaged,\" Collins said. \"I feel more ready to be able to do both work and home things that need to be done. My disposition has been much better in terms of being able to deal with stressors when they come up. And it was noticeable within the first couple of sessions.\" Collins knows meditation isn't a cure-all for the many hurdles health care workers face right now, but he recommends it widely as a way to ease the burden. \"It's unbelievable, and it sounds so silly,\" he said. \"You just make the time and it "}
