She grew up with an extraordinary passion of caring for others. Starting nursing school immediately after graduating high school in 2003 became her highest priority. Crystal has worked as a nurse for years in the McClennan and Bosque Counties. Her drive to provide more for her patients pushed her to continue her education. While working as a nurse she obtained her Master's Degree in Nursing and her Nurse Practitioner Certification from the University of Texas Arlington in 2019. Ms. Wright moved to Springtown in 2019 where she has spent the last 3 years practicing as a traveling Nurse Practitioner, providing home-based clinical visits and telehealth visits. As a believer in God's timing the opportunity presented itself to partner with Dr. Wooten and Total Care Chiropractic to form Total Care Health Services. Crystal felt that it was the right time in her career to start serving the citizens of Springtown and surrounding areas. Partnering with us here at Total Care Chiropractic has helped her to fulfill a lifelong dream of having her own practice while serving the residents in her home community. Crystal has a daughter, age 13 who attends Springtown ISD and is active in sports and band, when Ms. Wright is not busy serving others, she enjoys spending time with her daughter and family. "}
