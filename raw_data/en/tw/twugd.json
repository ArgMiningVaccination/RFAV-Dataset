We will respond to the threat of c limate change , knowing that the failure to do so would be tray our c hildr en and future generations. Some may still d eny the over whelming judgm ent of s cience, but none can av oid the devastating impac t of raging fires and c rippling drought and more pow erful storms. The path tow ards sustai nable energy sour ces w ill be long and som etimes difficult. But Am erica cannot r esist this transi tion, w e must l ead it. We cannot cede to othe r nations the technology that will po wer new jobs and new industri es, we must claim its promis e. That's how we will mainta in our economic vitality and our national tr easure -- our for ests and w aterways, our c roplands and snow -cappe d peaks. That is how we will pr eserve our plane t, commande d to our c are by God. That's what w ill lend m eaning to the creed our fath ers on ce declar ed.\" -- President Obama, S econd I naugural Addr ess, January 2013 THE CAS E FOR ACT ION While no sing le step can re verse the effects of climate change, we have a moral obli gation to future generations to l eave them a planet that is not pollut ed and da maged. Through steady, responsible action to c ut carbon pollution, we can protect our children's health and be gin to slow the effects of climate change so that we leave behind a cleaner, more stable environment. In 2009, P resident Ob ama made a pledge that by 2020, A merica would re duce its g reenhous e gas emissions in the range of 17 percent be low 2005 l evels if all oth er major econom ies agreed to limit their emissions a s well. Toda y, the President remains firmly committed to tha t goal and to building on the progress of his f irst term to he lp put us a nd the world on a sustainable long -term trajectory. Thanks in p art to the Administr ation's success in doubling America's use of wind, solar, and geothermal energy and in e stablishi ng the toug hest fuel econom y standards in our histo ry, we are creatin g new jobs, building new industries, and re ducing dangerous c arbon pollution whi ch contributes to c limate change. In fact, l ast year, carbon e missions from the energy sector fell to the lowest level in two d ecades. At the same time, while there is mo re work to do, we are more energy secure than at any time in recent histo ry. In 2012 , America's net oil imports fell to the lowest level in 20 years and w e have become the world's leading produc er of natural gas - the cleanest-burning f ossil f uel. While this progress is encouraging, climate change is no longer a dist ant threat - we are already feelin g its impacts across the country and the world. Last year was the warmest year ever in the contiguous Unit ed States and about one -third of all Americans experienced 10 da ys or more of 100-degree heat. The 12 hottest years on r ecord have all come in the last 15 years. Asth ma rates have doubl ed in the past 30 years and our children will su ffer more asthma attacks a s air pollution g ets wo rse. And increasi ng floods, he at waves, and droughts ha ve put far mers out of busine ss, whi ch is a lready raising f ood pr ices d ramatically. These changes come with far-reaching consequences a nd real econom ic costs. Last year alone, there were 11 di fferent w eather and climate disaster events with e stimated losses exceeding $1 billion each acr oss the United States. Taken tog ether, these 11 e vents re sulted in ove r $110 billion in e stimated damages, which would m ake it the second- costlie st year on reco rd. 5 In sho rt, Am erica stands at a critical jun cture. Today, President Ob ama is putting forward a broad-based plan to c ut the carbon pollution tha t causes climate change and aff ects public health. Cutting carbon pollution will h elp spar k busine ss innova tion to m odernize our pow er plants, resulting in cleaner forms of American-made energy that will c reate good j obs a nd cut our dependence on foreign oil. Combined with the Administra tion's othe r actions to increase the efficiency of our cars and hous ehold a ppliances, t he President's plan will r educe the amount of energy consum ed by American familie s, cutting down on the ir gas and utili ty bills. The plan, which consists of a wide variety of executive actions, ha s three key pillar s: 1) Cut Carbon Pollution in America: In 2012, U.S. carbon e missions f ell to the lowest level in two decade s even as the econom y continue d to g row. To build on this pr ogress, the Obama Administra tion is putting in place toug h new rules to cut car bon pollution - just like we have for othe r toxins like mercury and ar senic - so we protect the health of our children and m ove our econom y toward Am erican-made clean energy sour ces th at will c reate good jobs a nd lower hom e energy bills. 2) Prepare the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change: Even as we take new steps to reduce carbon polluti on, we must also pre pare for the impacts of a changing climate that are already being felt acr oss the country. Moving forward, the Obama Administra tion will help state and local governments st rengthen our roads, br idges, and shor elines so we can better protect people's homes, busine sses and w ay of life from s evere weather. 3) Lead International Efforts to Combat Global Clim ate Change and Prepare for its Impacts: Just as no c ountry is imm une from the impacts of climate change, no c ountry can meet this c hallenge alone. That is w hy it is im perat ive for the Unit ed States to couple action at hom e with leader ship i nternationally. Am erica must h elp forge a truly global solution to this g lobal challenge by galvanizing international action to si gnificantly reduce emissions (particularly among the major emitting c ountries), prepare for climate impacts, a nd dr ive progress through the international negotiations. Climate change represents one of our greatest challenges of our time, but it is a challenge unique ly suited to A merica's strengths. Our scientists will d esign new fuels, and our farmers will grow them. Our engineers to de vise new sou rces of energy, our workers will build th em, and our busine sses will s ell them. All of us will n eed to do our part. If we embrace this challenge, we will not just create new jobs a nd ne w indust ries and ke ep America on the cutting edge; we will s ave lives, protect and pre serve our treasu red natural resources, c ities, and coastlines for future generations. What follows is a blue print for steady, responsi ble national and int ernational action to slow the effects of climate change so we leave a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations. It highlights pr ogress already set in motion b y the Obama Administra tion to a dvance these goals and sets forth ne w steps to achi eve them. 6 CUT C ARBON P OLLUTION IN AME RICA In 2009, P resident Ob ama made a commit ment to reduce U.S. greenhous e gas emissions in the range of 17 p ercent be low 2005 l evels by 2020. T he President remains firmly committed to achieving that goal. While there is mo re work to d o, the Obama Administr ation ha s already made significant pr ogress by doubling generation of electricity from wind, sol ar, and geother mal, and by establishi ng histo ric new fuel econom y standards. B uilding on the se achievements, this document outlin es additiona l steps the Administration will ta ke - in par tnership with st ates, local communitie s, and the private sector - to c ontinue on a path to m eetin g the President's 2020 goal. I. Deploying Clean Energy Cutting Ca rbon Pollution from Power Plants: Power plants are the largest concent rated sour ce of emissions in the Unit ed States, tog ether accounting for roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions. W e have already set limits for arsenic, mercury, and lead, but the re is no fe deral rule to pr event power plants from releasing as much carbon pollution a s they want. Many states, local governments, a nd companies have taken steps to m ove to cleaner electricity sources. Mo re than 35 s tates have renewable energy targets in pl ace, a nd more than 25 ha ve set energy efficiency targets. Despite this p rogress at the state level, there are no fe deral standards in pl ace to re duce carbon pollution from pow er plants. In April 2012, a s part of a continue d effort to modernize our electric power sector, the Obama Administra tion pr opos ed a carbon pollution st andard for new po wer plants. The Envi ronmental Protection Ag ency's propos al reflects and re inforces the ongoing trend tow ards cleaner technolog ies, with natural gas increasi ng its sh are of electricity generation in recent years, principally through market forces and re newables deployment growing rapidly to account f or roughly half of new generation cap acity installed in 2012. With abunda nt clean e nergy soluti ons available, and building on the leadership of states and local g overnments, w e can make continue d pro gress in re ducing power plant pollution to improve public health a nd the environment while suppl ying the reliable, affordable pow er neede d for econom ic growth. B y doing so, we will continue to dr ive American l eadership in clean e nergy technolo gies, such as efficient na tural gas, nuc lear, renewables, and clean coal technolog y. To accom plish th ese goals, President Ob ama is issuing a Presidential Memorandum directing the Envi ronmental Protection Ag ency to wo rk expeditious ly to complete carbon pollution st andards for both ne w and existing power plants. This wor k will build on the successf ul first-term eff ort to develop greenhouse gas and fuel econom y standards for cars and trucks. In developing the standards, the President has asked the Envi ronmental Protection A gency to build on st ate leader ship, pr ovide flexibilit y, and take advantage of a wide range of energy sources a nd technolog ies including many actions in this pl an. Promoting American Leadership in Renewable Energy: During the President's first term, the United States more than doubl ed generation of electricity from wind, sol ar, and geother mal sources. To e nsure America's continue d leadership position in c lean e nergy, President Obama has set a goal to double renewable electricity generation onc e again by 2020. In order to m eet 7 this a mbitious target, the Administra tion is a nnoun cing a numbe r of new efforts in the following key areas: Accelerating Clean Energy P ermitting: In 2012 the President set a goal to issue p ermits for 10 gigawatts of renewables on public lands by the end of the year. The D epartment of the Interior achi eved this goal ahead of schedule and the President has di rected it to permit an additiona l 10 g igawatts by 2020. Since 2009, the Department of I nterior has approved 25 utilit y-scale solar facilities, nine wind fa rms, and 11 geothermal plants, which will p rovide enough electricity to pow er 4.4 m illion ho mes and suppor t an estimated 17,000 jobs. The Administra tion is a lso taking steps to e ncourage the developm ent of hydroelectric pow er at existing dams. To de velop a nd de monstrate improved per mitting procedures for such projects, the Administra tion will designate the Red Rock Hydroelectric Plant on the Des Moi nes River in Iowa to par ticipate in its Infrastructure Permitting Dashboar d for high-priority projects. Also, the Department of Defense - the single largest consum er of energy in the Unit ed States - is c ommitted to deploying 3 gigawatts of renewable energy on m ilitary installations, inc luding solar, wind, biom ass, and geothermal, by 2025. In addition, fe deral agencies are setting a new goal of reaching 100 m egawatts of installed renewable capacity across the federal ly subsidi zed housing stock by 2020. This e ffort will in clude conduc ting a survey of current projects in o rder to track pr ogress and facilita te the sharing of best practices. Expanding and Modernizing the Electric Grid: Upgrading the country's electric grid is critical to our efforts to make electricity more reliable, save consum ers money on their energy bills, a nd pr omote clean e nergy sources. To advance these important goals, President Ob ama signed a Presidential Memorandum this m onth tha t directs fe deral agencies to st reamline the sitin g, permitting a nd review process f or transmission pr ojects across federal, state, and tribal governments. Unlocking Long-Term Investment in Clean Energy Innovat ion: The Fiscal Y ear 2014 Budget continue s the President's commit ment to k eeping the Unit ed States at the forefront of clean e nergy research, developm ent, and de ployment by increasing funding for clean energy technolog y across all agencies by 30 percent, to a pproximately $7.9 billion. This inc ludes investment in a range of energy technolo gies, from advanced biof uels and emerging nuclear technolog ies - in cluding s mall modular reactors - to c lean c oal. To c ontinue America's leader ship in c lean energy innova tion, the Administration will a lso take the following steps: Spurri ng Investment in Advanced Fossil En ergy P rojects: In the coming weeks, the Department of Energy will issue a Federal Register Noti ce announc ing a draft of a solicitation th at would m ake up to $8 billion in ( self-pay) loan guarantee authority available for a wide array of advanced f ossil e nergy projects unde r its S ection 1703 loa n guarant ee program. This soli citation esigned to suppor t investments in innova tive technolog ies that can c ost-effectively meet financial and poli cy goals, inc luding the avoida nce, reduction, or sequestration of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. The propos ed soli citation will cover a broad range of advanced f ossil e nergy projects. R eflectin g the Department's commitment to c ontinuo us improvement in pr ogram management, it will t ake comment on the draft solic itation, with a plan to issue a final solicitation b y the fall of 2013. Instituting a F ederal Q uadrennial E nergy R eview: Innov ation a nd ne w sources of domestic energy suppl y are transforming the nation' s energy marketplace, creatin g econom ic 8 oppor tunitie s at the same time they raise environmental challenges. To ensure that federal energy policy meets our econom ic, environmental, and security goals in this c hanging landscape, the Administr ation will c onduc t a Quadrennial Energy Review whi ch will be led by the White House Dom estic Policy Counc il and Office of Science and Technolog y Policy, suppor ted by a Secretariat establish ed at the Department of Energy, and inv olving the robust engagement of federal agencies and outside stakeholder s. This f irst-ever review will f ocus on infrastructure challenges, and will id entify the threats, risks, a nd oppor tunities for U.S. energy and climate security, enabling the federal government to translate policy goals into a set of analytically based, clearly articulated, sequenced and integrated actions, and propos ed investments ove r a four-year planning horizon. II. Building a 21st-Century Transportati on Sector Increasi ng Fuel Economy Standar vehicles are currently the second l argest sourc e of greenhous e gas emissions within th e transpor tation s ector. In 201 1, the Obama Administra tion f inalized the first-ever fuel economy standards for Mode l Year 2014 -2018 f or heav y-duty trucks, bus es, and va ns. The se standards will re duce greenhou se gas emissions b y approximately 270 m illion m etric tons a nd save 530 m illion b arrels of oil. D uring the President's second t erm, the Administra tion will on ce again par tner with indust ry leaders and othe r key stakeholder s to de velop post -2018 f uel econom y standards for heav y-duty vehicles to f urther reduce fuel consum ption through the application of advanced cost-effective technolog ies and continue efforts to im prove the efficiency of movi ng goods across the United States. The Obama Administra tion ha s already established the toug hest fuel econo my standards for passenger vehicles in U .S. histor y. These standards re quire an average performance equiva lent of 54.5 m iles per gallon b y 2025, whi ch will s ave the average driver more than $8,000 in f uel costs over the lifetime of the vehicle and eliminate six billion m etric tons of carbon pollution - m ore than the Unit ed States emits in a n entire year. Developing and Deploying Advanced Transportation Technologi es: Biofuels have an important role to pl ay in increasi ng our energy security, fostering rural economic developm ent, and re ducing greenhous e gas emissions from the transpor tation is w hy the Administra suppor ts the Renewable Fuels Standard, and is inve sting in research and developm ent to he lp bring next-generation biof uels on line . For example, the Unit ed States Navy and D epartments of Energy and Agriculture are working with the private sector to acc elerate the developm ent of cost-competitive advanced biof uels for use by the military and commercial sectors. Mo re broadly, the Administra tion will c ontinue to leverage partnerships be tween the private and public sectors to d eploy cleaner fuels, in cluding advanced ba tteries and fuel cell technolog ies, in e very transpor tation mode . The Department of Energy's eGallon in forms drivers about e lectric car operating costs in th eir state - the national average is onl y $1.14 pe r gallon of gasoline equiva lent, sho wing the promise for consumer pocketbooks of electric-powered vehicles. In addition, in the coming months, the Department of Transpor tation will w ork with other agencies to f urther explore strategies for integrating a lternative fuel vessels into the U.S. flag fleet. F urther, the Administra tion will c ontinue to wo rk with st ates, cities and towns thr ough the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and U rban Developm ent, and the Envi ronmental Protection Ag ency transpor tation options, a nd low er transpo rtation costs while protecting the environment in c ommunities nationwid e. 9 III. Cutting En ergy Waste in Homes, Businesses, and Factories Reducing Energy Bills for American Families and Businesses: Energy efficiency is one of the clearest and most c ost-effective oppor tunitie s to s ave families mone y, make our busine sses more competitive, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the President's first term, the Department of Energy and the Department of Housing a nd U rban Developm ent compl eted efficiency upgrades in mo re than one million ho mes, saving many families more than $400 on the ir heatin g and cooling bills in the first year alone. The Administration will ta ke a range of new steps geared towards achi eving President Ob ama's goal of doubling energy produc tivity by 2030 r elative to 2010 l evels: Establishing a N ew Goal f or Energy E fficiency Standar ds: In President Ob ama's first term, the Department of Energy establish ed new minimum eff iciency standards for dishw ashers, refrigerators, and m any other products. Th rough 2030, the se standards will cut consum ers' electricity bills b y hundr eds of billions of dollars and save enoug h electricity to pow er more than 85 m illion ho mes for two years. To build on this success, the Administra tion is s etting a new goal: Efficiency standards for appliances and fe deral building s set in the first and second t erms combined will re duce carbon pollution b y at least 3 billion m etric tons c umulatively by 2030 - equiva lent to near ly one-half of the carbon pollution from the entire U.S. energy sector for one year - while continuing to cut families' energy bills. Reducing Barriers to Investment in Energy E fficiency: Energy efficiency upgrades bring significant cost savings, but upfront c osts a ct as a barrier to m ore widespread investment. In respons e, the Administra tion is c ommitting to a num ber of new executive actions. As soon a s this f all, the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilitie s Service will finalize a propos ed upda te to its En ergy Efficiency and C onservation Loan Program to provide up to $250 m illion for rural utilitie s to f inance efficiency investments b y busine sses and hom eowners across rural America. The Department is a lso st ream lining its Rural Energy for America program to p rovide grants and loa n guarantees directly to agricultural producer s and rural small busin esses for energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. In addition, the Department of Housing a nd U rban Developm ent's ifamily Energy Innov ation F und de signed to enable affordable housing provider s, technol ogy firms, acade mic institution s, and phil anthropic organizations to t est new approaches to d eliver cost-effective residential energy. In order to advance ongoing efforts and br ing stakeholders together, the Federal Housing Administra tion will c onve ne representatives of the lending communi ty and ot her key stakeholder s for a mortgage roundt able in July to identify options f or factoring energy efficiency into the mortgage under writing and appraisal process upon s ale or refinancing of new or existing homes. Expanding the President's B etter Buildings Challenge: The Better Buildings Challenge, focused on h elping American c omm ercial and indust rial buildi ngs b ecome at least 20 per cent more energy efficient by 2020, is already showi ng results. Mo re than 120 diver se organizations, re presenting over 2 billion squar e feet are on track t o meet the 2020 g oal: cutting energy use by an average 2.5 p ercent a nnua lly, equiva lent to a bout $58 million in e nergy savings per year. To c ontinue this su ccess, the Administr ation will expand the program to multifa mily housing - partnering both with p rivate and aff ordable 10 building owners and publ ic housing agencies to c ut energy waste. In addition, the Administra tion is la unching the Better Buildin gs Accelerato rs, a new track that will suppor t and encourage adoption of State and loca l policies to c ut energy waste, building on the momentum of ongoing efforts at that level. IV. Reducing Other Greenhou se Gas E missio ns Curbing Emissions of Hydrofluorocarbons: Hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs), whi ch are primarily used a nd air conditioning , are potent greenhous e gases. In the Unit ed States, emissions of HFCs are expected to near ly triple by 2030, a nd doubl e from current levels of 1.5 percent o f greenhouse gas emissions to 3 percent by 2020. To re duce emissions of HFCs, the Unit ed States can a nd will lead bo th through international diplom acy as well as domestic actions. In fact, the Administra tion ha s already acted by including a flexible and pow erful incentive in the fuel economy and carbon polluti on st andards for cars and trucks to encourage automakers to r educe HFC leakage and transition a way from the most pot ent HFCs in ve hicle air conditioning systems. Moving f orward, the Envi ronmental Protection Agency will use its a uthor ity through the Significant New Alt ernatives Policy Program to encourage private sector investment in low -emissions t echnolog y by identifying and approving climate-friendly chemicals while prohibiting certain us es of the most har mful chemical alternatives. In addition, the President ha s directed his Adm inistration to pu rchase cleaner alternatives to H FCs whenever feasible and transition ove r time to equipm ent that uses safer and more sustainable alternatives. Reducing Met hane Emissions: Curbing emissions of methane is critical to our overall e ffort to address global climate change. Methane currently accounts f or roughly 9 percent of dom estic greenhouse gas emissions a nd ha s a global warming potential that is m ore than 20 tim es greater than car bon dio xide. Not ably, sinc e 1990, m ethane emissions in the Unit ed States have decreased by 8 percent. This ha s occurred in p art through partnerships w ith indust ry, both a t hom e and abroad, in w hich we have demonstrated tha t we have the technolog y to deliver emissions reductions th at benefit both our econom y and the environment. To achi eve additiona l progress, the Administra tion Envi ronmental Protection Ag ency and the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Interior, Labor, and Transpor tation will develop a compre hensive , interagency methane strategy. The group will f ocus on assessing c urrent emissions d ata, addressing data gaps, ide ntifying technol ogies and be st practices for reducing emissions, a nd ide ntifying existing author ities and incentiv e-based oppor re duce emissions. Pursuing a Collab orative Approach to Reducing Emissions: Across the econom y, there are multiple sectors in whi ch methane emissions can be reduced, from coal mines and landfills to a griculture and oil a nd gas developm ent. For example, in the agricultural sector, ove r the last three years, the Envi ronmental Protection A gency and the Department of Agriculture have worked with the dairy indust ry to increase the adoption of methane digesters through loans, in centives, and othe r assistance. In addition, whe n it comes to the oil a nd gas sector, inve stments to build and upg rade gas pipe lines will not only put m ore Americans to wo rk, but a lso re duce emissions a nd enhance econom ic produc tivity. For example, as part of the Administration's effort to im prove federal 11 permitting for infrastructure projects, the interagency Bakken Federal Executive Group is working with indust ry, as well as state and tribal agencies, to a dvance the produc tion of oil and gas in the Bakken while helping to reduce venting and flaring. Mov ing forward, as part of the effort to d evelop a n interagency methane strategy, the Obama Administra tion will wo rk collaboratively with sta te governments, as well as the private sector, to re duce emissions acr oss multiple sectors, improve air quality, and achi eve public health a nd economic benefits. Preserving the Role of Forests in Mitigating Cli mate Change: America's forests pl ay a critical r ole in addressing car bon pollution, re moving nearly 12 pe rcent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions each year. In the face of a changing climate and incr eased risk of wild fire, drought, and pe sts, the capacity of our forests to a bsorb car bon is di minishin g. Pressures to develop forest lands f or urban or agricultural uses also contribute to the decline of forest carbon sequestration. C onservation and sust ainable management can help to e nsure our forests continue to remove carbon f rom the atmosphe re while also improving soil a nd w ater quality, reducing wildfire risk, a nd othe rwise managing forests to be more resilient in the fact of climate change. The Administra tion is w orking to identify new approache s to pr otect and restore our forests, a s well as othe r critical la ndscapes including g rasslands and w etlands, in the face of a changing climate. V. Leading at t he Federal L evel Leading in Clean Energy: President Ob ama believes that the federal government must be a leader in clean e nergy and energy efficiency. Under the Obama Administr ation, fe deral agencies have reduced greenhous e gas emissions b y more than 15 pe rcent - the equivalent of permanently taking 1.5 m illion car s off the road. To build on t his recor d, the Administra tion is e stablishing a new goal: The federal government will c onsum e 20 percent of its e lectricity from renewable sources b y 2020 - m ore than double the current goal of 7.5 pe rcent. In addition, the federal government will c ontinue to pur sue greater energy efficiency that reduces greenhouse gas emissions a nd saves taxpayer dollars. Federal Government Leadership in Energy E fficiency: On De cember 2, 2011, P resident Obama signed a memorandum entitle d \"Implementation of Energy Savings Projects a nd Performance-Based Contractin g for Energy Savings,\" challenging fe deral a gencies, in suppor t of the Better Buildings Challenge, to e nter into $2 billion wor th of performance-based contracts within two years. Pe rformance contracts d rive ic sector innova nd increas e efficiency at minimum c osts to the taxpayer, whi le also pr oviding long- term savings in e nergy costs. Fe deral agencies have committed to a pipe line of nearly $2.3 billion from over 300 re ported projects. In coming months, the Administra tion will ta ke a number of actions to st rengthen efforts to p romote energy efficiency, including through performance contracting. For example, in or der to in crease access to capit al markets for investments in e nergy efficiency, the Administra tion will init iate a partnership with the private sector to wo rk tow ards a standardized contract to f inance federal investments in e nergy efficiency. Going forward, agencies will a lso wo rk tog ether to synchronize building codes - leveraging those policies to improve the efficiency of federally owned and suppor ted building stock. Finally, the Administration will le verage the \"Green Button\" standard - whi ch aggregates energy data in a secure, easy to use format - within fe deral facilitie s to in crease their ability to manage energy consum ption, re duce greenhous e gas emissions, a nd m eet sustainability goals. 12 PREPARE THE U NITED STATES FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE As we act to c urb the greenhouse gas pollution tha t is d riving climate change, we must also prepare for the impacts t hat are too l ate to avoid. A cross Am erica, states, cities, and communities are taking steps to pr otect themselves by updating building codes, adjusting the way they manage natural resources, inve sting in more resilient infrastructure, and pl anning for rapid recovery from damages that none theless occur . The federal government ha s an important role to pl ay in suppor ting community-based pre paredn ess and resilience efforts, establishing policies that promote preparedn ess, protecting cr itical in frastructure and public resources, suppor ting science and re search germane to preparedness and resilience, a nd ensuring that federal ope rations a nd facilitie s continue to pr otect and serve citizens in a changing climate. The Obama Administra tion ha s been w orking to strengthen Am erica's climate resilience since its earliest days. Shortly after coming into offi ce, President Ob ama establish ed an Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force and, in O ctober 2009, the President signed an Executive Order directin g it to recomme nd ways federal pol icies and pr ograms can better prepare the Nation f or change. In May 2010, the Task Force hosted the first National Climate Adaptation Summit, conve ning local and regional stakeholde rs and decision -makers to identify challenges and oppor tunitie s for collaborative action. In February 2013, federal agencies released Climate Change Adaptation P lans for the first time, outlining strategies to pr otect their operations, missions, a nd pr ograms from the effects of climate change. The Department of Transpor tation, f or example, is de veloping guidance for incorporating c limate change and extreme weather event conside rations in to coastal highway projects, a nd the Department of Homeland Se curity is evaluating the challenges of changing conditions in the Arctic and along our Nation's borders. Agencies have also partnered with communitie s through targeted grant and techni cal-assistance programs\u2014for example, the Envi ronmental Protection Age ncy is wo rking with low -lying communitie s in No rth Carolina to assess the vulnerabili ty of infrastructure investments to s ea level rise and identify solutions to reduce risks. And the Administra tion ha s continue d, thr ough the U.S. Glo bal Change Research Program, to suppor t science and m onitor ing to expand our under standing of climate change and its im pacts. Going forward, the Administration will expand the se efforts into th ree major, interrelated initia tives to better prepare America for the impacts of climate change: I. Building Stronger and Safer Communities and Infrastru cture By necessity, many states, cities, and communitie s are already planning a nd pre paring for the impacts of climate change. Hospit als must build c apacity to serve patients during more frequent heat w aves, and ur ban planners must pl an for the severe storms that infrastructure will n eed to withsta nd. P romoting on-the-ground pl anning a nd resilient infrastructure will be at the core of our work to st rengthen America's communities. Specific actions will in clude: Directing Agencies to Suppor t Climate-Resilien t Investment: The President will di rect federal agencies to id entify and re move barriers to m aking c limate-resilient inve stments; id entify and re move counterproductive policies that increase vulne rabilitie s; and encourage and suppor t smarter, more resilient inv estments, inc luding through agency grants, t echni cal assistance, and other programs, in s ectors from transpor tation a nd water management to c onservation a nd 13 disaster relief. Agencies will a lso be directed to ensure that climate risk-management considerations a re fully integrated into fe deral in frastructure and na tural resourc e management planning . To b egin meeting this c hallenge, the Environmental Protection A gency is committing to int egrate conside rations of climate change impacts and adaptive measures into m ajor programs, inc luding its Clean Wa ter and D rinking Water State Revolving Funds a nd grants for brownfields cleanup, a nd the Department of Hous ing and Urban Developm ent is a lready requiring grant recipi ents in the Hurricane Sandy-affect ed region to t ake sea-level rise into account. Establishing a State, Local, an d Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedne ss: To help agencies meet the above directive and to e nhance local efforts to protect communitie s, the President will e stablish a short-term task force of state, local, a nd tribal officials to a dvise on ke y actions the federal government can t ake to be tter suppor t local p reparedn ess and re silience- building efforts. The task force will p rovide recomm endations on re moving barriers to r esilient investments, m odernizing grant and loa n programs to be tter suppor t local efforts, and de veloping information a nd tools to be tter serve communiti es. Supporting Communities as t hey Prepare for Climate Impacts: Federal agencies will continue to pr ovide targeted suppor t and assistance to he lp communiti es prepare for climate- change impacts. For example, throughout 2013, the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administra tion is wo rking with 19 st ate and regional partners and other federal agencies to t est approache s for assessing local tra nspor tation in frastructure vulnerabilit y to climate change and extreme weather and for improving resilience. The Administra tion will continue to assist t ribal communitie s on pre paredness through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including through pilot p rojects a nd by suppor ting par ticipation in federal initiatives that assess climate change vulne rabilitie s and de velop regional solutions. Thr ough agency \"Envi Progress Reports,\" e to id entify innova tive ways to he lp our most vulnerable communiti es prepare for and recove r from the impacts of climate change. The importance of critical in frastructure inde pendence was brought home in the Sandy response. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Energy are working with the private sector to address simultaneous re storation of electricity and fuels suppl y. Boosting the Resilience of Buildings and Infrastructure: The National Institute of Standards and Technol ogy will c onvene a panel on dis aster-resilience standards to de velop a comprehensive, commu nity-based resilience framework and pr ovide guidelines for consist ently safe building s and infra structure - produc ts that can inform the developm ent of private-sector standards and codes. In addition, buil ding on fe deral agencies' \"Climate Change Adaptation Plans,\" the Administra tion will c ontinue efforts to increase the resilience of federal f acilities and infrastructure. The Department of Defense, for example, is assessing the relative vulnerabilit y of its coastal facilitie s to climate change. In addition, the President's FY 2014 B udget propos Transpor tation Leadership Awar ds pr ogram for Climate Ready Infrastructure in communities that build enhanced pre paredness into th eir planning eff orts, and that have propos ed or are read y to break ground o n infra structure projects, including transit a nd rail, to im prove resilience. Rebuild ing and Learning from Hurricane Sandy: In August 2013, P resident Ob ama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force will d eliver to the President a rebuilding strategy to be implemented in S andy-affected regions a nd establishing precedents th at can be follow ed 14 elsewhere. The Task Force and federal agencies are also piloting new wa ys to suppor t resilience in the Sandy-affected region; the Task Force, for example, is hosting a regional \"Rebuilding by Design\" compe tition to g enerate nhance resilience. In the transpor tation sector, the Department of Transpor tation's Federal Transit Ad ministra tion (FTA) is dedicating $5.7 billion to f our of the area 's most impacted transit a gencies, of which $1.3 billion will be allocated to local ly prioritized projects to make transit s ystems more resilient to f uture disasters. FTA will a lso de velop a competitive process for additiona l funding to identify and suppor t larger, stand-alone resilience projects in the impacted region. To build c oastal resilience, the Department of the Interior will la unch a $100 m illion c ompetitive grant program to foster partnerships a nd promote resilient na tural systems while enhancing green s paces a nd wildlif e habitat near urban popul ations. An a dditiona l $250 million w ill be allocated to suppor t projects for coastal restoration a nd re silience across the region. F inally, with pa rtners, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is c onduc ting a $20 m illion s tudy to identify strategies to reduce the vulnerabilit y of Sandy-affected coastal communities to f uture large-scale flood a nd stor m events, and the National Oceani c and At mospher ic Administration will stre ngthen long -term coastal observations a nd pr ovide techni cal assistance to coastal communiti es. II. Protectin g our Economy and Nat ural R esources Climate change is affecting nearly every aspect of our society, from agriculture and tour ism to the health a nd safety of our citizens and na tural resources. To he lp protect critical s ectors, while also targeting hazards th at cut acr oss secto rs and regions, the Administra tion will m ount a set of sector- and hazard-specific efforts to p rotect our country's vital assets, to in clude: Identifying Vulnerab ilities of Key Sectors to Climate Change: The Department of Energy will soon re lease an assessment of climate-change impacts on the energy sector, including power-plant dis ruptions due to dr ought and the disruption of fuel suppli es dur ing severe storms, as well as pot ential oppor tunitie s to make our energy infrastructure more resilient to th ese risks. In 2013, t he Department of Agriculture and D epartment of the Interior released several studi es outlining the challenges a changing climate poses for America's agricultural enterprise, forests, water suppl y, wildlife , and public lands. This year and ne xt, federal agencies will re port on the impacts of climate change on othe r key sectors and strategies to a ddress them, with pr iority efforts focusing on health, transpor tation, f ood suppli es, oceans, a nd coastal communities. Promoting Resilience in the Health Sector: The Department of Health and Hu man Services will la unch an effort to create sustainable and resilient hospit als in the face of climate change. Through a publi c-private partnership with the healthcare indust ry, it will id entify best practic es and pr ovide guidance on affordable measures to e nsure that our medical system is resilient to climate impacts. It will a lso collaborate with p artner agencies to sh are best practices a mong federal h ealth fac ilities. And, building on lessons from pilot p rojects unde rway in 16 st ates, it will h elp train publi c-health profession als and communi ty leaders to pre pare their communitie s for the health consequences of climate change, including through effective communi cation of health r isks a nd re silience measures. Promoting Insurance Leadership for Climate Safety: Recognizing the critical r ole that the private sector plays in insur ing assets and enabling rapid recovery after disasters, the Administra tion will c onvene representatives from the insura nce indust ry and othe r stakeholder s to explore best practices for private and public insurers to m anage their own processe s and 15 investments to account f or climate change risks a nd in centiv ize policy holders to t ake steps to reduce their exposur e to these risks. Conserving Land and Wate r Resources: America's ecosystems are critical to our nation's econom y and the lives and health of our citizens. The se natural resources c an also he lp ameliorate the impacts of climate change, if they are properly protected. The Administra tion ha s invested significantly in conserving relevant ecosystems, inc luding working with Gulf State partners after the Deepwater Horizon spill to enhance barrier islands a nd m arshes that protect communitie s from severe storms. The Administr ation is also implementing climate-adaptation strategies that promote resilience in fish and wildli fe popul ations, f orests and othe r plant communitie s, fre shwater resources, a nd the ocean. Building on the se efforts, the President is a lso directing federal agencies to id entify and evaluate additiona l approache s to improve our natural defens es against e xtreme weather, protect biodiver sity and conserve natural resources in the face of a changing climate, and manage our public lands and na tural systems to s tore more carbon. Maintaining Ag ricultural Sus tainability: Building on the existing network of federal climate- science research and action cent ers, the Department of Agriculture is creating seven new Regional Climate Hubs t o deliver tailored, science-based kno wledge to farmers, ranchers, and forest landowner s. These hubs will wor k with univer sities and othe r partners, inc luding the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospher ic Administ ration, to suppor t climate resilience. Its Natural Resources Conservation S ervice and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation ar e also pr ovidi ng grants and techni cal support to a gricultural water users for more water-efficient practices in the face of drought and long -term climate change. Managing Drought: Leveraging the work of the National Dis aster Recove ry Framework for drought, the Administra tion will la unch a cross-agency National Drought Resilience Partnership as a \"front door \" for communiti es seeking help to prepare for future droughts and re duce drought impacts. B y linking information ( monitor ing, forecasts, outlooks, a nd ear ly warnings) with drought preparedness and long er-term resilience strategies in cr itical s ectors, this eff ort will h elp communitie s manage drought-related risks. Reducing Wil dfire Risks: With tribes, states, and lo cal g overnments as partners, the Administra tion ha s worked to m ake landscapes mo re resistant to wild fires, which are exacerbated by heat and drought conditions re sulting from c limate change. Federal agencies will expand and pr ioritize forest and ra ngeland re storation eff orts in o rder to make natural areas a nd communitie s less vulnera ble to cat astrophic fire. The Department of the Interior and D epartment of Agriculture, for example, are launching a Western Wa tershed Enhancement Partnership - a pilot eff ort in five western states to re duce wild fire risk b y removi ng extra brush a nd othe r ar ound cr itical areas su ch as water reservoirs. Preparing for Future Floods: To e nsure that projects f unde d with ta xpayer dollars last as long as intended, federal agencies will upda te their flood-risk re duction st andards for federally funded projects to ref lect a consistent approach tha t accounts f or sea-level rise and othe r factors affecting f lood r isks. This eff ort will in corporate the most re cent science on e xpected rates of sea-level rise (which vary by region) and build on work done by the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, wh ich annou nced in Apr il 2013 tha t all federal ly funded Sandy-related rebuilding projects m ust m eet a consist ent flood r isk re duction sta ndard tha t takes into account inc reased risk from extreme weather events, s ea-level rise, and othe r impacts of climate change. 16 III. Using Sound Science to Man age Climate Impacts Scientific data and insi ghts ar e essential to h elp government offi cials, communitie s, and busine sses better unde rstand and m anage the risks associated with c limate change. The Administra tion will c ontinue to lead in a dvancing the science of climate measurement and adaptation a nd the development of tools f or climate-relevant de cision -making by focusing on increasi ng the availability , accessibility, and utility of relevant scientific tools a nd inf ormation. Specific actions will in clude: Developing Actionable Climate Science: The President's Fiscal Y ear 2014 Budget provide s more than $2.7 billion, l argely through the 13-agency U.S. Globa l Change Research P rogram, to increas e under standing of climate-change impacts, establish a publi c-private partnership to explore risk and cat astrophe modeling, and develop the information a nd tools neede d by decision -makers to re spond to both long -term climate change impacts a nd near-term effects of extreme weather. Assessing Cli mate-Change Impacts in the United States: In the spring of 2014, the Obama Administra tion will re lease the third U.S. National Climate Assessment, highli ghting new advances in our under standing of climate-change impacts acr oss all regions of the Unit ed States and on cr itical s ectors of the econom y, including nergy, agriculture, and ecosystems and biodiver sity. For the first tim e, the National Climate Assessment will f ocus not only on diss emination of scientific information but also on t ranslating scientific insights into practical, us eable know ledge that can h elp decisi on-makers anticipate and prepare for specific climate-change impacts. Launc hing a Cli mate Data Initiative: Consist ent with the President's Ma y 2013 E xecutive Order on O pen Data - and reco gnizing that freely available open government da ta can f uel entrepreneurship, innova tion, s cientific discovery, and public benefits - the Administra tion is launching a Climate Data Initiative to leverage extensive federal climate-relevant da ta to stimulate innova tion a nd pr ivate-sector entrepreneurship in suppor t of national climate-change preparedness. Providing a T oolkit for Climate Resilience: Federal a gencies will c reate a virtual climate- resilience toolkit th at cent ralizes access to d ata-driven resilience tools, s ervices, and be st practices, inc luding those developed through the Climate Data Initiative. The toolkit will p rovide easy access to e xisting resources a s well as new tools, in cluding : interactive sea-level rise maps and a sea-level-rise calculator to aid post -Sandy rebuilding in New Yo rk and New Jersey, new NOAA sto rm su rge models and int eractive maps from the National Oceanic and At mosphe ric Administra tion th at provide risk in formation b y combining tidal data, projected sea levels and storm wave heights, a web-based tool tha t will a llow developer s to int egrate NAS A climate imagery into w ebsites and m obile apps, access to the U.S. Geological S urvey's \"visua lization tool\" to assess the amount of carbon absorbed by landscapes, and a Stormwater Calculator and Climate Assessment Tool de veloped to he lp local governments assess sto rmwater-control measures und er different precipita tion and temperature scenarios. 17 LEAD INTER NAT IONAL EFFORTS TO ADD RESS GLOBAL CLIMATE C HANGE The Obama Administra tion is wor king to build on the actions th at it is ta king domestically to achieve significant global greenhouse gas emission re ductions a nd enhance climate preparedn ess through major internationa l initia tives focused on spurring concrete action, including bilateral initia tives with C hina, India, and othe r major emitting countries. These initiatives not onl y serve to suppor t the efforts of the Unit ed States and othe rs to achi eve our goals for 2020, but a lso will help us m ove beyond tho se and be nd the post -2020 g lobal emissions t rajectory further. As a key part of this eff ort, we are also wo rking intensively to forge global respons es to climate change through a numbe r of important inter national negotiations, including the United Nations Framework Conve ntion on C limate Change. I. Worki ng with Other Countri es to Take Action to Address Climate Change Enhancing Multilateral En gageme nt with Major Economies: In 2009, President Ob ama launched the Major Econom ies Forum on Ene rgy and C limate, a high-level forum that brings together 17 c ountries that account f or approximately 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, in or der to suppor t the international climate negotiations a nd spur coope rative action to combat climate change. The Forum h as been s uccessf ul on both f ronts - having c ontributed significantly to progress in the broader negotiations while also launching the Clean En ergy Minist erial to catalyze the development and de ployment of clean energy and efficiency solutions. We are proposi ng that the Forum build on the se efforts by launching a major initia tive this year focused on f urther accelerating eff iciency gains in the building s secto r, whi ch accounts f or approximately one-third of global carbon pollutions from the energy sector. Expanding Bilateral Coo peration with Major Emerging Economies: From the outs et, the Obama Administra tion ha s sought to int ensify bilateral climate coope ration with k ey major emerging econom ies, thr ough initi atives like the U.S.-China Clean En ergy Research C enter, the U.S.-India Partnership to A dvance Clean E nergy, and the Strategic Energy Dialogue with B razil. We will be building on the se successes and finding new areas for cooperation in the second t erm, and we are already making progress: Just this mo nth, P resident Ob ama and President Xi J inping of China reached an histor ic agreement at their first sum mit to wo rk to use the expertise and institutions of the Mont real Protocol to pha se dow n the consum ption a nd pr oduc tion of HFCs, a highly potent greenhouse gas. The impact of phasing out H FCs by 2050 would be equiva lent to the elimination of two years' worth of greenhous e gas emissions from all sou rces. Combatting Short -Lived Climate Pollutants: Pollutants su ch as methane, black c arbon, a nd many HFCs are relatively shor t-lived in the atmosphere, but ha ve more potent greenhous e effects than car bon dio xide. In February 2012, the Unit ed States launched the Climate and C lean A ir Coalition to R educe Short-Lived Climate Pollution, whi ch has grown to i nclude more than 30 country partners and oth er key partners such as the World Bank and the U.N. Envi ronment Programme. Major efforts include reducing methane and bl ack carbon from waste and landfills. We are also leading through the Global Methane Initiative, which wo rks with 42 par tner countries and an extensive network of over 1,100 pr ivate sector participants to re duce methane emissions. 18 Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation: Greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, a griculture, and othe r land use constitute approximately one-third of global emissions. In som e developing countries, as much as 80 per cent of these emissions c ome from the land sector. To m eet this challenge, the Obama Administra tion is wo rking with p artner countries to put in pl ace the systems and institutio ns necessa ry to significantly reduce global land-use-related emissions, creatin g new models for rural developm ent that generate climate benefits, while conserving biodiver sity, protectin g watersheds, and improving livelihoods. In 2012 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Developm ent's bilateral and regional forestry programs contributed to r educing more than 140 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, including through suppor t for multila teral initia tives such as the Forest Investment Program and the Forest Ca rbon P artnership Fac ility. In Indone sia, the Mille Challenge Corporation is a five-year \"Green Prosper ity\" program that suppor ts environmentally sustainable, low carbon e conom ic development in s elect distr icts. The Obama Administra tion is a lso to address agriculture-driven deforestation th rough initia tives such the Tropical F orest Allia nce 2020, whi ch brings together governments, the private sector, and civil s ociety to reduce tropical d eforestation re lated to k ey agricultural commoditie s, whi ch we will build upon. Expanding Clean Energy Use and Cut Energy Was te: Roughly 84 percent of current carbon dioxide emissions ar e energy-related and about 6 5 percent o f all greenhou se gas emissions can be attributed to e nergy suppl y and energy use. The Obama Administra tion ha s promoted the expansion of renewable, clean, a nd efficient energy sour ces a nd technol ogies worldwide through: Financing and regulatory suppor t for renewable and clean e nergy projects Actions to pr omote fuel switching from oil and coal to n atural gas or renewables Suppor t for the safe and secure use of nuclear pow er Cooperation on c lean coal technolog ies Programs to i mprove and disseminate energy efficient technolog ies In the past three years we have reached agreements with m ore than 20 c ountries around the world, inc luding Mexico, South A frica, and Indon esia, to suppor t low e mission de velopm ent strategies that help countries to id entify the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while growing their econom ies. Among the many initia tives that we have launched are: The U.S. Africa Clean E nergy Finance Initiative, whi ch aligns grant-based assistance with p roject pl anning e xpertise from the U.S. Trade and D evelopm ent Agency and financing and risk m itigation tools from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to unloc k up to $1 billion in c lean e nergy financing. The U.S.-Asia Pacific Comprehensive Energy Partnership, whi ch has identified $6 billion in U. S. export credit and government financing to promote clean energy developm ent in the Asia-Pacific region. Looking ahead, w e will ta rget these and othe r resources tow ards greater penetration of renewables in the global energy mix on both a small and large scale, including through our 19 participation in the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative and accelerating the commercialization of renewable mini-grids. The se efforts include: Natural Gas. Burning natural gas is a bout one -half as carbon-intensive as coal, whi ch can m ake it a critical \"bridge fuel\" for many countries as the world transitions to e ven cleaner sour ces of energy. Tow ard tha t end, the Obama Administra tion is p artnering with states and pr ivate companies to e xchange lessons learned with our international partners on re sponsible developm ent of natural gas resources. We have launched the Unconve ntiona l Gas Technical Eng agement Program to shar e best practices on issu es such as water management, m ethane emissions, a ir quality, permitting, contractin g, and pricing to he lp increase globa l gas suppli es and facilitate developm ent of the associated infrastructure that brings them to market. Goi ng forward, we will p romote fuel-switching from coal to gas for electricity production and encourage the developm ent of a global market for gas. Since heav y-duty vehicles are expected to account f or 40 percent o f increas ed oil use through 2030, we will e ncourage the adoption of heav y duty natural gas vehicles as well. Nuclear Power. The United States will c ontinue to promote the safe and secure use of nuclear pow er worldwide through a variety of bilateral a nd multila teral e ngagements. F or example, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission a dvises international partners on safety and regulatory best practices, and the Department of Energy works with international partners on research and developm ent, nuc lear waste and stor age, training, regulations, qua lity control, and compre hensive fuel leasing options. Goi ng forward, we will e xpand the se efforts to p romote nuclear energy generation c onsist ent with maximizing safety and nonproliferation goals. Clean Coal. The Unit ed States works with C hina, India, and othe r countries that currently rely heavily on coal for pow er generation to a dvance the development and deployment of clean coal technolog ies. In addition, the U.S. leads the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, whi ch engages 23 othe r countries and econom ies on carbon c apture and sequestration t echnolog ies. Going forward, we will c ontinue to use these bilateral a nd m ultilateral e fforts to p romote clean c oal technolog ies. Energy E fficiency. The Obama Administra tion h as aggressively promoted energy efficiency through the Clean En ergy Minist erial and ke y bilateral p rograms. tunitie s and Appli ance Deployment Initiative and its Glob al Superior Energy Performance Partnership a re helping to acc elerate the global adoption of standards and practices th at would c ut energy waste equiva lent to m ore than 650 m id-size pow er plants by 2030. W e will wo rk to e xpand the se efforts focusing on several cr itical ar eas, inc luding : improving building efficiency, reducing energy consum ption a t water and w astewater treatment facilitie s, and expanding g lobal appliance standards. Negotiating Global Free Trade in Environmental Goods and Services: The U.S. will wo rk with tra ding partners to l aunch negotiations a t the World Trade Organization tow ards global free trade in environmental goods, inc luding clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, h ydro and geothermal. The U.S. will build on the consensus i t recent ly forged among the 21 Asi a-Pacific Econom ic Cooperation ( APEC) econom ies in this area. In 2011, A PEC economies agreed to reduce tariffs to 5 pe rcent or less by 2015 on a negotiated list of 54 e nvironmental goods. T he 20 APEC list wil l serve as a founda tion f or a global agreement in the WTO, with p articipating countries expanding the scope by adding produc ts of interest. Ov er the next year, we will wo rk towards securing participation of countries whi ch account f or 90 pe rcent of global trade in environmental goods, re presenting roughly $481 b illion in a nnua l environmental goods t rade. We will a lso wo rk in the Trade in Services A greement ne gotiations tow ards achi eving free trade in environmental services. Phasing Out Subsidies that Encourage Was teful Consumption of Fossil F uels: The International Energy Agency estimates that the phase-out of fossil f uel subsidi es - whi ch amount to more than $500 billion a nnua lly - would l ead to a 10 per cent reduction in g reenhouse gas emissions b elow busine ss as usu al by 2050. At t he 2009 G -20 m eeting in Pittsburgh, the Unit ed States successf ully advocated for a commitment to pha se out the se subsidi es, and we have since won si milar commitments in othe r fora such as APEC. President Ob ama is calling for the elimination of U.S. fossil f uel tax subsidi es in his Fiscal Y ear (FY) 2014 b udget, and we will continue to collaborate with p artners around the world tow ard this g oal. Leading Global Sector Public Financing Towar ds Cleaner En ergy: Under this Administra tion, the Unit ed States has successfully mobilized billions of dollars for clean energy investments in de veloping countries, helping to accelerate their transition t o a green, low -carbon econom y. Building on these successes, the President calls f or an end to U .S. government suppor t for public financing of new coal plants over seas, e xcept for (a) the most efficient coal technol ogy available in the world's poo rest countries in cas es where no othe r econom ically feasible alternative exists, or (b) facilitie s deploying carbon captur e and sequestration technolog ies. As part of this n ew commitment, we will wo rk actively to secure the agreement of othe r countries and the multila teral development ba nks to a dopt si milar policies as soon as possibl e. Strengthening Global Resilience to Cli mate Change: Failing to prepare adequately for the impacts of climate change that can no lon ger be avoide d will put m illions of people at risk, jeopardizing important de velopm ent gains, a nd increasi ng the security risks th at stem from climate change. That is w hy the Obama Administra tion ha s made histo ric investments in bolst ering the capacity of countries to re spond to c limate-change risks. G oing forward, we will continue to: Strengthen government and local c ommuni ty planning and response capacities, such as by increasing water storage and w ater use efficiency to cope with the increased variability in water supply Develop innova tive financial risk m anagement tools suc h as inde x insura nce to he lp smallhold er farmers and pa storalists m anage risk associated with changing rainfall patterns and dr ought Distribute drought-resistant seeds a nd pr omote management practices th at increas e farmers' ability to cope with climate impacts. Mobilizing Cli mate Finance: International climate finance is an important tool in our efforts to promote low-emissions, climate-resilient de velopment. W e have fulfilled our joint d eveloped country commi tment fro m the Copenhagen Accord to pr ovide approximately $30 billion of climate assistance to developing countries ove r FY 2010- FY 2012. T he United States contributed approximately $7.5 billion to this eff ort ove r the three year period. Goi ng forward, we will s eek 21 to build on this pr ogress as well as focus our efforts on c ombining our publ ic resources with smart poli cies to mobilize much larger flows of private inve stment in low-emissions a nd climate resilient infrastructure. II. Leading Efforts to A ddress Climate Change through International Negotiations The Unit ed States has made histo ric progress in t he international climate negotiations dur ing the past four years. At the Copenhagen Conference of the Unit ed Nations F ramework Conve ntion on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2009, P resident Ob ama and othe r world leader s agreed f or the first tim e that all major countries, wh ether developed or developing, would implement targets or actions to lim it greenhou se emissions, a nd do so unde r a new regime of international transparen cy. And in 201 1, at the year-end climate meeting in Durban, we achieved another breakthr ough: Countries agreed to ne gotiate a new agreem ent by the end of 2015 tha t would have equal legal force and be applicable to all countries in the period a fter 2020. This w as an important step beyond the previous l egal agreement, the Kyoto P rotocol, w hose core obligations applied to de veloped countries, not to C hina, India, Brazil or othe r emerging countries. The 2015 c limate conference is slated to pl ay a critical r ole in def ining a post-2020 t rajectory. We will be seeking an agreem ent that is a mbitious, inc lusive and flexible. It needs to be ambitious to m eet the scale of the challenge facing us. It needs to be inclusive because there is no w ay to meet th at challenge unless all countries step up a nd pl ay their part. And it needs to be flexible because there are many differently situated par ties with th eir own needs a nd impe ratives, and those differences wi ll have to be accommodated in s mart, practica l ways. At the same time as we work tow ard this out come in the UNF CCC context, we are making progress in a variety of other impo rtant ne gotiations as well. At the Mont real Protocol, we are leading eff orts in suppor t of an amendment that would pha se down H FCs; at the International Maritime Organization, we have agreed to a nd are now i mplementing the first-ever sector-wide, internationally applicable energy efficiency standards; and at the International Civil Avia tion Organization, we have ambitious a spirational emissions a nd energy efficiency targets and are working towards agreem ent to de velop a comprehensive global approach.
