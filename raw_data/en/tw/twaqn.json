Or have you been in pain for quite some time and are ready to get back to feeling better? An autoimmune disorder therapy session with us might be just what you need for overall wellness. Here's what to know about autoimmune disorder therapies. What is an Autoimmune Disorder? Autoimmune disorders occur when your body's immune system, the first line of defense against bacteria and viruses, turns on itself and cannot distinguish between healthy tissue and harmful antigens. As a result, autoimmune disorders can destroy body tissue, cause inflammation in the skin, joints, and muscles, and change the functioning of organs. Autoimmune disorders are often characterized by their periods of flare-ups\u2014when symptoms are most intense and severe\u2014followed by periods of remission. Over 80 types of autoimmune disorders exist, including: - Rheumatoid arthritis - Lupus - Vasculitis - Celiac disease - Type I diabetes - Alopecia areata What are Autoimmune Disorder Therapies? Most autoimmune disorders are commonly treated with medications that work by suppressing the immune system. However, if you're looking for non-invasive and drug-free approaches to treating your autoimmune disorder and its symptoms, several functional medicine approaches exist that work to restore balance within your body and increase your overall wellness. These include: - Meditation - Yoga - Integrative nutrition, including the use of herbal supplements - Traditional Chinese medicine practices such as acupuncture, tai chi, and qigong - Massage therapy - Energy healing, such as therapeutic touch What Are the Benefits of Autoimmune Disorder Therapies? Most complementary forms of autoimmune disorder therapies are non-invasive and drug-free ways of managing the symptoms of your autoimmune disorder. Some benefits are: - Decrease in stress and anxiety by activating the parasympathetic nervous system - Decrease in pain and inflammation - Improved mood and emotions - Enhanced quality of life - Improved sleep quality - Longer periods of remission What to Expect During an Autoimmune Disorder Therapy Session If you've never been to an autoimmune disorder therapy session, you might be wondering what to expect during your appointment. A certified physician at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking you a comprehensive set of questions to determine your current health, symptoms, as well as emotional and mental well-being. From there, a treatment will be created that's individual to you and can include one or several forms of functional medicine such as yoga, acupuncture, and integrative diet plans. The number of therapy sessions recommended will vary based on the severity and occurrence of your symptoms, but most patients find that an increase in wellness is experienced through regular therapy.
