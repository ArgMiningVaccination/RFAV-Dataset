Description The practice of neural therapy is based on the belief that energy flows freely through the body. It is proposed that injury, disease, malnutrition, stress, and scar tissue disrupt this flow, creating disturbances in the electrochemical function of tissues and energy imbalances called \"interference fields.\" Injection of a local anesthetic at spec ific sites is believed to re -establish the normal resting potential of nerves and flow of energy. Alternative theories include fascial continuity, the ground (matrix) system, and the lymphatic system.1, There is a strong focus on treatment of the autonomi c nervous system, and injections may be given at a location other than the source of the pain or location of an injury. Neural therapy is promoted mainly to relieve chronic pain. It has also been proposed to be helpful for allergies, hay fever, headaches, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, asthma, hormone imbalances, libido, infertility, tinnitus, chronic bowel problems, sports or muscle injuries, gallbladder, heart, kidney, or liver disease, dizziness, depression, menstrual cramps, and skin and circulation pro blems. Summary Neural therapy involves the injection of a local anesthetic such as procaine or lidocaine into various tissues such as scars, trigger points, acupuncture points, tendon and ligament insertions, peripheral nerves, autonomic ganglia, the epidural space, and other tissues to treat chronic pain. Neural therapy has been proposed for other chronic illness syndromes such as allergies, infertility, tinnitus, multiple sclerosis, depression, and chronic bowel problems. When the anesthetic agent is injected into traditional acupuncture points, this treatment may be called neural acupuncture. For individuals who have chronic pain or illness (eg, pain, allergies, hay fever, headaches, arthritis, asthma, hormone imbalances, libido, infertility, tinnitu s, multiple sclerosis, chronic bowel problems, sports or muscle injuries, gallbladder, heart, kidney, or liver disease, dizziness, depression, menstrual cramps, skin and circulation problems) who receive neural therapy, the evidence includes randomized and nonrandomized trials. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, functional outcomes, quality of life, medication use, and treatment -related morbidity. There are few English -language reports assessing the use of neural therapy for pain, and the available studies hav e methodologic limitations that preclude conclusions on efficacy. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy History Date Action 1/2023 Annual policy review.
