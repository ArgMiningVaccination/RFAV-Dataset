Current Law: The Maryland Medical Practice Act sets forth the laws governing th e licensure of physicians and the practice of medicine in the State. The Act establishes the State Board of Physicians and specifically defines the acts that constitute the practice of medicine. The State Board of Physicians is responsible for regulating , licensing, and disciplining physicians and other allied health professionals. Certain practitioners are exempt from licensure under the Maryland Medical Practice Act. For instance, Christian Science practitioners who are accredited by the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts who deal with human ills in accordance with the tenets of Christian Science and charge for services are exempted from the Maryland Medical Practice Act. In addition, a licensed dentist who has administered an esthesia regularly in hospitals in this State for at least 15 years before June 1, 1962, is also exempted when practicing anesthesiology or administering anesthesia for medical purposes. HB 541 / Page 3 Complementary and alternative health services, as well as the practi ce of a wellness practitioner, are not regulated under State law . Background: According to the National Institutes of Health, complementary and alternative medicine is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not considered to be part of conventional medicine. Some health care providers practice both complementary and alternative medicine and conventional medicine. Complementary and alternative medicines are different from each other. Complementary medicine is used together with conventional medicine, such as using aromatherapy to help lessen a patient's discomfort following surgery. In comparison, alternative medicine is used in place of conventional medicine. An example of this is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy as recommended by a conventional doctor. Complementary and alternative medicine practices are divided into four domains: (1) mind -body medicine; (2) biologically based practices; (3) manipulative and body -based practices; and (4) energy medicine. Mind -body medicine uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily functions and systems such as patient support groups and cognitive -behavioral therapy . Meditation, prayer, mental healing, and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance are also considered mind -body medicine. Biologically based practices use substances found in nature including dietary supplements and herbal produc ts. Manipulative body -based practices are based on manipulation and/or movement of one or more parts of the body, including massage. Energy medicine involves the use of energy fields, such as biofield therapies and bioelectromagnetic -based therapies. Bi ofield therapies are intended to affect energy fields that allegedly surround and penetrate the human body. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pressure and/or manipulating the body by placing the hands in, or through, these fiel ds. Examples of biofield therapies include qi gong, Reiki, and therapeutic touch. The existence of such energy fields has not yet been scientifically proven. Bioelectromagnetic -based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields, su ch as pulsed fields, magnetic fields, or alternating current or direct -current fields. Whole medical systems cut across all four of these domains and are built upon complete systems of theory and practice. These systems have evolved apart from, and ear lier than, conventional medicine used in the United States. Examples of whole medicine systems include homeopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and Ayurveda. Ayurveda originated in India and aims to integrate the body, mind, and spirit using t herapies that include herbs, massage, and yoga. HB 541 / Page 4 In the United States, 38.3% of adults and 11.8% of children used some form of complementary alternative medicine in 2007. Additional Information Prior Introductions: None.
