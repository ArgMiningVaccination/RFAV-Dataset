A Bit About Reiki ~ Like traditional Chinese medicine, Reiki is based on the idea that every cell in your body has its own energy, or life force. Reiki, the ancient Tibetan healing art of spiritually guided universal life force energy feels like a wonderful flow of love radiating throughout your body as it clears and balances energy pathways, moving you to a new level of awareness and service. There is a life force which flows through your physical body through pathways called chakras, meridians and nadis. It is also all around us in an energy field called the aura that has now been confirmed and even measured by scientists. Reiki heals by flowing through the affected parts of the energy field and charging them with positive energy. It raises the vibratory level of the energy field in and around the physical body where negative thoughts and feelings are attached. This causes the negative energy to break apart and fall away. In so doing, Reiki clears, straightens and heals the energy pathways, thus allowing the life force to flow in a healthy and natural way. This may alleviate the symptoms of disease or disharmony by addressing root cause, revitalizing the chakras and enhancing the flow of life force. This impacts the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies through releasing the blocks to your manifesting the energy of the loving and powerful essence which you are. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of the National Institutes of Health, places Reiki under the umbrella of energy medicine - treatments that aim to restore proper energy flow through the body. NCCAM is currently funding research that studies Reiki's ability to reduce stress, as well as its effect on people suffering from AIDS, prostate cancer and fibromyalgia. A 2004 study published in theJournal of Alternative and Complementary Medicinefound that Reiki has a positive effect on the autonomic nervous system, including helping to lower heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. Still, some aspects of Reiki's power are impossible to measure. In an Energy Healing session with me (using Reiki and my own method of energy work), I am a \"conduit\", so to speak, and can assist your body and energies to balance itself which then leads to self healing. The energy of Reiki stimulates and nourishes the natural process of a person's life and can even help with aches and pains. You will receive many benefits from my working on you, as this is subtle yet profound work! Most physical pain is tied to deep emotional experiences which can be released through the energy work we will do together. During your energy healing treatment, my hands flow gently around your body and work to improve its energy flow. I will check your chakras using a pendulum and then begin the balance process, using crystal energy in assisting my intuition. You will basically receive an energy \"tune up\" in our session together. If needed, I will perform \"psychic surgery\" on areas of the body that are in need of healing. This is a non invasive yet powerful tool that can relieve pain and help the healing process of internal organs. I will leave you with exercises, pranayama work, and other health tips that you can use in your daily life to keep your balance in check. This session includes a mini holistic "}
