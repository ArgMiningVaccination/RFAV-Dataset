What Our Patients Say Started the program as 200lbs breast cancer survivor stuck and couldn't kick the sugar habit. In her first 5-week program she lost 18.2lbs of fat and kept all of her muscle. She continued on the program and started personal training. 14 months later weighed in at 145lbs. She has been an inspiration watching her go though the program and how it changed her life. - Lisa F. In her first 5-week program dropped from 198lb down to 182lbs. of the 16lbs lost 14.8lbs was fat. She also lost 17.5 inches (7 body measurements) \" This was the easiest program to follow. Eat real food and the ketone test lets you know that you are on track.\" - Barbara L. Dr. Mike is awesome! I put a rib out of place, and after two months of pain I was recommended to see him. After one visit I found out what stretching I can do to get back to normal, and with the help of his adjustments, I've seen progress in just two weeks! - Caitlin T. My husband and I both have seen Dr Mike. His approach is holistic and hands on. We both have had amazing results. Dr Mike is knowledgeable, patient and professional. It is time for us to move off Cape and we will miss him very much. - Thomas S. Dr. Singleton is the best! You will find nobody more professional and better interested in your total care. - Nikki F. After trying everything for severe plantar fasciitis and suffering with it for a year, shockwave and laser therapy with Dr Singleton has greatly improved my condition after only two sessions so far. There was immediate relief after the very first session. The relief from chronic pain is profound. Dr Mike is extremely well versed in whole body wellness and utilizes many modalities for treating every individual's complaints. He was able to help me when physical therapy, multiple doctors, and extensive home care could not. So glad I found him! Would strongly recommend to anyone. Thank you! - Tom M. Excellent, thorough, whole-body and lifestyle approach to diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Singleton is both extremely knowledgeable as well as personable, with a wonderful staff and facility, who I could not recommend strongly enough. - Jonathan G. I hadn't been to a chiropractor in too long. I sit at a desk all day and was really uncomfortable. After a couple of visits, my back felt so much better. I recommend him to everyone. - Beverly F. Mike's knowledge never ceases to amaze me. He has helped me from my back to my toe. He even was able to help me avoid gall bladder surgery. We are always recommending him to our members at Fit Rev. He is a very trustworthy chiropractor and is able to help you in so much more to improve your health. - Kristin H. SERVICES We provide the best chiropractic solutions "}
