{"title": "Reddit", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2021-12-16", "cleaned_text": "Meditation [r/Meditation](/r/Meditation/) This community is for sharing experiences, stories and instruction relating to the practice of meditation. I am asking this because I have found myself in a situation where I really need some reassuring responses. The thing is that I am experiencing great difficulties at the moment to reach a peace of mind, and I find myself stuck in the world of thoughts. I am not an anti-vaxxer and generally don't get caught in fear based ideas and beliefs, and truly I do believe this is my own mind playing tricks on me. But I would really like some input from you guys on the subject. I got my first (and only) shot in June and the same night I had severe reactions like muscle tensions and racing heart. This led me to experience severe anxiety that just kept increasing. The last 1,5 years I have been advancing more and more in my meditation practices, and my experience is that when anxiety arises it disappears when I am facing it, and I reach a state of inner peace. This night this didn't happen and I got more and more anxious and paniced. Eventually it was gone, but it was a scary experience and I believe this experience induced this fear that has been growing. Since then I have been able to reach inner peace and blissful states from time to time, but I have been quite in the dark because of personal traumas related to a breakup. I do believe this is the reason for my current state and struggles, but this fear of the vaccine being the cause is still there. Last night I stumbled upon some thread on Reddit where people where discussing that the vaccine cuts the connection between the body and the higher Self, and this made me even more scared. I know deep down this is BS and this is not even a possibility but I can't help feeling anxious about the small chance of this being true. I just want to come back to my own Self, with this blissful energy in the background. Right now I am extremely tired, stressed, have racing thoughts, have a hard time concentrating and would even consider myself depressed. I also have some weird tingling sensation in my throat since 1,5-2 months back that my mind has made a connection to the vaccine. At the same time I do know how much our minds can play tricks on us, and that fear itself is the greatest obstacle to inner peace. And of course, if there is a subconscious fear that the vaccine has caused this, it will become a self fulfilling prophecy. This is the reason I'm reaching out to you guys, to hopefully get some reassuring responses regarding my concerns. "}
