Oral medication and/or surgery may be used when control cannot be achieved with the drops. This article concerns pneumatic trabeculoplasty (PNT), a surgical procedure claimed to lower IOP and reduce or eliminate the need for medication. After studying the evidence with help from several experts, I have concluded that PNT does not work and poses serious danger to patients. Background History In 1997, the Arizona Glaucoma Institute (AGI), of Scottsdale, Arizona, began offering a \"new treatment\" for open-angle and pigmentary glaucoma using a patented [vacuum-ring device](http://www.ophthalmicinternational.com/ROW_Equipment.html). Devices of this type are FDA-approved for stabilizing the eye during refractive surgery, but they are not approved in the United States for treating glaucoma. The institute's parent company, [Coronado Industries](http://www.coronadoindustries.com/), marketed the device through another subsidiary called [Ophthalmic International](http://www.ophthalmicinternational.com). The device was invented by company chairman Richard G. Smith and ophthalmologist John T. LiVecchi, M.D. and patented by Coronado in 1994 [2]. Company documents have described LiVecchi as medical director and a major shareholder of Coronado Industries. The patent document states: The open angle glaucoma treatment apparatus is a vacuum source and a vacuum applicator coupled by a hose. The vacuum applicator is an eye ring or an eye cup that is placed on the frontal surface of an eye. Suction (negative pressure) in the range of 10 to 30 mm. Hg. is applied by the vacuum source, which will fixture the ring or cup to the eye, or alternatively pressure is applied for 15 to 120 seconds. A second treatment is recommended later. It could be within twelve hours, on the following day, or within the next couple of days [2]. An AGI brochure stated that a 2-minute treatment with the device lowers IOP in most cases. [3] Another AGI document stated that during the previous four years, \"a good number\" of patients had been taken off of their medication completely and that \"a number of patients\" remained on medication but required reduced dosage [4]. PNT cost about $200 per treatment. In September 1997, the institute offered free glaucoma screenings in connection with its \"grand opening.\" [5] Early in 1998, an Arizona investment firm seeking investors for Coronado Industries issued a private offering summary which noted that the AGI's medical director, ophthalmologist Leo D. Bores, M.D., had originated the radial keratotomy procedure [6]. The solicitation, intended \"for broker-dealer internal use only,\" projected after-tax earnings of $12 million in 1998, $46 million in 1999, and $99 million in the year 2000. The solicitation also stated that the proceeds would be used to open additional Glaucoma Treatment Centers and that Coronado Industries believed that \"insurance companies will . . . quickly approve payment for the new device and procedure since it is projected to reduce the cost of long-term care costs associated with alternative treatments.\" [6] However, the company's [Form SB-2 Registration Statement](http://www.freeedgar.com/Search/ViewFilings.asp?CIK=859365&Directory=950147&Year=98&SECIndex=665&Extension=.tst&PathFlag=0&TextFileSize=362381&SFType=&SDFiled=&DateFiled=8/24/1998&SourcePage=FilingsResults&UseFrame=1&OEMSource=&FormType=SB-2&CompanyName=CORONADO+INDUSTRIES+INC) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 8/24/98, noted receipts of only $179,767 and an overall loss of $648,702 for the first half of 1998 [7]. Coronado's hopes for financial success have not materialized. The AGI clinic closed in 1999 after the Arizona Medical Board took action (described below) against Dr. Bores, and lack of FDA approval has blocked sale of the device within the United States. The device received CERMET certification in 2004, which means it can be marketed in about 25 other countries. So far, however, Coronado has steadily lost money since its inception. No Evidence of Effectiveness The fluid within the eyeball normally drains through the trabecular meshwork, a thin net-like band that lies between between the cornea (the clear window of the eye) and the sclera (the white portion of the eye). Glaucoma usually occurs because the mesh becomes clogged or is unable to allow sufficient drainage. When this happens, since fluid production continues, IOP builds up. Proponents postulate that PNT reduces IOP by stretching the trabecular meshwork so that more fluid flows out of the eye. However, this has not been anatomically demonstrated. Studying whether a treatment is effective against glaucoma is complicated because (a) IOP can vary from day to day, (b) sensitivity to increased pressure can vary considerably from person to person, (c) blindness from glaucoma typically takes 12 to 15 years to develop, so long-term monitoring is necessary, and (d) the tests that measure IOP involve interpretations that could be influenced by observer bias. To be valid, a test protocol should include the following: - Patient selection should based on repeated tests that show a consistent pattern of IOP elevation. - Treated patients (or eyes) should be compared to patients (or eyes) that are untreated or receive standard treatment. - Patient selection should be randomized to ensure that treated and untreated eyes are comparable before treatment is applied. Failure to do this can result in selection bias. - The people doing the eye-pressure measurements should not be able to tell which eyes were treated and which were not. Failure to do this can result in observer bias (a possible conscious or unconscious tendency to make favorable findings). - The data must undergo appropriate statistical analysis. PNT proponents claim that three published studies demonstrate effectiveness. Two of these studies were described by Drs. Bores and LiVecchi and a Mexican ophthalmologist (Guillermo Avalos Urz\u00faa, M.D.) in a paper that was published in 2005 in the Annals of Ophthalmology [8]. The first study involved 177 patients of Avelos and LiVecchi who underwent PNT twice one week apart and then about every 3 months for from 2 to 8 years between 1994 and 2001. The report stated that many of these patients were able to reduce or eliminate their glaucoma medication and that there was a 6.3 mm Hg drop in average IOP. The second study involved 317 eyes from 172 patients that Bores treated at the Arizona Glaucoma Institute for up to 18 months beginning in 1997. The report stated that many of these patients were able to reduce or eliminate the the amount of medication they took. However, these studies were so poorly designed that they should be regarded as meaningless. - Patient selection was not randomized. - The initial (baseline) IOP readings were not properly determined. The proper way to determine baseline values is to screen everyone on the same schedule and often enough to determine their average level. Instead of doing this, Bores, LiVecchi, and Avelos relied on high readings obtained when the patients happened to be seen. Doing this virtually ensures that the baseline IOPs assigned to patients are higher than their true average pressure and will falsely appear to drop when more frequent measurements are made, regardless of whether they are treated. - Masking was not used to prevent the researchers from knowing whether the eyes being evaluated had been treated. This is important to guard against observer bias. - Neither study contained control group of patients who did not undergo PNT, so that it is not possible to judge whether any lowering was due to PNT or to other factors. It is also possible that lowering could result from patients being studied taking their medication more carefully. The third allegedly positive study was published in 2005 in the European Journal of Ophthalmology [9]. This study involved 37 patients who were observed during 2001 and 2002 in two Italian clinics. The protocol called for treating one eye in each patient while the other served as a control for 30 days. The second eye was then treated, and the first eye was treated again two months later. The first eye treated was the one with the higher IOP. The authors claim that PNT lowered the average IOP by about 2 mg Hg. However, the study had many flaws, and proper statistical analysis actually shows no benefit. - Eye selection should have been randomized rather than based on which eye had the highest initial IOP. - The results were not compared with those of comparable patients who received standard treatment. - To determine the treatment effect on the second eye, the authors compared the IOP after PNT was done with the IOP when the study began. They should have compared the pressure after PNT was done with the pressure at day 30 before PNT was done. When this is done, the \"statistical significance\" vanishes. - Ten people (27% of the original group) dropped out of the study because their IOP could not be controlled. The final statistical analysis did not include them in the calculation. (In other words, they took the data, eliminated the worst ten results, and then reported on the average of the rest.) - The IOP reduction the authors claimed for the Bores data was only about 2 mm Hg, which is too small to be clinically significant. - The longest follow-up period was only about 3 months. - No masking to prevent bias from influencing IOP measurements was described. - The eyes that were treated first had two rounds of treatment. Yet their average IOP remained higher than the other eyes that received only one round of treatment. If PNT were effective, the eyes that received two rounds of treatment should have done better than eyes that had received one. The best designed study of PNT was reported in 1998 by researchers at Duke University. This study involved 8 glaucoma patients with who had one eye treated while the other served as a control. Measurements at 1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months later found no reduction of IOP or improvement in the drainage of fluid from within the eye [10]. The European Journal of Ophthalmology paper mentions but does not identify another study that involved 49 patients with glaucoma who took multiple medications and/or had prior multiple surgeries, and \"did not respond well to PNT.\" Significant Safety Risk Normal IOPs range from 8 to 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In high-pressure glaucoma, the levels range from 21 to 40. In rare cases, new patients present with higher levels. The higher the IOP, the more likely that optic nerve damage will occur. PNT temporarily squeezes the front of the eyeball and raises the IOP to 65 and perhaps even higher. In someone with an already damaged optic nerve, this could be serious. The accepted treatment for glaucoma is to lower the IOP with medication or surgery. Experiments in monkeys have demonstrated that sudden pressure elevations can compromise the blood supply to the optic nerve and accelerate nerve cell death in already weakened cells [11,12], and human experiments have found that acute pressure increases can increase cupping of the optic nerve [13,14]. Two cases have been reported of patients who lost part of their vision following refractive surgery during which a suction ring was applied to their eyeball [15,16]. Although no such complications have been reported with PNT, it still should be viewed with caution. Damage from high IOP may not be immediately apparent because visual impairment from glaucoma typically takes many years to develop. Proof of safety and effectiveness would require long-term studies showing not only that IOP is lowered, but also that the patients' visual fields have not been adversely affected. Minor complications from PNT appear to be common. The Italian researchers stated that 34 of their 37 patients had adverse effects such as redness of the eye (26 patients) or conjunctival bleeding (14 patients), but these effects were temporary and not serious. FDA Objections Documents obtained with a Freedom of Information Act request indicate that in February 1998, the FDA issued a warning letter to Ophthalmic International president G. Richard Smith. The letter stated: During an inspection of your firm conducted between November 25 and December 11, 1997, our investigators determined that your firm distributed two vacuum fixation devices with suction rings to the Arizona Glaucoma Institute. . . for use in treating patients with glaucoma using a pneumatic trabeculoplasty (PNT) procedure. These products are devices as defined by . . . the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Your vacuum fixation devices are adulterated . . . in that they are Class III devices. . . and do not have approved applications for investigational device exemption (IDE). . . . . . in that a notice or other information respecting the devices was not provided to the FDA as required [17]. The letter indicated that because the device is not approved for the treatment of glaucoma, the FDA regards it as a new device for which FDA approval is required and that: The sponsors of investigations, investigators, or any persons acting for or on behalf of a sponsor or an investigator may not promote or test market an investigational device or represent that it is safe or effective for the purpose for which it is being investigated. Smith replied that (a) the vacuum fixation device did have an IDE and should not be considered a Class III device, (b) an Institutional Review Board (IRB) had determined that the device did not pose an unreasonable risk to patients, and (c)his company plans to submit an application to broaden the way the device is used [18]. However, an FDA official responded that (a) the device had not been formally classified, (b) new devices are automatically placed in Class III, and (c) the agency disagreed with the IRB's conclusion [19]. In August 1998, the company submitted an IDE application, which the FDA rejected. Disciplinary Action In March 1999, Dr. Bores announced that he had retired from clinical practice but would continue to direct research at anther clinic with which AGI had merged [20]. In December 1999, after additional communication with the FDA, Ophthalmic International was given permission to conduct a small \"feasibility study.\" [23] Federal regulations state that during clinical studies, no investigator or sponsor can commercially distribute an unapproved device, charge subjects more than the amount needed to cover costs, or represent that the device is safe or effective for its intended purpose. The Arizona Medical Board concluded that Bores did all of these things, lacked FDA approval to conduct any PNT studies, and improperly collected Medicare payments for patients treated between December 1997 and February 1999. In April 2003, the board reprimanded Bores and placed him on two years' probation under which he was barred from conducting studies that did not meet FDA criteria. He was also required to reimburse Medicare for $15,539.81 that he had been paid for the 1997-1999 treatments [21]. The Current Situation Press releases from Coronado Industries indicate that the company has received approval to market its PNT equipment in several countries and has begun to do that. However, it appears to be a long way off from getting FDA clearance to sell within the United States. Its third-quarter 2005 report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states: The Company has not made an operating profit since its reorganization in 1996. Further, the Company has a working capital deficit of $891,435 and a negative net worth of $878,266. At this time the greatest impediment to the Company's profitability is the FDA approval of the sale of its products in the United States. The Company has been attempting to negotiate the protocol for a clinical study in the United States which would be relatively short in duration and inexpensive to complete. The previous finding of a \"significant patient risk\" by the FDA has thus far been a problem to negotiating a favorable clinical study protocol. The Company is hopeful that the results of a recent animal study and a new presentation of older patient records will permit a favorable clinical study protocol to be granted by the FDA within the next year. If a favorable clinical study protocol were granted by the FDA the Company anticipates it will be about two years after the clinical study commences before the Company's products could be sold in the U.S. The estimated cost of the clinical study is several million dollars. The Company is hopeful a major medical equipment distributor will pay the majority of the clinical study expenses as consideration for receiving the U.S. or worldwide marketing rights to the products. If the Company is unable to obtain third party funding of the clinical study, the Company will seek equity or debt financing for the clinical study. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to adequately fund any clinical study permitted by the FDA. Until the Company receives its FDA approval the Company will be dependent on loans from its management and improved international sales. During 2004 the Company received its Type 2a product classification and began shipping its products overseas pursuant to four distribution contracts. The Company recorded product revenue of approximately $88,330 during the first three quarters of 2005. The Company anticipates slightly increased product revenues in 2006 from these European distribution agreements [22]. The Bottom Line Pneumatic trabeculoplasty has not been proven safe or effective for treating glaucoma; and Coronado Industries' vacuum fixation device lacks FDA approval for such use. It remains to be seen whether additional research will demonstrate benefit. I do not believe that it will.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-nine-hundred-twelve) [Acupuncture: A History](https://quackwatch.org/acupuncture/hx/basser/) Acupuncture is a therapy based on ancient Chinese philosophy [1]. The practice of acupuncture is fairly widespread and is used by both medically and non-medically trained persons. The technique involves the puncturing of the skin with needles to achieve therapeutic benefit and is based upon the belief that the human body is subject to disease when there are imbalances in the level of invisible life forces. The needles are used to stimulate various points located over the body, and by this means the body's balance can be restored. The needles are usually inserted and twirled and may be left in for short periods. The points chosen for stimulation depend upon the patient's symptoms, the season, the weather, and the result of taking the pulse at ... Acupuncture is a therapy based on ancient Chinese philosophy [1]. The practice of acupuncture is fairly widespread and is used by both medically and non-medically trained persons. The technique involves the puncturing of the skin with needles to achieve therapeutic benefit and is based upon the belief that the human body is subject to disease when there are imbalances in the level of invisible life forces. The needles are used to stimulate various points located over the body, and by this means the body's balance can be restored. The needles are usually inserted and twirled and may be left in for short periods. The points chosen for stimulation depend upon the patient's symptoms, the season, the weather, and the result of taking the pulse at the wrist. Some modern practitioners use low-level laser light instead of needles. Beginnings In the early 1970s manuscripts dating from 168 B.C.E. were discovered at the Ma-wang-tui graves [2-4]. These provide a picture of Chinese medicine as it existed during the third to second century B.C.E. and describe all the therapeutic procedures in use during this period [5]. Acupuncture is not mentioned in these texts. As a therapeutic technique, acupuncture was first described in the Shi-chi text in the year 90 B.C.E. No known Chinese source prior to this time refers to the technique, though earlier texts do describe the use of objects such as sharp stones to drain blood or infection [6]. The Ma-wang-tui texts describe 11 mo, or vessels, that were believed to contain in addition to blood a life force known as ch'i or pneuma [7]. There was no distinction made at this time between vessels on the basis of content, and no information was provided on how the blood and ch'i circulated in the vessels, which did not make up a connected system [8]. By the end of the first century B.C.E., it was believed that there were 12 vessels, and that these were connected in a network. In addition, a picture had developed of the ch'i flowing through vessels separate from blood [9-11]. The most important text of this time\u2014the Huang-ti nei-ching\u2014mentions 12 connected vessels with different courses to the 11 described earlier [12]. These were called \"conduits\" (ching) or \"conduit vessels\" (ching-mo). It also records a large number of holes which are located over the body on these vessels. Many modern writers refer to these vessels as \"meridians.\" [13,14] In early times, the Chinese thought disease was closely related to the vascular system and, as noted above, treatment often involved bleeding with sharp stones [15]. Later the concept of a disease-causing agent\u2014the hsieh\u2014was developed. It was believed that this could lodge in the vessels and interfere with the flow in them. The concept of ch'i (represented in some texts as qi) came from the term hsieh-chi, or evil influences, which in turn developed from an earlier time in Chinese history when the agents of illness were thought to be demons (hsieh-kuei). [16] The wind was originally regarded as a demon and therefore an agent of illness. As a spirit or demon the wind resided, it was believed, in caves or tunnels. The term for \"caves\" is used in acupuncture literature to designate the holes in the skin through which the ch'i is able to flow into and out of the bodythsueh. It was believed that through the insertion of different kinds of needles into these holes the flow of ch'i could be increased or decreased to achieve a more normal state of health. Ch'i was considered to float through the air, and flow with blood. Each body organ was thought to send its own ch'i through the body, giving rise to the belief that the state of each organ can be determined through proper evaluation of the pulse. The Chinese character used to represent ch'i is literally read as \"vapors rising from food.\" [17] Supporters of acupuncture like to use the word \"energy\" in association with the term ch'i, but it is clear that: \"the core concept of ch'i bears no resemblance to the western concept of energy (regardless of whether the latter is borrowed from the physical sciences or from colloquial use).\" [18] Over time the connection between needling and ch'i, which formed the basis of acupuncture, was described in the context of an emerging cosmological view of the world, not evident in the earlier descriptions of medical bleeding. Organic medicine was subsumed under this emerging system of cosmological correspondences [19,20]. When the system of openings or holes along the vessels was first described, there were 365, not because this number had been anatomically identified, but because this corresponded to the days in one year. Early texts make no reference to the openingstthey are just suddenly described, and there are 365 of them. The absence of any objective basis for the openings is shown by the fact that many texts describe a different total number of them [21]. The vessels, and not the openings, were the central feature of \"ancient\" acupuncture, whereas in modern practice the points appear to be of prime importance. The vessels have, over time, lost their association with the vascular system [22] and in the West are now viewed primarily as functional pathways linking the openings. The use of the term \"meridian\" rather than \"vessel\" merely serves to aid in clouding the issue. A further problem is an apparent contradiction in that the modern practice of acupuncture seems to be based on the pre- and postcirculation concepts. That is, the vessels are needled as if they constitute separate units, while at the same time most practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine also rely on wrist pulse palpation, which makes sense only if the flow through the vessels is continuous. If the flow was not continuous (i.e., the vessels not connected), then each vessel would need to be palpated for its own pulse. This is, in fact, what was originally described, and it seems that this basic contradiction has arisen from a partial acceptance and a partial rejection of history [23]. It is unclear why this occurred and how it was decided what to retain and what to discard. Most people have heard of the terms \"yin\" and \"yang,\" which describe concepts that form an important part of the history of Chinese medicine and acupuncture. An ill person was considered to be out of balance with nature and these two opposing forces. Originally the terms meant shady (yin) and sunny (yang) side of a hill [24]. The belief in these forces was based on the view that most of the natural world consisted of events that were cyclical and therefore caused by the rise and fall of opposite, but complementary, forces. There was also an element of the ancient belief in a particular form of magictthat like corresponds to like. In other words, it was believed that hurting a picture of a person would result in real harm to the person, or eating food that looked like a particular body organ would be beneficial to that organ. Another important natural philosophy in the history of Chinese medicine was the doctrine of the Five Phases or Elements (wu-hsing), which involved the categorizing of natural phenomena, in particular water, fire, metal, wood, and soil into five separate lines of correspondence [25]. The initial application of these philosophies to medicine was characterized by a number of different schools with different theories, many of them apparently contradicting each other (e.g., supporters of the Five Phases doctrine rejected the yin/yang concept) [26]. Even in the one book, virtually side by side, there could be guidelines based on seemingly mutually exclusive (as seen through Western eyes) patterns of knowledge. For example, do the terms hsin (heart), kan (liver), and p'i (spleen) refer to anatomical structures or abstract functional systems? In the Chinese medical literature there is reference to both, and so neither is \"correct.\" These problems arose because there was primarily a reliance on subjective perceptions and no system for acquiring and recording information objectively. The early understanding of health and illness in China was derived almost entirely from analogical conclusions and not anatomical evidence [27-29]. It was not until the eighteenth century that it began to be acknowledged that a conception of function is of no use without an understanding of actual structure. Surgery was prohibited for a long time in China since it was regarded as unacceptable to open the body in this way [30]. It is important to remember that acupuncture arose at a time when there was no understanding of modern physiology, biochemistry, or healing mechanisms. If a person was sick and treated with acupuncture, and he improved, it was assumed that the treatment had caused the improvement. There was no formal study of diseases and their natural history, and no attempt was made to determine whether the person would have improved without the treatment. With no scientific basis available to determine the success or failure of treatment, the two events\u2014giving a treatment and symptom improvement\u2014were assumed to be causally related and, in this way, many specific treatments, including acupuncture, have been passed on untested to this day. The Early 1900s By the early twentieth century Western science came to be regarded as fundamental to China's future development, but in the eyes of many this created a conflict with the desire to preserve what was considered uniquely Chinese [31]. The dominant reformist view was that to retain Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) \"as is\" was equivalent to saying that modern scientific medicine was only for foreigners and must be denied to the Chinese [32]. Science, it was argued, was universal and belonged to China as much as the rest of the world. The distinction was not between Chinese and Western medicine, but rather between scientific and unscientific medicine. TCM was not to be rejected outright, but should be examined using the methods of science [33]. The early Chinese Communist Party, in particular, expressed considerable antipathy toward TCM, ridiculing it as superstitious, irrational, and backward [34]: Our men of learning do not understand science; thus they make use of yin-yang signs and beliefs in the five elements to confuse the world....Our doctors do not understand science: they not only know nothing of human anatomy, but also know nothing of the analysis of medicines; as for bacterial poisoning and infections they have not even heard of them....We will never comprehend the ch'i even if we were to search everywhere in the universe. All of these fanciful notions and irrational beliefs can be corrected at their roots by science [35]. In practice this meant that TCM techniques, such as acupuncture, became marginalized and were mostly restricted to the rural areas [36-38] Medical journals made little mention of TCM at this timetduring the period 1927-36 there was not a single paper on acupuncture published in the Chinese Journal of Physiology. Mao Tse-Tung and the Cultural Revolution It was left to Mao Tse-tung to save TCM, including acupuncture, by casting it into the political arena [39-42] The era of Mao Tse-tung saw a resurgence of interest in TCM as a result of: - Mao's personal involvement. (Interestingly, though, Mao is reported to have rejected TCM when he was sick: \"even though I believe we should promote Chinese medicine, I personally do not believe in it. I don't take Chinese medicine....\" [43] - The need to provide medical care to a large rural population. When the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, China was an unhealthy place, and the rural areas were particularly poorly serviced. There were few Western doctors, and most of these were caring for the wealthy or foreigners. - The Party's desire for increased power and control. By 1968 the Ministry of Public Health had become largely irrelevant, and most of the pre-Cultural Revolution leaders had been removed and replaced with army representatives. Decision-making power resided almost entirely with Party leaders. Acupuncture and other traditional therapies such as herbal medicine were powerful political tools and were used to judge support for the Cultural Revolution [44,45]. At one stage, the head of the North-East Public Health Board was publicly denounced for expressing opposition to TCM, and the First Vice Minister who had been the Health Care leader since the 1930s \"confessed\" in the People's Daily to having also opposed it. The reason for his opposition was because he was \"divorced from Party leadership.\" [46] Doctors and patients came under considerable political pressure to use traditional techniques, and critics were harshly treated. This pressure also impacted upon the medical literature, with the Chinese Medical Journal being replaced in October 1966 by a frankly political journaltChina's Medicinetwhose banner included the words \"official organ of the Chinese Medical Association.\" [47] The editorial of the first edition proclaimed: \"We will hold still higher the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung's thought, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and continuously advance the revolutionization of our ideology and work so that we may better serve the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world.\" [48] After the Chinese Medical Journal was recommenced in 1973, this policy of publishing material of a political nature continued [49,50]. It was only after the demise of the \"Gang of Four\" in 1976 that this emphasis was discarded and there appeared for the first time revelations about the impact that the political climate had had on medical practice. In 1987, in a paper on the history of the Chinese Medical Journal, this period was reviewed: \"It is sad to recollect the gloomy days of the 'Cultural Revolution,' which lasted 10 years starting in 1966. What happened to the Journal? CMJ was replaced by China's Medicine, which appeared from 1966 to 1968, filled with political documents, but very few medical papers....Although our Journal resumed publication in 1975, many authors still started their scientific articles with superfluous political sloganeering....Low quality papers were also accepted. Fortunately, normalcy was gradually restored in the Journal after 1979.\" [51] In China today, Western medicine and biomedical science predominates, but there are still many clinics offering purely TCM, and an increasing number offering both Western and Chinese medicine. As was the case in the early part of the twentieth century, there are calls for objective scientific evaluation of past claims [52,53]. Interestingly this is consistent with Mao's teaching, as he called for the modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine [54] and urged the Chinese to \"uncover the treasure house and raise its standards.\" [55] Assessing Acupuncture Assessing acupuncture within the Western scientific framework is a difficult task. As noted earlier, there are a number of different streams of thought in the historical literature, and these came to coexist even though they may appear to us today to be \"contradictory.\" [56] In setting out to scientifically evaluate acupuncture, which approach is to be selected for study, and why? Regardless of the number of points or \"vessels\" accepted, the consistent belief underlying most forms of acupuncture is that specific needling results in a specific effect. Thus, evidence supporting acupuncture must support the view that it is a separate and distinct entitytthat it does in fact exert an effect as a result of needling specific points on the body. There must be evidence that insertion of needles at random points on the body does not exert the same effect as specific needling. This matter is crucial. Proponents of traditional Chinese acupuncture claim that it takes many years of specialized training to be able to identify the specific acupuncture needling sites. If an equivalent effect is seen when a needle is inserted in the same way anywhere away from the specific site that the theory requires, this refutes the theory. It would also be useful for authors of papers on acupuncture to describe their preferred approach. Which description of the vessels is being used\u201411 or 12, connected or not connected\u2014and how many points are there? Why has this particular model been chosen in preference to the alternatives? What additional information, such as weather conditions, season, time of day, patient pulse (all required according to the Huang-ti nei-ching) has been included or excluded? The scientific assessment of acupuncture can proceed only when this information is provided and its source is declared. Modern pain research has demonstrated it is possible to achieve an analgesic effect by stimulating the body in certain ways, such as by the use of cold, heat, or electrical current [57]. One use of the latter is the technique of transelectrical nerve stimulation (TENS). These forms of stimulation are referred to as \"counterirritant\" techniques, or alternatively \"hyperstimulation analgesia.\" [58] The analgesic effect of these techniques is felt to be a physiological phenomenon in which the transmission of pain signals from one site or area is inhibited by the application of another noxious stimulus at a separate site, which may be remotely situated [59-64]. If acupuncture is a distinct entity it should be possible to demonstrate a distinction between its effect and that of other counterirritants. Early Days in the West The early 1970s were a period during which visits to China were popular, and these usually involved demonstrations of the almost miraculous effectiveness of acupuncture (such as major operations supposedly performed with only acupuncture anesthesia). These visits were then written up in Western medical journals more as journalistic pieces than as critical scientific reviews [65-67]. The rapid increase in popularity of acupuncture in the West followed on from the reports of these visits, and it had captured the public's imagination long before scientific studies began to question the validity of the anecdotes. An excellent example of this phenomenon, and a reminder of the importance of objective testing, is a published review of the use of acupuncture in sensorineural hearing loss [68]. This paper describes well how easily an unproven remedy may be unquestioningly promoted and how scientific assessment usually occurs as an afterthought. It describes the following process: (a) A visit to China by a well-known, and respected, ear-nose-and-throat specialist. (b) Demonstrations for this person of apparent cures effected by acupuncture. No inquiry made as to whether the patients \"cured\" had had pre- and posttreatment audiometric testing. (c) Return to the U.S., whereupon reports of cures began to reach the public via the media, particularly popular newspapers and magazines. (d) Public demand for the treatment to be made available as a result of the media reports of these cures, and the apparently high success rates being achieved by trained local practitioners. (e) The lack of objective scientific evidence for the reported cures is noted with concern, and research is conducted. (f) Formal studies show that acupuncture has no effect upon hearing levels of individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. The specialist who originally traveled to China, and wrote of the remarkable demonstrations he saw there, wrote the following just three years later: It is a tragic mistake to take a childtor an adult for that mattertfor acupuncture treatment for neurosensory deafness to any of the so-called acupuncture centers. There has not been one case of improvement demonstrated audiometrically, when a child or any deaf patient was tested before undergoing treatment and then afterwards by any reputable otologist. There have only been unreliable and perhaps planted testimonials [69]. Acupuncture Research Carefully designed and conducted scientific studies have so far failed to demonstrate that the use of traditional Chinese acupuncture is associated with more effective pain relief than either placebo or counterirritant stimulation such as TENS [70-93]. Many of these trials have compared \"real\" acupuncture (needles inserted according to one of the traditional theories) and \"sham\" acupuncture (needles inserted at other sites which, in some cases, were sites that the traditional theory said were least likely to reduce pain)\u2014with no difference in effectiveness found [94-99]. Since many of the studies were conducted with the cooperation and participation of professionals trained in that particular method of traditional acupuncture, it is insufficient to dismiss them as a part of some imaginary anti-alternative conspiracy. It is accepted that there are modern theories that go part of the way to explaining the analgesic action of counterirritant techniques such as TENS [100-109], though it must be noted that not all studies confirm that these have an effect over and above placebo [110-112]. What is becoming clear is that it is the stimulation itself that is important, and the available evidence fails to support the view that acupuncture has an action or effect that is separate to that seen with these other techniques. Some modern practitioners, in view of such evidence, have abandoned the ancient theories, including the vessels/meridians and even the acupuncture points. The British practitioner Felix Mann has been noted to observe wryly that if the modern texts are to be believed there is \"no skin left which is not an acupuncture point.\" [113] This is one response to the scientific examination of acupuncture, but the technique is not without its risks [114-120], and one could justifiably ask why, if equally effective techniques are available that do not involve puncturing the skin, do we continue to use this procedure? \"Viewed in this way acupuncture is an elaborate but unnecessarily complicated means of achieving analgesia when a clinically safer and easier method is available.\" [121] Low-level laser acupuncture is used by an increasing number of practitioners and, if effective, would be a useful noninvasive alternative. Unfortunately for users (and recipients) of this technique, the evidence supporting its use is pretty much nonexistent [122-124] There is also no evidence to support the view that acupuncture is of use in various systemic disorders\u2014e.g., asthma [125,126], arthritis [127-130], and psoriasis [131]\u2014and its use in such situations should be halted until such time as evidence is available. Animal Acupuncture Supporters of acupuncture sometimes refer to studies in animals claiming that these clearly demonstrate an analgesic effect, and since animals are not suggestible, the placebo effect is excluded. It is not the intention of this article to review this area in detail, but animals having acupuncture are often restrained in some way, and it is well described that when animals are restrained, they can develop anaesthesia due to fear and catalepsytthe so-called still reaction [132,133]. In addition, many of the animal studies do not compare \"real\" and \"sham\" acupuncture and provide no details as to the source of the acupuncture points used. Some animal species may have a physiological response to counterirritant stimulation similar to that of humans. As is the case for studies in humans, no useful information can be gleaned from research in animals that does not control for this possibility. Conclusion We have a more detailed knowledge of the human body than when acupuncture was first described, and since that time many of its beliefs have been examined closely. From a Western scientific viewpoint we can now confidently state: - The concept of ch'i has no basis in human physiology. - The vessels, or meridians, along which the needling points are supposedly located, have not been shown to exist and do not relate to our current knowledge of human anatomy. - Specific acupuncture points have not been shown to exist\u2014as noted earlier, different acupuncture charts give different numbers and locations of points. Scientific research has failed to confirm traditional Chinese acupuncture as a separate entity, and it appears to be just one of many \"counterirritant\" techniques demonstrated to have a mild analgesic effect. As it is an invasive technique, and safer means are available to achieve the same effect, how is its ongoing use to be justified? Further research may shed a different light on acupuncture, but until then: - The public should have access to accurate information about acupuncture's current scientific status. There is a marked difference between the claims of some practitioners of acupuncture and the findings of the clinical research. - Those who are claiming that traditional acupuncture is a distinct entity need to demonstrate this by conducting well-controlled trials and submitting the results for peer review. - There is a need for scientifically rigorous studies of the effectiveness of acupuncture in a range of \"systemic\" conditions. Until these are performed, acupuncture should not be used in these conditions. - Acupuncture should not be offered without full informed consenttpatients must be advised of acupuncture's scientific status, the availability of less invasive alternatives, and its possible adverse effects. The need for more research, and research of a higher standard, has been stressed by authors of previous reviews of acupuncture [134-142]. References - Unschuld PU.

Terry Chappell](https://quackwatch.org/cases/fdawarning/rsch/chappell/) Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research 1401 Rockville Pike Rockville MD 20852-1448 Warning Letter MAR - 9. 2000 L. Terry Chappell, M. D., Secretary Great Lakes College of Clinical Medicine IRB 122 Thurman Street Post Office Box 248 Bluffton, Ohio 45817 Dear Dr. Chappell: From November 16 to December 1, 1999, Mr. Hugh McClure Ill, an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), inspected the Great Lakes College of Clinical Medicine (GLCCM) Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Terry Chappell, M. D., Secretary Great Lakes College of Clinical Medicine IRB 122 Thurman Street Post Office Box 248 Bluffton, Ohio 45817 Dear Dr. Chappell: From November 16 to December 1, 1999, Mr. Hugh McClure Ill, an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), inspected the Great Lakes College of Clinical Medicine (GLCCM) Institutional Review Board (IRB). The purpose of this inspection was to determine if the IRB's procedures for the protection of human subjects comply with FDA regulations, published in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 50 and 56 [21 CFR 50 and 561. A copy of the list of Inspection Observations (FDA Form 483) left with you at the end of the inspection is enclosed, and is referenced below. Our inspection noted the following deficiencies: 1. Failure to prepare detailed written procedures for conducting the review of research, including periodic review. [21 CFR 56.1 O8(a), 56.11 5(a)(6) A. There are no detailed instructions as to how the IRB is to operate. The document titled, \"Basic Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects for The Great Lakes College of Clinical Medicine\" does not constitute detailed written procedures. Simply restating or rewording the federal regulations does not meet the requirement for written procedures. The regulations require that the IRB shall adopt and follow written procedures for conducting its review of research. The procedures should describe the IRB organization, how many voting members make up the IRB, how IRB members are selected, explicitly outline how applications are processed, who will receive pre-meeting materials to review, how the review is to be conducted, how decisions are made, what criteria are used, to determine the basis of approval of research proposals, the frequency of continuing review, how continuing review is conducted, how controverted issues are decided, and describe how records must be maintained to fulfill federal requirements. The written procedures should explicitly define how the IRB will consider research proposed by IRB members, and how the IRB will avoid conflict of interest in its reviews. B. The procedures for conducting periodic review are not adequate. Written procedures should describe in detail the following aspects of IRB continuing review operations: how and when renewal notices are sent to clinical investigators, how administrative staff processes interim reports, how periodic reports are discussed, the voting method the IRB will use for continuing reviews, and IRB follow-up activities in the event of a lack of response or an incomplete response. The procedures should specify how the IRB will document its actions for ensuring that progress reports are submitted and reviewed at the specified time intervals. The content of progress reports should be described in detail so that clinical investigators will provide the IRB with interpretable periodic reports. For example, Dr. Royal submitted approximately 50 pages of individual subject information with no summary of adverse events, risks, or benefits for IRB consideration in a periodic report. These data are not readily interpretable by the IRB, and therefore do not provide a periodic report which is meaningful for the IRB's determination as to whether the study should continue, be modified, or terminated. C. Written procedures should describe how the IRB will determine when an investigation involves an investigational product subject to FDA regulation. The IRB's \"Project/Protocol Information form for submission of research protocol for review\" does not request information to determine whether the research involves a product regulated by FDA, and the IND or IDE number associated with the investigational drug, biologic, or device. The IRB also does not confirm whether the clinical investigator appropriately concluded whether an IND or IDE is required. The IRB should have a mechanism in place to contact FDA to discuss proposed research if the IRB is unsure whether an IND or IDE is required. The IRB should not rely solely on a clinical investigator's interpretation of FDA requirements. See item 5A, below. D. Written procedures should describe how the IRB will determine when an investigation involves a significant risk device. E. The IRB should develop procedures for incorporating revisions to proposed research and for notifying the full lRB of those revisions. Written procedures should describe how the IRB will assure that studies \"approved\" pending modifications are not initiated before the IRB accepts the modified documents. F. Written procedures should describe the extent to which the IRB will review web site advertisements for studies approved by the IRB. information on web sites is considered advertising. G. The written procedures should explain the role of the IRB Chair. The minutes of the meetings conducted on September 20, 1997, noted that the IRB Secretary, Dr. Chappell, chaired the meeting even though Dr. Carter was in attendance. In addition, Dr. Chappell conducted the expedited review of at least one study; see item 10, below. Please comment in your reply. H. There are no written procedures to describe how adverse reaction reports are reviewed, by an \"expedited\" process or by the full IRB. There are no written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the appropriate institution officials and FDA of the following: i. Any unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others. ii. Any instance of serious or continuing noncompliance with FDA regulations or the requirements or determinations of the IRB. iii. Any suspension or termination of IRB approval. The IRB procedures should define whether the IRB will review proposed research to be conducted only in foreign countries, and whether there should be additional procedures when the proposed research is only conducted out of the United States. The IRB approved the study titled \"Induced Malaria as Therapy for HIV Infection\" conducted in China. The IRB did not review the Chinese translation of the protocol or consent form, and has no information about how subjects and malaria parasite donors are recruited and screened. See item 2, 6, and 11, below. K. The written procedures should describe how the IRB will review proposed research and proposed consent forms for information regarding the charging of study subjects for investigational products under FDA jurisdiction. The information should also be provided to clinical investigators. FDA prohibits charging for investigational drugs and biologics unless specifically approved with the limitations described in 21 CFR \u00a7 312.7. The limitations for charging for investigational devices are set forth in 21 CFR \u00a7 812.7. L. The IRB should consider requiring investigators to include the IRB approval date on consent forms to assure that the current consent form is used when the original consent form has been amended. This is not required by regulation, but it is considered to be a good practice. 2. Failure to consider community attitudes and cultural backgrounds. [21 CFR \u00a7 56.107(a) ] The IRB reviewed and approved the study titled \"Induced Malaria as Therapy for HIV Infection\" conducted only in China. There is no documentation as to how the IRB considered the local community attitudes or cultural attitudes towards two of the significant aspects of the research: the direct injection of blood from one person into another person, and that the subject will be administered live malaria parasites. Please explain how the IRB determined that this research was acceptable for Chinese citizens. Would the IRB's approach have been different if the research was conducted in the United States? 3. Failure to include at least one IRB member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. [21 CFR \u00a7 56.107(d) ] The regulation states that an IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution. The \"GLCCM IRB Membership List 1999\" identifies that the following individuals are \"non-members\": Effie Buckley, R.N.; James Carter M.D.; George Kindness, Ph.D.; Barbara Faber, J.D.; and Frances Greenway. We deem these individuals to be affiliated with GLCCM for the following reasons: Dr. Carter is the IRB Chair, and his curriculum vitae states that he was elected to Life membership in the Great Lakes Association of Clinical Medicine. Ms. Barbara Faber is the spouse of William Faber, D.O., a scientific member of the IRB. Ms. Buckley is employed by F. Timothy Gilford, M.D., who is a scientific member of the IRB. Ms. Greenway is employed by Theodore Rozema, M. D., who is a scientific member of the IRB. As employees of IRB members who are also members of the Great Lakes Association of Clinical Medicine, Ms. Buckley and Ms. Greenway have connectors to the IRB which could influence their consideration of proposed research. Although they may not serve in the role of nonaffiliated member, they may continue to serve as IRB members. Mr. Bob L. Smith is also identified as a nonaffiliated member. Mr. Smith's employer is a laboratory contracted to perform laboratory analyses for at least one study approved by GLCCM. The employer's web site also provides information about upcoming GLCCM conferences. This employer/employee relationship constitutes an affiliation to GLCCM. Mr. Smith may continue to serve as an IRB member, but he cannot be considered to be nonaffiliated with the institution. Also see item 4B, below. Given that, by charter, the IRB will review only protocols proposed by GLCCM members, please explain in detail how you will recruit, train, and include members who have no affiliation with GLCCM. 4. Failure to insure that research is reviewed free from conflict of interest. [21 CFR \u00a7 56.107(e) ] IRB members did not always exclude themselves from deliberation and voting on their own research projects, and on projects for which they have a financial interest. The following are examples: A. IRB member Dr. George Kindness participated in deliberations, made the motion to approve, and/or voted on the following studies in which he was personally involved: i. \"Stimulated Autologous Immune Serum and Autologous Tumor Vaccine in the Treatment of Refractory Solid Tumors (GAT).\" Dr. Kindness conducted the preliminary review, made the motion to approve, and voted on the study. Dr. Kindness' business is the laboratory integrally involved in the study. The IRB concluded that additional laboratory tests were to be used to monitor the results. ii. \"Multi-Centered Project #M019 - Investigational Proposal for the Study of AM-2.\" Dr. Kindness' business was involved in the study. iii. Dr. Kindness chaired and voted on modifications to the project titled, \"Multi-Centered Clinical Registry on EDTA Chelation Therapy and Cardiovascular Disease\" even 'though his business would perform all study-related laboratory tests. B. IRB member Mr. Bob Smith made the motion to approve the study submitted by Dr. Kotsanis titled, \"Use of Secretin to Remediate Autism, ADD, ADHD, and PDD\" during the meeting held on November 20, 1998. Mr. Smith is employed by the Great Smokies Laboratories, which is identified in the protocol as the laboratory to perform protocol-required tests. 5. Failure to exercise authority to require modification in (to secure approval) or disapprove all research activities covered by these regulations. [21 CFR \u00a7 56.109(a) ] A. The IRB does not assure that studies subject to FDA regulation are conducted under an investigational new drug application (lND) orinvestigational new device exemption (IDE). Research that is subject to FDA oversight must be performed under an effective IND or IDE, unless the IRB determines that a device study poses a non-significant risk (NSR).In this case, the sponsor and clinical investigator do not need an IDE; however, the study must comply with the abbreviated IDE requirements[21 CFR 812.2(b)]. In instances when an IND or IDE is necessary, the IRB should not approve research in the absence of an lND/lDE. The IRB appears to lack personnel who are knowledgeable about FDA requirements, and who can distinguish when proposed research must be performed under an IND or IDE. See item 1C, above. B. The meeting minutes of March 13, 1999, document that an IND was required for a study proposed by Dr. Hauser. The IRB approved the study even though an IND was not submitted. An IRB cannot supercede the authority of FDA to oversee the conduct of clinical studies involving investigational products. C. Current IRB practices are inadequate to assure that studies \"approved\" pending modifications are not initiated before the IRB accepts the modified documents. Review of meeting minutes shows that the IRB often recommends approval of a proposed clinical investigation pending certain revisions to be made by the investigator, but there is no procedure in place to confirm that required modifications have been completed. Also see item 8. below. D. The IRB reviewed the protocol submitted by Dr. Page, titled \"Gene Activated Therapy (GAT) for the Treatment of Cancer\" during the meeting held September 20, 1997. The IRB meeting minutes list six (6) \"suggestions\" regarding the study design and conduct, including the following: define the duration of the study and follow-up period, include lab tests to monitor the patients, define the centrifugation process, revise the consent form, consider adding an independent monitor, and provide additional background information. These so-called \"suggestions\" are actually important questions or modifications that should have been addressed in the design of the clinical study prior to, or as a condition of its approval. The IRB notified Dr. Page that the study was approved in a letter dated October 9, 1997. However, the six \"suggestions\" listed above were not included in the letter to Dr. Page. E. The IRB does not review the proposed research to assess whether the study involves charging subjects for investigational products under FDA jurisdiction. See item 1K, above. 6. Failure to require that information given to subjects as part of informed consent is in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR \u00a750.25. [21 CFR \u00a7 56.109(b) ] The IRB approved consent forms that do not meet federal regulations. The consent forms submitted by Dr. Page and Dr. Heimlich and approved by the IRBare representative examples: A. The consent form submitted with the original protocol titled \"Gene Activated Therapy (GAT) for the Treatment of Cancer\" was approved by the IRB on September 20, 1997. The consent form approved by the IRB is deficient for the following reasons (not a complete list): 1. The consent form is written in the form of a protocol and does not directly address the perspective of a potential study subject. 2. The consent form is written using technical language and medical jargon not readily understandable by a lay person. 3. Item 13 (first item 13 on page 2) implies that the safety of this investigational product has been established. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the investigational product is safe and effective. 4. The consent form does not contain the following required elements: i. An explanation of the procedures to be followed and the expected duration of the subject's participation. The procedures described in item 5 are vague as to the number of blood donations, the number, site, and timing of serum injections, who will perform the injections, the requirements of participants to travel, and other procedures. ii. The identity of whom to contact in the event of research-related injury to the subject. iii. An explanation of whom to contact for answers to questions about research subjects' rights. iv. A detailed explanation of the risks of participating in the research. The reference to risks is vague, confusing, and incomplete. 5. The paragraphs are not sequentially numbered, which could be confusing to potential study subjects. Some items are repeated. B. The study described in item 6A, above, was subsequently renamed \"Stimulated Autologous Immune Serum and Autologous Tumor Vaccine in the Treatment of Refractory Solid Tumors (GAT).\" The consent form provided by Dr. Page in the periodic report dated February 29, 1999 [sic]is deficient for the following reasons (not a complete list): 1. The consent states \"I understand ... that I may have a copy of this document.\" 21 CFR \u00a7 50.27(a) requires that a copy shall be given to the person signing the form. 2. The consent form does not contain the following required elements: i. An explanation of the procedures to be followed expected duration of the subject's participation. ii. A description of any benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research. The benefits of the research should be discussed separately from the alternate procedures which are described in the seventh paragraph. iii. The consent form states, \"Compensation for injuries as a result of participating in this study is not available except as may be required bylaw\" (emphasis added). It is not reasonable that prospective subjects would understand what is required by law. This phrase requires clarification. iv. The identity of whom to contact in the event of research-related injury to the subject. v. An explanation of whom to contact for answers to questions about research subjects' rights. C. The English version of the consent form for the study titled, \"Induced Malaria as Therapy for HIV Infection\" is deficient for the following reasons (this is not a complete list): 1. The consent form does not adequately describe the procedures to be followed. The consent form states, \"Natural infusion of malaria parasites will be administered on day 1.\" The actual procedure involves injection of blood from a malaria-infected person into the study subjects. There is no description of the steps taken to screen malaria parasite donors for pathogens. 2. The duration of the study is described as \"unlimited.\" The long-term risks of the study and the frequency of follow up are not defined. 3. The risks of receiving blood from another person are not described. The possibility of receiving blood-borne pathogens is not discussed. 4. There is no description of the consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research, such as during the stage of malaria infection. 5. There is no description of the lifelong risks associated with malarial infection, other than ruptured spleen and death. 6. The consent form lacks the identity of whom to contact in the event of research-related injury to the subject. 7. The consent form lacks an explanation of whom to contact for answers to questions about research subjects' rights. 8. Use of the wording \"You understand..\" is inappropriate. The subjects may certify that they understand the statements in the consent form and are satisfied with the explanation provided by consent process, but many will not comprehend the underlying scientific and medical significance of all the statements, nor are they in a position to judge whether the information provided is complete. Subjects should not be required to certify such understanding or completeness of disclosure. 9. The name of the clinical investigator is indicated only by \"XXXXXX. \"The IRB should know the identity of the person conducting the study. 10. The consent form contains exculpatory language in which the prospective subject is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence. 7. Failure to review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, and include members with primary concerns in scientific and nonscientific areas. [21 CFR 56. I08(c) ] A. The following research projects are examples of studies approved after members submitted their votes by facsimile transmission: \"Effects of Intravenous Secretin Infusion in Autistic and learning Compromised Individuals\" and \"Evaluation of the Effect of Immunotherapeutic Technique Enzyme Desensitization (EPD) for a Considerable Variety of Illness/Conditions/diagnostic Conditions.\" This is not a complete listing. These studies do not qualify for expedited review, and should be discussed and voted on at convened meetings. B. Research was reviewed and approved during two meetings (May 1, 1998, and May 7, 1999) when the requirement of a majority of voting members was not met because one or more IRB members abstained from voting. The IRB should have a sufficient number of members present at each meeting so that a majority is retained when IRB members are excluded from deliberations and voting due to conflicts of interest. C. The IRB reviewed and approved research at the meetings held May 1, 1998, and November 20, 1998, when the requirement of a majority of voting members was not met, with six (6) and eight (8) of 16 members in attendance, respectively. D. There was no nonscientific member present when research was approved on November 20, 1998. Mr. Bob Smith does not represent the viewpoint of a nonscientific member due to his education, experience, and employment in a scientific position. 8. Failure to notify investigators in writing of its decision to approve ordisapprove the proposed research activity, or of the modificationsrequired to secure IRB approval of the research activity. [21 CFR56.109(e)] The IRB does not consistently notify clinical investigators in writing of the IRB decision to approve or disapprove research, including continuing review. 9. Failure to conduct continuing review of research. [21 CFR 56.109(f)] A. Continuing review is not conducted at convened meetings of the full IRB, nor are periodic reports discussed in any manner. The periodic reports are reviewed by Dr. Chappell, IRB secretary. No determination is made by the IRB as to whether the study should be amended, terminated, or allowed to continue as originally approved. B. The IRB approved the continuation of studies even though the clinical investigator submitted incomplete periodic reports. For example, on August 31, 1999, the IRB approved the continuation of the Study titled, \"Low Level Laser Therapy for Treatment of Acute and Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain and Neurological Symptoms\" even though the clinical investigator did not report how many subjects had been enrolled. 10. Failure to properly identify and apply expedited review procedures. [21CFR \u00a7 56.llO(b) ] On December 22, 1997, the IRB Secretary approved the study titled, \"Clinical Relevance of Heavy Metal Removal by Calcium Disodium Ethyline Diamine Tetra Acetic Acid using an Appropriate Therapeutic Window in a Pediatric Population\" through 'expedited review.' Such use of the term 'expedited review' is not permitted by FDA regulations. The IRB procedures should ensure that the use of expedited review is limited to the approval of minor changes in ongoing research as described in \u00a7 56.110(b) and to the approval of categories of research listed in the enclosed Federal Register notice. 11. Failure to have procedures to determine that risks to subjects are minimized. [ 21 CFR \u00a7 56.111 ] A. The IRB did not determine whether medical devices used in studies pose a significant risk or nonsignificant risk to subjects. This determination was not made during IRB review of the following studies: \"Low Level LaserTherapy for Treatment of Acute and Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain and Neurological Symptoms,\" \"Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation,\" and \"Class 3a Laser as an Acupuncture Device.\" B. The IRB reviewed and approved the study titled \"Induced Malaria as Therapy for HIV Infection.\" The study includes the direct injection of blood from one person into the study subject, with vague descriptions of screening the malaria parasite donor for potential pathogens. Please explain how the IRB determined that risks to subjects were minimized and that the procedures are consistent with sound research design and do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk. 12. Failure to prepare adequate documentation of IRB activities. [21 CFR 56.115] FDA believes that the records that an IRB or an institution must maintain provide significant evidence of whether the procedures utilized by the IRB are adequately protecting the human subjects of the investigations that the IRB is reviewing. A. There is no documentation of the manner in which the periodic review of research is conducted. B. The current listing of IRB members does not objectively describe members' affiliations to the institution; see item 3, above. C. Meeting minutes do not always identify the title of the study which was discussed and voted on during a meeting. Many studies are referred to by acronyms, such as \"AMG Project\" or by the last name of the clinical investigator. For example, the minutes of March 26, 1996, identify only the \"W.A. Shrader project\" and the \"Paula Bickle project.\" D. Meeting minutes do not identify which \"updates\" have been received since the previous meeting. This is an example of the poor documentation of the IRB's periodic review of research. E. Meeting minutes do not consistently document the details of recommended changes to protocols and consent forms. F. Meeting minutes do not consistently record that previously requested protocol changes and/or clarifications have been received by the IRB. G. The IRB records do not document the IRB's determination that investigational devices are significant risk or non-significant risk devices. H. The minutes of the meeting of May 7, 1999, do not record the status of the IRB review of the study titled, \"Comprehensive Nutrient Supplementation as an Adjunct to Chelation Therapy.\" I. The file for the study titled, \"Induced Malaria as Therapy for HIV Infection \"does not contain the documents originally submitted in the study proposal, and does not contain a copy of the letter documenting when the study was initially approved by the IRB. J. The \"Project Check List\" for Dr. Page's study \"Stimulated Autologous Immune Serum and Autologous Tumor Vaccine in the Treatment of Refractory Solid Tumors\" does not document that the IRB conducted a review of an update on May 1, 1998. Based on the deficiencies found during this inspection, we have no assurance that your IRB procedures are adequately protecting the rights and welfare of the human subjects of research. For this reason, in accordance with 21 CFR 56.120(b)(l) and (2), and effective immediately, - no new studies that are subject to Parts 50 and 56 of the FDA regulations are to be approved by your IRB, and - no new subjects are to be admitted to ongoing studies that are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 until you have received notification from this office that adequate corrections have been made. These restrictions do not relieve the IRB of its responsibility for receiving and reacting to reports of unexpected and serious reactions and routine progress reports from ongoing studies. We acknowledge that the IRB promised to implement corrective actions. Please notify this office in writing, within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of this letter, of the actions you have taken or plan to take to bring the procedures of your IRB into compliance with FDA requirements. Please include a copy of any revised documents, such as written procedures, with your response. Any plans of action must include projected completion dates for each action to be accomplished. In addition, please submit a copy of the written notification from the IRB to each of the affected clinical investigators notifying them of this suspension. We will review your response and determine whether the actions are adequate to permit the IRB to resume unrestricted activities. Your failure to adequately respond to this letter may result in further administrative actions against your IRB, as authorized by 21 CFR 56.120 and 56.121. These actions include, but are not limited to, the termination of all ongoing studies approved by your IRB and the initiation of regulatory proceedings for disqualification of your IRB.

[Hide Full Content](#one-thousand-three-hundred-thirty-three) [Application and Affidavit for Seizure Warrant Re: John E. Curran](https://quackwatch.org/cases/fda/court/curran/affidavit1/) The Rhode Island Department of Health has suspended the health care practice of John E. Curran for falsely portraying himself as a physician and naturopath. Curran has operated as the Rhode Island Health Aid in Cranston, Rhode Island and the Northeastern Institute for Advance Natural Healing in Providence, Rhode Island. For several years, his now-defunct Web site stated that he has a Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) degree from the American Institute of Natural Healing; a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD) degree from the Southern College of Naturopathic Medicine; Doctor of Medicine (Alternative Medicine) (ND, AM) from the Southern Graduate Institute; and a Doctor of Medicine (MD) from the St. Luke School of Medicine.

Curran for falsely portraying himself as a physician and naturopath. Curran has operated as the Rhode Island Health Aid in Cranston, Rhode Island and the Northeastern Institute for Advance Natural Healing in Providence, Rhode Island. For several years, his now-defunct Web site stated that he has a Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) degree from the American Institute of Natural Healing; a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (NMD) degree from the Southern College of Naturopathic Medicine; Doctor of Medicine (Alternative Medicine) (ND, AM) from the Southern Graduate Institute; and a Doctor of Medicine (MD) from the St. Luke School of Medicine. The site also claimed that he was \"certified\" by Brown University Medical School, Duke University Medical School, and Harvard University Medical School. However: (a) none of his \"degrees\" came from accredited institutions; (b) medical schools do not \"certify\" people; and (c) none of his credentials provide a legal basis to treat patients. One of his diagnostic programs was a \"Complete Body Assessment\" that cost $950 and included \"an in-depth consultation regarding your health history and nutritional diet, BioMeridian Stress Assessment, Food testing (250 foods), Iridology, Chinese Tongue and Nail Analysis, Urinalysis, Blood Oxygen Level Testing, Heart and Lung evaluations, and a Full Body Thermography Scan.\" His \"treatment\" offerings included the use of several quack devices. The document below summarizes information from five of Curran's former patients and two government agents who posed as patients. Subsequently, government agents raided, closed, and confiscated equipment and records from Curran's office. Documents in the case suggest that Curran is likely to be prosecuted for mail and wire fraud. [Naturowatch has additional information]. United States District Court DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND |In the Matter of the Seizure of | Bank Account Number 1452-751-0 Citizens Bank of Rhode Island c/o Legal Department 100 Sockonosset Road Cranston, RI |APPLICATION AND AFFIDAVIT | FOR SEIZURE WARRANTCASE NUMBER: 1:05-M-04M I, Jason A. Simonian, being first duly sworn, depose and state as follows: I. Introduction 1. I am a Special Agent with the United States Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA/OCI), and have been so employed since September of 1997. I am assigned to the Boston, Massachusetts Resident Office. Prior to my employment with FDA, I conducted criminal investigations as a Special Agent with the U.S. Department of Labor for eight (8) years. I have attended numerous federal agency sponsored training courses and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I am responsible for conducting criminal investigations involving violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal statutes enforced by FDA. 2. This affidavit is submitted in support of a search warrant for The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, which operates at the address of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island. 3. This affidavit is also submitted in support of a seizure warrant for Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0. The account constitutes evidence of the commission of a criminal offense, or constitutes contraband, fruits of crime, or things otherwise criminally possessed within the meaning of Fed.R. Crm. P. 41(b), and is subject to forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(a)(l)(A) and, therefore, may also be seized pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(b). 4. As part of my duties as a Special Agent with FDA/OCI, I am currently investigating allegations of the following illegal activity: (1) Mail Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71341, which makes it a federal crime for a person, having devised or intended to devise a scheme to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, for the purpose of executing such scheme, to place or cause to be placed in any post office or authorized depository for mail or to take or receive there from any matter or thing; and, (2) Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71343, which makes it a federal crime for a person, having devised or intended to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, to transmit or cause to be transmitted by wire, radio or telephone communications in interstate commerce any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice. 5. In addition, I am investigating allegations of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71956(a)(l)(A)(i), which makes it a federal crime to knowingly conduct and attempt to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate commerce which involve the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, in this case, Mail and Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71341 and 1343, with the intent to promote the carrying on of said specified unlawful activity. To that end, I am seeking a seizure warrant for forfeiture of Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(a)(l), which provides for the seizure of any and all property which was involved in the transactions constituting money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. 6. FDA is the agency of the United States Government charged with the responsibility of protecting the American public by enforcing the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7301-397, to ensure that, among other things, drugs and medical devices sold for use by or upon humans and animals are safe and effective and bear labeling containing true and accurate information. 7. Since April of 2004, your affiant and investigators from the FDA/OCI Task Force, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CID), and individuals from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) have conducted the investigation detailed below, which has established probable cause to believe that the above-described unlawful activity has been and is being perpetrated by and at the direction of Dr. John E. Curran, a Naturopath whose practice, The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, operates at the address of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island. 8. The information set forth in this affidavit is based on information obtained by your affiant and from other investigators involved in this case, interviews conducted by your affiant and other investigators, review of documents, and two separate undercover meetings with John Curran. The affidavit does not contain every fact known to me with respect to this investigation. Rather, it contains those facts that I believe to be necessary to establish probable cause for issuance of a search warrant for the premises of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, and for the issuance of a seizure warrant for Citizen's Account No. 1452-751-0. 11. II. Premise to be searched 9. This affidavit is offered in support of a search warrant for the business premises of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing, which is operated by John E. Curran. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing is located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island 10. One Richmond Square is a three-story brick office complex. A marking of One Richmond Square is located above the main entrance of the building. The premise to be searched is located within One Richmond Square, at Suite 310E, which is located on the third floor of the complex. The entrance door to the office is identified as \"310 E\". 11. Suite 301E, all of which is to be searched, is described as follows: Upon entering the suite there is a patient waiting area. To the right is a bathroom and to the left is a half door, which leads to the \"Pharmacy\" area. Supplement stock is in view on the shelves in the pharmacy area. A doorway, which leads from the waiting room to the main interior office, is located adjacent to the bathroom door. To the right of the main interior office is a room with \"therapy\" equipment. Across from that room is John Curran's office. Located on one side of Curran's office is a \"thermal imaging room\" and on the other side of the office is a room where exams are conducted. There is also door located next to the desk in the main interior office. It is unknown where this doorway leads, A diagram of the suite is attached as part of Attachment A. 111. The Scheme A. Summary 12. The investigation has revealed that John Curran induces patients to purchase expensive treatment plans and for alleged nutritional or therapeutic materials in order to cure them of alleged actual or imminent diseases that Curran claims to have diagnosed. Although he is not qualified to diagnose diseases, Curran advises his patients, among other things, that: (1) they have live parasites in their blood stream; (2) that they have a severely reduced number of blood cells; (3) that they have certain deficient \"body functions;\" (4) that they have worms in their blood; (5) that they have holes in their blood; and (6) that they have a life threatening disease. Curran provides the majority of his diagnoses by performing a \"live blood analysis\" or a \"bio-meridian test.\" As is further described below, neither test is designed to diagnose disease. 13. Upon providing a patient with the diagnoses, Curran promotes and sells the use of his treatment programs or alleged pharmacological materials, the cost of which ranges from approximately $200 to $10,000. Curran accepts cash, checks or credit cards, or, alternatively, promotes a credit service provided by GE Capital that will provide his patients with a line of credit to purchase his services. The line of credit is referred to as a \"Credit Care Card.\" Examples of what he sells are products referred to as \"E-water\", and a super \"green drink.\" Curran claims that E-water is therapeutic water, but the investigation has determined it is regular distilled water that Curran labels as \"E-water.\" The \"green drink\" appears to be a compilation of ingredients with no therapeutic value. B. The Practice of Medicine 14. Under Rhode Island state law (R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 5-37-I), the \"practice of medicine\" includes: the practice of allopathic and osteopathic medicine. Any person is regarded as practicing medicine . . . who holds himself or herself out as being able to diagnose, treat, operate, or prescribe for any person ill or alleged to be ill with disease, pain, injury, deformity or abnormal physical or mental condition, or who either professes to heal, offer or undertake, by any means or method to diagnose, treat, operate, or prescribe for any person for disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical or mental condition. In addition, one who attaches the title MD, physician, surgeon, D.O., osteopathic physician and surgeon, or any other similar word or words or abbreviation to his or her name indicating that he or she is engaged in the treatment or diagnosis of the diseases, injuries or conditions of persons shall be held to be engaged in the practice of medicine. R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 5-37-1. 15. Curran is not a licensed physician. However, the investigation has determined that Curran claims to have received a medical degree from St. Luke's School of Medicine located in Liberia, Africa. In addition, he holds himself out in promotional materials as \"Dr. John Curran, N.D., M.D.\" In addition, in his promotional materials, Curran also boasts other academic degrees such as a doctorate in naturopathy from the American Institute of Natural Healing, a doctorate of naturopathic medicine from the Southern College of Naturopathic Medicine and continuing education certificates from Brown University and Harvard University. 16. As outlined below, although Curran is not a licensed physician and cannot legally practice medicine, it is part of his scheme to lead his patients to believe that he has diagnosed serious medical conditions that require immediate attention. However, in response to a complaint filed against him with the R.I. Board of Medicine, and in order to avoid the Board's jurisdiction, Curran's lawyer, A. David Tammelleo, in March of 2003, advised the Board he is not subject to their jurisdiction because he \"is not practicing nor purporting to practice medicine.\" 17. In the letter, Mr. Tammelleo also referenced R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14. Section 23-74-14 states in pertinent part that: All unlicensed health care practitioners shall provide to each unlicensed health care client prior to providing treatment a written copy of the unlicensed health care client bill of rights. A copy must also be posted in a prominent location in the office of the unlicensed health care practitioner. Reasonable accommodations shall be made for those clients who cannot read or who have communication impairments and those who do not read or speak English. The unlicensed health care client bill of rights shall include the following: (1) The name, unlicensed health care title, business address, and telephone number of the unlicensed health care practitioner; (2) The degrees, training, experience, or other qualifications of the practitioner regarding the unlicensed health care being provided, followed by the following statement in bold print: \"The state of Rhode Island has not adopted any educational and training standards for unlicensed health care practitioners. This statement of credentials is for information purposes only. Under Rhode Island law, an unlicensed health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis. If a client desires a diagnosis from a licensed physician, chiropractor, or acupuncture practitioner, or services from a physician, chiropractor, nurse, osteopath, physical therapist, dietician, nutritionist, acupuncture practitioner, athletic trainer, or any other type of health care provider, the client may seek such services at any time\" R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14 (emphasis added). 18. The investigation has revealed that, in compliance with R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14, Curran provides his clients with a document entitled \"Client Bill of Rights,\" in which he advises patients that he is not a licensed physician and which states that an unlicensed health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis. Despite his disclaimer, however, it appears that Curran's method of practice is to identify himself as \"Dr. Curran\" and to induce patients to believe that they are, or will become seriously ill, and that he can cure them or prevent disease. C. Naturopathy 19. According to the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, a licensed medical school located in Tempe, Arizona, Naturopathic Medicine is the philosophy of treating disease and restoring health using natural therapies. It strongly promotes prevention in health care and a non-invasive approach to treatment including: acupuncture and oriental medicine, homeopathy, botanical medicine, nutritional counseling, mind-body medicine, hydrotherapy and physical medicine. 20. Naturopathic physicians (NDs) attend a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical program and are educated in all of the same basic sciences as in conventional medical school. Studies concentrate on holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. Graduates sit for professional board exams to become licensed as naturopathic doctors within licensed states or as jurisdiction allows. 21. On his website, www.drcurran.com, Curran advises that Naturopathic Medicine \"is a distinct medical system of healthcare: an art, science, and practice of diagnosing and treating people and preventing disease. It honors clients as unique human beings, enabling them to take responsibility for their own health. It is based upon the belief that the body has an innate natural ability to heal itself when given the appropriate internal and external healing environment.\" 22. Curran advises his patients through promotional materials that he is a Board Certified and Licensed General Practitioner of Naturopathic Medicine from the District of Columbia. Your affiant has reviewed an application that Curran submitted to the District of Columbia for a license. It appears that Curran paid $150 for the application. He represented in the application that he attended the American Institute of Natural Healing and competed 2200 hours of course work and received a naturopath degree/certificate in 1998. However, your affiant is not aware of any record that Curran is a licensed naturopathic \"physician\" who has taken any board exams. D. St. Luke's Medical School 23. Your affiant has reviewed records from St. Luke's Medical School. Investigation by IRS/CID SA Ferraro identified a California based extension of St. Luke's School. In response to this investigation, St. Luke's provided SA Ferraro with a hand written response advising that the school has no records indicating that John Curran was ever a student at the college. SA Ferraro has advised your affiant that there is an ongoing federal investigation regarding the sale of fraudulent degrees with regard to St. Luke's School of Medicine. E. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing 24. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing is an active licensed corporation within the State of Rhode Island. It is also a member of the Better Business Bureau (BBB). A review of the company's BBB application showed that the company is engaged in \"alternative health care.\" John Curran, N.D. M.D. is listed as the Owner/Medical Director. Curran originally operated his business, then called Rhode Island Health Aid, at 743 Reservoir Ave., Cranston, RI. He moved the practice to his current Richmond Square address and changed the name of the business to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing in approximately July of 2002. F. Live Blood Analysis 25. Investigation by your affiant has determined that on April 10, 1997, John Curran, of 743 Reservoir Avenue, Cranston, Rhode Island, purchased a NuLife Sciences Laboratory Grade Research Microscope, Serial # 204134. The Microscope was sold to Curran by PSI Resource/NuLife Sciences, 2404 Vineyard Place, Boulder CO. Among other accessories, the device came with a Panasonic CCD Color Camera with transformer and microscope slides. The investigation has revealed that Curran uses the device to perform blood analysis and improperly diagnose disease. 26. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the term \"device\" means: an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is: (1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, (2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation's, treatment, or prevention's of disease, in man or other animals; or (3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(h). 27. Your affiant has made contact with numerous individuals who hold various positions within FDA for assistance in this investigation. I have met with Beth Griffin, Engineer/Investigator for the FDA-New England District and provided her with documentation regarding the NuLife Sciences Laboratory Grade Research Microscope. Griffin has advised me that the device is not cleared or approved by FDA for use as a medical device. 28. In addition, Curran knows that the analysis is not to be used for diagnoses. On June 9, 1998, Curran, on behalf of RI Health Aid, sent a letter to the RIDOH regarding the subject of Live Blood Evaluation. In the letter, Curran writes that \"[u]nder State and Federal Laws, people receiving services considered to be of an experimental research nature by the FDA/AMA must be informed of such. Nutritional live blood evaluation is of a nutritional nature and is not for a medical diagnosis, treatment, disease prevention, or health assessment. All evaluations are screenings for research purposes only.\" (emphasis added). Nonetheless, the investigation, as summarized below, has demonstrated that John Curran is utilizing this device in the diagnosis of disease, to include blood parasites, cancer, and white blood cell anomalies. G. BioMeridian Stress Assessment 29. Investigation by your affiant has determined that John Curran purchased a BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device from BioMeridian International. The BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device (which is also referred to as the Meridian Stress Assessment) is referred to as a \"galvanic device\" and cleared by FDA as a Class Il medical device for the measurement of the electrical resistance of the skin. Your affiant has reviewed sample printouts from the device and, in essence, they list different body systems and functions, such as heart, endocrine system, cellular metabolism and provide a reading for how each responds to the test. No galvanic skin response devices, including the BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device, are cleared or approved by the FDA for the use in the diagnosis of disease. Your affiant's investigation has determined that Curran uses this device in conjunction with the Live Blood Evaluation to provide diagnoses of diseases in patients, contrary to federal and state regulation. H. E-Water 30. Your affiant has reviewed the promotional pamphlet that John Curran provides to his clients regarding E-Water. On that document, Curran states that \"each drop of this water will refresh your body and increase your vitality. Homeopathy has proven that water has remarkable memory and capacity to store energy. This specially energized water contains the same synergistic healing properties as the water in Lourdes, France. - Dr. John E. Curran, N.D., M.D.\" 31. The document further claims that \"Body Balancing E-Water is uniquely charged water wherein the molecules spin in the reverse direction and emit electrical energy which your body's organs absorb to function at its optimal capacity. The elderly, adults, and children as well as animals and plants, can benefit dramatically from taking this E-Water. It is recommended for ALL ages. This water does not act as a stimulant.\" 32. Your affiant has spoken to David Uliss, Chief - Forensic Sciences, RIDOH and provided him with a copy of the E-Water pamphlet. Subsequent to examining the document, Dr. Uliss advised your affiant that the claims were \"ridiculous as a matter of science,\" advising that water molecules are constantly spinning in all directions and that the notion of providing a charge for organ absorption was \"absolutely without any scientific merit.\" I. The Machines 33. Your affiant is also aware that, as part of his sales pitch, Curran attempts to sell his patients a full treatment protocol that is to be performed by using certain machines, which have been described as follows: (1) hydrotherapy massage machine; (2) spectra collor spa system; (3) hyperbaric chamber; massager (5) ionic cleaner; (6) massage capsule; and (7) personal sauna with white plastic hoses. Each machine is discussed below in the context of Curran's representations about each to his patients or to an undercover agent. IV. Victims 34. As part of this investigation, your affiant and other investigators conducted interviews of the following former patients of Curran: RD: (In the interest of confidentiality of the patients, only the initials for each patient are included herein.) 35. In February of 2003, RD, a former patient of John Curran, provided a written complaint to the RIDOH regarding the treatment he had received from Curran. That statement provided the following information, in substance: 36. On September 30, 2002, RD went to see Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310E, for an initial consultation. Curran spent about a half -hour asking how RD was feeling. After the initial meeting, Curran asked RD to return the following week for some tests to see what Curran could find. During the follow-up visit, Curran performed the Meridian Stress Assessment on RD. Curran claimed that the procedure tested for \"food allergies\" and \"the body's vital functions.\" Curran presented RD with a computer printout of the foods RD was \"allergic\" to and told him that he was deficient on 55 of the 62 body functions that were tested. Curran performed a second test that involved getting a blood sample from RD1s finger. Through a microscope image of the alleged drawn blood, Curran showed RD what he called \"blood parasites\" and told RD that his body was infected with them. Curran advised RD that he was \"very sick\" and that he needed a complete detoxification, which would cost him $4,500. RD subsequently signed a contract for the program and began the treatment. 37. Curran's treatment called for RD to stay on a liquid diet that consisted only of a product identified by Curran as the \"Super Green Drink\" formula for a period of four (4) weeks. The Super Green Drink Formula is a powder that Curran manufactures and sells to his clients. RD's weight when he started the liquid diet was 149 lbs. Three (3) weeks and three (3) days later, RD's weight had dropped to 124 lbs. 38. When RD called Curran to tell him he was down to 126 Ibs., Curran indicated that he didn't care if RD lost another 25 pounds but advised that RD must stay on the diet, after which Curran proceeded to prescribe to him $208.33 worth of pills and other liquid formulas. It took RD over a year to get back to his present weight of 150 lbs. RD advised that he paid Curran a total of $3500. ML: 39. On August 11, 2004, ML, a former patient of John Curran, was interviewed by your affiant and provided the following information, in substance: 40. On July 22, 2004, ML had a complete medical assessment performed by Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, for which ML was charged $950.00. As part of that examination, Curran performed numerous tests including a Meridian Stress Assessment and Live Blood Analysis. ML advised that Curran introduced himself as \"doctor\" Curran and wore a name tag that read \"Dr. Curran.\" Additionally, ML advised that on the walls of his office Curran had four (4) certificates from various institutions including Harvard Medical School. 41. During the visit, ML stated that Curran told her that he had cured four (4) people who had Hepatitis C. After conducting the blood analysis test, Curran advised ML that she was infested with blood parasites and showed ML two slides that allegedly contained ML's blood. Curran pointed out \"worms and eggs\" that were ready to hatch within ML's blood. Curran told ML that she had \"only one good blood cell with the others being deformed.\" Upon completion of the Stress Assessment Test, Curran provided ML with a printout of the results, which indicated that ML had five (5) out of (62) bodily function readings that were \"good\", with the rest being \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" ML informed your affiant that she was surprised,at the results of her blood test because just a couple of weeks prior to her exam with Curran she had been to the hospital on an unrelated matter at which time a blood evaluation had been conducted and no abnormalities were found. 42. After providing ML with his results, Curran addressed a proper course of action. Curran took ML to a room in the office that contained various machines. Curran advised ML that using the machines was the \"fast cure\" to rid her of her parasite infestation. He proposed a treatment plan for $10,000.00 for a total of ten (10) visits which would allow her to use each of the machines. ML subsequently told Curran that the price was too expensive. Curran then stated that he would return to his office and formulate the necessary list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that ML would need to be cured. ML stated that, some time later, Curran returned to the patient room and provided ML with a list of items totaling $5,000.00. Curran also provided ML with an application for a Credit Care card, which, if approved, would provide her with financing for Curran's services. ML filled out the application for the card, but advised the office not to forward her application until she had a chance to discuss the matter with her husband. ML also provided Curran's office with a check for $600.00 as an initial payment for the items Curran had listed and advised Curran that she would return the next day to provide payment in full. ML stated that she felt very pressured at the time of her visit to buy the prescribed \"medications.\" 43. ML advised that after discussing her visit with her husband, and thinking about what had occurred during her visit, she felt as if she had been the victim of an attempted fraud. ML advised that she then contacted her bank (Sovereign Bank) and put a stop payment on the check she had provided to Curran. LM: 44. On September 27, 2004, Bruce McIntyre at the RIDOH interviewed LM, a former patient of John Curran. LM provided the following information, in substance: 45. LM went to see Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, after reading about him in a local health magazine. LM had her initial consultation with Curran on August 6, 2004. LM stated that she went to see Curran because she wanted to lose weight and stop smoking. After this initial consultation, Curran scheduled LM to come to the office for a complete medical assessment on August 13, 2004, for which LM was ultimately charged $950.00. LM advised that the medical assessment lasted between 4-5 hours. As part of the exam, Curran conducted several tests including a live blood analysis and a stress assessment test. Subsequent to taking a blood sample from LM's finger, Curran advised LM that she was infested with blood parasites and that the parasites had been in LM's system a long time and had become \"double-headed.\" After conducting the stress assessment, Curran produced a printout that he told LM indicated that she had four (4) out of (62) bodily functions that were good with the rest being \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" LM also informed that during her exam Curran told her that he had cured patients who had Stage IV Cancer. 46. Subsequent to advising her of his diagnosis, Curran provided LM with a list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that LM would need to take. Included on the provided list were a \"Super Green Drink\", a powder made by Curran that cost $1,195.00, and \"Dr. Curran's Unique Body Balancing E-Water\" that cost $45.00 per bottle and also was produced by Curran. In total, Curran charged LM $4,806.97. AD: 47. On September 27, 2004, LD, the mother of AD, met with a member of the RIDOH and filed a complaint, including a written statement, regarding the treatment her daughter had received from John Curran. LD provided the following information, in substance: 48. AD (age 24), who is temporarily living in San Diego, was diagnosed with Celiac Disease (gluten and wheat allergies) while living in California. AD came home to Rhode Island for a week and decided to seek another opinion regarding her illness. Dr. John Curran was recommended. Curran listed himself as an MD as well as an ND, and that convinced LD and AD to utilize his services. 49. On Tuesday, August 31, 2004, AD had an afternoon appointment with Curran. Curran initially had a technician perform what he referred to as a Full Body Medical Imaging Scan. Curran then explained to AD that there were many blood and other tests that he needed to be performed to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Curran asked AD to return on Saturday, September 4, to complete those tests. AD was scheduled to fly back to San Diego on Sunday the 5th and had other plans for Saturday. Curran stated that he would be in his office later in the evening on Tuesday the 31st and that he would wait for AD in order to complete the tests. AD asked her mother, LD, to accompany her to Curran's office for the evening appointment. 50. At the onset of that appointment, Curran explained his testing procedures, and AD and LD subsequently went in to the examining room where the tests would take place. Curran proceeded to perform his exam. As part of that exam, Curran pricked AD's finger tips, put blood samples on a glass slab, put that slab under the microscope and projected the \"living blood cells\" onto a monitor, enabling both AD and LD to view what he proceeded to diagnose. 51. Curran showed what he stated were \"parasites\" living in AD's blood cells. He said that her blood was infested with these parasites and that her immune system was so overworked trying to kill them on a daily basis that when other germs and bacteria entered her system, the immune system was too tired to fight. Curran also showed LD and AD \"white formations\" in the cells, which he said were \"holes\" in the blood. He also showed what the \"healthy\" color of blood cells should be and what you wouldn't want to see for coloration. Curran showed another view of AD'S cells and said they were tainted \"green,\" which was an indication of early cancer. Curran advised that this was the \"worst\" blood work he had ever seen and advised LD that she had to picture AD standing on the edge of a cliff. Curran indicated that if AD were not treated immediately, with drastic measures, AD would \"fall off the cliff' within one to two years. Curran also told AD that she had thyroid problems and a dysfunctional pituitary gland that were making her age three years to every one. LD advised investigators that she was \"devastated\" upon hearing the diagnosis. However, Curran told LD and AD that this diagnosis was reversible, informing that \"drastic measures were required for drastic situations.\" Curran claimed that he could cure AD with a very intensive ten-days of therapy. 52. Curran walked LD and AD into his therapy chamber and showed them a Hyperbaric Chamber, Hydrotherapy Massage Machine, and a Spectracolor Spa System. Curran stated that the theory behind the therapy was that he had to \"kill\" the parasites in her blood cells as quickly as possible with intensive heat, detoxify the body of nasty matter, supplement her diet with herbal treatments, and put her on a nutritional diet. Curran stated that the protocol would cost $10,000. Curran stated that he knew that LD and AD had a lot to digest but advised them \"not to lose sleep over it.\" Curran explained to LD and AD that they could have a credit application prepared right then and there to see if they qualified for the cost of treatment. Curran advised that many of his patients were not prepared to come up with money out of pocket and utilized the credit service. Curran provided LD with an application for a Creditcare card which LD filled out and which was immediately submitted by the office. LD was approved for the issuance of credit prior to her leaving the office. 53. At the conclusion of the exam, LD was presented with a bill in the amount of $1355.33 for all of the tests conducted that night. Curran suggested that AD call her boss in California to say that she was delaying her return and to delay her flight back for a couple of weeks. The next day, LD and AD were supposed to pick up a diet plan for AD, and AD was scheduled to begin therapy. LD wrote out a check for $1355.33 and left the office. 54. LD relayed Curran's diagnosis to her husband, ED, who suggested that AD see her primary care physician, Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah, prior to beginning treatment with Curran. On Thursday, September 2, 2004, AD met with Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah. AD informed her of everything Curran had said and showed her some of the test results. Dr. Jeremiah advised AD that she was the second of her patients who had visited Curran and who had been given a life-threatening diagnosis. Dr. Jeremiah subsequently conducted a full physical exam on AD, including blood work. 55. Your affiant has subsequently met with and spoken to Dr. Jeremiah, who advised your affiant that, with the exception of Celiac Disease, AD is a healthy 24-year-old with no indication of cancer or any other life-threatening illness. Her thyroid is normal, as is her pituitary gland. Dr. Jeremiah further informed your affiant that the only parasites that can be detected through blood work are those connected with malaria and that AD had not been exposed to malaria nor had any such symptoms. 56. LD informed investigators that she stopped payment on her check to Curran immediately and contacted her lawyer who forwarded a letter to Curran addressing this issue. The possible impact of the letter on this investigation is discussed below. 57. On October 19, 2001, your affiant and TFA Christopher Cardarelli met with LD at her residence. LD reiterated her statements previously made at the RIDOH. LD also added that during their time with Curran, Curran told LD that he had cured patients with Stage IV Cancer. (Curran made the identical claim to client LM). CR: 58. On December 13, 2004, your affiant interviewed CR, a former patient of John Curran, at CR's residence located in Sterling, Massachusetts. CR provided the following information, in substance: 59. On November 30, 2004, CR went to see John Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, after hearing about him from a work colleague. CR stated that he went to see Curran because he wanted to lose weight. Curran conducted a complete medical assessment exam for which CR was charged $950.00. CR advised that the exam lasted several hours. As part of the exam, Curran conducted several tests, including a live blood analysis and a stress assessment test. The first test Curran conducted was the blood analysis test. For that test, Curran took a blood sample from CR's finger which he placed on three glass slides. Curran placed the slides, one at a time, under a microscope that was hooked up to a computer monitor. Curran then reviewed the blood and advised CR that he had \"clumpy\" red blood cells. Curran further informed CR that his red blood cells had \"holes in them.\" Curran stated that CR's white blood cells had a \"glowing aura\" around them and pointed out \"inch worm\" like creatures moving around CR's blood. CR stated that, after pointing out each one of these conditions, Curran would exclaim \"that's not good\" or \"this doesn't look good.\" Curran also showed CR a pamphlet which had pictures of what \"healthy\" blood cells should look like and what one would not want to see. Curran's final diagnoses was that CR's immune system was fatigued and that he had a virus in his blood. 60. Subsequent to the blood analysis, Curran conducted a BioMeridian Stress Assessment test. After conducting test, Curran produced a printout that he told CR indicated that CR had three (3) out of (62) bodily functions that were good, with the rest being \"stressed\" or 'weakened.\" 61. After advising CR of his diagnosis, Curran provided him with a list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that CR would need to take to improve his health. Included on the list were the \"Green Drink\" formula and \"Dr. Curran's Unique Body Balancing E-Water.\" Additionally, Curran scheduled a machine therapy protocol for CR which was intended to \"pull the toxins out\" of CR's body and \"kill the virus\" in CR's blood. CR advised that he agreed to purchase both the supplements and treatment program suggested by Curran. 62. To help him finance his treatment, CR filled out a Credit Care card application which was provided to him by Curran's office manager and approved for credit while CR was still at Curran's office. At the conclusion of his appointment CR's Credit Care account was charged the sum of $6,719.08 for the exam, supplements and therapy treatment program. CR has subsequently contacted Curran's office and notified them that he had decided not be participate in the therapy program and requested that his Credit Care account be credited for the corresponding charge (2,995.00). CR advised that he was told by someone at Curran's office that they would make the credit, however, as of December 3, 2004, no such credit had been issued. V. Undercover Operation 63. In addition to the above-cited patients, and as part of this investigation, an undercover, monitored, operation was initiated as described below. A. Task Force Agent (TFA) Al Faella 64. On September 17, 2004, TFA Albert Faella, while working in an undercover capacity, went to Curran's office located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, for a previously scheduled exam. Your affiant has listened to a recording of that meeting as well as spoken to TFA Faella about that meeting which is summarized as follows: 65. As part of the exam, Curran pricked a blood sample from TFA Faella's finger and smeared the sample on three (3) individual glass sample slides. Curran subsequently requested a urine sample from TFA Faella for which TFA Faella had to exit the exam room. When TFA Faella returned with the requested urine sample, Curran was sitting in front of a microscope. TFA Faella sat in the chair next to Curran, looking at a monitor, which appeared to be wired to a camera mounted on the microscope. Curran appeared to TFA Faella to have a slide already in the microscope and pointed out to TFA Faella what his red and white blood cells looked like. Curran stated that the white blood cells should be perfectly round and proceeded to change the glass slide in the microscope. Curran tested the urine sample and stated that TFA Faella's urine was acidic at 5.0 which is completely acidic. Upon looking at the new slide, Curran stated that there was something wrong with TFA Faella's white blood cells because they were not shaped completely round and some were not fully-grown. Upon further examining the slide, Curran spotted what he called a \"microimbulei.\" He stated that once one is seen, \"they're like roaches\", and guaranteed that there are \"millions in the body,\" which Curran explained meant TFA Faella's \"immune system is not functioning optimally or else it would not let anything grow in the body.\" 66. Curran also added that it looked like TFA Faella had a little bit of liver toxicity and spider webbing. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella had a lot of cell deformity and that his immune system needed total regeneration because Curran could not find one good cell. Curran advised TFA Faella that \"they're all deformed\" (referring to Faella's white blood cells) and that if TFA Faella stayed like this that his immune system would allow other things to grow and eventually become premature diseases. TFA Faella asked Curran if what he had been shown floating in his blood was a parasite and Curran responded \"correct\" and that it was easy enough to treat. Curran stated that he also had seen a couple of clots forming in TFA Faella's blood and observed eggs starting to grow, stating that within twenty-four hours the eggs would be huge. Curran went on to say that they (referring to the parasite eggs) are deep seated within the cells and the immune system cannot get at them. When asked by TFA Faella about how to get rid of the parasites, Curran replied that he was working on a program in his head. 67. Curran informed TFA Faella that the next slide in the blood test would show if the parasites had caused any damage to the body. While conducting this test, Curran explained that the bar graph on the monitor should show a solid red line and that any break in that line would indicate some type of weakness within the system. In conducting this test, Curran stated that he did see something happening in TFA Faella's system but did not know whether the condition would mature in six months or six years, and then revised his answer to one year, adding that this test would have to be performed every three months. Curran also observed some holes in TFA Faella's blood smear, which Curran stated indicated that something was starting to happen. Curran explained that when he sent other similar patients for scans they always come back positive for cancer. However, in the case of TFA Faella, Curran advised that he would be able to reverse the condition now, in this stage, quite easily. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella's fiber net is all broken which indicates glucose intolerance. Curran asked TFA Faella if he took any painkillers, to which TFA Faella replied \"no\" and inquired why Curran was asking. Curran stated that TFA Faella had a little discoloration of the blood and indicated that he (Curran) could see orange/greenish specks which indicate diseases. Curran stated that he has an eighty-percent success rate and could get TFA Faella's blood back to that of a twenty-year-old. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella had adrenal stress which was sitting on top of his kidneys and causing fatigue and that he also saw purple in the blood sample which is a sign of malabsorbtion of nutrients. 68. In the next test he performed, Curran placed a clear liquid in the palm of TFA Faella's hand and had him grasp a small, approximately five-inch brass bar, which was connected to a computer system labeled BioMeridian Health Assessment test. Curran advised TFA Faella to grasp the bar loosely. Curran was holding on to a pen-like probe which he would push against TFA Faella's joints on the opposite hand and foot and then changed to the other side to complete the test. Curran explained that the testing system he was using was the most state of the art in the United States and that the test would measure the various bodily organs and lymphatics and detennine whether something was wrong in one of the internal organs. Curran proceeded to explain how this is a very important test to have done at least once a year to determine if a body has disease in it or not. While conducting the test, Curran informed TFA Faella that he had gall bladder problems and that his kidneys were super-stressed. At the end of the testing, Curran stated that the printer was not working and he could therefore not supply a copy of the test, but would keep it in the file. He went on to say that out of the sixty-two tests the machine scans for, TFA Faella had only passed five of them, but that within a month Curran would have TFA Faella back in shape. 69. After completing the assessment test, Curran had TFA Faella sit on an exam table where he looked at TFA Faella's fingernails on both hands and indicated to TFA Faella that his oxygen system wasn't working properly. Curran went on to say that because he did not see any half moons in the fingernails that it was a sign of degeneration and that 80-90 % of all his cancer patients have no moons in their fingernails. Curran also examined TFA Faella's tongue, took his body temperature, and checked his eyes. Curran stated that TFA Faella's pupils were pulsating, which meant that TFA Faella's glandular system was running out. 70. Upon completion of the exam, TFA Faella was instructed to get dressed and wait in Curran's office. Curran subsequently returned to the office and began to talk about several treatment protocols with TFA Faella. The first treatment discussed involved TFA Faella subsisting for a period of 30 days on only the Green Drink formula, 64 ounces of carrot juice a day and numerous other supplements Curran would supply to kill the parasites. Curran stated that this program would keep TFA Faella's blood squeaky-clean and heal everything. Curran went on to state that the only thing that worried him was the formation of TFA Faella's white blood cells because none of them were correct and he did not know why. But, Curran stated, in thirty days the cells would become perfectly round. 71. Curran then offered TFA Faella another treatment program to be done in addition to the above-cited supplement program. This therapy would last for a period of ten days and was intended to deactivate pesticides and heavy metals and excrete them as well as any deep seated microbes. Curran proceeded to show TFA Faella the therapy room that was located across his office and described each machine in the room and its function. 72. The first was a hyperbaric chamber which Curran stated was used for people who have had a stoke or brain damage and which supplies high-pressure oxygen. The next machine was a Hydro Massager which had an infra red light above it and, according to Curran, was supposed to stimulate the thyroid into producing healthy white blood cells. The beam saturates the body, which deactivates microbes from reproducing as well as cancer cells, viruses and bacteria with a high frequency. 73. The next piece of equipment shown to TFA Faella was an ionic cleanser, a machine in which clients would put their feet. While the machine appeared to TFA Faella to be a simple foot massager, Curran advised that, while in use, a person could actually see the garbage coming out of the body and floating up in the water. Curran described the garbage coming out of the body as browns, greens and all sorts of different colors. 74. The next piece of equipment shown to TFA Faella was a massage capsule, in which a client would lie inside. The apparatus had a black light above it where a person's head would be. Curran stated the machine provided cold light therapy. Curran advised that the machine would reprogram the immune system and fight against infections. 75. The final piece of equipment that Curran showed TFA Faella was a personal sauna in which a person's head would be sticking out of the unit as it heats up. Attached to the unit were two small white plastic hoses from which Curran advised O2 and O3 were being pumped into the unit, which heats up to 110 degrees. According to Curran, O3 takes pesticides out of the cells. 76. Curran and TFA Faella then returned back to Curran's office to discuss which form of therapy would be best. Curran then advised that a full course of treatment, utilizing the above-described machines would cost $10,000.00. A plan involving only supplements would cost several thousand. Curran reiterated to TFA Faella that the $10,000.00 program was best, stating that it's the only form of treatment that will completely erase everything wrong with TFA Faella. TFA Faella advised Curran that his schedule would not allow him to use the machine protocol and he would opt instead for the supplement program. Curran again tried selling a shorter time period machine-based treatment protocol, which TFA Faella refused. Curran then left the office to devise a supplement protocol for TFA Faella. Curran subsequently returned with a list of supplements for TFA Faella to purchase. The products included two supplements that Curran advised he produced himself. The first of these was the \"E-water\", which is bottled water bearing the, said trade name. Curran advised that this water reverses the molecules in the body. The second was the \"Green Drink\" formula which, Curran claimed, contained every nutrient that the body needs. The E-Water was sold for a cost of $45.00 for a four-(4) ounce bottle and a white unlabeled bucket of green powder to make the \"Green Drink\" sold for a cost of $675.00. 77. TFA Faella purchased all of the supplements with official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using Sovereign Bank check No. 109 for the total sum of $3,729.00, which included the full body exam. Sovereign Bank subsequently provided your affiant with a copy of the cited check which indicated that it had been deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. Your affiant is aware of the process by which a check issued by Sovereign Bank is processed. Your affiant is aware that prior to the funds being deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, a series of interstate bank wire transfers occurred culminating with the funds being deposited into the identified account. 78. On September 16, 2004, immediately following TFA Faella's exam with Curran, your affiant accompanied TFA Faella to Pawtucket Memorial Hospital, 11 Brewster Street, Pawtucket, RI. Upon arrival, Faella met with Dr. Noubar Kessimian, in a previously arranged meeting, for the purposes of supplying Dr. Kessimian with a blood sample for testing for the presence of blood parasites. TFA provided the necessary blood sample, which was tested at Memorial Hospital. Dr. Kessimian subsequently provided your affiant with a printout of the lab results, which were negative for the presence of parasites. Dr. Kessimian has also advised your affiant that blood parasites are extremely rare and are almost exclusively found as a result of contracting Malaria, a disease not present in this geographical area. B. Postal Inspector (PI) PI Correia 79. On October 8, 2004, Postal Inspector (PI) Al Correia, while working in an undercover capacity, went to the office of John Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, as part of a previously scheduled exam. Your affiant has listened to a recording of that meeting as well as spoken to PI Correia about that meeting which is summarized as follows: 80. Upon PI Correia's arrival, Curran reviewed a pre-exam form filled out by PI Correia and advised that it was a typical \"kill me diet.\" Curran stated that 99 percent of the people he treats are riddled with disease and, with PI Correia, Curran has an opportunity to stop it before PI Correia became diseased. 81. In the exam room, Curran initially conducted a Live Blood Analysis. Curran pricked PI Correia's right index finger and smeared blood on three (3) glass slides. Curran stated the microscope he was utilizing was not hooked up to the monitor screen at this time and he would let PI Correia look into the microscope viewfinder if he found something. 82. Curran then placed a blood slide on the microscope and told PI Correia that his blood cells should be perfectly round. He had PI Correia look in the microscope and noted that the blood cells were not round. Curran showed PI Correia a picture of healthy blood cells and then a picture of what PI Correia's blood cells looked like. Curran stated it was Rulo [sic], which could be, amongst other things, degenerative disease, liver disease, cancer, etc. Curran told PI Correia that he did not know exactly what it was but that PI Correia's system was not functioning correctly. 83. Curran stated the next blood slide could give him an answer. He then requested that PI Correia go to the bathroom and provide a urine sample. When PI Correia returned to the exam room, Curran tested the urine and stated that it was normal. Curran then looked at another blood slide and told PI Correia that he did not have any tumors but did have heavy metal, probably heavy metal poisoning. Curran stated that PI Correia had a yeasty buildup that could trigger a premature disease if not treated. 84. Curran stated the next test would check PI Correia's electroconductivity. A clear liquid was placed in the palm of PI Correia's hand and he was given a small bar (approximately five inches long) to hold in the hand. On the computer monitor screen there was a graph labeled Bio Meridian Health Assessment, which would tell Curran if the organ tested is stressed or weakened. Curran touched PI Correia's other hand and foot with a pen like device, producing readings on the graph. While touching the pen like object to PI Correia's foot, Curran told PI Correia that his liver was super stressed. Curran stated 17 out of 62 bodily functions were in the norm. Curran explained that the body fires electricity and this machine checks the firing of that electricity, which occurs in every area of one's body. Subsequent to conducting the test, Curran provided PI Correia with a printout of the results. Curran stated that PI Correia's weakest areas were his right lung and small intestines. The assessment indicated that only 17 out of 62 bodily functions were operating in a \"balanced\" state with the others being either \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" Included in those systems that were identified as stressed or weakened were the lymphatics, lungs, large intestine, nervous system, circulation, allergies, cellular metabolism, endocrine system, small intestine, connective tissue, gallbladder, kidneys and urinary bladder. Curran advised PI Correia that after continuous visits to his office, PI Correia would be perfect. 85. During the meeting, PI Correia asked Curran if he should be concerned that his blood cells were not round. Curran advised that they were round but coagulated and clumpy, which could cause heart attack and stroke if it caused blockage of the arteries. Curran stated that because PI Correia's blood was clumpy he couldn't read it in that state. Curran then stated he could get PI Correia into a program that would make him perfect. 86. Curran suggested a rejuvenation program consisting of not eating for 30 days while subsisting on the \"Green Drink,\" which would repair every cell in PI Correia's body. Curran also advised that PI Correia could drink the Green Drink for breakfast and lunch but eat a good dinner at night. Curran stated that this protocol would make PI Correia perfect and keep him there. This protocol would stop PI Correia's blood cells from sticking together. Curran advised PI Correia that the Green Drink formula took him ten years to formulate and that he puts 100 products in the formula. Cunan informed that it took half a year, working with scientists, to put the 100 products in the drink. Curran stated the drink totally repairs every cell in the body, PI Correia told Curran that he would purchase the supplements he suggested. Curran gave PI Correia a list of items totaling $2,715.82, which included the full body exam. PI then stated he would purchase the items at a later date. 87. The exam, at a cost of $950.00, was paid for by official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using an undercover Mastercard credit card. Your affiant subsequently contacted Mastercard and was advised that the transaction cited resulted in a wire of funds in the amount of $950.00 to the U.S. Bank National Association located in Knoxville TN. Your affiant is aware that company is a credit card clearing house. Funds from that institution were then wire transferred to Citizens Bank in Rhode Island, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. 88. On October 19, 2004, PI Correia met with Dr. Paul J. Agatiello, MD., F.A.C.P. for the purposes of receiving a comprehensive medical exam as a second opinion to diagnosis received from Curran during Correia's October 8, 2004 exam. In his Summary Statement, Dr. Agatiello wrote \"[t]o a reasonable degree of medical certainty, this physician finds NO evidence by history or physical examination of abnormalities of the lymphatics, lungs, large intestine, nervous system, circulation, allergies, endocrine system, small intestine, connective tissue, gallbladder, kidneys or urinary bladder.\" 89. Your affiant's investigation determined that PI Correia is the first person identified in this case that has not been diagnosed with deformities, such as parasites or worms, in his blood. According to PI Correia, during his exam with Curran, blood was drawn from his finger and placed under the microscope. Curran told PI Correia that the computer screen monitoring system, which Curran has used with all other identified patients to show the presence of parasites, was not hooked up and was not being used. 90. Your affiant is aware that just prior to PI Correia's visit, Frank S. Lombardi, attorney for AD, sent a letter from his office on September 7, 2004. In that letter attorney Lombardi accused Curran, among other things, of performing unnecessary work and charging expensive fees. Lombardi also notified Curran that his client had requested a stop payment on the check she wrote to him and that she had notified the Board of Medical Licensure regarding her visit to Curran's office. P.I. Correia visited Curran after the letter was sent to Lombard. 91. Also, of note. at the bottom of PI Al Correia's BioMeridian Stress Assessment analysis, provided by Curran, the following is written: \"The MSAS equipment does not provide a medical diagnosis. If patients feel they need a diagnosis, they should consult with their physician.\" Your affiant has reviewed similar assessment analysis reports provided to other patients of John Curran. That review revealed that in all cases, for patients seen prior to PI Correia and prior to the Lombardi letter, no such statement is made. Despite the disclaimer that has been added to the Stress Assessment test, based upon your affiant's review of the audiotapes of both undercover visits by TFA Faella and PI Correia, Curran never verbally advised either that he could not provide the diagnoses and that they should consult their physician if they felt they needed a diagnoses. VI. Peer Review of Currant's Treatment Protocol 92. In addition to the statements obtained above from Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah and Dr. Noubar Kessimian, I have also reviewed comments by a third doctor regarding Dr. Curran's methods. As part of its initial investigation, the RIDOH forwarded copies of Curran's promotional documents for review by Doctor Tim Gorski, MD Fellow at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FACOG). On November 4, 2002, Dr. Gorski wrote a letter in response to the forwarded materials. Your affiant has reviewed Dr. Gorski's assessments in which he provides his medical opinion that many of Curran's treatments are of an unproven or disproven nature. In particular part, Dr. Gorski provided the following information to RIDOH: The \"BioMeridian Stress Assessment\" appears to be a variation on electrodiagnostic methods that are well-known forms of medical fraud. The procedure consists of grounding the patient, then using a probe to pass low levels of electrical current through the patient. Various dials connected to the circuit are then claimed to measure the status of the patient's health. However, the resistance/current measured only reflects nonspecific effects such as how hard the probe is pushed against the patient. 93. Dr. Gorski also stated that naturopaths do not prevent, cure, diagnose or treat disease. VII. Glen Lynch 94. On May 11, 2004, your affiant along with PI Al Correia interviewed Glen Lynch. Glen Lynch had contacted the RIDOH and requested a meeting to discuss John Curran. Glen Lynch provided your affiant the following information, in substance: 95. Glen Lynch informed that he is the brother-in-law of John Curran. Glen Lynch stated that John Curran was engaged in certain unethical activities for which Glen Lynch had specific information. Glen Lynch stated that he was, until recently, employed by Curran at his medical office and as the day-to-day operator and owner of Eve's Herbal Garden, a vitamin supplement store on 743 Reservoir Avenue in Cranston, RI. Cumin's previous practice, Rhode Island Health Aid, was originally at the same address on Reservoir Avenue. According to Glen Lynch, Curran was the real owner of Eve's Herbal Garden with Glen Lynch holding the title in name only. 96. Glen Lynch stated that he was asked by Curran to create a \"Super Green Drink\" formula sold by Curran to his patients. Glen Lynch provided investigators with a notepad, which he claimed identified the formula he used to create the \"Green Drink\" and listed the cost of each of the various ingredients in the formula. When Curran had originally asked Glen Lynch to create the drink, he told him to \"make it green and make it taste good.\" Glen Lynch advised that he has no scientific background but attempted to create a formula that contained various healthy nutrients. Glen Lynch stated that Curran would charge up to $1,200.00 for a bucket of the powder. Glen Lynch left the employment of Curran after Curran had approached him regarding the cost of the formula. Curran wanted Glen Lynch to cut the expenses and to just keep it green and tasting good. Glen Lynch stated that he could not honor that request, stating that he felt it was wrong, and that it led to his having a falling out with Curran. Glen Lynch provided your affiant with a jar containing the green drink formula. 97. With regard to the \"E-Water\" that Curran sold, Glen Lynch stated that Curran would purchase gallons of distilled water, which he would place in a transparent like box with a rod in it, which was connected to a plug in electrical power source. Curran would pour the water in the box and let it sit there for a while. Glen Lynch surmised that the box was transparent so that if someone looked at it would appear as if something was happening to the water. Glen Lynch stated that upon his leaving the employment of Curran he had taken the apparatus, which Glen Lynch provided to your affiant. VIII. The Money 98. Glen Lynch has advised your affiant that Curran's business generated significant amounts of cash and that Curran had personally shown him large amounts of cash. Glen Lynch stated that Curran told him that he could not deposit the money into the bank in amounts over $10,000 because of, as Glen Lynch remembers it, \"some IRS rule.\" Glen Lynch also stated that, with regard to his medical practice, Curran told him that he \"wanted to make a couple of million bucks and get out.\" During his undercover visit to Curran's office, TFA Al Faella saw a safe in Curran's office, to the left of his desk, under a credenza. 99. Glen Lynch further informed your affiant that he and Curran had engaged in some fraudulent financial transactions with Glen Lynch's American Express Card and Curran's business, Rhode Island Health, when it was still on Reservoir Avenue. According to Glen Lynch, Curran devised a scheme whereby Curran would bill Glen Lynch's Amex card for fictitious purchases at the store and then split the cash received by the business with Glen Lynch. Glen Lynch stated that both he and Curran were aware that Glen Lynch would not be paying back the charged moneys [3]. Footnote 3. Your affiant is also aware that Glen Lynch has previously pleaded contendere to two state charges of simple assault/domestic and vandalism. 100. American Express has provided your affiant with records for the account of Glen P. Lynch (Acct. No. 3715-628432-52008 & 3721-2171 18-34008). A review of those records indicates that there was in excess of $33,000.00 in charges from Rhode Island Health. Those charges were almost exclusively in round thousand dollar allotments. According to Cathy Curran (No relation) Senior Special Agent, Northeast Region, for American Express, the GL Accounts have not been paid. 101. As part of this investigation, your affiant and other participating investigators have also reviewed numerous financial documents. 102. Your affiant has reviewed records provided by the Rhode Island Department of Administration, Division of Taxation-Employer Tax Section. Those records pertained to wages paid by The Northeastern Institute of Advanced Healing. A review of those records indicates that for calendar year 2003, John Curran claimed wages totaling $21,000. For the first two (2) quarters of calendar year 2004, John Curran reported wages totaling $12,500. 103. Your affiant has determined that John E. Curran currently resides at 66 Falcon Ridge Drive, Exeter, RI. The residence was purchased on August 2, 2004, and the listed owners are John E. Curran and Colleen R. Brophy. The home was purchased for $465,000.00 from Thomas and Valeria Guest. The mortgage payment for the residence are made by John Curran utilizing funds from The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing (Citizens Bank Checking Account No. 1452-75 1-0) 104. Your affiant has reviewed records from GE Capital relating to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. GE Capital is the issuing company behind the Creditcare card application that is utilized at Curran's practice. Medical practitioners utilize the card for patients who are in need of a financial payment plan to receive services. SA Robert Ferraro has conducted an analysis of payments made by GE Capital to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing (Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-75 1-0). That analysis indicates that for the year 2003, GE Capital sent a total of $120,413.16 in credit deposits to the Citizens Bank account. For the year 2004, to date, similar deposits have been made totaling approximately $210,216.00. Investigation by your affiant has determined that payments made to the identified account are done so by bank wire transfer. Upon approval of credit from GE Capital, a Credit Care card is sent to the client via the U.S. Mails. Subsequent payments to GE Capital can be made by sending payment via the U.S. Mails. 105. As stated above, your affiant's review has determined that it appears that receipts from Curran's business are deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0. To date, the investigation has traced certain payments that relate to fraudulent services into Account No. 1452-751-0. 106. On August 13, 2004, LM, the patient identified above, paid $2,000 to Curran's business by using a Visa credit card issued by Household Bank SB NA. Household Bank has confirmed to SA Robert Ferraro that it issued a payment on behalf of LM to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing. 107. Your affiant is also aware that Visa and Mastercard payments are typically processed through a clearing house. On January 5, 2005, your affiant spoke with a representative at Merchant Services. Your affiant was informed that Merchant Services is a credit card clearing house bank. Your affiant was advised that Merchant Services collects payment for credit card charges made through individual companies that utilize a credit card machine provided by Merchant Services or a wholesaler associated with Merchant Services. Your affiant was advised that charges are \"bundled\" and then monies are forwarded to the client after subtracting the fees charged by Merchant Services. Additionally, clients provide Merchant Services with a single bank account where funds are to be forwarded. 108. Your affiant has determined that John Cun-an utilizes Merchant Services and that charges made from his company are forwarded to Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0. Your affiant has also reviewed bank statement for Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0 and identified what appear to be numerous deposits of bundled payment items from Merchant Services, including deposits that occurred after August 13, 2004, when ML used her Visa card to pay Curran. 109. Your affiant is also aware that Merchant Services was utilized by John Curran to process the credit card payment for services he provided to PI Al Correia as fully described above at paragraph 87. 110. In addition, as explained above at paragraph 77, TFA Faella purchased supplements from Curran with official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using Sovereign Bank check No. 109 for the total sum of $3,729.00. Sovereign Bank subsequently provided your affiant with a copy of the cited check which indicated that it had been deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. 111. The investigation has revealed that the proceeds of the scheme are being used to promote the scheme because the funds deposited in the Citizen's Bank account are used to make payment on the business' American Express Account. A partial review of Citizens Bank records for Account No 1452-751-0, for the time period of January 2004 through September 2004, identified monthly checks being made payable to American Express Business Platinum Card, Account No. 3727-150577-83006 83006, held in the name of Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute. The identified checks include the following: Check No. 2306 written on January 6, 2004 in the amount of $15,591.70; Check No. 5472 written on or about March 1, 2004 in the amount of $23,788.69; Check No. 5666 written on May 1, 2004 in the amount of $27,137.34; Check No. 5769 written on June 13, 2004 in the amount of $17,841.78; Check No. 5820 written on June 28, 2004 in the amount of $28,513.95; Check No. 5930 written on August 6, 2004 in the amount of $14,700.23; and Check No. 2567 written on September 15, 2004 in the amount of $24,935.30 112. Your affiant has conducted a partial review of statements from American Express Business Platinum Card, Account number 3727-150577-83006, for the time period of October 2003 through September 2004, held in the name of Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute, 38 One Richmond Square, Suite 3 10E Providence, RI. The review identified checks being made payable to various corporations engaged in providing products and services utilized by Dr. John E. Curran and the Northeast Institute of Advanced Natural Healing in the furtherance of a scheme to defraud. The following purchases took place after Curran had seen ML, TFA Faella and PI Correia. 113. On August 26, 2004 and September 29, 2004, payments, each in the amount of $5,046.61, were made to Practice Builder Business Services. The investigation has revealed that Practice Builder Business Services is a company engaged in providing medical practices with strategic marketing services. The company provides, among other services, web design and strategies, company promotional design, typesetting and placement and mailing and physician and patient retaining and referral building. 114. On September 3, 2004, a payment of $19,190.00 was made to BioMeridian Inc., located in Utah. As stated above at paragraph 29, this corporation sells BioMeridian Stress Assessment devices, a device utilized by John E. Curran and described in detail in this affidavit. 115. Numerous payments have been made to Chi's Enterprise, a corporation that the investigation has revealed is engaged in the sale of herbal supplements. The payments include a payment was charged in the amount of $728.00 on August 17, 2004. IX. Computer Search Issues 116. As used in the Affidavit, the term \"computer\" includes \"computer software and memory,\" which refers to digital information that can be interpreted by a computer and any of its related components to direct the way they work. Software is stored in electronic, magnetic, optical, or other digital form. It commonly includes programs to run operating systems, applications (such as word-processing, graphics, or spreadsheet programs). 117. Based upon my training, experience, participation in other fraud and drug investigations, and discussions with other law enforcement officers experienced in the use and retrieval of computer-generated information, I am aware that computer storage devices (like hard disks, floppy disks, tapes, laser disks, and Bernoulli (drives) can store the equivalent of thousands of pages of information. Additionally, a person engaged in fraud may try to conceal criminal evidence, such as by storing it in random order with deceptive file names. This may require the qualified computer experts to examine all the stored data to determine which particular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime. 118. During the course of this investigation, your affiant has consulted with other Special Agents, including FDA SA Special Agent Phil Walsky. SA Walsky has been a Special Agent with FDA for six years. Prior to FDA, SA Walsky was a special agent with the United States Secret Service. SA Walsky has been performing computer forensics since 1997, when he received computer forensics examination training and certification while he was with the Secret Service. He has continued to perform computer forensics as a Special Agent for the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigation. SA Walsky has received training and has gained experience in the usage of specialized computer software and hardware which assists him in examining seized computers. He performs dozens of computer forensic exams a year. The training SA Walsky has received includes Seized Computer Evidence Recovery (SCERS) training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, in Georgia in1997, and numerous continuing training over the following years. This continuing training covers various topics of computer forensics investigations such as legal issues, software and hardware components, internet and email dynamics, and other computer related topics. He has received additional training for various forensic software and hardware tools that I use for computer examinations. 119. Based on your affiant's experience in fraud investigations, consultation with other special agents and discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that computer files or remnants of such files can be recovered months or even years after they have been downloaded onto a hard drive, deleted or viewed via the Internet. Electronic files downloaded to a hard drive can be stored for years at little or no cost. Even when such files have been deleted, they can be recovered months or years later using readily-available forensics tools. When a person \"deletes\" a file on a computer, the data contained in the file does not actually disappear; rather, that data. remains on the hard drive until it is overwritten by new data. Therefore, deleted files, or remnants of deleted files, may reside in free space or slack space - that is, in space on the hard drive that is not allocated to an active file or that is unused after a file has been allocated to a set block of storage space - for long periods of time before they are overwritten. In addition, a computer's operating system may also keep a record of deleted data in a \"swap\" or \"recovery\" file. Similarly, files that have been viewed via the Internet are automatically downloaded into a temporary Internet directory or \"cache.\" The browser typically maintains a fixed amount of hard drive space devoted to these files, and the files are only overwritten as they are replaced with more recently viewed Internet pages. Thus, the ability to retrieve residue of an electronic file from a hard drive depends less on when the file was downloaded or viewed than on a particular user's operating system, storage capacity, and computer habits. 120. Also based on discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that computer hardware, software, and electronic files may be important to a criminal investigation in two distinct ways: (1) the objects themselves may be contraband, evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits of crime, an/or (2) the objects may be used as storage devices that contain contraband, evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits of crime in the form of electronic data. Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits the government to search for and seize computer hardware, software, and electronic files that are evidence of crime, contraband, instrumentalities of crime, and/or fruits of crime. In this case, the warrant application requests permission to search and seize records that may be stored on a computer. These records constitute evidence of crime, and your affiant believes that, in this case, the computer hardware is a container for this evidence. This affidavit also requests permission to seize the computer hardware that may contain the records if it becomes necessary for reasons of practicality to remove the hardware and conduct a search off-site. 121. Based upon discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that searching and seizing information from computers often requires agents to seize most or all electronic storage devices (along with related peripherals) to be searched later by a qualified computer expert in a laboratory or other controlled environment. This is true because of the following: a. The volume of evidence. Computer storage devices (like hard disks, diskettes, tapes, laser disks) can store the equivalent of millions of information. Additionally, a 'suspect may try to conceal criminal evidence; he or she might store it in random order with deceptive file names. This may require searching authorities to examine all the stored data to determine which particular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime. This sorting process can take weeks or months, depending on the volume of data stored, and it would be impractical and invasive to attempt this kind of data search on-site. b. Technical Requirements. Searching computer systems for criminal evidence is a highly technical process requiring expert skill and a properly controlled environment. The vast array of computer hardware and software available requires even computer experts to specialize in some systems and applications, so it is difficult to know before a search which expert is qualified to analyze the system and its data. In any event, however, data search protocols are exacting scientific procedures designed to protect the integrity of the ' evidence and to recover even \"hidden,\" erased, compressed, password-protected, or encrypted files. Because computer evidence is vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional modification or destruction (both from external sources or from destructive code imbedded in the system as a 'booby trap\"), a controlled environment may be necessary to complete an accurate analysis. Further, such searches often require the seizure of most or all of a computer system's input/output peripheral devices, related software, documentation, and data security devices (including passwords) so that a qualified computer expert can accurately retrieve the system's data in a laboratory or other controlled environment. 122. Your affiant recognizes that the computer(s) located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, R.I. may be used by functioning companies, and that a seizure of the computers may have the unintended and undesired effect of limiting the companies' ability to engage in business. In response to these concerns, the agents who execute the search will take an incremental approach to minimize the inconvenience to any legitimate business that may be occurring at this address and to minimize the need to seize equipment and data. This incremental approach, which will be explained to all of the agents on the search team before the search is executed, will proceed as follows: a. Upon arriving at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, the agents will attempt to create, while at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, an electronic \"image\" of the information stored on the computer(s). Generally speaking, imaging is the taking of a complete electronic picture of the computer's data, including all hidden sectors and deleted files. Imaging a computer permits the agents to obtain an exact copy of the computer's stored data without actually seizing the computer hardware. The computer expert or another technical expert will then conduct an off-site search for the computer files described in the warrant from the \"mirror image\" copy at a later date. If the computer expert successfully images the computers, the agents will not conduct any additional search or seizure of the computers. b. If \"imaging\" on-site proves impractical, or even impossible for technical reasons, then the agents will seize those components of the computer system that the computer expert believes must be seized to permit the agents to locate the computer files described in the warrant at an off-site location. The components will be seized and taken in to the custody of law enforcement agents. If employees of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, so request, the computer expert will, to the extent practicable, attempt to provide the employees with copies of any files that may be necessary or important to the continuing function of legitimate business. If, after inspecting the computers, the analyst determines that some or all of this equipment is no longer necessary to retrieve and preserve the evidence, the government will return it within a reasonable time. CONCLUSION 123. Based on the foregoing, including: (1) the purported diagnoses that patients had abnormalities in their blood, including parasites; (2) the efforts to sell products to the patients, such as the green drink and E-water, and misrepresentations regarding their development and potential; (3) the undercover operations that showed that Curran had falsely diagnosed the conditions of the undercover agents; (4) the patient complaints and summaries; (5) the medical opinions that indicate that parasites in the blood should only occur in patients with malaria, a disease not present in this geographical area; (6) Curran's statements to Glen Lynch that he could not deposit cash in amounts greater than $10,000 at a bank and the he intended to \"make a couple of million bucks and get out;\" (7) Curran's use of interstate wires to conduct financial transactions resulting from his scheme; and, (8) Curran's use of the mails to respond to and deflect inquiries from the RJDOH regarding patient complaints, I believe that probable cause exists that John E. Curran, through his activities at The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island has engaged in the following illegal activity: (1) Mail Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; and (2) Wire Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. 124. Based upon the foregoing, including: (1) the deposits of fraudulently obtained proceeds into Citizen's Bank Account No. 1452-751-0; (2) the use of the funds in the Citizen's Bank account to pay American Express Business Platinum Card, Account No. 3727-150577- 83006, bills addressed to Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute; (3) and the charging of expenses intended to promote the scheme to the American Express account, I believe that probable cause exists that John E. Curran, through his activities at The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, has conducted financial transactions involving the proceeds of the specified unlawful activities of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343), with the intent to promote the carrying on of said specified unlawful activities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i). 125. I further believe, based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, there is probable cause to believe that evidence, fruits, any instrumentalities of illegal activity by John Curran, as more fully described in Attachment B, are presently located on the premises at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, at the office and principal place of business of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. I respectfully request that the Court issue a search warrant for those premises as described in Attachment A, authorizing seizure of items described in Attachment B, which I incorporated by reference as though fully set forth in the Affidavit. 126. Based upon the above information, there is also probable cause to believe that Citizen's Bank Account No. 1452-751-0 is being used with the intent to promote the carrying on of the specified unlawful activities of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i), and that said account contains the traceable proceeds from the above violations. Thus, all funds in this account are forfeitable to the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, or constitute property traceable to such property. JASON A.

All contain many claims that are questionable, controversial, fanciful, unsupported by published evidence, or just plain wrong. Although he mentions standard skin-care treatments, sometimes favorably, his books provide little guidance about when they might be appropriate or sufficient.

Nicholas Perricone, M.D., has written three similar books: The Wrinkle Cure [1], The Perricone Prescription [2]; and The Acne Prescription [3]. All contain many claims that are questionable, controversial, fanciful, unsupported by published evidence, or just plain wrong. Although he mentions standard skin-care treatments, sometimes favorably, his books provide little guidance about when they might be appropriate or sufficient. Although he provides long lists of references, practically none of them directly support what he promises. Despite this, his books have made best seller lists and the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) has featured him during fundraising campaigns. Perricone claims that following his advice can quickly improve appearance, improve general health, increase mental sharpness, and make people more energetic. In The Perricone Prescription, for example, he promises to \"stop skin from wrinkling, sagging and dulling\" and says that, \"being wrinkle free for life is achievable\" if you follow his 28-day program. He offers \"increased vitality, sharpened cognitive and problem-solving skills, and improved memory\" and claims that \"looking and feeling old is now an option.\" He also describes his program as \"proven . . . to reverse the many signs of premature aging and stop its progress.\" [2:1-5] Background History Dr. Perricone makes much of his connection with Yale University. He is a former assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Yale University School of Medicine\u2014an unpaid position in which he supervised students from time to time. However, his affiliation ended in 2002 when his contract was not renewed. In an interview reported in the Washington Post, Perricone said that the school authorities had been very critical of his books, public appearances, and anti-inflammation theories [4]. The report also noted that he subsequently became an adjunct (visiting) professor at Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine and pledged $5 million to establish the Perricone Division of Dermatology there. Perricone's books are sprinkled with statements that his ideas are based on his own research. However, the extent and quality of this research is unclear. A PubMed search for his name brought up only six citations, of which only two appear to be original research, both on topical glycolic acid [5,6]. His books describe situations in which he tested various ideas in a few patients, usually over a short period of time, but he provides few details and apparently published none of those findings in medical journals. Most of Perricone's recommended strategies are nutrition-related. In The Wrinkle Cure, he describes how his interest in this subject developed: My own fascination with nutrition was sparked during my undergraduate days, before I entered medical school. I had always suffered from sallow, acne-plagued skin, allergies, and fatigue, so I started reading everything I could find on the subject\u2014which, at the time, meant pretty much everything written by Linus Pauling, Ph.D. . . . and Adelle Davis. I began experimenting with vitamins on my own, and the results were gratifying. My skin and allergies improved, and I had much more energy. . . . When I entered medical school, however, my interest in nutrition made me an eccentric. My classmates thought I was nuts because I popped vitamins after meals and bundled up to go running in the dark, cold mornings of Michigan winters. [1:3,6]. The references to Pauling and Davis may help explain why Perricone spouts so many strange ideas. Although Pauling was a great chemist, his late-in-life beliefs in vitamin megadoses have been thoroughly discredited [7]. Adelle Davis achieved great popularity during the 1970s, but close examination of her writings indicates that she consistently misinterpreted research reports or simply made things up [8]. The irrational nutrition-related beliefs Perricone absorbed before going to medical school were apparently untouched by his science-based education. Perricone's \"Prescription\" The Perricone Prescription provides detailed instructions that include exactly what foods to eat, when and in what order to eat them (proteins first), what exercises to do, what supplements to take with each meal, and what to apply to your skin at what times of day. He even includes a section of recommended recipes. His program includes: - Diet: Three meals and two snacks daily, high quality protein (above all, wild salmon), \"good\" fats, and carbohydrates with a low glycemic index. No sugar. A long list of prohibited foods including carrots, bananas, duck, potatoes, flour, raisins, corn, soda (even diet soda) and many others. - Nutrient supplements: 25 different ones, some taken more than once a day: alpha lipoic acid, vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B12, folate, biotin, vitamin turmeric. - Skin treatments: sunscreens, cleansers, moisturizers, eye-care products and enriched night cream; various creams with ingredients such as vitamin C, vitamin C ester, alpha lipoic acid, DMAE, PPC, tocotrienol, and olive oil. - Exercise: For strength, endurance, and flexibility; 40 minutes a day, 6 days a week. - Miscellaneous advice: 8-10 glasses of spring water a day; no tobacco, coffee, or alcohol (but tea is allowed); melatonin for sleep if needed. Perricone markets his own line of high-priced nutritional supplements and skin care products worldwide. Typical prices from his [Web site](http://www.nvperriconemd.com/) include: - $120 for 4 oz alpha lipoic acid and other ingredients for spider veins - $570 for 2 oz neuropeptide facial conformer - $195 for a 30-day supply of supplements for weight loss - $438-458 monthly for the entire skin and nutrient program based on skin type [9]. In November 2003, The Wall Street Journal reported that Perricone's company (N.V. Perricone) grossed $11.9 million in 2001, $42.4 million in 2002, and was expected to top $52 million in 2003 [10]. The article also noted that Perricone's PBS fundraising specials had generated over $4 million for PBS in both 2001 and 2002. Questionable, Unverifiable, and Erroneous Statements Perricone says that he gradually came to believe inflammation is the underlying cause of aging and of many diseases and that his own research shows that treating inflammation would reverse the aging process. In fact, he characterizes inflammation as \"the key to the whole process of disease of every type.\" [2:20] Inflammation is indeed associated with many diseases, but it is not always clear whether the inflammation is a cause or a result. Nor is it clear that nutrients that help fight inflammation (such as vitamins C and E) do anything to reverse most of those diseases. Inflammation is characterized by the presence of white blood cells in a skin biopsy specimen. However, their presence can be due to hundreds of different causes, including systemic diseases, infections, foreign substances, insect bites, autoimmune processes, viruses, genetic abnormalities, and malignancies. Inflammation can be nonspecific and even be due to scratching. And the presence of white cells doesn't necessarily mean there are any associated clinical or molecular abnormalities [11]. Inflammation doesn't always increase with age; the inflammatory response to skin injuries actually decreases as you get older [12]. Dietary deficiencies can cause inflammation in the skin (pellagra is a classic example), but there's no evidence that supplementing an already adequate diet would prevent inflammation. Nor is there evidence that inflammation causes wrinkles. (The leading controllable factors are sun damage and cigarette smoking.) If Perricone truly wanted to test his theories, it would not be difficult. They could be tested on an animal model with biopsies before and after various treatments. Also, one could look for epidemiologic data on patients taking prednisone or nonsterioidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to see whether they have fewer wrinkles [13]. In acne, hair follicles become plugged with comedos composed of dead skin cells and sebum (a mixture of fats and waxes). If bacteria invade, the surrounding skin can become inflamed, and pimples or pustules may form. Most people with acne have a mild (noninflammatory) form and get occasional whiteheads or blackheads. There is little evidence that acne is related to diet. If self-experimentation suggests that a specific food aggravates acne, avoiding the food may be reasonable, but Perricone's sweeping claims have no scientific support. Page 33 of The Perricone Prescription illustrates an extraordinary degree of illogical thinking about nutrition. After describing a breakfast consisting of orange juice, cold cereal with banana, skim milk, a low-fat bran muffin, margarine and coffee, the book states: As [Megan] drinks the juice, she is causing a burst of inflammation in her body as the juice floods her bloodstream with sugar. This causes a sharp spike in her insulin levels, resulting in a rapid acceleration of the aging process, increasing the risk of heart disease, every form of cancer, memory loss, and mental deterioration. To add to the problems, the sugar flood is causing the collagen to cross-link, laying the foundation for the birth of wrinkles, sagging, and loss of tone. Page 45 contains an equally ridiculous passage which concludes that eating bagels, cookies, or caffeinated, sugary sodas\u2014which Perricone inappropriately regards as addicting\u2014places people at risk for \"exhausting our pancreas, burning out our adrenals, and placing us at risk for insulin resistance and diabetes.\" Here are more of Perricone's claims followed by our comments in brackets: - Substances like olive oil \"penetrate, strengthen, and refresh your skin cells.\" [What do \"strengthening\" and \"refreshing \"your skin cells mean?] - You look puffy the morning after eating Chinese food because of an inflammatory response to what you ate. [Any puffiness would probably be because the salt and MSG caused the body to temporarily retain water.] - When you are mildly dehydrated your metabolism drops and you gain weight. [Actually, dehydration usually decreases appetite and results in weight loss.] - His program works by a synergy between diet, supplements, skin care, and exercise. [Synergy means the combination works better than the sum of the individual components. There are no published data comparing the combination with each factor alone or with other combinations.] - Slow, steady release of insulin into our bloodstream keeps us younger. [He doesn't indicate how he thinks this could be measured. It can't.] - Sugar makes the insulin receptors on the cells burn out. [Untrue] - The contemporary American diet rarely contains enough protein. [Untrue. Americans tend to consume more protein than they need.] - DMAE is your magic bullet for great skin tone. [A PubMed search shows only one small study that showed an effect of topical DMAE on skin [14]] - There are probably unidentified components of salmon that promote health and slow aging. [This possible, but he has no basis for saying it is probable.] - Salmon improves manic-depressive patients who don't respond to medication. [He mentions a study but doesn't give a citation for it, and it is not listed in PubMed.] - Socrates prescribed olive oil for various diseases. [So what?] - Olive trees live for centuries and re-grow after being cut to the ground. [Implied benefits from olive oil for human longevity by magical analogy.] - Adults should limit milk intake because they may have lactose intolerance or allergies. [It would make far more sense to base an individual decision on whether the individual actually is intolerant.] - Alcohol is bad, so hard liquor is bad, but wine is OK. [A glass of wine and a shot of whiskey contain approximately the same amount of alcohol.] - Avoid tap water; drink spring water. [Bottled water is not tested as thoroughly as public water supplies and many brands fail to meet tap water standards. Several surveys have found more contaminants, bacteria, etc. in some bottled waters than in tap water. Tap water is generally safer.] - Spring water flushes toxins from the body. [What toxins? What difference does it make whether it's spring water or other fluids?] - Everyone needs 8-10 glasses of water a day. [A comparison of two diets, one with and one without plain water, showed no difference in hydration whether water was supplied by plain water or other beverages [15]]. - The same substances work on the central nervous system and the skin. [A personal observation, not otherwise supported. He theorizes that the nervous stem and skin are alike because they originated in the same one of three cell layers of the early embryo.] - Vitamin C deficiency causes wrinkles. [Sun exposure and tobacco use are the only recognized factors known to cause wrinkles.] - Growth hormone is the true \"youth hormone.\" [Only in the sense that it helps youths grow into adults!] - Coffee causes weight gain, while tea cause weight loss. [Neither is correct.] - Lack of essential fatty acids can cause miscarriage. [A PubMed search for fatty acids and miscarriage showed only one study in the blue fox; it showed just the opposite\u2014that supplementing the diet with essential fatty acids in the form of evening primrose oil increased the rate of miscarriage.] - Alpha-lipoic acid is an anti-aging drug. [There are no known anti-aging drugs.] Lack of Science Dr. Perricone would be more credible if he could show us a study demonstrating that people who followed his prescription lived longer, had \"younger\" skin demonstrated by objective measures, or felt better compared to those on a placebo program\u2014or that they were better in any measurable way. Instead, he provides only testimonials, exaggerated claims, partial truths, and incorrect statements. He cherry-picks possibly supportive studies from the literature and ignores contradictory studies. He cites lots of lab studies (in vitro or in animals), but few that demonstrate any clinical effects in humans. The diet he recommends is low in calories, and weight loss alone may improve the way his patients look and feel. His advice about tobacco and sunscreens is appropriate, but there is little science behind the rest of his program. He seems to have gathered every nutrient and skin cream he had any reason to hypothesize might work and advised using all of them. A more rational approach would have been to first see which ones really worked, and later to see if any combinations of the effective agents worked better than a single agent. No scientist worth his salt does experiments without controls; Perricone treats everyone, so that there is no basis for comparison. The Perricone Prescription includes full-color before-and-after photographs of women who tried its 28-day program. These photos are far from convincing, with differences in position, lighting, facial expression, makeup, and weight loss that could affect the appearance. The reader is asked to make purely subjective judgments and to notice undefined qualities such as \"vibrancy,\" \"radiance,\" and \"improved contours.\" Dr. Hall's own informal poll indicated that most people prefer some of the \"befores\" to the \"afters.\" A Washington Post reporter's experience illustrates how inexact this type of study can be. Page 12 of The Perricone Prescription states that, \"Without exception, every patient who has tried the Three-Day Nutritional Face-lift has had good results, and has returned convinced that my Wrinkle-Free Program works. And you will, too.\" Noting that this statement is preposterous, the reporter decided to test the program on herself. On the fourth day, she had lost three pounds, and it seemed to her that her pores were smaller, her eyelids less heavy and her chin line \"less blurry.\" However, 18 out of 26 of her friends who looked at before-and-after photographs said she looked younger before she started the program [4]. Perricone and his patients may agree that they look better after treatment, but the photographs are the only attempt he makes to present objective evidence. It seems rather silly to depend on subjective impressions and photographs when several objective methods of measuring improvement are available. Reputable published skin studies have used skin surface measurements by semi-automated computer morphometry, laser profilometry, and skin biopsies whose specimens are examined with immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy [16]. Moreover, the creams and lotions he recommends could easily have been evaluated by applying them to one side of the face and using the other side as a control. Perricone provides little information from sources that disagree with him. Mercury in fish is a possible concern with a high salmon diet, but he doesn't even mention it. He lists all the positive effects of nutrients but omits to mention the toxic effects of high doses, even though some of his supplements may push people into the toxic range. He does not mention that only three nutritional factors have ever been found to correlate with longer life in mammals: calorie restriction, and restriction of methionine and tryptophan\u2014in rodents [17]. Overview Dr. Perricone has mixed a pinch of science with a gallon of imagination to create an elaborate, time-consuming, expensive, prescription for a healthy life and younger skin. There is no reason to think his program is more effective than standard measures. Although some of his advice is standard, most of his recommendations are based on speculation and fanciful interpretation of selected medical literature. He makes lots of money by convincing patients and consumers, but he hasn't succeeded in convincing critical thinkers, doctors, scientists, or anyone who wants to see hard evidence. Perricone's \"prescription\" isn't science; it's creative salesmanship. For Additional Information References - Perricone N.

As reported in The New York Times, according to police, the Mitchells performed, without Ms. Babb's consent, a spiritual healing ritual that included \"cutting [the] woman's heals with a razor, pouring hot wax and flammable liquid into the wounds and setting them on fire.\" Ms. Babb suffered second degree burns on her feet and faced the need to possibly have part or all of one foot amputated. [Rashbaum WK. Feet burned in ritual, police say. The New York Times 6/23/02, p. 32.] FLESH-MUTILATING COSMETIC QUACKS ARRAIGNED Iris and Eliezer Fernandez were arraigned July 18th in New York City on charges of assault, performing medical treatments without a license, scheming to defraud, grand larceny, and possession of a weapon, a hypodermic needle. The couple used needles to provide injections of Hyacell, an unapproved drug in the United States, to people seeking fewer wrinkles, lip plumping, breast enlargement, and other cosmetic procedures at low financial cost. The couple's anti-wrinkle treatments allegedly left the face of Freddy Borges, 47, mottled with purple scars. Other underground providers have offered similar injection procedures resulting in at least eight people hospitalized in the city since mid-June with life-threatening infections that required drainage procedures that left their faces mutilated. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city health commissioner, asked that anyone who had received unlicensed treatment or doctors who treated similar infections to call 1-800-NYC-DOH7. According to Reina M. Turcios of the CDC, most of the victims in the city were immigrants from Latin America; and similar cases in the past year were reported in Wyoming and Colorado. Promotion of the Fernandez's procedure was largely through word of mouth. [Fries JH. More illegal Botox-like injections suspected. The New York Times 7/20/02, B1, B3.] Last year The New York Times reported that police raided a clinic, El Centro de Est\u00e9tica (Spanish for Aesthetics Center), in Corona, a working-class neighborhood in Queens, New York. Clinic staff were accused of illegal practices and operating under unsanitary conditions. Prior to the raid a 33-year old woman who checked in at the St. Joseph's Campus of St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers complained of infection after receiving at the clinic liposuction and silicone implants in her buttocks. Doctors at the hospital reportedly said they had treated other patients of the clinic who had surgical complications. Vincente Galarza, 49, and John Zurita Velasquez, 45 were accused of practicing medicine without a license. Jennifer Gando, 30, was accused of working as a registered nurse without a license. Patricia Bautista, 37, was accused of practicing dentistry without a license. The clinic promoted plastic surgery, orthodontics, manicures, pedicures, and facial tatoos to replace the need for lipstick and other makeup. The news report also mentioned that Ilda Medina, who had a face lift done at the cash-only clinic for $3,500, complained of knots and scars under her ear, and said that people at the clinic threatened to kill her if she reported them to the police. And Alejandra Restrepo, 18, reportedly claimed to be unable to eat solid food for weeks after receiving braces at the clinic, and unable to afford to have the braces removed. [Koh EL. Police raid an illegal clinic offering cosmetic surgery. The New York Times 5/21/01, B3.] Also last year National Post (www.nationalpost.com) reported the death of a Vietnamese woman, Thi Hanh Lan Tran, 36, who may be the first person in Canada to die from surgery for cosmetic enhancement performed by unlicensed persons. Toronto police issued a warrant for criminal negligence causing death to Minh Tam Thi Le, and arrested her partner Tu Ngoc Nguyen for the same offense. Their clinic regularly advertised in Vietnamese newspapers and magazines in the Toronto area. During a cut-rate breast augmentation procedure Thi Hanh Lan Tran reportedly went into cardiac arrest likely attributable to a \"freezing agent\" she was given as a sedative. Plastic surgeons interviewed for the report discussed the problem of cosmetic procedures by unqualified persons operating out of backroom clinics. Stories they told included an Asian woman whose faced likely had been injected with silicone window caulking, a penis lengthening surgery that left a man unable to have sex for five years, and festering nasal infection following injections of unknown material. [Blatchford C. The beauty butchers. 5/2/01.] A recent story in The New York Times concerned the pervasive public-health and criminal problem of beauty salon personnel offering medically complex cosmetic procedures such as Botox injections, collagen injections, laser treatments, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion while failing to operate under medical supervision as advertised. [Siwolop S. That quest to enhance beauty can leave scars. 7/14/02, p. BU9.] US NEWS & WORLD REPORT EXPOSES HOAXES Professed surgical insertions of goat gonads into human gonads and breatharianism were among the scams and schemes described in the August 26/September 2 special issue of US News & World Report on \"The Art of the Hoax.\" The goat gonad transplants were promoted in the 1920s and 1930s by John Brinkley, who had a diploma mill medical degree, as a treatment for impotence and eventually a variety of ailments including epilepsy and insanity. In her article, \"The Doctor's Got Your Goat,\" Katherine Hobson wrote that Brinkley later admitted that he knew the transplants could only work as placebos and that he tucked the tissue into the patients' abdomens (exposing his customers to unwarranted risk of infection). Brinkley earned millions of dollars promoting his \"Fountain of Youth\" on the radio and his mail-order prescriptions. But, following a huge back tax bill from the Internal Revenue Service, malpractice suits from customers dissatisfied with his newer prostate operation, and an indictment for mail fraud, Brinkley declared bankruptcy and lost a radio station he had started in Mexico. He died a year later in 1942. Hobson made the point that quacks like Brinkley operate today. She noted the availability of herbal products promoted as aphrodisiacs on the Internet and she quoted NCAHF President Robert Baratz, who, she wrote, sees a growing number of popular products and practices without any scientific basis: \"People want simple quick answers to complex problems. And with the technology today, they get the idea we can do just about anything like thawing out Ted Williams even though he's already dead.\" In his article \"Swallowing Air,\" David LaGesse described so-called breatharianism, the practice of giving up food and water and living off air and light as \"silly\" and \"deadly.\" He interviewed breatharianism promoter Wiley Brooks, 66, who was caught many years ago eating \"junk food\" and who says that for him hamburgers counteract the sickening effects of electrical power lines. LaGesse wrote about Jasmuheen, an Australian woman who promotes breatharianism and claims to have stopped eating in 1993, but also admits to eating cake and chocolate. She failed to complete a test by Australia's 60 Minutes TV show of her breatharianism after a few days when doctor warned that her health was collapsing. The test came after another Australian woman died in 1999 from dehydration with a copy of Jasmuheen's book Living on Light. \"Two Australian breatharians went to jail for letting another initiate starve to death in 1998, and a German death the year before is tied to the teachings,\" wrote LaGesse. In the introductory article to the special issue, Thomas Hayden wrote: \"In the stories that follow, we present elaborate swindles, outrageous gags, and insidious disinformation campaigns. They're all hoaxes-proof there's a sap for every scam artist, an easy mark for every mountebank, a chump for every charlatan.\" RAW MILK PROMOTER DIES Edgar Stueve, who co-founded Alta Dena Dairy in California with his brother Harold in 1945 died on August 1st of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 86. [Los Angeles Timesobituary, 8/7] During the 1980s the dairy falsely advertised that the company's raw milk products were safe and healthier than pasteurized milk. In 1989 a California Superior Court Judge ruled in a suit filed by Consumers Union and the American Public Health Association and later joined by the Alameda County District Attorney that Alta-Dena and its affiliate Stueve's Natural that \"overwhelming evidenceprovedthat Alta-Dena's raw (unpasteurized) milk frequently contains dangerous bacteria that cause serious illness,\" that the company must stop its false advertising, and that the company's milk containers and advertising must carry for ten years conspicuous warnings. The court order also required the dairy to pay $100,000 as restitution to a fund to fight consumer health fraud, and civil penalties of $23,000 to the Alameda County District Attorney. [Raw milk creamed in California court. Nutrition Forum 1989;6(3):21.] KOOP AND \"CAM\" Commentary by William M. London In an editorial on \"The Future of Medicine\" published in the January 11th issue of the journal Science, C. Everett Koop, MD, ScD, former Surgeon General of the United States criticized the \"natural health products industry\" for: keeping its distance from medical research and from clinical medical practice, focusing instead on the short-term marketing advantages derived from keeping herbal and nutritional remedies exempt from any Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of efficacy. Dr. Koop concluded his editorial with a much needed call for accountability to consumers: There is a potential role for some complementary therapies and natural health products in preparing us to meet the challenges of the 21st century. But it can only be played if that industry and its proponents are prepared to meet real scientific and regulatory tests of safety and effectiveness. Unfortunately, Dr. Koop has not spoken out about the irrationality of many methods promoted as \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine (CAM). Nor has he rejected CAM as marketing doublespeak used by promoters to give an image of respectability to nonvalidated and invalidated methods. In July 2001 drkoop.com Inc., which Dr. Koop co-chaired at the time, issued a news release announcing: Marc Micozzi, MD, PhD has joined the company's medical advisory board as principal medical advisor in the areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), demonstrating the company's promise to market only dietary supplement formulas based on scientific evidence.\" The release stated that Drs. Koop and Micozzi \"both believe that unreliable and inconsistent information about supplements available in a burgeoning supplement industry poses a serious public health risk.\" It quoted Dr. Koop: Incorporating Dr. Micozzi's expertise is consumer advocacy at its finest. Marc is helping us to raise the bar for the industry overall by reassuring customers that we've done our homework, so they don't have to. Dr. Micozzi is not an appropriate choice to champion the use of scientific evidence to provide accountability in the health marketplace to consumers. He is the editor of Fundamentals of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1996), which has been used as a textbook in many of the U.S. medical school courses on so-called CAM that have failed to apply principles of skeptical inquiry. At the foundation of Dr. Micozzi's book are the doctrines of postmodernism and cultural relativity, which actually denigrate the value of scientific evidence. For example, on p. 11, he wrote: The point of this discussion is that everyone has beliefs, and all realities are constructed; the facts of science are as culturally contextualized as those of law, theology, or social manners. Scientific fact is only as stable as the logic that produced it and the systems that apply it. [Emphasis in the original.] After failing to note the clear advantages of science as a process of discovery and self-correction for learning about how the cosmos-which includes purported methods of healthcare-operates, one page later he wrote: The practice of cultural relativity is pivotal to the study of alternative medicine, because each alternative system of medicine provides a different set of ideas about the body, disease, and medical reality. Readers will find it much easier to absorb and use this material if they can willingly-even playfully-step aside from their current beliefs and appreciations, to let in new ones. Con artists could not ask for a better worldview for their marks to have. After reading Micozzi's chapter, a quip attributed to George Orwell comes to mind: Some ideas are so silly that only an intellectual could have thought of them. Micozzi's book includes chapters on homeopathy, \"healing touch,\" naturopathy, chiropractic, qigong, and other scientifically indefensible systems of care, with each chapter written by proponents. No entries for quackery or health fraud are present in the book's index. I suppose it would violate the doctrines of postmodernism and cultural relativity to judge anything as quackery or health fraud. The foreword to Micozzi's book was written by none other than Dr. Koop. The former Surgeon General did not embrace either postmodernism or cultural relativity; he clearly stated that scientific testing is essential for advancing healthcare. But overall, his foreword revealed his na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the subject matter in the book. For example, he exaggerated the popularity of various so-called alternative therapies (just as Dean Ornish, MD did in my e-mail exchange with him published in the July/August NCAHF Newsletter). He wrote that a 1993 Harvard Medical School paper in The New England Journal of Medicine found that a third of adult Americans use \"complementary and alternative treatment.\" But the apparent popularity of \"unconventional\" methods in the study depended upon inclusion of survey data on use of practices such as exercise, prayer, self-help groups, and commercial weight loss programs, which are not typically marketed as \"alternative\" or \"complementary,\" and which are not addressed in Micozzi's book. Dr. Koop wrote: This is an opportune time for us to take a second look at such alternative treatment approaches as acupuncture, botanical medicine, homeopathy, and others; not to offer these treatment modalities blindly but to expose them to the scientific method. (p. ix) But the Harvard Medical School data suggested that, of those surveyed, fewer than 1% used acupuncture, only 3% used herbal medicine, and 1% used homeopathy in the past twelve months. And specific claims of clinical efficacy for acupuncture, the vast majority of herbal products, and homeopathy remain, even after numerous clinical investigations, scientifically unsupported. Acupuncturists have no sound basis to promote such notions as points, meridians, and flow of chi. Unless they are adulterated, homeopathic preparations-many of which are formulated with active ingredients repeatedly diluted until no molecules remain in solution-are overpriced placebos. In his foreword (p. x), Dr. Koop suggested that the approach to \"complementary and alternative medicine\" should be President Reagan's credo for foreign policy: \"Trust, but verify!\" Dr. Koop put the cart before the horse. AUTHORITATIVE HERBAL GUIDE PUBLISHED Pharmaceutical Press has published a second edition of Herbal Medicines, a 530-page guide with monographs on 148 herbs. Each monograph covers identifying features, constituents, food use, herbal use, dosage, pharmacologic action, adverse effects, contraindications, warnings, references, and comments that reflect the authors' analysis and advice. The authors note that \"clinical efficacy has not been established for the majority of the herbal ingredients described in this handbook and, in some instances, there is lack of documentation for chemical constituents and for pharmacologic actions.\" They also note that although some toxic herbs have been eliminated from products manufactured in developed countries, \"safety continues to be a matter of concern.\" Nevertheless, they have done their best to determine what ingredients may be suitable for medicinal use. The book is intended primarily for health professionals but its main points are understandable by laypersons.

The study involved 12 healthy volunteers who were exposed to either the magnetic disk or an identically appearing disk that was not magnetic.

Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine 6(1):9-12, 2002] The magnets were manufactured by Magnetherapy, Inc, of Riviera Beach, Florida.

Peter Breggin debunked. Quackwatch has posted an article sharply criticizing psychiatrist Peter R. Breggin, M.D., and The Ritalin Fact Book, Breggin's most recent commentary about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The article notes that the book exaggerates (a) the problem of misdiagnosis, (b) what non-drug treatment can accomplish, and (c) the extent of side effects from Ritalin and similar medications. Breggin has been improperly criticizing mainstream psychiatric practices for many years. The book's back cover describes him as \"the conscience of psychiatry,\" but Quackwatch's board chairman Stephen Barrett, M.D., asserts that it would be more accurate to characterize him as \"a harmful nuisance whose views can undermine trust in the medical profession and frighten people away from helpful treatment.\" [Barrett S.

James Gary Davidson, operator of a Mexican cancer clinic that treated people with a fraudulent magnetic device, has been sentenced to 88 months in a federal prison followed by 2 years of supervised release. In June 2000, he and five others were charged with criminally defrauding investors as well as clinic patients.

Its tests of 634 samples found that 94 (14.8%) contained hormone-related substances, not listed on any label, that would have led to a positive \"doping\" test. Of the 94 samples, 23 contained precursors (building blocks) of both nandrolone and testosterone, 64 contained precursors of testosterone alone, and 7 contained precursors of nandrolone alone. In addition, 66 others (10.4%) returned borderline results for various unlabeled substances. The products were gathered from 215 providers in 13 countries from October 2000 to November 2001. Ninety-one percent of them were purchased in stores or over the Internet. The rest were obtained from the manufacturers. Under the Olympic Movement's rule of strict liability, athletes are responsible for whatever substance is found in their body. The IOC Medical Commission has been warning against the potential risks linked to the use of nutritional supplements since 1997. It has also called for industry and government action to ensure their quality.

A Florida judge has certified a nationwide class composed of consumers in 49 states who were misled into purchasing Cellasene, a herbal concoction that Rexall claimed would remove \"cellulite.\" (Cellulite is a common nonmedical termused to describe the lumpy, irregular fatty deposits that appear as dimpled skin around the hips, buttocks and thighs.)

A judge in Lake County, Ohio, has barred the estranged parents of an eight-year old girl from smoking or permitting anyone else to smoke in her presence. Chinnock WF. [In re Julie Ann, a minor child](http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/documents/98/2002/2002-ohio-4489.doc). Case No. 97-PR-755. Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, Lake County, Ohio] During a hearing on custody and visitation, the judge raised the issue of the danger of secondhand smoke to children and discussed this with the mother and her significant other with whom the child lives. After citing a long list of reports about the dangers of secondhand smoke, the judge concluded: There is a superabundance of scientific evidence that demonstrates secondhand smoke is harmful to children. This evidence of manifold harm from secondhand smoke to children is consistent and robust, and gives rise to a duty upon family courts (and the legislature) to take action to reduce children's involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke. . . . Moreover, perhaps even more significantly, parental smoking is a key factor in children becoming active smokers after involuntarily being passive smokers; children of smokers are almost twice as likely to smoke as children of nonsmoking parents. . . . The overwhelming authoritative scientific evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that a family court that fails to issue court orders restraining persons from smoking in the presence of children under its jurisdiction is failing the children whom the law has entrusted to its care. For these compelling reasons, the mother and father are hereby restrained under penalty of contempt from allowing any person, including themselves, to smoke tobacco in the presence of the minor child Julie Anne. If smoking is allowed in the house in which the child lives or visits on a regular basis, it shall be confined to a room well ventilated to the outside that is most distant from where the child spends most of her time when there. Courts in several states have ruled that secondhand smoke can be a factor in a custody case. Many divorce decrees include agreements to avoid smoking around the children, but this is probably the first case in which the issue was initiated by a judge.

The [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP)](../../07PoliticalActivities/WHC/00.html) issued its final report in March. It is a prayer of praise to CAM, which it never actually defined, despite two years of \"study\". Between the WHCCAMP and the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), there have been, in 10 years, over one billion of our dollars spent, supposedly to research the efficacy, safety, and veracity of \"Alternative Medicine.\" Results? We have \u2014 according to these fine commissions \u2014 debunked exactly nothing. Nothing has been either proven or disproven, according to these expert panels. This lack of any definitive answers to the questions these groups were charged to study does not seem to bother the leadership of either group, who say that it means more study is needed. I was enthusiastic when the Office of Alternative Medicine, the body that evolved into the NCCAM, was formed at the NIH. As a user of several practices that fall under the vague term \"alternative medicine,\" I was glad there would finally be rigorous testing, to separate the wheat from the chaff. NIH authority assured the likelihood of valid research. Or so I thought. I assert that, yes, we should study the few practices and theories in the hodgepodge of so-called CAM that have sound hypotheses amenable to testing. But we should also relegate the majority of CAM practices to the rubbish heap of nonsense where they belong. When a practice and/or its theoretical underpinnings conflict with scientifically verified facts, when it fails scientific testing or is so bizarre that it cannot be tested, it should be discarded from medical and nursing care. Allowing appropriate room for a patients to engage in their religious rituals is an ethical imperative. But granting such religious practices (homeopathy, qigong, therapeutic touch) the status of adjunct medical or nursing therapy is an ethical mistake. Those who continue to push for acceptance of such practices should be called by their proper names: variously cultists, crooks, or quacks. CAM has no definition that the movement can agree upon, nor even that the NCCAM or WHCCAMP can provide. This ambiguity annoys some alt-med advocates, such as meditation teachers who wish they were not associated with the dental alchemists or the alien abductee shrinks. But most folks are happy with the loose coalition of CAM, where the few practices which have either proof or promise lend credibility to the rest, no matter how wacky. Just having a couple of official federal bodies (sort of) in on the fun, not to mention all those endowed CAM departments at prestigious universities, is enough for alternative healers of all varieties to feel validated. Having a department of alternative medicine in your medical college no more proves efficacy than having a theology department proves God, of course. The majority of CAM professors are advocates, rarely skeptics. They share a vague and unchallenged assumption that CAM must mean something. Again, the similarities to theology. Proponents capitalize on associations with major universities while ignoring the standards and conclusions of science...oh, excuse me, \"Western Science,\" that stodgy animal that doesn't understand the quantum essentialism of the spirit-filled world, blah blah blah. This notion of different, culturally defined, distinct and equally valid versions of science is spreading. There is no such thing Western science, Eastern science, Islamic science, Creation science, Chinese science, et cetera. There is only science. These other things may be philosophy, delusion, religion, ideology. They are not science. There is a smiling, even sweet, intellectual dishonesty among the CAM crowd, which they see as openmindedness and cultural sensitivity. This allows them to hold equal belief in an enormous array of nonsense. Going to wellness fairs, folk festivals, new age shops and other venues crawling with CAM practitioners has exposed perhaps the most insidious aspect of this loose movement. In a spirit of equality and inclusion, fairness and access, there is virtually no discrimination. It is a mutual admiration society, with oohs and aahs, hugs and healings for all. It is a sweet and kindly crowd, for the most part. Your personal experience is the highest standard of proof. And they are all recipients as well as providers of services. They accord equal respect for the varied \"healing modalities\" offered by each. Thus a wild crossbreeding of goofy ideas is fertilized in the permissive soil of uncritical enthusiasm. Allergies are diagnosed by applied kinesiology, and cured by waving laser pointers over acupuncture points, supplemented by Chinese herbal medicines and homeopathic preparations. I have been told by a less activist skeptic that these people are not doing any harm, and maybe they stimulate enough placebo to do some good in spite of themselves. I am afraid this is the prevailing attitude among skeptics. I am not so sanguine. Many CAM consumers are fair-weather marks who have physically harmless CAM treatments (Reiki, Polarity, colorpuncture) to get and stay \"in balance.\" This is entertainment and caring physical touch, for the worried well and the just swell. If they get sick, though, they will see a \"real doctor\" as one woman said to me. They are playing a game of make-believe and they almost acknowledge it. It is akin to belief in ghosts, I think. Something harmless, fun to believe, and not to be examined too closely lest it lose its charm. The problem, of course, is knowing where to draw the line. Con artists and misguided crusaders alike can convince a fair-weather mark to have expensive and even dangerous treatments. Laetrile, chelation therapy for atherosclerosis, coffee enemas and chiropractic neck manipulation can be dangerous, and have not proven effective. Indeed, many treatments in medicine that are \"standard of care\" have not been proven in that most definitive of testing protocols, the double blind study; sometimes is not possible.* And a physician may treat outside the standard. But everything that is considered standard-of-care in medicine has been extensively studied and clinically and statistically analyzed, and, unlike vast areas of CAM, must be based on known facts and sound hypotheses. A sound hypothesis is grounded in theoretical reality as assumed based on plenty of experiment and observation. For example, the cause of a particular illness may be unknown, but knowledge should lead one to consider an infectious pathogen or chemical trauma, say, and to not consider a ruffled \"human energy field.\" The HEF is popularly presumed, yet unmeasurable by any objective means, and lots of CAM theory depends on its existence. A house of cards built on a wishes, guesses, and dogma. I have spoken with practitioners who have not developed adequate referral relationships with the rest \u2014 the real \u2014 of medicine. Someone suspicious of medical doctors may depend upon a well-meaning CAM therapist who does not recognize ominous symptoms. If someone has a psychiatric crisis during a \"shamanic journeying\", will the healer/tour guide be able to, or even know to, get the patient help, or try to chant him back? One of the most lethal diseases in the US is major depression. A variety of admittedly imperfect drugs have literally saved lives, but CAM scammers are among the strongest critics of synthesized psychotropics. Everytime I think folks cannot buy another, wilder form of snake oil, they buy the stuff by the case. Just last week, someone assured me that she saw silver fillings turn to gold and porcelain crowns turn to gold crowns. She is, she insists, \"the biggest skeptic\" but she \"saw it with my own eyes.\" I asked her why I have not seen it in the dental journals, told her of many years of similar claims, that our \"own eyes\" are very easy to fool, and that the Indian fakirs/fakers beat the western hemisphere to most of these tricks by centuries. She said she had a different need for evidence than me, and said, \"I saw it . . . you don't have to believe it.\" My response? \"YOU don't have to believe it!\" Preponderance of evidence, experimentation, data (not anecdote) mean that knowledge is not a matter of faith, that you don't have to \"believe it.\" I should have asked why the \"dental healer\" did not just make new undamaged teeth. And what cement does God use under those miraculous gold crowns? The dental healings were all the rage recently in charismatic christian churches, and seem to have been an import from Argentina, where the craze appeared in the 1970's. Along with gold crowns where they had never been before, and cross-shaped gold fillings, there is gold dust, glittering and appearing on folks clothes, hands, hair. Commonly this is accompanied by oil, usually appearing on people's hands. That is the way the reports go. The \"gold dust\" that has been tested is shown to be plastic glitter. A few American preachers have had to admit that the miraculous gold crowns God gave them were actually placed months or years before by their dentists.* Few folks will check their dental history to verify what they already are sure is a miracle. As for cross-shaped fillings, molar fillings on the chewing surface are usually this shape, as decay occurs in the anatomical pits and fissures between the cusps. In human molars and premolars that pattern of nooks and crannies is a cross. In dogs, who have the same number of teeth, but many more cusps on each molar, there is no cross. Fillings made of silver amalgam are shiny when first placed, though may darken with time, and grinding the teeth can continuously burnish these fillings. Shine an incandescent penlight in your mouth and your back teeth may shine with golden crosses, too, as the yellow light bounces off the silver surfaces. Of course, people will see what they desire and expect to see, and reinforce one another in delusion and illusion. It is these dependable aspects of human perception and psychology that honest magicians and unethical charlatans alike depend upon. The \"holy teeth\" stories may seem a silly and absurd example, but these tales share in common with other healing anecdotes some important aspects that illustrate a determined lack of critical inquiry. If these stories were true, it would be easy to test the claims; yet believers show a curious lack of interest, and even hostility to, such independent investigation. It reminds me of the notable lack of concern that Freud's \"hysterics\" showed to their reported afflictions (blindness, paralysis), which led to the theory that the symptoms serve a purpose and the afflicted preferred the symptoms to the responsibilities of wellness. Belief in miracles serves various purposes to believers, and I often encounter folks who don't care about scientific verification. Those rare tests designed by believers to test their beliefs are usually biased and inadequate, built upon common fallacies. These \"researchers\" do not consciously cheat (often), but neither are their lousy techniques challenged by \"peers,\" because their peers do similarly silly work. When I quiz CAM fans on the pseudoscience of their claims, they are almost always surprised. Although they like to claim victim status, oppressed by the mythic, monolithic \"medical establishment,\" they are seldom challenged to their faces with simple friendly skepticism. And I am still surprised that they have not already asked themselves the questions I do. Chatting with an acupuncturist recently who sells a line of homeopathic \"remedies,\" I gave him an aid to understanding the extent of dilution involved in a \"30 C\" homeopathic preparation. So, there is not even a molecule of the original substance in the final remedy. He agreed, then explained that water retains the \"memory\" of the substance originally chosen for \"potentizing\" (dilution). Well, I said, what of all the other substances that water in the remedy has encountered? If water molecules and the component atoms retain \"cellular memory of water,\" what of the places it has been: sewers, other folks bodies, uranium mines, trees? He \"never thought of that.\" I only know it the remedies work, he said, maybe the key is in the \"succussion\" (ritually hitting the bottom of the vial on you palm a specified number of times). I looked at him like he had just sprouted another head and his skin broken out in a plaid. When folks just get absurd, they may need someone to stop making nice-nice and call them on the nonsense. He finally said he did not know exactly HOW it worked but THAT it does work. Well, it is a start, but I hope he will examine his evidence THAT the remedies work. And how does he define \"work\"? I will not defer to the supposed authority of homeopaths who can't talk sense about the field they are so educated in. Likewise psychics, theologians, physicists, or anyone else who makes claims about reality if they cannot back them up with reality. And out of that list, only physicists can do so in their field of expertise, but a physicist is not physics, and can believe in nonsense as religiously as the next guy. ___________________ Mrs. Hand-Boniakowski is a registered nurse and registered dental assistant who works in a dental office in Manchester, Vermont.

Choosing a chiropractor can be difficult because the majority of chiropractors are involved in unscientific practices [1,2]. If you do decide to consult one, begin with a telephone interview during which you explore the chiropractor's attitudes and practice patterns. Positive Signs Try to find a chiropractor whose practice is limited to conservative treatment of back pain and other musculoskeletal problems. Ask your medical doctor for the names of any who fit this description and appear to be trustworthy. Membership in the [Canadian Academy of Manipulative Therapists (CAMT)](http://www.manipulativetherapy.org/) is a very good sign, but the number of chiropractors who belong to this group is small. CAMT's \" [orthopractic guidelines](http://manipulativetherapy.org/info/guidelines.html)\" describe a science-based approach to manipulative therapy. In addition to manual manipulation or stretching of tight muscles or joints, science-based chiropractors commonly use heat or ice packs, ultrasound treatment, and other modalities similar to those of physical therapists. They may also recommend a home exercise program. For most conditions that chiropractic care can help, significant improvement should occur within a few visits. Negative Signs Avoid chiropractors who advertise about \"danger signals that indicate the need for chiropractic care,\" make claims about curing diseases, try to get patients to sign contracts for lengthy treatment, promote regular \"preventive\" adjustments, use scare tactics, or disparage scientific medical treatment or preventive measures such as [immunization](../../03HealthPromotion/immu/immu00.html) or [fluoridation](../../03HealthPromotion/fluoride.html). Avoid chiropractors who purport to diagnose or treat \" [subluxations](chirosub.html),\" who have waiting room literature promoting \"nerve interference\" as an underlying cause of disease, or who post charts or distribute literature suggesting that chiropractic might help nearly every type of health problem. Avoid any chiropractor who routinely performs or orders x-ray examinations of all patients. Most patients who consult a chiropractor do not need them. Be especially wary of full-spine x-ray examinations. This practice has doubtful diagnostic value and involves a large amount of radiation. Avoid chiropractors who \"prescribe\" [dietary supplements](chironutr.html), [homeopathic products](homeo.html), or herbal products for the treatment of disease or who sell any of these products in their offices. For dietary advice, the best sources are physicians and registered dietitians. Avoid chiropractors who offer [Biological Terrain Assessment](Tests/bioter.html), body fat computerized nutritional blood analysis or Hemaview), [testing with a Nervo-Scope twin-scale device called a [Spinal Analysis Machine (S.A.M.)](Tests/sam.html), or any other [dubious diagnostic procedure](Tests/tests.html) on Quackwatch. biomagnetic therapy, [Neuro Emotional Technique (NET)](mentserv.html#NET), or [Neural Organization Technique (NOT)](Tests/ak.html#NOT), or who exhibit a dogmatic attachment to any other specific chiropractic technique or school of thought. Understand that some chiropractic treatments involve significant risk. Spinal manipulations involving sudden movements have greater potential for injury than more conservative types of therapy. Be aware that chiropractic neck manipulation can cause serious injuries. Neck manipulation should be done gently with care to avoid excessive rotation that could damage the patient's vertebral artery. It should never be used unless symptoms indicate a specific need for it. A small percentage of chiropractors advocate neck manipulation to \"balance\" or \"realign\" the spine no matter where the patient's problem is located. I recommend avoiding such chiropractors. Additional Safeguards Never consult a chiropractor unless your problem has been diagnosed by a competent medical practitioner. Don't rely on a chiropractor for diagnosis. Although some chiropractors know enough to avoid diagnostic difficulty, there is no simple way for a consumer to determine who can do so. As an additional safeguard, ask any chiropractor who treats you to discuss your care with your medical doctor. Remember that although manipulative therapy has value in treating back pain and may relieve other musculoskeletal conditions, chiropractors are not the only source of manipulative therapy. Physical therapists, many [osteopathic physicians](../../04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html), and a small number of medical doctors do it also.
