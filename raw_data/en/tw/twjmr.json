Our environment has become incredibly polluted over the last 50 years, brought on by industrial farming practices and general pollution of air, land and sea. When you pair this with stealth infections and compromised gut health, it's a recipe for disaster when it comes to your health. Additionally, we are exposed to many more man-made chemicals (so-called xenobiotics ) today - present in medications, beauty products, cleaning supplies, residual pesticides in foods - seriously increasing nutrient requirements for proper detox! You see, without consistent detoxification support, these toxins accumulate inside your body, ultimately triggering more serious disorders that affect hormone balance, digestion, joint health, and proper mental function. Yet oftentimes, people dealing with these ailments will turn to medications to merely address symptoms - without addressing the true root cause of their chronic dis-ease and merely adding to their toxic load! Detox During Weight Loss Proper detoxification support is also key when undergoing any weight loss, because many fat-soluble toxins (stored in fatty tissues) get released and need to be dealt with. Yet weight loss plans oftentimes don't support the three phases of detox to allow your liver and other organs to metabolize and excrete xenobiotics - and that's one of the reasons why many people don't feel any better after a standard juicing plan. Plus, conventional weight-loss wisdom also doesn't take your gut health, hormone balance, and sleep patterns into account to achieve optimal results. Each person has unique health challenges and may be suffering from specific imbalances that might be blocking weight loss. Thus, there is no \"one diet fits all\" plan. Finally, genetic factors also play a role in how \"healthy\" some foods are for your body. This is why some dieting styles work well for people and not for others. \"Bio-individually\" has to be taken into account when using food as medicine! Stuck and Can't Lose Weight? In my practice, I find that a patient's microbiome and impaired gut health are one of the key stumbling blocks keeping them from losing stubborn weight. The bacteria that make up our microbiome help digest our food, protect our immune system, fight harmful bacteria and viruses, and produce important nutrients like B12, thiamine (B1) and riboflavin. They also produce important neurotransmitters that allow for proper brain function (this is why people with poor gut health report brain fog). So when people attempt to lose weight without also addressing underlying digestive and hormonal imbalances, it makes it next to impossible to lose that stubborn weight. That's why unlike in conventional practices, our functional medicine-based approach to detox and weight loss is a far more in-depth approach: Our goal is to unlock vibrant health for our patients by giving them medically-backed cleansing strategies to rid their bodies of toxins and promote a healthy diet and lifestyle that they can use for a lifetime. We also include in-depth testing to see where their digestive or hormonal imbalance lie, so we can craft a personalized treatment plan unique to each patient's individual needs. Depending on your situation, we may also recommend intermittent fasting protocols like Prolon to regenerate stem cells, slowing the aging process, protecting against chronic illness, improving skin tone, and aid in easier weight loss.
