Practitioners believe that stress, pain and illness can alter the body's flow of energy, causing an imbalance in one or more areas of the system. Too much or too little energy in an area of the body can interrupt the flow of energy resulting in physical symptoms. Energy therapy providers hope to restore your child's healthy energy flow by opening, connecting, and balancing their energy system. Energy therapy will be performed in a gentle and safe manner. An energy therapy practitioner will place their hands on, or several inches above, your child's body in series of locations to shift the balance and energy flow. Most children experience little to no pain. Your child may feel warmth, cold, tingling, or they may see colors. Most children describe getting energy therapy as pleasant. Your child's treatment will be done by a provider who has completed training in energy therapy, as well as training in pediatrics. The number of treatments depends on symptoms and energy flow. The session will last anywhere from 15-60 minutes, based on you or your child's needs. Energy therapy is safe when performed by properly trained providers. Serious side effects are very rare. The energy therapy at CHOP is closely managed to ensure your child's safety, and our energy therapists are skilled in caring for children. Most children feel relaxed and calm after a session.
