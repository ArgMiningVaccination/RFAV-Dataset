[2](#B2) [3](#B3)Postmenopause refers to the period of life after menopause has occurred. According to Webster New World Medical Dictionary, \"it is the time after which a woman has experienced 12 consecutive month of amenorrhoea. [4](#B4)According to Indian Menopause Society research, there are about 65 million Indian women in the age group of 45 years. Average age of menopause is around 48 years but it strikes Indian women at the age of 30 to 35 years. So menopausal health demands even higher priority in Indian scenario. [3](#B3) [4](#B4)The physiological, emotional and psychological changes leave women vulnerable in total and reduce the quality of life (QOL). A study was conducted among the postmenopausal women members and nonmembers of elderly support association reveals that mean total score of QOL of member of the association was significantly greater than non-members. There was a significant relationship between QOL and membership of the association (P < 0.05). [1](#B1) [5](#B5)Hence there is a growing need to have counseling and training program by the professionals to improve women's health, reducing problems and enhancing QOL in menopause period. It was evident from a study findings which aimed to investigate the effect of counseling on QOL shows that before the counseling session, mean \u00b1 standard deviation for QOL in experimental group was 101.2 \u00b1 31.4 and it was significantly decreased to 96.9 \u00b1 27.0 after intervention (P < 0.05). While no significant change was observed in the control group (from 98.9 \u00b1 35.5 [7](#B7) [8](#B8)A wide gap in the knowledge has been documented on the women from developed and developing countries. And this gap is even wider in women among rural and urban communities. In this regard, this study aimed to compare the QOL of postmenopausal woman in rural and urban areas and to improve it through a health promotion awareness program. Materials and Methods Results 1. Sample characteristics 2. Assessment of different domains QOL of postmenopausal women in rural and urban area [Table 1](#T1), the QOL score of physical domain was 71.5% in urban and 74.7% in rural with difference 2.8, in sexual domain was 71.0% in urban 72.0% among rural women with difference 1.0%, in vasomotor domain was 45.2% in rural and in urban 43.0% with difference 2.2, in psychological domain was 41.8% in rural and in urban 42.6% with difference 0.8. 3. Comparing the QOL of postmenopausal women in urban and rural areas [Table 2](#T2)shows that the mean QOL score (X2 = 27.24) of rural area was higher than the mean QOL score (X1 = 26.34) of urban area. The calculated 't' value (t = 0.86) is lesser than the table value ('t98'=1.980). The computed 't' value shows that there is no significant difference in the QOL. This indicates that there is no significant difference between the mean QOL score of postmenopausal women in rural and urban areas. 4. Association between the QOL of postmenopausal women and selected demographic variables Discussion [9](#B9)Similar cross-sectional descriptive study was done at Iran also shows that the participants were over 55 years. [1](#B1)A study conducted in Karnataka shows that 56% of women from rural area. The present study reveals that the physical symptoms were more among rural women (7.71%) compared to urban women. This includes symptoms such as feeling tired, aches and pains, joint pain and bloating. This could be the lifestyles and status of women at home. The women continue to work for the family in spite of their poor health. [10](#B10)Similarly psychological symptoms such as loss of memory, anxiety, feeling lonely, sadness was reported more (42.6%) among urban women. Vasomotor and sexual domain the difference in QOL score is very minimal among the rural and urban women. [11](#B11)Similar findings were reported in a study which shows that the rural women had less prevalence of anxiety attack (7.3% vs. 4.2%) than urban women. [12](#B12)The study findings were differ in a study conducted by Hakimi et al. [13](#B13)shows that the mean scores of menopausal symptoms and their subscales showed significantly higher scores in the physical and psychological subscales in the urban women, while the rural women had significantly higher scores in the concern subscale. Another clinical trial findings conducted in Iran shows that there was significant difference in the mean of QOL scores between the 2 groups in immediately after the educational intervention and 3 months after the educational intervention in dimension of vasomotor, psychosocial, sexual and physical (P < 0.001). [14](#B14) [15](#B15)This was supported by a study conducted in Iran showed that the knowledge and performance of spouses in the menopausal health training program group were significantly higher 3 months after intervention (P < 0.0001). The QOL in women in the menopausal health training program group was higher 3 months after intervention (P < 0.0001). The mean scores of psychological and physical domains were significantly lower in the intervention group (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively). [16](#B16)This is highlighted in a study conducted to find the relationship between the women's attitude and QOL revealed that the women whose relationships with their husband were negatively affected had higher vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual symptom scores (4.2 \u00b1 1.7, 3.7 \u00b1 1.7, 3.5 \u00b1 1.5, 3.5 \u00b1 1.8). Similarly, the vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual symptom scores were high in women who declared an unfavorable relationship with their children (4.5 \u00b1 1.8, 3.8 \u00b1 1.6, 3.7 \u00b1 1.4, [8](#B8) [17](#B17) [18](#B18)It infers that the postmenopausal symptoms experienced by women are same, irrespective of their place of residence. The investigator felt that the reason could be the influence of mass media such as TV, radio, newspapers, and social media which have deep rooted impact on the life styles of the people everywhere. In olden days the women had a close knitted interaction with the family members with whom they were sharing their reproductive problems and issues. [3](#B3)The present study also reveals that most (64%) of the women were from nuclear family. Since the social structure has changed the trend of joint family to nuclear family the women depend on the mass media to know about their health problems. "}
