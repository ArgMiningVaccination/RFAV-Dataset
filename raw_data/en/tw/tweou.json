PLEASE SELECT A are two main groups of practitioners of Acupuncture in the UK. Those who work primarily as specialist acupuncturists and those such as physiotherapists or doctors whom use varying levels of acupuncture as an adjunct to their normal practice. The British Acupuncture Council (BACC) is by far the largest group representing specialist acupuncture. The British Medical Acupuncture Society (BMAS) mainly represents doctors and the Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists (AACP), physiotherapists who also use acupuncture. The level of training can vary greatly in both the BMAS and AACP so asking the practitioner what and how long their training was may be helpful.

Alexander Technique practitioners refer to themselves as teachers and their clients as students. Established in 1958 The Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique (STAT) is the main body representing the profession. They merged in 1999 with the Alexander Teaching Network, bringing over 800 members together under one body.

In 1864 what is now the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (NIMH) was established. In modern times there has been renewed interest in herbal medicine. The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, established in 1987, represents those prescribing oriental herbs and applying eastern approaches to diagnosis. Although highly effective as a form of complementary medicine, Chinese herbal medicine has been associated recently with some toxicity problems. Although the problem is on a very small scale it is recommended to seek treatment only from members of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine rather than High Street pharmacies. National Institute of Medical Herbalists Medicine (RCHM) Office 5, Ferndale specialist homoeopathic practitioners practise the profession of homoeopathy. Homoepathy achieved recognition in the original National Health Act of 1950. Five hospitals in Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Tunbridge Wells have provided homoeopathic wards. Doctors practising homoeopathy belong to the Faculty of Homoeopathy. The Society of Homoeopaths (SH) is the main organisation for specialist homoeopaths.

A recent move in 1998, which formed the United Kingdom Confederation of Hypnotherapy organisations (UK CHO), has improved the situation. Hypnotherapy remains relatively popular with doctors and dentists. The British Society of Medical and Dental Hypnosis represents the interests of many of these practitioners.

An umbrella group, the British Association for Massage Therapy, combines the four largest groups. Many massage therapists also apply aromatherapy so there may be an overlap between members of the different groups.

Although some naturopaths use dietary supplements as well, the term as used in Britain is very different from the \"Naturopath\" in the USA and Australia, where it is used to describe practitioners applying a range of complementary and alternative treatments around a core of dietary advice and supplementation. In Britain, osteopathy has historically been linked with naturopathy and the General Council and Register of Naturopaths has had an overlapping membership with what is now the General Osteopathic Council. There are a number of professional bodies representing nutritional therapy. The British Association of Nutritional Therapists was formed in 1997 and represents a fairly large number of practitioners. In 1999 the Nutritional Therapy Council was established. This body focuses on educational standards and developing national occupational standards for the profession.
