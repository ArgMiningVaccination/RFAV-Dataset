When a healthy body encounters disease-causing organisms or pathogens, it activates its immune response. Antibodies released by the immune system eliminate antigens on the pathogens. You can boost the immune system by making dietary and lifestyle changes in your life. These changes may fortify the body's natural resistive forces to fight disease-causing organisms and harmful pathogens. Alternative treatments such as chiropractic care may help improve the immune system by treating subluxations. Get Quality Sleep You may fall sick if you don't get the needed amount of sleep or suffer from poor quality sleep. Studies show people sleeping less than six hours have more chances of getting cold than those who sleep for more than six hours. Getting adequate sleep strengthens your natural immunity. You tend to sleep more when you're sick, allowing the body's immune system to fight sickness and help recuperate faster. Studies indicate infants need up to 14 hours of sleep, teens 8-10 hours, and adults require to sleep for at least seven hours. Moderate Exercise May Boost Immune System Moderate exercise such as walking may improve the immune system, while prolonged intense exercise may decrease immunity. When people suffering from low immunity do moderate exercises daily, the efficacy of vaccines improves. People doing moderate exercise daily may see a reduction in inflammation and regular immune cell regeneration. Chiropractic Treatment Chiropractic care may help the patient's overall health. Although spinal adjustments may relieve people suffering from neck and back pain, these adjustments may help improve the immune system. The immune system and the spine are connected, and when the spine is not aligned, you may experience several discomforts such as back and neck pain due to a non-responsive immune system. The immune system and the nervous system are deeply intertwined and work together to produce optimal body responses. Both systems communicate with each other by releasing hormones and messenger molecules that help them interact with other body organs. Immune system talks to the brain of any foreign antigens in the body. The brain sends a signal to the nervous system, which reacts. The immune system creates an immune response to foreign antigens. Chiropractic treatment may correct the spinal abnormalities known as vertebral subluxations caused due to the compression of nerve pathways. The nervous system controls the body functions, including the immune system; you can see a positive effect of chiropractic care on immune function. Thus making spinal adjustments with chiropractic care may help boost the immune system. Chiropractors at The Joint Chiropractic may help enhance your immune system.
