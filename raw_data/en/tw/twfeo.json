Balance is established through good nutrition and physical activity, as well as healthy functioning of the complex systems working hard inside your body to maintain equilibrium. Asula's Naturopathic Physicians use lab testing and lifestyle analysis to understand and prescribe treatment programs for the healthy functioning of your hormonal, digestive and detoxification systems. Naturopathic balancing is sought for a variety of reasons, including physical pain, digestive health, hormone balancing and detoxification. Physical Pain To address physical pain a naturopath will help a patient restore hormonal health and reduce inflammation so that the body is better able to manage the micro-traumas we endure every day in our bodies, or recover from big injuries. This can be done through; - Balancing cortisol levels, a hormone that controls inflammation in our bodies, - Anti-inflammatory herbs and supplements, like turmeric and fish oils. - Diet interventions like taking out inflammatory foods such as sugar and trans fats, and adding in a lot of vegetables and fresh whole foods. - Managing lifestyle; getting enough sleep, reducing stress and drinking enough water Attending to endocrine and digestive systems will allow your body's natural healing abilities to be at full capacity. This power-packed prescription is sure to help your body recover in no time! Nutrition and Digestive Health Whether you are dealing with healthy weight management or digestive disorders such as IBS, constipation and bloating, Asula can help. Good digestion is essential to your body's health. Your doctor will meet with you to conduct a detailed examination of your unique nutritional needs, covering concepts of healthy nutrition, food allergies, nutrient absorption, meal planning and behavioral modifications. Asula will work with you to develop a realistic nutrition plan to optimize the functioning of your digestive system. It is amazing how much a person's health can improve by simply creating a daily diet plan that is right for their unique body type and lifestyle. Hormone Balancing Through salivary and blood hormone testing and analysis, we assess stress hormones such as cortisol as well as sex hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Imbalanced levels of these hormones are often correlated with adrenal fatigue, infertility, pre-menstrual syndrome, lack of sex drive, exhaustion, insomnia, hypoglycemia, weight gain, weight loss, and other symptoms. Consultation and test results will indicate hormone excess and/or deficiency, which is then assessed to formulate an action plan involving such remedies as: natural bio-identical hormones, herbs, diet and lifestyle recommendations, nutritional supplements and patient education. It is also important to evaluate and correct circadian rhythms in order to maintain healthy adrenal functioning. Detoxification Oftentimes the first step in regaining balance is cleansing your body of residual toxins that are sustaining imbalances. Symptoms like autoimmune problems, rashes, foggy-headedness, depression, and poor memory signal the need for a detoxification treatment. Our Doctors of Naturopathy will identify toxicity levels through symptom evaluation and diagnostic tools like hair and urine tests. Levels of toxicity are treated with dietary cleanses, supplements and education aimed to decrease toxin exposure. Select any service for a detailed description.
