If a child under two years old gets diarrhoea, it is likely that rotavirus is to blame. Illness is usually brief, but severe dehydration is possible and deaths caused by this virus are common in low-income countries. An estimated 215,000 children die from rotavirus infection every single year. How does a tiny virus, 100 times smaller than a red blood cell, have such a devastating impact on the host? Rotavirus enters the body through the gut and invades cells of the intestine. Once inside the cell, rotavirus makes copies of itself using the cell replication machinery. New viral particles then burst out of the cell, killing the cell in the process. This results in malabsorption of water and nutrients, and consequently diarrhoea. Vaccination Thankfully, the number of cases of rotavirus in the UK has dramatically fallen since 2013 (figure 1). This was the year that the NHS introduced the new rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization schedule. This vaccine is given at 8 weeks and 12 weeks old to all children. The vaccine was first licensed in the US in 2006, and is now used in almost 100 countries worldwide. All vaccines work by mimicking a real infection, and tricking our body into mounting a protective immune response. One of the most important cells to respond to vaccines are B cells. There are billions of B cells in our body, but only a tiny number are specific for each virus. If a B cell finally meets a virus it can recognize, it will rapidly replicate. These activated B cells then make proteins called antibodies (figure 2). Antibodies essentially act like flags; they bind to viral particles and signal to other parts of the immune system that the particle needs destroying. Vaccine-induced antibodies circulate in the blood stream and protect the individual from any subsequent virus infection. Despite being a great success in many affluent countries, the rotavirus vaccine is less than 50% effective in many low-income countries. These are exactly the places where vaccination is needed most. Many researchers and pharmaceutical companies are therefore working towards developing better rotavirus vaccines. These need to be highly safe, as well as able to protect against a multitude of different rotavirus stains. Rotavirus and antibodies We know that antibodies are produced in response to rotavirus vaccination, but we don't exactly know how these antibodies are targeting the virus for destruction. This effectively means that nobody is really sure how the rotavirus vaccine works. This makes improving the vaccine incredibly challenging. My research focuses on understanding the interactions between antibodies and rotavirus; if we know which antibodies are most important, vaccines can be formulated that favour stimulation of these types of antibodies. Furthermore, it will be possible to test vaccinated individuals to see whether they have the most useful type of antibody. Rotavirus is an unusual virus in that it is made up from three different layers (figure 3). The outermost layer or 'capsid' is shed when rotavirus enters cells. This reveals the inner capsid, which is never seen outside of the cell. Humans that are vaccinated with rotavirus make antibodies against every different part of the viral particle, including the inner capsid. It has long been thought that antibodies only work outside of cells - so why do people vaccinated with rotavirus make antibodies targeting the hidden proteins? Antibodies inside cells - 'intracellular antibodies' A new body of work at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus has shown that antibodies can also work inside cells. This has been described as a 'paradigm-shift' in our understanding of antibody activity. An intracellular antibody receptor (figure 4) called TRIM21 exists inside every cell in our body and acts as a last-line of defence against virus infection. During my Junior Research Fellowship I have been working at the LMB to apply the very latest understanding of antibody activity to the global health issue that is rotavirus infection. My research has focused on answering three main questions: 1. What are rotavirus-specific antibodies doing inside cells? To study how intracellular antibodies are working I have developed a way of artificially introducing antibodies into cells in the lab; cells are mixed with antibodies of interest and given a small electric shock. I then measure how easy it is for cells to be infected with rotavirus. I have shown that multiple strategies are used by antibodies to block virus replication, including activation of TRIM21. 2. How are antibodies getting inside cells in the first place? This is a question I have been studying with third year Magdalene medical student Olivia Stupart. During this past summer we have been developing a new system in the lab that enables us to study the receptors that move antibodies into cells. We have then used CRISPR technology to eliminate these antibody receptors from cells, in order to determine how important they are. 3. Could measuring these intracellular antibodies be useful for testing vaccine efficacy? To tell whether any vaccine has worked, a simple blood test is usually run that can measure whether virus-specific antibodies are present. These tests are particularly valuable during development of new vaccines, allowing responses to trial vaccines to be monitored closely. However, there is no universally reliable blood test for rotavirus vaccination at present. This means that the only way to be sure a new rotavirus vaccine works, is to wait and see whether a vaccinated child gets rotavirus infection. This means clinical trials often last for years and end up being very costly. By measuring the activity of intracellular antibodies, I have shown the number of these antibodies present in mice correlates with whether the individual is protected from infection. Preliminary data using human blood samples looks promising, so the next step is to test this assay in a large cohort of human patients. Moving forwards A major outstanding question in the rotavirus field is why don't rotavirus vaccines work in low-income countries? Multiple hypotheses have been put forward, ranging from malnutrition and immunosuppression to concurrent disease and the effect of maternal immunity. My future research aims to focus on the impact of maternal immunity, in particular, maternal antibodies. These are the antibodies transferred from mother to infant across the placenta and in breast milk. These serve to protect children from infectious diseases. However, it has been known for decades that these maternal antibodies can block responses to vaccination. As I continue into the next phase of my research career, I hope to unravel how maternal antibodies can be both good and bad for rotaviruses. by Dr Sarah Caddy (2015) "}
