Principled international collaboration and foreign contributions are critical to the success of the U.S. research enterprise. Some individuals and foreign governments violate core principles of integrity and pose risks to research security. Hidden diversions of intellectual property weaken the U.S. innovation base and threaten our security and economic competitiveness. The U.S. Government is taking deliberate steps to address risks to research security and integrity while maintaining an open and collaborative enterprise. 2INTEGRITY OF THE RESEARCH ENTERPRISE RESTS UPON CORE PRINCIPLES AND VALUES 3Integrity of the research enterprise rests upon core principles and values Openness and transparency enable productive collaboration and help ensure appropriate disclosure of potential conflicts of interest and commitment. Accountability and honesty help acknowledge errors and correct behaviors that can hamper progress. Impartiality and objectivity protect against improper influence and distortion of scientific knowledge. Respect helps create an environment where all can be heard and contribute. Freedom of inquiry allows individual curiosity to guide scientific discovery. Reciprocity ensures scientists and institutions exchange materials, knowledge, data, access to facilities and natural sites, and training in a way that benefits collaborating partners proportionally. Merit -based competition helps ensure a level playing field where the best ideas and innovations can advance. 4Individuals, institutions, and governments share responsibility for integrity in the research enterprise 5Principles of integrity for responsible individuals and institutions: Openness and Transparency Accountability Impartiality and Objectivity Honesty Respect Principles of integrity for responsible governments, reflected in U.S. government policy: Openness and Transparency Accountability Freedom of inquiry Reciprocity Merit -Based Competition Behaviors that violate these shared principles jeopardize the integrity of the research enterprise.PRINCIPLED INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESS 6International science is frontier science Enables cutting -edge research that no nation can achieve alone Strengthens scientific and diplomatic relations Leverages resources, including funding, expertise, and facilities Trains a robust S&T workforce capable of solving global problems International students and scholars contribute significantly to the U.S. research enterprise 7Elizabeth E.

A conflict of commitment is a situation in which an individual accepts or incurs conflicting obligations between or among multiple employers or other entities. Many institutional policies define conflicts of commitment as conflicting commitments of time and effort, including obligations to dedicate time in excess of institutional or funding agency policies or commitments. Other types of conflicting obligations, including obligations to improperly share information with, or withhold information from, an employer or funding agency, can also threaten research security and integrity, and are an element of a broader concept of conflicts of commitment. Examples of behaviors that increase risk and can harm the research enterprise 11Irresponsible Conduct that Violates Funding Agency and Institutional Policies: Failures to disclose: Financial conflicts of interest Conflicts of commitment External employment arrangements Financial support that overlaps with U.S. funding Shadow laboratories or other parallel research activities Diversion of intellectual property Peer review violations Examples of Behaviors that May Violate Laws: Theft or diversion of materials and intellectual capital Grant Fraud Potential Impacts: Distorted decisions about appropriate use of taxpayer funds Hidden transfers of information, know -how, data, and time Diversion of proprietary information and pre-publication data to foreign entities Loss of Federal research funding , or need to replace key personnel Damage to the reputation of research institutions and researchers Reputational, career, and financial detriment to individuals Loss of public trust in the research enterprise Impacts: Distorts decisions about appropriate use of taxpayer funds Hidden transfers of information, know - how, data, person - timeCase study 1: Undisclosed conflicts of interest and commitment 12Undisclosed founder and primary shareholder of a publicly traded Chinese biotech company that specialized in the same work he performed at UCSD Multiple undisclosed subsidiaries and additional companies in the U.S., China, and the Cayman Islands Undisclosed member of a foreign government sponsored talent recruitment program.

Undisclosed members of a foreign government sponsored talent recruitment of Interest Unreported Conflict of Commitment Six scientists at the Moffitt Cancer Center, including the President and CEO and the Center Director, resigned due to violations of conflict of interest rules through their work with China . Researchers resigned from U.S. institution. The Center returned more than $1 million in state money.Unreported Conflict of Commitment Violation of Peer Review ProcessImpacts: Loss of public trust in the research enterprise Distorts decisions about appropriate use of taxpayer funds Diversion of proprietary information and pre - publication data to foreign entitiesCase study 3: Distortion of the p eer review process 14Researcher served as a designated peer reviewer for funding agency grants. Undisclosed participant in a foreign -government sponsored Talent Recruitment Program Diverted proprietary information: Emailed grant applications to scientists in China and to some U.S.- based persons Researcher instructed one recipient of the information to \" keep it to yourself \" Stated in another note, \" Here is the bone and meet [sic] you need .\" Emailed a grant application to a Chinese academic institution offering: \" Some methods you may learn from this proposal . Keep this confidential .\" Researcher was let go from MD Anderson. Case as reported by the Cancer Letter, April 26, 201915Nine hackers working for the Mabna Institute, an Iranian government -sponsored entity, were indicted in 2018 for allegedly hacking into at least 144 U.S. universities and 176 universities in 21 foreign countries. Hackers allegedly stole 31.5 terabytes -about 15 billion pages - of academic data. Collectively, the victim universities spent an estimated $3.4 billion to acquire the data. Hackers waged a phishing campaign that successfully compromised the accounts of some 8,000 accounts to steal research and other academic data, such as journals, theses, dissertations and electronic books. Theft or diversion of materials and intellectual capitalImpacts: Diversion of proprietary information and pre - publication data to foreign entitiesCase study 4: Cyber theft of data Charged by DOJ on March 23, 2018 for conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized access to a computer, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Defendant(s) are presumed innocent until proven guilty.16Researcher found guilty of conspiring to commit federal grant fraud, making false statements, and obstruction by falsification Founded a U.S. company and applied for DOE and NSF grants to fund his U.S. company to conduct research between 2014 -2016; at least some research had already been completed in China, including by researcher's own \"Satellite Lab\" Signed undisclosed five -year employment agreement with Chinese University in 2014 to serve as Director of Research InstituteGrant Fraud \"Shadow Lab\"Impacts: Distorts decisions about appropriate use of taxpayer funds Researcher was found guilty on February 21, 2019. Case # 7:17- cr-00073 (Western District of Virginia)Unreported Conflict of CommitmentCase study 5: Criminal grant fraud RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENT SPONSORED TALENT RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS 17Some government-sponsored talent recruitment programs are problematic A foreign government sponsored talent recruitment program is an effort directly or indirectly organized, managed, or funded by a foreign government to recruit science and technology professionals or students (regardless of citizenship or national origin). Many countries sponsor talent recruitment programs for legitimate purposes of attracting researchers in targeted fields Many programs utilize legitimate means of attracting talent, including offering research fellowships and grants to incentivize researchers to physically relocate However, some programs encourage or direct unethical and criminal behaviors Contracts for participation in some programs, including some sponsored by the Chinese government, include language that creates conflicts of commitment and/or conflicts of interest for researchers Requirements to attribute awards, patents, and projects to the foreign institution, even if conducted under U.S. funding Requirements to recruit or train other talent recruitment plan members, circumventing merit- based processes Requirements to replicate or transfer U.S .-funded work in another country 18Transparency and full disclosure are essential to properly assess risks.Example talent recruitment contract : Undisclosed employment 19U.S.- funded researcher working full time at a U.S. institution Undisclosed employment in another country for 9 months out of the year (Foreign institution) (U.S. -funded researcher)U.S.- funded researcher Foreign institutionU.S.- funded researcher(Foreign institution) Foreign institutionForeign institution (U.S. -funded researcher)Foreign institution Foreign institution U.S. researcherExample talent recruitment contract : Directed output 20U.S. -funded researcher is party to an undisclosed contract with a foreign institution U.S. researcher is obligated to file 2 -3 foreign patents within 3 years. The nondisclosure of this contract does not give the university or the Federal funding agency knowledge of its patent rights. In some cases U.S.- funded researchers have secured foreign patents based at least in part on their U.S. -funded work.(Foreign institution)(U.S.- funded researcher) (U.S.- funded researcher)U.S. Government employee signed an undisclosed talent program contract with a Foreign institution. Contract raises concerns of preferential treatment to certain potential students Undisclosed commitment of the U.S. institution to a foreign institution Researcher received undisclosed support from foreign research team(U.S. -funded researcher) (Foreign institution) (Foreign institution) (Foreign institution)(U.S. -funded researcher)Example talent recruitment contract : Other support 21These conditions are problematic for the U.S. Government and the Research Institution. This contract cedes credit from the work conducted by a federally funded researcher and employee of a U.S. institution to a foreign institution. These conditions may be problematic for the researcher -both the foreign institution and foreign government need to approve the application for termination of the contract. Penalty for breach of contract is not clearly defined.

Example talent recruitment contract : Objectives 25 U.S.- funded researcher is party to an undisclosed contract with a foreign government Foreign institution dictates that the U.S. -based laboratory be moved to China; U.S. institution unaware of this commitmentU.S.- funded Researcher(Foreign institution) U.S.- funded Researcher(Foreign institution)Example talent recruitment contract : Problematic for r esearcher and institution 26Imposed secrecy Stringent restrictions on termination of Contract -the U.S. researcher cannot unilaterally terminate the contract. U.S. -funded Researcher U.S. -funded Researcher Foreign institutionHow widespread are behaviors that threaten research security and integrity? 27Inquiries from the National Institutes of Health are currently the most public. As of June 2020 : Sent notices to over 87 academic and research institutions Identified concerns regarding more than 189 scientists Nearly all in pre -clinical research, across many fields of biomedicine, all across the United States The National Science Foundation's inspector general has reported a 20% increase in caseload in the last yearData are incomplete but suggest widespread and systemic activity across geographic location and research discipline Incidents of concern are not unique to any one background, ethnicity, or nationality Other countries have identified similar behaviors in their research enterprises, and we are engaging with them to reach common awareness and share best practices Many cases of concern have involved individuals with undisclosed participation in foreign government sponsored talent recruitment programsComprehensive risk assessment and risk mitigation require a range of measures and response mechanisms. 28Timeline of Case # 7:17- cr-00073 (Western District of Virginia) 2018In many instances, institutions have taken administrative action to address inappropriate behaviors. Prosecutions are consequential, but are not a substitute for an effective internal compliance program.Criminal prosecutions provide an important but incomplete measure of research security riskSome government s ponsored talent programs are adapting in response to growing awareness of the risks they pose Translated from a 2018 local talents program contract, sponsored by the Chinese National Natural Science Fund Commission: III: Items to Pay Attention To In order to further do a better job in ensuring the safety/security of overseas talents, [we] ask the organizations not use e -mails in sending out notifications for interview/defense . Instead, they should use telephone calls or faxes in giving notifications in the name of inviting [the candidates] to come back to China to attend academic conferences and forums, t he words \"1000 Persons Plan\" shall not appear in the written notifications. 29 U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTION 30Balancing Openness with SecurityU.S. government coordination to address key areas that impact the American research enterprise On May 6, 2019 The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy established the Joint Committee on the Research Environment (JCORE) through the National Science Technology Council to address four critical issues related to the research enterprise. Four subcommittees focus efforts on: 1.Research Security : Balancing openness with strengthening the security of our research enterprise 2.Reducing Research Administrative Workload : Reducing the administrative burdens that impede critical scientific research while ensuring we have appropriate accountability and oversight 3.Rigor and Integrity in Research : Fostering a research enterprise that upholds freedom of inquiry, reciprocity, and promotes positive incentives that underscore sound research practices 4.Safe and Inclusive Research Environments: Ensuring that the research environment is an environment that is merit -based, safe, inclusive, equitable, and welcoming to allStrengthening the security of the U.S. research e nterprise The JCORE Research Security Subcommittee aims to protect America's research enterprise without compromising our values or our ability to maintain the innovation ecosystem that has underpinned our leadership in science and technology. The Subcommittee is comprised of over 20 science and security Federal agencies, and co -chaired by White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy. Research Security Subcommittee Focus Areas: 1. Appropriate and effective risk management 2. Consistent, coordinated, and effective outreach to and engagement with academic and research institutions 3. Coordinated guidance for Federal agencies 4. Recommendations for academic and research institutions 32JCORE research security subcommittee actions Developing guidance for Federal departments and agencies Developing best practices for universities and other research institutions Letter to the United States Research Community Developing education and outreach materials that highlight examples of risks to research Engagement with Congress Coordinating with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on the Science and Security Roundtable as directed by the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act Individual agencies are also taking policy actions in line with their mission 33 Letter to the United States Research CommunityEngagement and outreach White House Summit on November 5th, 2019 Convened more than 150 people from industry, academia, and the Federal government Provided and collected insights on the work of Joint Committee on the Research Environment (JCORE) Request for Information on the American Research Environment on November 26, 2019, inviting the research community to provide input on all four JCORE focus areas Extensive interagency outreach to hundreds of institutions, faculty , and students across the country. Deep engagement with associations and societies, and with international partners. 34 White House National JCORE Summit 5 Nov 2019Photo Credit: Erik JacobsAdditional Administration Action Highlights 35Presidential proclamation to block certain graduate level and above Chinese nationals associated with entities in China that implement or support China's Military -Civil Fusion strategy from using F and J visas to enter the United States. The National Institutes of Health issued a Statement , sent letters to grantee institutions requesting information about undisclosed foreign ties ,and since 2018 has identified concerns regarding more than 189 scientists . The National Science Foundation issued a Dear Colleague letter , made policy changes to mitigate risks through changes to proposal submission requirements , and is acting on the recommendations of a study by the independent JASON group on research security. The JASON study identifies the threat of foreign influence as a complex issue that 'can be addressed within the framework of research integrity'. The Department of Energy issued a directive prohibiting participat ion by DOE laboratory personnel in talent recruitment programs sponsored by certain foreign governments of risk and established an S&T risk matrix to help protect identified emerging research and technology areas. Additional Administration Action Highlights 36The Department of State is engaging with partners to raise awareness of the risks of foreign interference on research integrity and security. As part of its China Initiative , the Department of Justice developed an enforcement strategy that combines outreach and enforcement to address threats posed by non -traditional collectors, including in academia. Recent criminal prosecutions alleging fraud and false statements by academics have highlighted concerning patterns of behavior, many of which involve Chinese talent plans. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Office of the Private Sector partnered with academic associations, hosted national level Academia Summits, and strengthened engagement with private industry and academia throughout the FBI's 56 field offices. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Counterintelligence and Security Center strengthened partnerships with academia to raise awareness and provide context to better understand and recognize foreign influence activities .Additional Administration Action Highlights 37The Department of Agriculture issued guidance on the inclusion of U.S. bilateral Science and Technology Agreements in S&T agreements with foreign governments to ensure consistent application of provisions, such as intellectual property rights and benefit sharing. USDA is conducting enhanced training and awareness for its workforce on promoting and protecting American research and development. The Department of Defense established a Research Protection Initiative to establish consistent standards for the reporting of conflicts, detect incidents of problematic behavior, and work with academic institutions to limit undue foreign influence in research awards . The Department of Education has established new information collection requirements and systems to improve the transparency of foreign funding of institutions of higher education, opened ten civil compliance investigations of U.S. universities for failing to disclose their financial relationship with foreign sources, and identified previously undisclosed foreign funding totaling approximately $6.5 billion and over $1 billion in funding for unknown objectives from anonymous sources in China, Russia, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.For further information 38White House Joint Committee on the Research Environment: JCORE@ostp.eop.gov Email academia@fbi.gov or contact your local FBI field office Contact your Federal funding agency 39 "}
