As always, vaccines are for UMB campus employees and students. The 1-day clinic will be held Tuesday, October 17 from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm in the Weise Gallery on the first floor of the Library. This year's clinic will include vaccines for the flu (including high dose flu shots for those above 65 years of age), COVID-19 (Moderna), Pneumonia (Prevnar 20), RSV (Arexvy), shingles, and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis). Participants may sign up for any and all available vaccines needed but please note that some vaccinations may require a co-pay. Co-pay is by credit card only. To make sure the clinic has enough vaccinations and for shorter wait times, appointments are strongly encouraged. There will be some walk-up appointments available but we cannot guarantee vaccines without an appointment. Our clinic partner, Safeway, will be scheduling appointments using this link. After signing up for an appointment, please look for a confirmation email from Safeway for additional information on what to bring to the appointment and how to reschedule or cancel as the HSHSL will be unable to alter appointments this year. We look forward to seeing you at the clinic on October 17th! The HSHSL is here for you! Don't hesitate to ask for help at the Information Services desk; we're happy to assist. You can also reach us by email at hshsl@umaryland.edu, telephone at 410-706-7995, or chat. Here is a top ten list of common questions with links to guide you to the answer or service. A new \"Color Me Happy\" exhibit is back in the Weise Gallery! This interactive coloring wall features drawings that recall cherished symbols and icons of Maryland & Baltimore. We invite everyone to pause and indulge in carefree coloring, whether it's Black-Eyed Susans, Mr. Trash Wheel, a Baltimore Oriole, or many others. Have a question? Need guidance on where to find a journal article or which citation manager to use? The HSHSL's Information Services desk is here to provide you fast and friendly reference help. Come by in person, email: hshsl@umaryland.edu, call: 410-706-7995, or chat! Do you need an article or book that the HSHSL does not have access to? UMB faculty, staff and students can order interlibrary loans (ILL). The turn-around time is fast and the service is free for students. It is easy to connect with a faculty librarian who works directly with your school. The Research and Education Services (RES) portal helps students, researchers, educators, and clinicians learn about how their school's librarian can collaborate with and support them. "}
