This mandate is a directive of the state of California that Palmer is legally required to follow. Any individuals who choose not to become fully vaccinated and have a qualified and documented medical or religious exemption have the option to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. Please view the attached flow charts that outline important next steps for interns, faculty and staff who work in the Palmer West Chiropractic Clinics and students on preceptorships or student rotations in the state of California. Important deadlines: If you are vaccinated or are willing to get vaccinated, you must provide proof of full vaccination by 9/30/21. If you become fully vaccinated after 9/30/21, you will need to provide proof upon receipt and will be cleared from the weekly testing requirement at that time. If you meet exemption requirements and are willing to get tested weekly, you must complete the Declination form and submit your first test result by 10/1/21. Individuals who fail to submit their test results in a timely manner will be restricted from the clinic settings until they do. Individuals who are unwilling to comply with these state mandates should follow the flow-charts for next steps immediately, including the option to do a Clinic rotation on Palmer's Main campus in Davenport, Iowa. https://blogs.palmer.edu/profiles/2020/03/10/coronavirus-covid-19-update/ https://www.parker.edu/the-pandemics-within-the-pandemic/ https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Sherman-College-Weekly-Covid-Update-09-07-2021.html?soid=1125017960960&aid=PRJOVvUN620 The university will be complying with Gov.
