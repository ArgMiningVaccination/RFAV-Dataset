Plants use the essential oils they produce for their own biological safety. Essential oils are known to be antimicrobial, anti-histaminergic, and anti-inflammatory. They can serve as neurotransmitters, tissue hormones, enzymes, and cofactors for biological processes. They promote tissue healing by supplying negative ions, ozone and oxygen. Essential oils can help manage pain and infections and promote tissue regeneration. Essential oils for first aid Bleeding \u2014 Helichrysum italicum on location, undiluted. Unlike cauterization, this oil also protects against infections and promotes tissue healing. Very useful after [dental procedures](https://ivcjournal.com/integrative-dental-care/). Use caution around cautery, as essential oils are flammable. Bruising and pain \u2014 Helichrysum italicum, Peppermint and Frankincense (Boswellia carterii) undiluted on location. Burns \u2014 Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) on location every five minutes for 30 minutes, then twice a day until healed. Allergic reactions \u2014 Lemon, Blue Tansy (Tanacetum annuum) and Frankincense, undiluted on location. Can use over carotid arteries if systemic reaction. Very useful topically at vaccine injection sites. Heat stroke \u2014 Peppermint diluted in ice water and misted over the whole body. Place undiluted on the feet and follow with a cold wet pack to drive in the oil. These are just some examples of how to use essential oils in an emergency, to support recovery. In first aid applications, the oils are rarely diluted. This is a time for strong action. Make sure you know your oils. Many products are diluted with fillers or are not Biologically Active\u00ae and could therefore cause damage rather than help. For example, while Lavender essential oil (Lavandula angustifolia) helps with burns, Lavandin is high in camphor, and can actually cause burns. Oil quality, type of oil, and technique all matter in using essential oils responsibly.
