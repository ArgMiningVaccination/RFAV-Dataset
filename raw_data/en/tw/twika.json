That's how Meyers also ended up there. No matter how many pints of blood doctors drained from her, doctors and specialists couldn't figure out why Meyers, then a high school senior, was unable to stay awake, keep her hair from falling out or from her body temperature drastically dropping in her sleep. She said many people didn't believe her. Until her mother came across a woman in a magazine who had Meyers' symptoms, and felt better with the help of a naturopathic doctor. Meyers said she had nothing left to lose, and she scheduled a consultation and hair analysis. When her test results came back, she was informed that she had 400 times the normal amount of copper in her body. After detoxing with herbs and changing her diet, she gradually recovered, she said. It was then she realized she wanted to help others who were suffering and had nowhere left to turn, she said. \"It put me on a path of wanting to help others who didn't have any other answers,\" said Meyers at her new clinic in Franklin, her pink hair framing the crystal hanging around her neck. The Franklin resident and licensed acupuncturist is opening AcuPUNKture at 205 E. Central St. on the second floor, with plans to open on Jan. 8. Meyers, 32, calls it \"an alternative place for healing,\" using a mixture of adjunctive techniques, like cupping therapy, and therapeutic organic essential oils and CBD salves in her sessions. The shop will also sell gemstones, crystals, Epsom bath salt and essential oils. Meyers, originally from Easton, opened her first clinic in Jamaica Plains around five years ago, and decided to open a clinic a few miles from her home when a real estate company left the space at 205 E. Central St. around a month ago. \"I personally love acupuncture, I treat all my friends and family, and myself when I can't get treatments for other people,\" said Meyers, who graduated from Framingham State University with a bachelor's degree in food and nutrition and later earned a Master's degree in Chinese and Japanese Styles of Acupuncture at the New England School of Acupuncture in Worcester. She's treated a range of clients, from children to older patients in nursing homes, for issues like pain, digestive issues, headaches and insomnia. At her Jamaica Plains location, which is located just minutes away from Lemuel Shattuck Hospital and Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital, she treats many patients for fertility issues. \"(My clients) usually come to me as a last resort,\" she said, many, like her, hopping from specialist to specialist for answers to problems that don't show up in blood work or x-rays. As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, its effect on mental health can also be debilitating, with many seeking alternative therapies to help them manage it. \"I see a lot of people for pain, but now I see a lot of people for anxiety and stress,\" she said, with pent-up stress sometimes manifesting in stomach and body aches. Because of COVID-19 occupancy regulations, only one patient will be in the room with her at a time, she said, and recommends getting acupuncture regularly to see benefits instead of just once. She also lets clients know what to expect if they have any worries, but usually, they're surprised how little it hurts after she sticks the first needle in. \"You might feel a little pinch but after that, you shouldn't feel any pain, like you might feel weird, achy sensations or feel needles in places where there aren't needles - it's all normal, as long as it's not sharp pain then you're good,\" she said. \"A lot of people will fall asleep or doze off on the treatment table,\" she said. Most of the needles she uses are Japanese needles around 16-22 gauge, which she said thinner than the average Chinese needle at around 30-35 gauge. \"But until you get acupuncture, it's such a hard sell, because our only exposure is getting held down for a finger prick or getting booster shots - all this trauma around needles,\" she said. Further down the line following the pandemic, she hopes to offer a set amount of free sessions once per month for veterans, and possibly also first-responders and teachers. Still, not all insurance agencies cover holistic medicine like acupuncture, but Blue Cross Blue Shield will be accepted at the Franklin location, she said. When Meyers isn't poking patients with needles, she's gardening or building projects, like cat patios, with her husband Anthony for their six cats or feeding their collection of 20 bantam chickens. AcuPUNKture in Franklin will begin booking appointments starting on Dec. 18. Patients must first take a 15-minute private tele-health phone intake prior to their first in-person acupuncture session.
