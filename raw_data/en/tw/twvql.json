The group didn't think they were goingto make it down by dark andasked us if we could send up rescuers with flashlights. We informed them that they were going to have to deal with the situation themselves. [Therewere several hours of daylight left- ed.].\"Neely said that the leaders made it down before dark and were given flashlights to take back to the rest of the group. His question to them: \"If you are going tocarry one piece of battery-operated technology, why make it a cellular phone instead of a flashlight?\"More and more, rescue agencies are receiving direct reports via cellular phones from lost or injured parties. Only one cellular call for help came in to the AMC Search and Rescue in 1994, according to SAR Coordinator John Sanders; in 1995 there were eight three of which were on Boot Spur. New Hampshire Fish and Game Lieutenant Rick Estes didn't have exact figures, but said his department is seeing an increase in cellular phones being used to call in emergencies from the woods.For the rescue community, this increase raises a number of dilemmas.First, with the perfusion of cellular phones in society, easy communication is taken to be synonymous with easy access. Do cellular phones: a.) increase the number of frivolous rescue calls and, thus, potential danger to rescuers; and b.) cause wilderness users to take greater risks, with this electroniccrutchintheirpack?Also,couldthis communication form actually be more useful than the present reliance on radios? What are the benefits and drawbacks of this burgeoning technology?Before discussing these questions in any detail, perhaps it would be useful to understand how cellular technology works. The following information is based on conversations with Bill I lastings, RF Engineer for Bell Atlantic/Nynex Mobile.VOLUME 7, NUMBER 1 First, your cellular phone is basically a radio; it uses radio waves comparedtotheshortermicrowavesto communicate with the nearestantenna. The reason you are able to have 2-way conversations like a telephone instead of the usual \"one-at-a-time\" of radios, is that the cell phone uses two different frequencies at the same time, known as a duplex system.The \"cell\" is simply thearea covered by each antenna, and it is linked to other cells by radio and land line systems. Your cellular call comes into the cell, and is either connected to a land line (the regular phone lines, either copper cable or fiber optic), or relayed bymicrowave to a central control area operated by the cellularcompany, and then transferred to theland line.The company that provides service (the carrier) owns or leases these cell sites (your \"home\" area), but may have agreements with other cellular carriersto provide extended coverage beyondyour home. If you are travellingsay, driving your car and you pass from one cell into another, computers automatically hand off your conversation, without any interruption in service. One difficulty rescue organizations have had is the inability to call back to a cellular phone outside of its homearea.According to Hastings, this should be changing, as cellular carriers sign agreements with competitors to accept each other's users into their systems. However, phones can be programmed not to accept this \"follow me\" capability, which could be problematic for rescuers.Another option for SAR agencies, according to Hastings, is to figure out which cell the caller has reached and to access their phone through the local company that operates the cell. Optimally, SARgroups should have this informationfor their area in a response plan.Although in operation the cellular phone behaves much likeaconventionalphone,therearesome important differences. The cell phonecan be significantly affected byatmospheric conditions and terrain. The average size of a cell varies for these reasons, according to Hastings, but is roughly circular and will usuallyaverage a radius of about six miles.He added that cells formerlywere larger, but with more and3 more carriers signing on, many cells have been powered down.Since the device uses the radio frequency range (RF) from 824to 894 megahertz(MHz), the signal can be intercepted by somecommercial equipment, but not legally, so privacy, althoughprobable, is not guaranteed.Not surprisingly, rescue leaders from organization acrossthe country have similar concerns about the cell phones beingcarried in people's backpacks. The main concern is that, witheasier access to communication, outdoor enthusiasts mayperceive an emergency, but instead of relying on their ownskills, will call to be rescued. Although not much data hasbeen compiled yet, anecdotal evidence supports this. Lt. Estesof the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, tells of ateam being dispatched for a fractured ankle, a situation, hesays, that was made to sound more serious when the call camein. According to Estes, the caller stated later, on scene, that \"Iwanted to make sure you guys were going to come.\" SaysEstes, the attitude seems to be, \"If it takes getting you nervedup, you'll come.\"Tod Schimelpfenig, Risk Management Director for theNational Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), also finds thathe is being called to more \"questionable\" situations. He andother NOLS staffers are often the ones who perform rescuesfor private parties in Wyoming's Wind River Range. With theheavy reliance on volunteers for SAR, Schimelpfenig feels thatthe potential extra load of superfluous calls could \"put a strainon the volunteer system.\"The frivolous calls also trouble John Sanders, who saysmost of the cellular calls received by the AMC are for \"non-emergent problems:things they could solve themselves, orthey're lost.\"In the past, said Sanders, people would call infrom their homes, concerned about an overdue party, but theAMC would wait until the next day to send out searchers, ifthe party, according to Sanders, \"could be reasonably expectedto survive the night.\" He added, \"They would spend the nightout and learn a really good lesson: either they will be preparednext time, or they won't go hiking again.\"Sanders said that when rescuers have voice contact withhikers who have potential problems (via the cellular phone),that at least at present they feel uncomfortable notresponding.Says Lt. Estes:\"What if they didn't have thephone? We have been saving people for years without it. Iwould hatetoseeitimpede people'sabilitytohelpthemselves.\"That the phone would be taken along as areplacement for backcountry skills and knowledge is acommon concern among rescuers. Notes Schimelpfenig:\"There is a different atmosphere now, with people not being asself-reliant as they once were.\"Jed Williamson is President of the American Alpine Cluband chair of the NOLS Risk Management Committee. Helikens the phone to other tools used by outdoor recreationists,such as belay or prusik devices, and wonders how many couldfashion a belay or prusik without the premade versions. \"Youstill need the basic skills,\" he said. Williamson believes anincident ten years ago in the Northwest Territories predictedtoday's misuse of cellular technology. A party was trying torun from the head of the McKenzie River to the ocean. \"Onthe second day,\" he said, \"they got wet and cold, and used anairplane-type transceiver to call for help.\"\"The phone is an additional according doesn't of self-confidence they wouldn't otherwisehave.\" Does this mean they will end up taking excess risk?\"I don't think so,\" says Sanders, \"but I know rescuers who do.\"Sanders doesn't feel that the present cellular calls for rescueare willful abuses more likely just ignorance of the basics:\"They just don't know,\" he says.Another unique problem for SAR personnel with theproliferation of cellular phones in the backcountry, at least inthe Northeast, is people's calling in initial information from ascene perhaps from a different group but leaving tocontinue their trip, taking the communication link along withthem. Or passing by a scene, and later deciding there couldhave been a problem, and then calling in sketchy information.Incident Commanders will usually leave the latter situationalone but not without trepidationwhy didn't the group inquestion request help?As for the former:\"It's reallyfrustrating,\" says Dave Neely. \"We had an incident on MountMadison this past summer [in the White Mountain NationalForest], where an EMT hiking with her friend came across aman apparently in distress. As she took vital signs, anothergroup came by and offered her the use of their cellular phone,which she used to call his condition down to us. \"However,\"he said, \"the group with the phone continued on toward thesummit, taking the phone with them, so we had no way ofdetermining the stability of the patient.\"The result was that rescuers were dispatched from twodifferent backcountry locations, while a litter team fromAndroscoggin Valley SAR was sent up from the valley.\"When the teams converged,\" says Neely, \"they found that thepatient was moving well, tired and dehydrated, but otherwisefine.\" Neely feels that an \"extra fifteen minutes\" could haveprevented much risk for the rescuers. \"If you're going to offerthe phone for assistance, you've got to be prepared to go allthe way.\"Interestingly, calls about ill or injured patients often comeinto rescue agencies, and not physicians or hospitals.Tod Schimelpfenig has an extra reason to ponder thebackcountry use of cellular phones: in addition to performingSAR, he is also responsible for safety and risk management inan organization that leads wilderness trips around the world.From this perspective, the cellular phone (or the standardradio) can be either a wilderness intrusion or a tool for rapidcontact in a true emergency. In the NOLS Newsletter of April1995, Schimelpfenig published NOLS' position on using cellphones and radios on their trips. It reads in part: JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1996 2WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Without physically compromising the wilderness, wehave to provide our students and staff with essentialsafety equipment. At NOLS, cell phone and radiouse may be inconsistent with our traditional ideas ofwilderness,butourpracticesevolvedwhenimmediate communication to the outside world was not possible.It is our position that as technologicaladvances make communication possible from themost remote regions. .. NOLS will make use ofthem.In a phone interview, he added that, despite the policy,very few NOLS leaders are taking cell phones along. Much of the reason is logistical, \"They are still not a reliable way to communicate,\" he said.\"For example, in the Wind Rivers,there is absolutely no contact, although many of the trailheads are within range.\"This could be changing. Motorola, a leading producer ofcellular equipment, is rumored to be able to cover most of the planet by early in the next century. A new player may be thesatellite. Although the startup cost is much higher ($2550 for satellite versus $0-$100 for cellular), the costs of running thesystem are comparable. At present, this equipment is bulky and may not be suitable for the backcountry; but, according to literature from American Mobile Satellite Corporation of Reston,Virginia,theirSKYCELLsystemprovides communication from \"virtually anywhere in North America, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. ..\"It also includes service within 200 miles of surrounding coastal waters.Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Personal Locator Beacons (PLB) also hold potential for backcountrylocation and communication, but with the same risks as withcellular phones. Schimelpfenig believes that within three-and- a-half years, he could be able to contact any program at any time.Nynex's Hastings emphasizes, however, that cellular carriers are first going to service the marketable ones, where they will not lose money.In other words, the trailhead willget service before the trail.How have the NOLS leaders reacted to the cellular phone policy?\"Five years ago,\" says Schimelpfenig, \"there was some resistance to radios.I don't hear that any more. Now,people are demanding more from the technology.\"Apart from the pragmaticconcerns, there is another, lesstangible issue: how ethical is it to toss a cell phone in yourpack before tromping down the trail? For many SAR leaders, it is obviously a trend that will continue, \"so we'd better get used to it,\" according to John Sanders.For Jed Williamson, personal experience has demonstrated the inappropriateness not of the technology, but of the way it is used. \"I have comeupon people in remote settings usingthe phone to have an argument with someone back home.If you want to have a wilderness experience,\" he says, \"then have it.Don't use it to call your Aunt Matilda. Or if you do, get off the trail. Don't subjecteveryone else.\"\"The challenge,\" says Schimelpfenig, \"is how to preservethe wilderness experience while carrying a [technological] device.It could be a great asset.\" Adds Neely: \"Having the phone takes away from your need to evaluate the landscape to rely on your wits. When you leave the road behind, you are subject to more natural laws. It defeats the purpose to have too many safety valves.\"While each rescuer has hisor her personal reaction tocellular phones, those interviewed acknowledge cell phones' potential usefulness in a bona fide emergency.There are, however, limitations.John Sanders says:\"Understand that reception is pretty spotty, and the phone may be useless for communication.As with any high-tech item, it is easy to break and harder to fix, especially in the field. So if you're going to bring one along, you need to know how to program it and how to fix it.Plus, you need to bring along extra batteries.\"Rick Estes fears that \"some folks may lean too much on their phone as their primary safety resource, and get into trouble when their expectations exceed its capabilities.The bottom line is that people still need to be responsible for themselves.\"Jed Williamson also seesemergency potential for cell phones, but would like to ensure that people know when their use is warranted.\"Cellular users have to be educated,\" he says.How?\"Signs or pamphlets at the [railheads,\" for example.He also proposes a partnership between cellular manufacturers and carriers and organizations such as the National Forest Service, National Park Service, SOLO, and NOLS. Perhaps such information could be included with the equipment.Maybe the most effective education, proposes Williamson, is to \"make them pay when they have to be rescued. They arecreating a hazard when they go out without adequate skills or clothing.\"Lt. Estes points out that, in New Hampshire, any backcountry user can be charged for the cost of their rescue under the Reckless Conduct Law, if the rescue is \"deemed frivolous and unnecessary.\"Despite the potential for saving time or giving directaccess to medical information, rescuers would still rather rely on their own backcountry skills in an emergency, and not a cellular phone.Estes feels that, \"If taking the phone is a matter of weight, I'd rather take survival gear with me.\" And Dave Neely adds, \"If I were leading a group, I might consider it [phone] for liabilityreasons, but not on a personal trip.\"Jed Williamson says he prefers the archaic map, compass, and survival gear as well. As for the cellular phone, he says: \"I'm too old.\" JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1996 35WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER TOP TEN SUGGESTIONS FORCELLULAR USERSIN THE BACKCOUNTRY10. Know how to operate and phone. 9.Bring extra;:charged batteries.Before you leave,have phone for \"follow me\" roaming or itsequivalent, so rescue agencies can call you back.Bring theitenessentials and knOW how to use them. 6.Have the telephone- numbers for the local 'hospitalor clinic in addition to the local rescue agency(many of which are accessed :..through the StatePolice or County Sheriff). 5.Use the phone only in a true emergency, or wherethe patient will require litter evacuation. Brokenwrists and sprained ankles are usually not exaMplesand you may. be told to deal with the situationyourself.4.Remember that the phone is an aid, not a solution:It may not work when you need it most.-Be sensitive to the fact that you will encounterpeople in the backcountry who are seeking theirown kind of \"wilderness experience\" and try not tointrude. 2.Take a Wilderness First Aid course and learn tomanage the situation yourself. Self evacuationshould be your first consideration. 1.Do not tax volunteer rescue organizations for non-emergency situations; the rescuers you divert maycost someone else's life. THERMOMETERS IN THE WILD:PROS AND TiltonCold and shivering? Hot and sweaty? Normal? Yourpatient is often a puzzle you're trying to solve. And yourpatient's temperature ranks among the important pieces ofinformation you'd like to have. But far more important to youis this: what changes, if any, are taking place in your patient'stemperature over time?Thermometers, varying greatly incomplexity and in cost, offer ways to monitor a patient'stemperature. Even if the measurement is off a tad up or down,you can still keep track of changes. But is a thermometer awilderness medical tool?6Sixplaces ona human body provide accesstotemperature: skin, mouth (oral cavity), armpit (axilla), rectum,eardrum (tympanic membrane) and esophagus.Most of you would agree that what you'd ideally like toknow is your patient's \"core\" temperature. But what exactlydoes that mean?Parts of the human body differ in \"core\"temperature, and those temperatures will vary as stress varies.The brain typically lives at a higher temperature than the heart.In a patient suffering from the cold stress of hypothermia,axillary, oral, rectal, even tympanic thermometers may registertemperatures lower than the patient's core temperature. In aheat-stressed patient who has been exercising vigorously, therectal temp may be substantially higher than the core, due tothe heat generated by muscular activity in that region of thebody. Even a very expensive, very accurate thermometer maynot tell the information you'd most like to have.Failure to properly use a thermometer, which is morelikely in a wilderness environment (dark, wind, rain, andmore), can make it difficult even to monitor with relativeaccuracy the changes in temperature over time. If you push arectal thermometer into a mass of doo, you'll record thetemperature of the doo. Thermometers not held firm and stillin a patient's mouth or armpit will record temperatures lowerthan true.In both cases, your next measurement may show asignificant but inaccurate change. SKINAlthough monitoring the patient's forehead with the backof your hand obviously gives you no accurate measurement, itdoes allow you to detect big changes in skin heat and skinmoisture.You can detect generallyif your patientisattempting to shed excess heat (hot and sweaty) or store all theheat possible (cold and dry). Useful info! MOUTHOral thermometers provide the easiest access to an actualmeasurement. Your patient does not have to expose any bodyparts to the environment, and most patients are comfortablehaving the thermometer in place. Standard glass thermometershave found a home in many wilderness first aid kits, but theydo break easily. Exposure to excesses of heat or cold can alterthe accuracy of a standard glass thermometer, and cheap onescan lose their accuracy over time even under controlledconditions.Electronic thermometers are more durable andprobably more accurate, but they only work as long as thebattery does.It is often suggested, sometimes strongly, thatyour thermometer should be one that reads low temperatures,sometimes called a \"hypothermia\" thermometer, because manystandard instruments will not register in the hypothermia range.Friends of mine who wish to remain anonymous say this: \"It'sjust plain silly to attempt to get an accurate measurement oftemperature in a hypothermia patient in the field when somany more indicators will be present.\" Thermometers can behelpful in determining an elevated temperature in, say, apatient with a fever. The thermometer, if you do use it, needsto be held in the mouth for three to five minutes. Your bestJANUARY/FEBRUARY 1996 4WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER bet is to periodically check the reading until you find two consecutive readings of thesame temperature.ARMPITThe same glass thermometers used in the mouth can be used in the armpit, with thesame pros and cons mentionedabove. The thermometer may need to be left in place for up to 10 minutes.Axially temperatures, in the wildernessespecially, are at best apoor guess at \"core\" temperature.\"Why do axilla temperatures,\" writes Robert E. Burr, FACP,FACEP, medical advisor, US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine,\"stillappear as a subject ofdiscussion? This technique has been discredited for years and has no place in the evaluation of an environmental casualty.\" I feel that way, too, but Dr. Burr said it better than I could.RECTUMAnywhere you can sticka regular glass thermometer, youcan stick a \"rectal\" thermometer, and vice versa. Glass rectals are typically made of thicker material, which means you'll have to leave it in a bit longer to get an accurate measurement.Digital thermometers with long flexible probes work well for taking a rectal temperature. And, other than the heat-stressed patient mentioned earlier,you should get a fairly accurateestimate of \"core\" temperature with a rectal measurement. As you can easily imagine, a substantial amount of your patient will get exposed to the environment. And most patients will be made uncomfortable by the procedure. If you take a rectalmeasurement, the thermometer need only go in two to four inches.Many wilderness care providers swear by rectalmeasurements, and many swear at them.EARDRUMSoaring into several hundreds of dollars to purchase,tympanic thermometers must be aimed directly at the eardrum to work precisely.Used thus, they are fast and accurate, giving a reading that should be close to a rectal measurement, but one that may vary quitea bit from an oral check. But most tympanic thermometers will simply not work outdoors. Their ability to function isaltered by the radicalrange of ambient air temperatures faced by the wilderness care provider. At least one manufacturer,Exergen Corporation (Newton, MA), offers a tympanicthermometer that they claim has beendesigned for use in wilderness environments.If it works, it could give you the mostaccurate measurement of temperaturesin the hypothermicor hyperthermic range.But Dr. Burr comments: \"Our experience and opinion from the experience and opinion of others has been that tympanic thermometry is unreliable.\" ESOPHAGUSEsophageal thermometers, when in place, lie near the heart, and must be inserted in a way similar to the insertion ofa nasogastric tube, althoughyou will find some of thesethermometers are smaller and easier to insert than an NG tube. Placed accurately, thisthermometer should giveyou the mostJANUARY/FEBRUARY 1996 5accurate measurement of \"core\" temp possible. Inaccurately placed, they can be off several degrees. Once again, I know of no one who has usedan esophageal thermometer in the wildoutdoors.So, should you be carrying and using a thermometer in the wilderness? Maybeyes. Maybe no. These thoughts andconsiderations will, hopefully, help you make that decision.REFERENCE:\"Temperature,Thermometersand Temperature Monitors,\" preliminary proprietary materials, copyright 1995 by the Wilderness EMS Institute.WHO'S WHO IN WILDERNESS MEDICINE:MURRAY HAMLET, DVMBy Ted WalshDr. Hamlet manages research plans and operations at the Army Cold Weather Research Laboratory in Natick, Mass. andhas earned a reputationas the definitive authority on cold-injury and the treatment ofcold-injury. He earned his positionafter eight years active service in the United States Army stationed mostly in arctic and sub-arctic environments. Upon his discharge (honorable), hewas then asked to stay on as a civilian specialist for the military. Dr. Hamlet's medical training is as a veterinarian. Although this may seem unusual, the reality is that an understanding of comparative animal anatomy and physiology has led to the most insightful understanding of human anatomy and physiology.Whether the topic is Raynaud's, frostbite, or hypothermia, Murray is the man peoplego to for the last word, a fact thattoo many lawyers are already aware of.WMN: How did you eventually mesh Veterinary Medicine with research in cold injuries?Dr. Hamlet: Well actuallywe have to go way back to answerthat, in fact to high school. I was interested in birds and, in particular, the air-sacks in birds. There were some interesting theories as to the purpose of air-sacks but the jury was still out as to their actual function. As I say, I became interested and started a science project looking into their purpose. Along the way I became convinced that the primary function of these air- sacks was thermo-regulatory. My project ended up entered in competition in the National Science fair. Basically ever since I have been involved withheating and cooling systems in animals and humans.WMN: Did your project win anything in the National Science Fair?Dr.Hamlet: I came in second.WMN: Why did the Armysend you to Alaska? 7WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Dr. Hamlet: They needed someone to look after the labanimals for their cold weather lab there.WMN: Is that also how you got directly involved with ColdInjury research?Dr. Hamlet: That's pretty much it. The Army cold weatherspecialist was a bit cantankerous. He needed an assistant. Wegot along O.K. When he retired the Army came to me andsaid, \"You're the only one we've got now that knows aboutthis stuff. You're in charge\".WMN: Ten years ago you were involved with the evaluationof what happened in the Mt. Hood disaster, and you have beeninvolved with several investigations that the military has doneon training deaths due to cold. You have also been called asan expert witness in several cases involving deaths or injuriesthat occurred on trips run by outdoor programs. What lessons,if any, can be learned from these tragedies?Dr. Hamlet: I think the basic one is being able to recognizewhen there is a problem.About the only thing that all thedifferent tragedies you mention have in common is that invirtually all cases there was a mistake made, a misjudgment,or an equipment failure, and nobody dealt with the problem.Now another mistake occurs and compounds the first. It isalmost never one false move that does you in, but a series offalse moves.WMN: What do you recommend outdoor programs andwilderness- oriented organizations do to avoid this pattern ofbehavior?Dr. Hamlet: Well, obviously, good solid training for thepeople leading tripsis key, but Ialso hope the peopleemploying those leaders are careful about who they choose tolead their trips basing their choice on some sort of trackrecord.It is up to the leader to be the one who says, \"Hey,hold up. We've got a problem.\"WMN: What do youconsideryour mostsignificantcontribution to wilderness medicine?Dr. Hamlet: I think if I can educate even a few people tolearn from the mistakes made by others that have lead toavoidable injuries, then I've done something worthwhile.WMN: Can people write to you with questions?Dr. Hamlet: Sure. They need to contact me at:Dr. Murray HamletUS Army ResearchInstituteof EnvironmentalMedicineResearch Programs & Operations DivisionNatick, Massachusetts 01760-5007 8THE JOY OF SOCKSor\"SOCKS IS MORE THAN A CAT\"by Murray Hamlet, DVMFor many of us, socks are things we can use, after a dayor two of wear, to clear out any tent or cabin; or, if we live inthe White House, a furry critter to feed at night. Often, wemay feel compelled to incinerate them after our foray into thewoods. Actually, our socks or sock system is integral withour boots and vital to the well-being of our feet. As our feetare our transportation in the backcountry, the sock choice wemake can mean the difference between a pleasant or amiserable trip, and in certain circumstances can lead to a litterevacuation.Socks serve these primary functions: to insulate the footfrom heat and cold; to move moisture away from the foot and,thus, keep it dry; to prevent the \"shear forces\" which causeblisters; and protecting the foot by keeping it a distance fromthe boot material, known as ''stand off.\"The different materials from which they are manufacturedgive socks a variety of properties, some beneficial, someneutral, and some even detrimental. Wool has excellent \"standoff\" and moisture absorbency, but dries slowly. Nylon is goodfor strength and form, but can be too hot; often, nylon iswoven with wool to add strength. Polypropylene is strong andhas well-known moisturetransferproperties, known as\"wicking.\" Polyester, too, is a good wicker. Acrylic, on theother hand (or foot), breaks down too easily. Orlon is too soft,reducing the stand off space. Cotton the most popular choicein socks is usually the worst choice for hiking, as it is toohydrophilic (water-absorbent), and causes the most blister-producing friction.Blister prevention is perhaps the most important functionof our socks. When dry, socks prevent shearing, the frictionbetween the foot and the sock. However, as the sock gets wet,this force increases and causes the spreading of connectivetissue. To protect itself, the body pads the area with a secretionof water underneath the skin, which we call a blister.Another cause of blisters is excessive heel lift; as thelaces over the arch loosen with walking, there is effectivelymore room in the boot, allowing the heel to lift with each step.The foot can slide backward in the boot, causing pressure andfriction in the forward part, resulting in blisters on the ball ofthe foot. Also, as the heel is lifted past the transverse foldsabove it, the Achilles tendon will abrade and blister as well.Heel lift can be prevented by \"differential lacing;\" lace theboots tightly for four or five eyelets and tie, then lace theremaining eyelets more loosely to accommodate for calfexpansion. With the forefoot laced down, the heel should notlift. Boots too long or large can also cause heel lift, wheresocks \"walk down\" your leg into the boot. Try a 1/16 or 1/8-inch Poron insole to remedy this problem. JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1996 6WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Boots and socks work together to provide proper fit, so agood-quality, well-fitted system is critical. When you try onboots, make sure you are wearing the same sock system youwill wear when hiking (or skiing, or climbing), includinginsoles. Also, wear a weighted pack, as the weight willsimulate the extra spread of your foot when you are carryinga full pack. Measure both the length and width of your feet,and take into account that the midsole in quality leather bootswill shorten slightly with wear (which is what causes boots toget the classic \"rocker\" shape). Try the boots on unlaced withyour toes jammed into the toe cap; there should be about 1/2inch of space behind the heel. Similarly, with the heel againstthe heel counter, there should be a 1/2 inch between the end ofthe lon2est toe and the end of the toe box. Lace up the firstfive eyelets, and walk around to check for heel lift. If the bootscannot be comfortably tightened to prevent heel lift, try thenext smaller size. Make sure your toes have plenty of space towiggle: cramped toes equal blistered toes.The two-sock systemallows your footwear the bestopportunity to do their job. Start with a thin, tightly-knitpolypropylene or polyester sock (such as Coolmax), about 14inches high, next to the skin. The liner should have a minimumof nylon. Avoid cotton, orlon, and acrylic.The outer sock should have a high concentration ofwool 50% or higher perhaps blended with polyester orpolypropylene. A bit of nylon will add to strength andstructure, especially in the upper calf. Socks should be denselyknit, either a smooth, flat weave (like a Dachstein) or napped(where one side is flat and the other looks fluffy). The smoothside should be next to the skin, which helps the watertransference; ironically, this is opposite of the way most socksare sold...To test for density, stretch the material over your fingerand rub. If you can see your finger through the material, it istoo loosely knit. Press the material onto a hard surface withyour thumb; it should not mat down, but should maintain a 1/8to 1/4-inch thickness. Also, try the rub test when the materialis wet (probably at home, unless you have very progressiveretailers). It should hold up the same as when dry. You willprobably notice that most rag socks are too loosely knit. A\"fish mouth\" closure at the toe, if you can find it, will fitbetter. rSUBSCRIPTION ORDER FORM FORWILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTERPlease send me:o One year subscription (6 issues) $240 Two year subscription (12 issues) $44Overseas subscriptions must be in US funds.

Newton, WEMT-Band to be aware of danger signs, should not overshadow thesingle universal truth of eating disorders: The experience ofeach individual is unique, with its own origins, manifestation,perpetuatingfactors,andmedicalandpsychologicalcomplications. No matter how much you learn about eatingdisorders, keep in mind that when you deal with a strugglingstudent, that student deserves to meet you in a space free ofassumptions and judgement.Don't listen just to the eatingdisorder; listen to the individual. He or she has an amazingand amazingly difficult story to share.Eating disorders are complex problems that often risk goingunrecognized during the early stages in which they may besuccessfully addressed. They have become so prevalent in ourculture during the last ten years or so that most everyone hasat least heard of anorexia and bulimia in passing conversation,and many of us are close to someone who has struggledprofoundly with concerns of eating and body image. Sinceeating disorders are not commonly recognized as potentialbackcountry emergencies, they are often neglected in trainingcurricula for trip leaders; but, since they respect no divisionbetween backcountry and frontcountry, they can become aproblem during an expedition of any length.While this article specifically speaks to wilderness tripleaders,Ibelieve that its discussion will be relevant foroutdoors educators of all types and for travellers who leadgroups in any region of the country or of the world foranyone who works or plays in a remote setting where propernutrition truly poses a constant safety issue.The primary goal of this article is to increase awarenessabout eating disorders:to help wildernesstripleadersrecognize potential problems among students, to understandtheir grave medical and psychological implications, to learnsome factors that may contribute to their development, and toconsider what- steps toward prevention and recovery may betaken in the field. Beyond the scope of this article, my hopeis that opening discussion of the issues at stake will encourageyou, as a trip leader, to go out and learn more about eatingdisorders on your own to discuss eating concerns openlywith your students, to share stories with your colleagues, toconsult hospital staff or professional therapists for answers toquestions that your discussions raise.One final cautionary note before we delve further intodefinitions and discussion: Iwill be making some broadgeneralizations in an attempt to outline common signs andcomponents of eating disorders. These generalizations, whilenecessary in order to help trip leaders learn how to recognize11FRONTCOUNTRY INTRODUCTIONS:A GROUNDING IN FACTS AND FIGURESAT-RISK POPULATIONSEating disorders and their complications comprise a steadilygrowing threat to the health of individuals in Western nations.According to David Herzog, Director of the Harvard EatingDisorder Center, an estimated 5.5 million people within thecurrent US population willsuffer from a clinical eatingdisorder at some point in their lives.The populationmost commonly affected byeatingdisorders and, accordingly, about whom the most is heardand written regarding eating concerns and body image is thatof women in their teens and twenties. In fact, ninety percentof eating disorder patients are female. Still, a significant tenpercent are male; no group of individuals is immune to thefactors that are thought to precipitate eating disorders.While a much greater number of women than men sufferfrom clinical eating disorders, both sexes are indeed at risk fordeveloping disordered eating although the underlying reasonsthat men develop such problems are often markedly differentfrom the factors that provoke the disorders in women. Severalspecific groups in which eating disorders are frequently notedinclude: 1.Young middle- to upper-class women. This is still the mostvisible group, as well as the population most targeted bycurrent outreach efforts.2. Athletes,including women and men alike. Thoseparticipating in sports that emphasize body weight or bodyshape (e.g., wrestling, rowing, running, skating, gymnastics,dancing) are particularly susceptible.3. Men or women with a personal or a family history ofsubstance abuse. For these individuals, the eating disorderoften springs from a general impulse-control problem.4. Homosexual men.A recently identified at-risk group,perhaps arising out of an elevated concern for body imagesimilar to that cited among young women.5. Middle-aged and older women striving to maintain a\"youthful\" figure. Often these are women who have carriedpreoccupations of body image from their youth into lateryears and who may be unknowingly encouraging disorderedeating and unhealthy body images in their own children.Problems in this category have been documented even inwomen into their eighties refusing food at nursing homes.6. Young children.Some children who observe oldersiblings', friends', or parents' unhealthy attitudes towardfood and distorted body images or who absorb mediamessages that thinner is better begin to show patterns ofdisordered eating at a frightening early age. Children whoare under stress due to parents' poor relations with eachother are also believed to be prone to eating disorders. ORIGINS IN PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIETYDisordered eating should be viewed not so much as anisolated affliction, but rather as one symptom of otherconcerns. An eating disorder is often a maladaptive attempt tocommunicate a larger problem, a silent cry for help, themanifestation of apatternof underlyingpsychologicaltendencies. Contributing to imbalanced associations with foodmay be an anxiety disorder, a relationship of codependency, ora lack of self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-efficacy.Traumatic events involving the family, such as abuse oralcoholism, are common experiences to find in the history ofan eating-disordered individual.Within our larger society, current media images areclassically cited as harmful to young women's self-perceptions,and are clear contributors to the perpetuation of unhealthybody images in many cases. Popular media images tend toemphasize thinness as a virtue equitable with femininity. The\"waif' look has been proposed as a backlash of power throughwhich women, who are increasingly coming to fill what havebeen considered traditionally \"male\" roles, are encouraged tomaintain an air of childhood inorderto appear lessthreatening.Societal encouragements toward thinness as ameasure of beauty combined with a persistent Westernassociation between thinness and a strong work ethic havemade eating disorders almost contagious. Members of acollege running team, for example, may encourage poornutrition in each other; newer team members, admiring thesuccesses of more experienced team members, may come tobelieve that eating only salads can translate into gloriousathletic success. Here, self-deprivation becomes a new level MARCH/APRIL 1996 122of competition between team members, and this asceticism isseen as the highest form of discipline.Despite its risks, an eating disorder is sometimes perceivedas a solution to the individual who finds himself or herselfbeginning to fall into its patterns. For the woman whoconstantly struggles with memories and fear lingering from anabusive relationship, the origins of anorexia which removesher menstrual periods and nearly all the fat from her bodymay rest in the belief that if she succeeds in retaining anappearance of smallness and sexual immaturity no one willwant to touch her. For the man who needs to keep his bodyin constant check for weigh-ins before his wrestling matches,the diuretics and purging of bulimia may seem the miraclecombination that helps him drop those last few pounds eachcompetition morning.Outside of specifictraumatic origins or demands ofcompetition, the discipline required to maintain an eatingdisorder may filla broader need for control felt by anindividual; if she cannot control all the events in her life, atleast she can feign control of her eating and her own body.For the person with an overwhelming scope and number ofconcerns, having an eating disorder seems to narrow the focusof worry, as the eating disorder's management comes todemand every last reserve of energy and attention. Eatingdisorders can be so hard to overcome precisely because theyserve such important psychological functions in people's lives.Their resolution is far more difficult than simply stopping theactions that define the disorders would appear to be, far morecomplicated than just ceasing to throw up after every meal orstarting to eat normally.CLINICAL DEFINITIONS & COMMON SIGNSThe clinical pathology of eating disorders is broken intotwo commonly recognized disorders: anorexia nervosa andbulimia nervosa.Other less ofdisordered eating compulsive overeating, compulsiveexercise, and bulimiarexia.While the problems endured bymany individuals struggling with eating disorders representcombinations of several of these pathways, the distinctionsdrawn between disorders do serve to facilitate basic educationand to open initial discussion.Anorexia nervosa essentially reflects a mode of self-starvation; the individual suffering from acute anorexia looksdecidedly unhealthy, even emaciated. The anorexic tends tofocus on a single aspect of his body that he considersimperfect and cannot see objectively that the rest of his bodyhas become dangerously thin. Anorexia is clinically identifiedby severely deficient food intake patterns that lead to drasticweight loss, specifically to reduction below 85% of ideal bodyweight. Mood swings, preoccupation with food, insomnia, aconstant sensation of coldness, and excessive exercise areclassic marks of anorexia. Some clear signs and symptomslinked to the disorder include dry skin and hair, dehydration,lightheadedness, and persistent general weakness coupled withbursts of frenzied activity.While the anorexic literally looks like he is starving todeath, the bulimic may be underweight, normal weight, or evenoverweight. Bulimia is classically defined by its binge/purge WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER cycles, in which a person first overeats and then vomits or useslaxatives to rid herself of the food quickly. The purgingcomponent of bulimia may also include abuse of diuretics,enemas, insulin, or thyroid medication.Since none of the methods of purging employed bybulimics prevents absorption of calories by the body, and sinceall are extremely taxing physically, the bulimic often appearsmore simply exhausted than dangerously thin. Many bulimicsexhibit weight fluctuations, intensely critical views of theirown bodies, and a tendency toward depression. Ironically,though, the bulimic who does not yet believe that she has lostcontrol of her eating habits may seem almost too cheerful ona routine basis with a smile she will quickly assure you thateverythingiswonderfulinherlife andwillturntheconversation toward you instead. Some physical signs ofbulimia that the untrained eye may notice include brittle nails,dry and scratched skin on the surface of the hands (especiallyaround the knuckles), dry and stringy hair, and raw gums fromexcessive toothbrushing.The stress placed on her face andneck by repeated vomiting may also cause swollen cheeks andparotid glands, a chronic sore throat, and difficulty swallowing.The bulimic will frequently disappear after eating to purgeand to brush her teeth, and will become increasingly anxiouswhen she cannot be alone following meals. She may actsurprised and awkward if you happen to meet her in what shethinks is a rarely-used bathroom, or, in the case of thebackcountry, a secluded spot away from the group. OneOutward Bound instructor, reflecting on the story of the firstbulimic student that she met on a trip, recalls that \"this youngwoman kept disappearing after meals and we didn't knowwhy...We asked her about this and of course she just saidshe'd gone off to look at the woods or to see if she could findsomething or to go to the bathroom.\"The bulimic student may also demonstrate noticeablepreoccupation with group food issues. Again of the studentmentioned above, her instructor remembers that \"she was veryuptight around food always concerned about who was goingto carry it, who was going to cook it, how much there wasgoing to be.\"Mealtimes, as important cooperative socialcomponents of most backcountry trips, may pose a particularthreat to the eating disordered student.The problem with the disorders on backcountry expeditions,notes one National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) leader,is that \"eating's a big deal, cooking's a big deal. It's a socialscene and we spend a lot of time doing it; it becomes a largefocus as it is on any camping trip.\" A student may becomeincreasingly uncomfortable with her concerns about food asmealtimes and snack breaks come to dictate the structure ofher day on the trail, or she may try to seize control of thesocial setting surrounding food by keeping constant tabs onhow much others are eating and by assuming a role as cookand caretaker of the food.It is important to remember thatmealtimes, which most of your group may perceive as restfuland relaxing breaks from the stresses of backcountry travel,may be the most stressful points of the day for one of yourstudents.While the typical anorexic doesn't believe that she has aproblem, the typical bulimic realizes on some level that she haslost control of her actions, and she is ashamed of what she is MARCH/APRIL 1996doing to herself. The purpose behind the bulimic's actions,and even the signs of her problem, may be very hard torecognize precisely because bulimia has taught her to be suchan expert at hiding. She has become so good at concealing herproblem that no one else suspects what she is doing to herself.As bulimia creates a constant struggle for privacy and anagging concern with embarrassment, issues of shame and ofsecrecy come to be intimately entwined with the disorder.THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OFTHE TRIP LEADERRECOGNITION OF A PROBLEMThe most important contribution that you can make towardrecovery from an eating disorder is initial recognition of thedisorder.But the most important action that you can takewhen you do recognize an eating disorder in a student is torealize that the problem is bigger than you can handle aloneand bigger than your student can handle alone as well.While it is crucial to caution that there is no one magicalsign that will point to the eating-disordered trip participant,several issues inadditiontothewarning signs andpredisposing factors discussed above should be consideredin the backcountry.People with eating disorders tend to behigh-achieversandperfectionists,as do many outdoorenthusiasts and athletes who set high standards for themselves.The student's drive to travel through the backcountry whatbrought him to your group may arise out of the appeal ofwilderness living's elements of survival and self-denial. Foranother student, the eating disorder may serve as the onlyconstant that she perceives herself to possess as she enters intothis new environment and into relationships with unfamiliarpeople.In this sense, the eating disorder may serve as asource of security during a backcountry trip.In recognizing the magnitude of the problem, then, youmust also realize that recovery from an eating disorder is along process.An estimated 70 to 80% of bulimia patientsmarkedly improve within a few years, while anorexia morecommonly poses chronic nutrition and health problems andapproaches a mortality rate of 3 to 5%, again according toDavid Herzog.Although recovery is possible, it cannot beachieved in the field. CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATIONIf the problem cannot be cured in the field, why, then,should you be concerned beyond simple recognition of aproblem?Eating disorders may cause any of a number ofphysical problems that should be understood by the responsibleand medically-knowledgeable trip leader. A basic awarenessof these medical complications can offer you a sense ofperspective regarding the seriousness of eating disorders, andcan provide the background necessary to understand the scopeof the effects brought about by unhealthy eating patterns.Death from an eating disorder is most often sudden, withlittle or no warning. The cause of death from complications ofan eating disorder is usually cardiac: a lack of potassium maylead to cardiac arrhythmia, or muscle weakness may lead toheart failure. Although these complications are usually133WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER unsuspected before sudden cardiac death, muscle cramps mayoccasionallysignala potassiumdeficiencybeforethedeficiency has become so severe as to cause a lethalarrhythmia.Anorexicsandbulimicsarepronetoahostofcardiovascular problems aside from sudden death, includingbradycardia,cardiomyopathy,congestiveheartfailure,hypotension (with systolic pressure as low as 70 mm Hg),mitral valve prolapse, and peripheral cyanosis. Gastrointestinaldisorders such as constipation, diarrhea, pancreatitis, andesophageal or gastric dilation or rupture may often lead toamenorrhea, which in turn leads to calcium loss from bonesand signs of premature osteoporosis; stress fractures arecommon, especially in athletes. In younger people, delayedbone maturation and reduced stature may be a furtherconsequence of unhealthy eating habits.Other possiblecomplications include hair loss, cavities, loss of tooth enamel,anemia, low white blood cell count, and seizures.SOFT SKILLS AND THE OFFER FOR DISCUSSIONAn understanding of the great range of backgrounds andcomplications of eating disorders is crucial for trip leaders,who are frequently placed in roles in which they mayencounter students with such problems. But if recovery cannotbe achieved in the field, what can you do?Again, the most important role of the backcountry tripleader lies in the recognition of disordered or unhealthy eatinghabits.Early recognition and intervention can make adifference in the eventual success of treatment. This isprecisely why trip leaders need to be informed about themyriad of issues surrounding disordered eating.In fostering a safe environment to address the problem, themost effective attitude that you can take is one of openness todiscussion, demonstrating a commitment to be present andattentive in listening to students' concerns. Soft skills are ofthe essence. A major psychological complication of eatingdisorders involves the secrecy and silence that surround them;people simply don't talk about eating disorders. Do your partto help break this cycle, while respecting the student's right toprivacy. The soft skills of wilderness medical care can help toremove the shame and denial that have hampered opendiscussion of eating concerns in the past. While it will helpimmensely to be informed, do not hesitate to reach out to astudent for fear of not knowing everything possible about thespecifics of eating disorders. Sensitivity and a few goodquestions will demonstrate attentiveness and concern which,in the end, is the best that a trip leader can offer the eating-disordered student in the field.A student going through an eating disorder can reallybenefit from your support as a listener and as a means to thenext step in getting help. While you cannot force a student tochange her unhealthy habits, you can approach her with agenuine concern. The most helpful words you can offer willavoid making assumptions or judgements about your student;well-meaning efforts phrased as \"you have a problem\" or \"youare too thin\" are less likely to be heard than first-personstatements of concern such as \"I'm worried about you and Ithink that your health may be in danger\" or \"I'm scared of MARCH/APRIL 199614_what you're doing to yourself and I would like to help you getsome help.\"Be conscious of your own personal boundaries, of thelimits of your ability to intervene, if you find yourself tryingto help a student who is struggling with an eating disorder. Doyou have some personal experience or opinion that is causingher problem to affect you to the point where you cannot be ahelpful resource? If you have struggled with eating concernsand body image yourself in the past or have been close tosomeone who has been through an eating disorder, you maycompromise your own mental health if you allow yourself tobecome too involved in helping your student. Regardless ofyour own limits, remember that you can offer neitherprofessional therapy nor definitive medical care, and yourstudent needs both of these if there is to be clear hope forrecovery.Recovery is a long and complex process. In order forrecovery to be successful, the student must first acknowledgethat a problem exists. This is much more difficult than it maysound to those unaccustomed to dealing with eating concerns,and is often the biggest hurdle in the process of recovery. Inorder for psychological counseling to be effective, a medicallystable patient must be ready to confront the problem. Onlywhen the student is in a strengthened body can therapy beginwith a hope for reaching some of the underlying psychologicalhelp. Your encouragement to seek care after leaving the tripmay be the first contact that helps him begin to realize that hedoesn't need to tackle this problem alone. There is help to befound; he needs it, and he deserves it.PREVENTION AND THE PLACE OF THE ROLE MODELEven with an understanding of the complicated nature ofeating disorders, frustration lingers you are not a therapist,and the open ear that you can lend so often may feel like suchan insignificant offering.While you can do a great deal ofgood in just talking openly with students who have eating andbody image concerns, there may be a more proactive role thatyou can take to help encourage strong bodies and healthyeating habits in your students. In discussions about energylevels and body image with your students as well as in yourown day-to-day attitude, you can uphold wilderness medicine'smost effective treatment: prevention.The perception of food as fuel food not as the enemy butas a functional need of the human body is an importantoutlook to encourage in students. You can strive to emphasizehealthy eating rather than weight and calories. In nutritionseminars or discussion, depending upon the structure of the tripexperience, questions of the role of different kinds of food canbe addressed. Why are fats crucial? What diverse roles docarbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins play in helping the bodyto meet energy requirements and to maintain itsdailyactivities? What kinds of intake demands are placed upon thebody by sustained periods of high exertion, such as thoseundertaken by backcountry travellers? The discussions youinitiate can help discourage formation of distorted body imagesby young students at crucial points in their development.Another important function that you can fill is one of a rolemodel. Many students on organized backcountry trip programs 4WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER are adolescents at a crucial age in their development of self-perception and body image. You can send a valuable message in your level of comfort with your own body; you can set a good example by accepting yourself in your current physicalform and by projecting the knowledge that you do not have to be perfect in order to be outstanding and admirable. You, as the trip leader, have the opportunity to strive to fashion the trip itself as a safe space to be imperfect. You can foster an environment within which questions of self-image can be addressed, encouraging your students to search for internal points of reference rather than to absorb the opinions and advice of others unthinkingly. Furthermore; you can besomeone at this crucial developmental point who responds to the student as an individual and as a whole person, rather than identifying her within a single, narrow characteristic as \"so pretty\" or \"so smart.\"If you have an encounter with a troubled student that leaves you troubled, you need to find a way to make yourself feel better. Believe this for yourself just as you would assure your student that he deserves help in getting through his difficult time. After the experience, find someone to talk to about your experience, to \"debrief' a sympathetic friend or colleague, or perhaps a counselor whose job it is to deal with eating disorders on a routine basis. Take some time to write about your experience in a journal. Or resolve your unansweredquestions by reading to learn more about the problem that you have just helped tackle.MAKING DECISIONS FOR THE BACKCOUNTRY:SCREENING AND EVACUATIONSome organized outdoorprograms such as NOLS andOutward Bound have developed sensitive and elaboratescreening procedures to address the issues of eating disorders for applicants with a history of such concerns before these students begin a course. One NOLS administrator explains their policy: \"We ask a lot of questions about the history of it, the frequency of episodes Have they ever been treated by a professional for it?Are they still being treated by a professional? Have they ever been hospitalized? Then we spend some time talking about the effects of stress, what's in the NOLS diet, and our eating and cooking habits and whether they have considered those and their potential impacts.\"Still, inevitably, students with eating disorders that have not yet been diagnosed continue to appear on courses to the surprise of their instructors.In contemplating evacuation,any student in whom yoususpect an acute eating disorder should be considered to be in extreme danger.The most important question for the trip leader to evaluate, however, is \"How immediate isthis danger?\" Ultimately, all eating disorders have the potential to becomelife-threatening,inbothphysiologicaland psychological aspects. While the patterns of eating disordersplace great physical stress on the body, psychological threat is caught up in the cycles of control and loss of control that many eating disorders represent. An eating disorder in its beginning stages may be itsown positive reinforcement, andcan quickly escalate into a full-blown obsession that demands all of a person's time andenergy. Seeing no way out of an MARCH/APRIL 1996eating disorder and, at the same time, seeing no way out of the related problems that are perpetuating the disorder an individual may become so depressed that she finds a potential solution in the idea of suicide.The most immediate risk that the eating disordered student poses on a backc,ountry trip is one to group safety.One Outward Bound instructor describes the drain that an eating- disordered student placed on her group, noting that she was \"physically too weak to participate and hypothermic all the time...We had to give herconstant attention.\"A NOLSinstructor corroborates, noting that he's known a few students who've been brought out of the field, usually because \"they aren't eating so they can't keep their energy levels up and they're unable to stay warm.\" Furthermore, he goes on to emphasize thetripleader's need to defer medical and psychological treatment to other authorities: \"If there's active bingeing and purging going on, and our staff find out about it, my sense is that the student will be removed from the field for at least professional evaluation before continuing it just gets out of our realm of being able to make a decision.\"Another Outward Bound instructor, in an incident related by a colleague, had to make difficult judgements in deciding to evacuate a student from her semester sailing course several years ago.Determining that the evacuation was truly necessary \"was just a matter of looking at eating patterns and noticing her weakness. Shewas physically weaker [than therest of the group) she just couldn't withstand the rigors of the pulling boat.\"In the end, the decision toevacuate this student was derived from her inability to sustain the energy levels necessary to contributeto a safe and cooperative environment for all the students and instructors involved. Although your evaluation of the problems caused by an eating disorder may find the risk to be immediate in one very real sense, this is one case in which a calm approach will bea far greater asset than will a hasty and anxious response to the situation. The decision to evacuate should be based on issues of safety safety of the student, safety of the group as a whole, and safety of the staff. The medical and psychological needs of the student are greater than the group and theinstructors can provide, while her presence may be too draining for the staff to balance with the rest of the trip and may detractfrom the positive experience of other members of the group. If the student is not maintaining the necessary calories to continue safely upon the trip, then the situation needs to change for the good of all involved.The instructor who related the story of the sailing trip also mentioned that she had talked to the student some time after the evacuation and that \"she said it was the best thing...that they booted her off the course because she ended up gettingsome more intensive therapy and had actually gotten control of her eating since then.She was incredibly upset the day she was asked to leave but knew it was the right thing. She told the instructors afterward that it was the right thing, and thanked them.\"Eating disorders are difficult issues because there are no clear solutions, no universal formula to be followed towardrecovery. Despite its many complexities, when armed with a solid knowledge of the factors involved and of the safety issues at stake trip leaderscan and do make reasonable515WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER judgements about the meaning of the eating disorder to theirgroup as a whole.The trip leader's \"right\" response to aneating disorder is elusive and changeable, resting somewherewithinthe balance between theinterests of the eatingdisordered student and the needs of the rest of the group but,most of all, it is always sensitive and informed.Sources:*David Herzog, Director of Harvard Eating Disorder Center.Personal interview, March 1996.*Personal interviews with instructors and administratorsfromNationalOutdoorLeadershipSchool(RockyMountain Branch) and Outward Bound (Hurricane IslandBranch), March/April, 1996.*M.

THE STUFF OF ENDURANCEBy Buck TiltonAs the hike starts those places where you store excitementare stuffed as full as your pack. And so are those placeswhere you store glycogen, the first fuel your body burns forendurance. Glycogen was once the food you ate, derived fromcarbohydrates and strung now, like pearls, into chains ofglucose molecules. Built from your diet of the last 24 hoursor so, glycogen waits, packed into the cells of your musclesand liver, ready to provide energy. What you have eaten priorto the hike, and your level of physical fitness, determine howlong you will endure. DIET AND DOINGEnergy production takes place within each of your musclecells.For the first 20 to 30 minutes of your hike, storedmuscle glycogen provides almost your entire source of energy,with the addition of a little glucose from your blood which hasbeen released from the stores in your liver. But the drain onyour glycogen starts to tell. Hormone levels in your blood MARCH/APRIL 1996change, insulin lowering and epinephrine rising, and stored fatsbegin to play an increasing role in providing energy. At the90-minute mark for the average backpacker, fats and bloodglucose have become a major supplier of endurance. With twohours behind you, glycogen has almost been used up.Fortunately,yourfatsupplyisvirtuallyinexhaustible.Unfortunately,fatswon't burn unlesscarbohydrates arepresent, and continued exercise depends on your musclestaking glucose from your blood. You must take on morecarbos or you start to poop out.Replenishing carbosismost effectivewithadrinkcontainingasixtosevenpercentconcentrationofcarbohydrates (e.g. Gatorade, Exceed, Sytomax). Choose thedrink that tastes best to you. Within minutes glucose will bespilling into your bloodstream. Higher concentrations areabsorbed more sluggishly,sometimes causing anupsetstomach. For optimum endurance, drinks should be taken insmall swallows consistently throughout periods of exercise ata rate of about a liter per hour. Start sipping around 30minutes into your hike to avoid carbo depletion.If you don't like carbo-replacement drinks, endurance canbe maintained with energy bars (e.g. PowerBars, Exceed SportBars).They'll take 30 to 60 minutes to go into action, andthey must be followed with the same drinking regimen usingplain water.Even if you're using drinks for carbohydrates,you should still start munching something about 90 minutesinto your exercise, to ensure your blood glucose stays highenough to prevent exhaustion. When energy stores areexhausted, they take a long time to rebuild, up to a day.Carbohydrates can be replaced with regular old food (suchas breads and sweets) and water, but they just aren't asefficient.Besides, energy bars are lightweight and compact,with a lot of calories, and little garbage to pack out.Another reason exists for keeping your carbo intakeadequate. After two hours of strenuous backpacking withouttaking the time to replenish carbohydrates, your brain, whichfeeds almost entirely off blood glucose, may begin to complainwith headaches and dizziness. Your ability to think thingsthrough carefully will rapidly diminish. You may find yourselfin serious trouble.To maintain energy stores within your muscles the normalAmerican diet of approximately 46 percent carbohydrates isnot enough.\"A diet containing 70 percent carbohydrate isrecommended when you're exercising hard, \" writes EllenColeman in her book Eating for Endurance. Ms. Colemansuggest balancing you diet from the four food groups dairy,protein, fruit-vegetable, and grain then doubling your intakeof fruits-vegetables and tripling your intake of grains toachieve a high carbo diet.Primary carbohydrate sources arecereals, breads, pastas, muffins, pancakes, rolls, rice and othergrain products, fruits and vegetables.Carbohydrateloading,achieving maximum glycogen storage,is a combination of diet and exercise that endurance athletes166WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER sometimes use (see Ms. Coleman's book for complete details.)But, since exercise stimulates high muscle glycogen storage,you can't load more carbos unless you're involved inendurance training.TRAININGFor food to be burned into energy, oxygen must be presentin each cell. The harder you work, the more oxygen you use.But you, and everyone else, will reach a place during exercisebeyond which your ability to utilize oxygen will not increase,even should the intensity of your exercise continue to rise.When you are using oxygen at you maximum capacity, youhave reached an exercise plateau of 100 percent aerobiccapacity. You can only function at maximum for about fiveminutes. Then you've reached another poop-out point.Training for endurance will increase your ability to utilizeoxygen.That, in practical terms, means you'll be able tocover the same distance on the trail with less effort, or agreater distance with the same effort.\"We define endurance exercise,\" writes Coleman, \"asexercising for three to five days per week, for 20 to 60minutes, at 50 to 80 percent...of aerobic capacity...(or 60 to 90percent of maximum heart rate).\" Find your maximum heartrate by subtracting your age from 220. On this trainingregimen, you can maximize your aerobic capacity in sixmonths to two years, depending on the intensity of yourexercise and your genetic predisposition.HYDRATION\"Water,\" says Ms. Coleman, \"is the most commonlyoverlooked endurance aid.\" Even very mild dehydrationproduces a loss of efficiency. Before heading out along thetrail, drink a half-liter of cold water. Cold fluids empty fromthe stomach quicker and cool the engine, preparing it for theheat stress of the exercise to come. Then keep up theconsistent drinkingplain water or energy drink at theliter per hour rate. WHO'S WHO IN WILDERNESS MEDICINEAN INTERVIEW WITH DR. BILL HERRINGBy Lucy Hopkin Dr. Bill Herring is an orthopedic surgeon based out ofBoone, North Carolina. On top of his busy schedule practicingmedicine in the controlled environment of the clinic, Dr.Herring has also been involved with medicine in developingcountries. On the Board of Advisors and Safety Committeefor the North Carolina Outward Bound Schools, Dr. Herring isan active member of the Mountain Alliance Group in Booneand has 15 years experience as team sports physician forAppalachian State University. Dr. Herring has done asignificantamount ofwildernessmedicaltrainingfororganizations like Appalachian State University, Wilderness MARCH/APRIL 1996Medical Associates, NASAR, and SOLO.WMN: In which developing countries were you involved withthe teaching of medicine?Dr. Herring: Zaire, Haiti, Nepal, and Honduras.WMN: Was this work in association with any particulargroup, or was this work done independently?Dr. Herring: Different groups. Some of it was working inmissions with the Presbyterian Church. The two trips toHonduras were with the Episcopal Church in North Carolina.WMN:It has been said that practicing medicine in thesedeveloping countries is like practicing in the wilderness. Howwould you describe the similarities of these two environments?Dr. Herring:I think third world medicine is similar towilderness medicine in two primary regards. The number onereason isthat often there issignificant delay in gettingdefinitive treatment.And the second reason is that, youusually have to improvise when you are practicing medicine inthird world countries. Improvisation is frequently an elementin that situation just as it is with wilderness medicine. So,those are the two biggest things that come to mind the delayin definitive treatment and improvisations. This is simplybecause you don't have the things available to you that youwould have in our medical culture.WMN: You're an orthopedic surgeon. What would you sayis the most common backcountry orthopedic emergency thatyou see?Dr. Herring:Probably the most common significant injurywould fall under the category of shoulder dislocations. Ingeneral, however, the most common orthopedic injuries that Isee in the backcountry setting would be knee and anklesprains.WMN: When learning shoulder dislocation reduction, manystudents voice concerns about doing further injury or damage.How safe is it for Wilderness First Responders or WildernessEMT's to be attemptingto shoulder relocations in thebackcountry?Dr. Herring:I think if they have had proper training, as wellas a basic understanding of what they are doing, that it is asafe procedure.WMN: What would be an example of a complication aprovider might run into?Dr. Herring:Complications would occur if somebodydisregarded: number one, the patient's complaints of increasedpain when you started the reduction, and, number two, ifsomebody continued to forcefully manipulate a joint, say ashoulder, in the face of a feeling a mechanical block. Thedanger in this instance would be possible or potential nerve 1 7WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER and vascular damage primarily. But if people are educated, dothe procedure properly, and realize what the constraints are,then there really should be very little chance of furtherdamage.WMN: Prevention is really emphasized in wilderness medicaltraining.Is there one thing that you can say about preventionthat may minimize some of the injuries that come in from thebackcountry?Dr. Herring: I think probably the first thing that would cometo mind would be being well prepared for whatever thebackcountry venture might be. That might be mentalpreparedness to deal with whatever the activity is, whatever thesetting is, or it might deal with equipment preparedness. Ithink being prepared for what the adventure is would probablybe the key to injury prevention.WMN: What do you consider your greatest contribution tothe field of wilderness medicine?Dr. Herring:I hope that my contribution is being able toshare with people a way to more safely enjoy the wildernessenvironment.I can't think of anything that I would call amajor contribution.WMN: I don't know, education doesn't come cheap! You'vecertainly touched a heck of a lot of people through all theteaching you've done.Dr. Herring: Well, I think education is important and I dofeel like I've been able to contribute in that area through theyears in the various programs with which I've worked. I thinkI have touched many folks that spend a lot of time in variouswilderness endeavors.But as far as saying what a majorcontribution has been, I couldn't do that.WMN: If we were to find Dr. Herring out in the backcountry,what would he be doing?Dr. Herring: Golly, that takes in a broad spectrum of things!Depending on the season I enjoy kayaking and mountainbiking, rock climbing, backpacking, and skiing cross countryas well as downhill.I enjoy all those things. It's pretty mucha seasonal thing depending on the time of the year. I wouldbe hard put to pick a favorite but if I had to, it would probablybe kayaking.WMN: Would it be okay if readers contacted you if they hadany further questions?Dr. Herring:Sure, that would be fine.Please MARCH/APRIL OF WILDERNESSMEDICAL TRAININGFor information on upcoming courses, including datesand locations, please contact the following:schools:SOLO, Wilderness & Emergency Medicine603-447-6711Wilderness Medicine Institute970-641-3572Many other groups offer training, feel free to ask fornames of other established organizations.

Box 3150, Conway, NH 03818.Editor-in-Chief: Holly A. Bryan Yeaton; NEWSLETTER AND ISSN-1059-6518IMMERSION FOOTby Tod Schimelpfening,NOLS Rocky Mountain School Director Immersion foot results from prolonged exposure to wet,cold conditions conditions which many outdoor recreationistsavoid.But military operations rarely have the luxury ofchoosing their weather conditions, and like National OutdoorLeadership School (NOLS) expeditions, may live and work fordays in weather conducive to the development of immersioninjury.Understandably, therefore, much of what we knowabout non-freezing cold injury immersion foot or trenchfoot comes from the military. In World War I when theterm trench foot was coined the British Army aloneexperienced 29,000 immersion foot casualties in the winter of1915-16, while frostbite and immersion foot casualties for U.S.forces in Europe in WW II totaled 90,000. This article,written for wilderness leaders, shares NOLS' experience withimmersion foot.What is immersion foot?Immersion foot is a local, non-freezing injury that occursin cold, wet conditions, usually in temperatures of 30-40 F. Ithappens even in the tropics as a result of conductive heat lossfrom immersion in cold water. The injury occurs when bloodvessels constrict in response to heat loss, reducing blood flowto the extremity and depriving cells of oxygen and nutrients.The ensuing injury may range from a few weeks of sore feetto permanent muscle and nerve damage. In some cases,victims experience months of pain and disability and evenamputation.Severe immersion foot produces a wet gangrene which isdifficult to treat and may require early aggressive surgery.Frostbite, in contrast, can result in dry gangrene, easier to treatmedically although still serious.Trenchfoot isa combination of immersion foot withmechanical trauma.Often the term is used interchangeablywith immersion foot.Before we clearly identified the phenomena of cold non-freezing injury, NOLS Instructors knew that our feet, after a 19VOLUME 7, NUMBER 3 month of postholing in the wet spring snows of the RockyMountains, would inevitably be numb and painful. Soakingwet leather boots and socks are a clear risk. We've seenimmersion injury in cooler climates from sweat-dampenedsocks.We've experienced immersion foot in plastic boots,neoprene socks and other vapor barrier systems, as well aswith supergaiters and gore-tex boots. It happens on winter skitrips and in the desert.At NOLS, signs and symptoms tend to occur while peopleare on hiking or skiing expeditions, but may also develop if theextremity (s)is immobile and exposed to a cool, dampenvironment for an extended period of time for example, ina lifeboat or with paddlers sitting all day in kayaks on coldriver trips.This same injury also occurs to fingers from wetmittens what I call \"immersion or dachstein hand.\"We used to think that at least 12 hours of exposure to cold,wet conditions was necessary to produce the injury. You willstill hear this figure quoted, and it's probably true in mostcases.Our experience however, tells us that it can happenmuch quicker, over a long, wet, cold hiking day for example,or in a multi-hour river crossing. Murray Hamlet, an expert onnon-freezing cold injury, says the minimum exposure is aslittle as three hours, although he thinks it takes 12 hours tohave a seriousinjury.These episodes of short onsetimmersion foot could be due to individual susceptibility, orcould be the culminating event of long-term exposure. Thereare times when our diligence prevents immersion foot,although we will have chronically cool and constricted feet.But as little as an afternoon's lapsed attention can ourbest efforts.Assessment of Immersion Foot*\"Classic\" and SymptomsImmersion footisusually described a worst casescenario:the extremity appears cold, swollen and mottled.Cyanosis is usually present. Tactile sensitivity is reduced, asis capillary refill time. The foot may look shiny. The patient may describe the foot asfeeling wooden. When the extremitywarms, the skin becomes warm, dry and red.The pulse isbounding. The injury is painful. The injured area may itch,tingle and exhibit increased sensitivity to cold, which maypossibly be a permanent sensitivity. The recovery period canlast weeks.Nerve damage may be permanent. Thedevelopment of blisters, ulcers, and gangrene is possible.*Common Signs and SymptomsAll these \"classic\" signs and symptoms are true. However,we most often see subtle forms of non-freezing cold injury thatdo not necessarily look mottled, gray, or waxy, nor do wealways experience poor capillary refill, or altered skin colorand temperature.All we may see are cool pale extremities,numbness or tingling and mild swelling. We may see mottledareas, often on the underside of the foot. Only rarely are ourcases serious enough for the patient to describe wooden-likefeet or a cotton-wool sensation, to experience edema andblistering, or to be unable to walk. Pain is unusual in the field,more common after blood flow has returned to the extremity.Pain onset may be delayed by 24 hours, and may not evenfully develop for several days. People may also complain ofitching after rewarming.I've seen several people whose immersion feet were warm,dry, and pink with good capillary refill time. Numb toes werethe chief complaint of one, painful feet of another. We scratchour heads and wonder if this is a cold injury, \"numb toe\" fromboot pressure, or simply a case of sore feet in a person new towalking long distances.Murray Hamlet says we should besuspicious about any numbness, tingling, or pain in our feetwhen we are in cool conditions. I agree with him. Nerves aremost susceptible to injury from reduced blood flow. Many ofthe long-term effects of immersion foot are due to damagednerves in our feet:Pain, numbness, chronic tingling anditching.The patient may not notice the constricted condition of theirfeet until they are warmed after the trip. We've learned toadvise peoplereturning from prolonged wet and coldconditions to avoid long, hot showers or baths. The rapidwarming can surprise the unwary with swollen, painful, andred feet.Treatment for Immersion FootWarm an immersion foot slowly at room temperature. Inserious cases swelling, pain, and blister formation will preventwalking. In most cases the extremity will only be sore. Avoidwalking on injured feet and elevate the feet to reduce theswelling.Bed rest, along with avoiding trauma, is oftennecessary until the injury heals. Ibuprofen is recommendedbecause of its anti-inflammatory properties. Aspirin andacetaminophen may also help.It has been our experience, which has been shared bymilitary experts, that non-freezing cold injuries can producepain resistant to the strongest of medicine. Patients cannotwalk, wear shoes, or even accept the pressure of a bedsheet ontheir feet. Their feet look normal, but they have pain that 220defies medication.PreventionImmersion foot can be dismissed as a disease of the past bythose who think modern equipment provides protection, but therecent experience of the British and Argentine armies in theFalklands demonstrates that this is not the case. The Britishused 42 different boot/sock combinations and none provedeffective in this cold, wet climate. It was only their behaviorand leadership that kept them from having immersion footamputations, although the condition affected many of thetroops.The Argentines on the other hand, with poorleadership and untrained troops, suffered 274 amputations.Our experience is that in prolonged cold, wet conditionssome degree of immersion foot is inevitable. A recent militarystudy noted an incidence of one in ten during wet coldconditions. The best footwear/gaiter system can be of littlehelp.Itis the daily interaction between the equipment,outdoor skills, and habits of vigilance and assessment that areessential in controlling this incidence rate. What follows aresuggestions from NOLS instructors that we have accumulatedover the years.*There is no new thing under the sun...In WWI the British reduced immersion foot casualties from29,000 to 400 per winter by using techniques (without makingsignificant footwear changes) that we still follow today: creategood boot fit with heavy wool socks; keep the body warm;remove socks and dry and massage the feet twice a day; do notsleep in wet footwear; dry wet socks against your skin; keepyour feet out of water or mud as much as possible; watchcarefully and react promptly if you experience numbness ortingling; keep footwear loose to allow for circulation.*Dry your socks...Drying socks is a continual activity on wilderness trips.During the day we stick wet socks into our shirts to dry themagainst the skin, and, likewise at night, drape them over ourchest and belly in our sleeping bags. We'll hang them in thesun and dry them over a fire. Keep one pair of dry socks ina dry place such as in a sleeping bag or a small plastic bag.*Sleep with warm, dry feet...Sleeping in dry feet is very helpful, but there is a falseimpression that this offers complete protection. People copingwith multi-day, wet, cold conditions have developed immersionfoot by hiking for a single day in wet socks. A single night ofsleeping in cool wet socks has undone weeks of vigilantattention. Not only should we go to bed with warm dry feet,they need to stay that way all night long.*Look at your feet...We suggest leaders check in with participants regularly andconsider periodic visual inspection. Warming cool feet on acompanion's belly, or stopping to change socks in the middleof the day should be routine tasks, not impositions. When theconditions are ideal for trench foot to occur, you may need tokey into susceptible people aggressively. Many suggest twice MAY/JUNE 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER daily visual checks, changes to dry socks, and foot massagesto help circulation.Visual checking must be part of theroutine. A verbal confirmation is insufficient. Messages sentto the brain are faulty due to nerve damage. If during the dayyou experience damp socks or feet that are feeling sweaty, airyour feet and change into dry socks.*In camp...When you get to camp, get out of your wet bootsimmediately. Change into a pair of dry socks and begin toactively dry your wet or damp socks. Warm your feetpromptly. Don't wait until bedtime.*Foot powder...Foot powder does not seem to be helpful in preventingimmersion injury, although for some, its use is as a disciplinein conjunction with changing socks. People with a tendencytoward athlete's feet (fungal foot infections) have foundmedicated foot powders helpful.*Role model good habits...Role modeling of good foot care by leaders on the trail andin camp is essential.The image of a cold injury to manyoutdoor enthusiastsis oftenfrostbite, and they arelessinformed on the subtleties of cold non-freezing injuries.Novices often assume some degree of cooling is unavoidableand acceptable and inadvertently cross a line from extremitycoolingtoa coldinjury.Ifparticipantsseeleadersaggressively dealing with their feet, they are more likely to dothe same.I talked with three backpackers last summer who got theirimmersion foot by tolerating cold, moist feet during long dayson the trail.Over time, this tolerance grew into immersionfoot, despite the fact that they claimed to sleep with warm dryfeet.All three were surprised and denied any precipitatingsigns or symptoms. All thought they could get by letting theirfeet be cool during the day and warming them at night:unfortunately, they were caught by the subtle onset of thisnasty, insidious injury.*If your core is not warm your feet will be cold...Poor nutrition, dehydration, wet socks, inadequate clothing,and the constriction of the blood flow by the shoes, socks,gaiters, or tight clothing are all predisposing factors.*Equipment...Plastic boots and supergaitors are improvements overleather boots.Rubber galoshes, while unfashionable, haveproven inexpensive, simple and helpful in keeping footweardry.A NOLS instructor coping with last deep summer'ssnowpack said, \"I would advise people take booties, insoles,and galoshes.Camp shoes in galoshes are just not warmenough when living on snow 24-hours a day.\"Have multiple pairs of socks, two pair on your feet and atleast two spare pairs. More than six pairs is not a bad idea,but we have found novices with multiple pairs avoiding dryingand stashing wet socks in their packs. I had a student who21avoided drying socks for weeks by trading candy bars andeven cash for dry socks.Commendable outcome, dubiousmethods.*Instill awareness...Immersion foot is subtle and insidious. We have to stressprevention in the absence of noticeable signs and symptomsa challenging task but we pull it off with altitude illness andhypothermia.When initially speaking with novices, ask if their feet tendto sweat, tend to be cold, or hard to keep warm. People whosefeet sweat excessively may be more apt to develop trench foot.Wet socks increase conductive heat loss.*The evacuation decisionThe evacuation decision for immersion foot is not blackand white, so I'll make a few comments to help us navigatethe gray areas. In some cases evacuation will be clear from amedical perspective: inability to walk,signs of serious coldinjury such as cyanosis or symptoms such as numb cold feetor complaints of pain (which may not be relieved with ourpain medications). We step into the gray when we suspect wehave intervened early and signs and symptoms are mild. Wenow have to consider factors that are less medical, more in therealm of expedition leadership: the trip route, anticipatedweather conditions, ease or difficulty of evacuation later in thetrip and the patient's outdoor skills. I don't want to give theimpression that all cases need to be evacuated; this is likely,but not universally true.If we can keep the feet warm anddry, the patient can stay in the field, but, they have to be ableto care for themselves with unswerving diligence. There canbe no further lapses in attention or technique.Closing thoughtsCommon threads in many NOLS immersion foot scenariosare people who tolerate cold feet, wait too long beforeintervening, and who are surprised when they discover theyhave been injured. Having had serious frostbite, my attitudeis if your feet are not definitely warm, you're doing somethingwrong. People may believe they have to tolerate some levelof cold extremities as an unavoidable consequence of camping.While there is some truth to this, a novice lacks the experienceto know how much they can tolerate before an injury occursand even an expert can be fooled. I'm one of those peoplewho rationalized delaying rewarming by saying, \"My feet arecold but they are not that cold.\" I wrong.SourcesGentile D.A., Morris J.A., Schimelpfenig T., Bass EmergMed.

TRIP LEADER'S PRIMERBy Bryan Yeaton, WEMTWell, the snow has finally melted, flowers are poking theirruffled collars out of the soil, leaves are stretching out of thetrees, and every student in every school has been gripped bythe fever spring is here, and it is time to get outside!To much oftheoutdoorcommunity,thismeansopportunity:i.e. jobs. One of the most common reasons forpeople to become certified in Wilderness Medicine is to leadexcursions into the backwoods or backwaters. Adults or kids,underprivileged or overprivileged, glacier or desert, woods orwater, high altitude or below the sea: all lend a different twistto what you may experience as a Wilderness trip leader. Ifyou are getting ready to lead trips this summer, or if you arelooking toward getting into a leadership position, you shouldbe aware of what the organizations who run these trips expectfrom the people they hire.Ray Auger, Director of High School Programs for theStudent Conservation Association (SCA), hires leaders to takehigh school students into National Parks and National Foreststo build or repair trails. Auger looks for, \"Experience: a highproficiency in outdoor travel and living, plus the ability tomotivate teens.\" Auger may put up to ninety leaders in thefield in any summer season who are \"responsible for the safetyand well-being of students, often in remote settings.\"Allyson Krzyzaniak of The Biking Expedition in Henniker,New Hampshire, also seeks applicants who know what toexpect. \"We get around 150 resumes for 15 positions everyyear. We advertise very specifically that we are looking forprevious experience with adolescents.\" Krzyzaniak says thatmany of the \"experiences\" included by applicants aren'trelevant to the position. \"Some don't really understand whatthe position is about, she says; \"We are very honest about whatwe need. The market is more competitive, and we have toexpect more responsibility and skills.\"Auger also sees many applications targeted through the\"scatter approach.\" He says, \"Applicants have to know theorganization and the position to which they are applying. Ourneeds are very specific outdoor skills, working with kids,working with tools, organizational skills. It is obvious from aresume if you are applying to us specifically or applying tomany types of outdoor organizations. Our application for theSCA is very detailed; by the time someone fills it outcompletely, he or she knows whether or not they areappropriate for the job.\"At Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center,Program Director of Operations Bill Aughton stresses not onlyhard skills, but motivation as well. He says, \"We certainlyrequire some identification of hard skills- if you are going to22lead 5.9 rock climbs or Class V canoeing, you need to be ableto do it.But we also look for real enthusiasm; this is whatyou go out and do for fun, not just to satisfy a job.\"Enthusiasm is less tangible than skills or experience, butdealing with participantsin remote areas requires manyunmeasurable talents. Program directors acknowledge both theimportance of intangibles, and the difficulty of discerning themfrom resumes and interviews. Marcy Berkowitz of The RoadLess Travelled, a Chicago-based organization, says that hercompany looks for \"the sound of the genuine.\" She adds, \"Wewant to find people who aren't in this for their own ends, butto enable kids to grow, to find their own successes.\"At the SCA, Ray Auger uses scenarios to tell if applicantsare \"woodsy or wanna-be's.\" \"We want to get some idea ofhow people will react in a given situation; it is black-flyseason in Vermont, it has been raining and the tents leak. Thecrew is ready to mutiny. What do you do? There are manycreative solutions to the problem, but no right answer.\"According to Krzyzaniak, good leaders have the ability tolisten and to communicate, and they genuinely care about allofthemembers ofthegroup,includingthemselves.\"\"Anyone,\" she adds, \"can rock climb. To be effective as aleader,you needacombinationofthings,especiallycommunication skills.\"For Berkowitz, a leader must be \"very pressure: able to handle any situation whichcomes along.\"Berkowitz says her company looks for highenergy, along with excellent organizational skills. Ray Augeragrees.\"Our leaders,\" says Auger, \"are responsible for all thelogistics- food, tools, work projects, transportation,and budget.We need to know if they can handle these complexities in anorganized fashion. Have they managed budgets before? Plus,we are looking for low-key, easy-going personalities, peoplewho are appropriate in their language and behaviors, who willcomply with our policies and protocols.\"Berkowitz agrees:\"Our leaders have the same values asour programs.\" Astheriskassessment and management facets ofwilderness programs becomes more important and morescrutinized, program managers are demanding more training inwilderness medicine from their potential leaders. All of theorganizations interviewed for this article require wildernessmedical training, as opposed to \"street-oriented\" first aid.\"Wilderness medicine is \"incredibly important\" at The RoadLess Travelled,accordingtoBerkowitz.\"For twenty participants, we have four leaders a 5:1 ratio with aminimum of two leaders being at least Wilderness FirstResponder (WFR) or Emergency Medical Technician (EMT orWEMT).In reality, 80 percent of our leaders hold thesecertifications. 4 MAY/JUNE 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER The stakes are increasing.According to Ray Auger, \"Up until this year, we have required a minimum of Wilderness First Aid (WFA) [most oftena 16-hour course]; 80-hour course]. More and more, says Auger, \"the SCA prefers leaders to come in with the training. \"We sometimes will offer these courses, but would rather have them certified before they get here.\"Bill Aughton views wilderness medicine from several perspectives. A formerpararescuer for the British military, hehas also worked with Mountain Rescue Service in North Conway, New Hampshireand co-foundedInternational Mountain Equipment. Before coming to Outward Bound, he instructed wilderness medicine for Stonehearth Open Learning Opportunities (SOLO), andmost recently directed Search and Rescue Operations for theAppalachian Mountain Club. Aughton has strong feelingsabout the wildernessaspect of medical training:\"There is a savvy neededfor practicing medicine outdoors; it is much more than just medicine. All therescue gear in the world won't do you any good if you or your patient gets cold.\" Hecontinues, \"I would muchrather take lots of food and clothingand water than lots ofgear, and I used to sell gear.\" Aughton points to acase on Mount Washington, the highestpeak in the Northeast,renowned for its wicked weather. \"There was a rescue in theAnunonoosuc Ravine [on the west side of the mountain],\" heexplains.\"The local ambulance crew responded; it was just chucking down rain and they had no appropriate gear. Fortunately, the carry only took aboutan hour, or there would havebeen a far more seriousproblem with lots of patients.\"\"I would rather,\" heconcludes, \"have a good WFA in the than streetEMT with no outdoorskills. Wilderness medicine teachesyou to improvise from what you have, and not to relyon specialized equipment.\"For people lookingto leading trips,gaining allthis experience and trainingcan seem daunting. The people who do the hiring acknowledgethat there are dues to bepaid.\"Most of our \"are teachersor as Bound.\" that well-qualified leaders are hard to find. \"We can teach you howto fix a bike in fouror five days; we can't, in that time, teachyou how to work with kids,\" she says. \"We like to see leadership experience:NOLS, Outward Bound, or a college outing club.Although we offersome training, those leaders whocome to us with their certificationshave already demonstratedcommitment.\"Ray Auger adds, \"Ourprogram is very specialized;a summer camp for 12-year old's is very different from leading a backcountry trails program. We also require the abilityto 5work safely withtools; not necessarily just trailtools: carpentry and farming can be applicable skills as well.\"Many organizationssupport- and offer- an apprenticeshipbefore trying to assumea role.\"There aren't enough good, experiencedfolks,\" according He likes experiencegained from watchinga mentor: \"There is no substitute fortraining under someone with more experience. But,\" he cautions, \"be ready to work forpoor pay for one or two years.\"Thompson Island offersboth internships and assistantships.The SCA also hasa method for leader candidates to gain more relevant experience. \"We will pair a new leader with one who has run several programs,\" says Ray Auger, \"then, in a year or two, they may be ready to run their own programs.\"Many supervisors speak ofhaving plenty of applicants,but relatively few with all theright stuff. Says Krzyzaniak, \"With each certification we requireWFR, CPR, water safety we narrow the field of applicants. Then you have to add inskills such as communicationand facilitation.\"In the end, it is impossibleto predict how an individual will react to a situationin the field. The decisionto hire or not may come down tointangibles.\"MI trips mayseem similar on the surface, butcan be very different,\"says Marcy Berkowitz.\"The key is to finda good match between the individual and the organization; for us, that'ssomeone who is concerned about theindividuals and the group.\"\"At The Biking Expedition,we look for flexibility and honesty,\" says Krzyzaniak.\"Does the leader havea set way of dealing with situations,or is she or he adaptable? From the interview we can informa general impression, then call the references for verification.\"Bill Aughton looks for\"confidence and self-assurance. We can teach people a lot of things, but we don't know howto teach judgement.At Outward Boundwe lean heavily on experience,someone who has shown enthusiasmand dedication to a skill. Thethings you teach peopleat Outward Bound should be thesame things you do for fun.\"As the owner of acompany, Allyson1Crzyzaniak knows the leaders she puts in the fieldreflect on her and herorganization. \"All the work we do,\"she says, \"means nothingif we have good leaders.The market ismore competitive; companies are payingmore money for good leaders, they have to expect more responsibility and skills.\" YOU CAN'T LIVE ONBREAD ALONEBy Jen Senwn, NREMT-INutrition to people,but what it all comes downto is providing energyto fuel the furnace that powersus up mountains, down rivers, and through the woods. Food providesthe fuel to feed the seriesof 23MAY/JUNE 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER biochemical reactions that allow us to do the things we do.So, how does it work? Well, it's really quite simple. At avery basic biochemical level, glucose burned in the presenceof oxygen creates energy. (How's that for the Krebs cycle in10 words or less?) To most effectively function we need adiet with the proper proportions of carbohydrates, fats, andprotein.Carbohydrates, the principle energy source, are defined assimple or complex. Simple carbohydrates are sugars: glucose,fructose, and sucrose. All these sugars require very little workby our bodies to give us a quick boost of high energy. Theproblem with these \"quick-fix\" energy sources is that theydon't last long and often bring our energy levels lower thanwhere we started. Complex carbohydrates, starches which aremade up of long chains of simple sugars, are found in grainsand vegetables (especially root veggies). Since these breakdown slowly, they provide a longer burning fuel source thatwill keep us going for greater periods of time. Any extraglucose from the breakdown of carbs is converted into a morecomplex molecule, glycogen, and stored in the liver andmuscle tissue in anticipation of future energy needs. Abalanced diet should include about 60% carbs.Another source of energy, fatsare essentialtotheproduction of steroid hormones, cell membranes and vitaminsA, D, and E while dietary fats have been implicated inincreased risk of heart disease and cancer (and this may be trueif eaten in large quantities), fats are an essential part of ourdiet when used in moderation. Fats provide over twice thecalories per gram as either carbohydrates or protein, whichmakes them an efficient source of energy in the backcountryespecially in the winter when it takes more calories to keepour internal fires burning.Fats should account for 25% of ahealthy diet and can be found in dairy products, nuts, andmeats.Protein is second only to water in its abundance in thehuman body. It is not, however, a primary energy source. Weneed 15% protein in our diet to support the growth of newtissue and to rebuild the proteins broken down during exercise.Proteins are made up of combinations of 22 different aminoacids; eight of which, called essential amino acids, must beprovided by our diet.Fish, meat, eggs, and dairy contain alleight of the essential amino acids, while grains and vegetablesby themselves do not. So, if we just eat grains and vegetables,we have to mix and match to provide a complete protein.Beans and rice are a good example of two incomplete proteinswhich, when served together, provide a complete proteinsource.Obviously our total intake must meet our body's need forenergy, and our body's energy requirement depends on thetype of activity we choose. Being a couch potato requires farfewer calories than a winter ascent of a favorite summit. Thespecific numbers change depending on the person and theactivity, but the general guidelines remain the same: 60%carbohydrates, 25% fats and 15% protein is the formula toenable a healthy body to take us where we want to go.If we don't provide the proper amount of fuel for ourbodies, there may be consequences to pay further down theroad - the most obvious of which is not having the energystores to keep us going. We've all experienced the misery ofa 5000 calorie hike with a 2000 calorie food supply. Our \"getup and go\" gets up and goes and we're left feeling lethargic,weak, and cranky. Fortunately, bodies can compensate for thislack of calories by utilizing alternate fuel sources - glycogenfrom the liver and fats from storage. (This is what we'retrying to do when we exercise to aid in losing weight.) Longterm, however, it becomes harder for our bodies to create feastfrom famine and we are forced to breakdown more importantbody tissues such as muscle to access proteins as an additionalenergy source.The resultant loss of muscle mass clearlycauses a decrease in performance. Long-ter deficiency indiet can lead to weakened immune system, hormonal changes,electrolyte imbalance, anemia, and inability to extract theessential nutrients we need from the food we eat. While notimmediately evident, these changes can affect our body'sability to function later in life. In order to maximize efficiencyin the short term and stay healthy and active in the long term,a proper diet is essential.WHO'S WHO IN WILDERNESS MEDICINE?AN INTERVIEW WITHROBERT ROSE, M.D.BY FRANK HUBBELL, DO With each issue of the Wilderness Medicine Newsletter, wetry to present an individual who has made a significantcontribution to Wilderness Medical Care. That contributionmay be in the form of teaching, research, rescue, or patientcare.This month I would like to introduce you to RobertRose, MD, an extraordinary visionary and provider of medicalcare in areas of the world lacking access to modern medicine.WMN: How did you get involved in wilderness medicine?Dr. Rose:I have always been an avid outdoorsman andadventure traveler. While I was at medical school, I attendeda talk by a doe who had been practicing medicine in a remotearea of Tanzania.Later, when IrealizedIhad someuncommitted time before beginning internship, I contacted thedoe and ended up spending six weeks in the shadow of MountKilimanjaro providing health care in an isolated, medicallyunderserved community.WMN: Have you had other experiences of this nature?Dr. Rose:After internship I went in Family Practice butended up in Emergency Medicine which brought me to anemergency department inthe White Mountains of NewHampshire.I became involved with ACTS - AmericansCaring, Teaching, and Sharing - a group dedicated to bringinghealth care to rural Honduras. Over a period of 10 yearsACTS established and staffed several clinics which are prettyself-sufficient now. 6 MAY/JUNE 199624WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER WMN: What are the greatest challenges you face in thesesettings?Dr. Rose:Practicing medicine in remote areas withoutmodern diagnostic tools and equipment is really difficult andthe difficulty is compounded by working with the complexitiesof another culture.There is no 911 no specialists, you're WMN: What projects are you currently involved with?Dr. Rose:I recently formed a not-for-profit organizationcalled GEOMED whose mission istoassist medicallyunderserved countries in developing a sustainable grassrootshealthcare system. Learning that in El Salvador's capital, SanSalvador, a group of people call the city dump home, we haveteamed up with a local project to not only help provide healthcare and basic education, but also to develop light industriesand improve the overall standard of living. This model hasbeen deemed successful and is being exported to several othercommunities in El Salvador.WMN: What lies in GEOMED's future?Dr. Rose:Interest and we arelookingfor other projects.Because GEOMED isanorganization run by volunteers and the projects are staffed byvolunteers, we areintheprocess of determiningthequalifications for these volunteers and have concluded thatthere is a need for a training program. This fall GEOMEDwill be offering an eight-week program here in the WhiteMountains to prepare future GEOMEDICs for a seven-monthwork commitment in the rural areas of El Salvador.WMN: What will a GEOMEDIC's training consist of?Dr.Rose:The GEOMEDIC Program willincludeEMT/WEMT certification, training in followship/leadership,team-building, logistics, basic skills of water and sanitationengineering, tropical medicine, as well as cultural, social, andlanguage skills. GEOMEDICs will then be placed with severalother GEOMEDICs in various health care settings around ElSalvador for seven months. At these sites they will work withEl Salvadoran health care providers to develop and providesustainable grassroots health care services. As part of theprocess, they will also provide education for the individuals inthe community on the basics of health care, like proper woundcare to prevent infection, how to properly manage a village'swater supply to minimize diseases spread by water, child care,etc.WMN: How can someone become a GEOMEDIC?Dr. Rose:Anyone interested in becoming involved withGEOMED' s programs can contact me for more information.The response for applications for the GEOMEDIC programand positions has been very good. The fall program is fullwith 18 individuals ready to take the Geomedic program andhead off to El Salvador for seven months.

Itis the pilot, navigator, and guide. The musculoskeletal systemis the vehicle that the brain drives as it navigates through life.As with any mode of transportation, it is the vehicle that hasa tendency to take the wear and tear, not the driver.The musculoskeletal system has two distinct parts that worktogether: the skeleton and the musculature. The skeletalsystem affords us protection from the external environment andthe rigid support required for movement. Its bones are thestorage site for calcium reserves, required by the muscles forcontraction and by the nerves for communication. Its bonemarrow is the production site for the cellular components ofbloodred blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Themuscles provide the power of locomotion, while muscularcontraction creates a source of heat production. Together themuscles and the bones determine how we look cosmesis.The musculoskeletal system consists of bones, cartilage,muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The bones supply a flexibleor jointed support structure, a framework that gives the systemrigidity and provides protection to internal organs. The bonesarticulate with each other at the joints.The articular surfaces (the ends of the bones) are protectedby cartilage, a material that is very resistant to wear and tear.The joints are lined with a layer of tissue, a synovial lining,that produces a lubricant. The lubricant is a very slipperysubstance called synovial fluid, that, like the articular cartilage,helps to limit the wear and tear on the joints.Joints are held together in close opposition by ligaments.Ligaments are composed of a very tough, sinuous material thatspans joints to prevent them from coming apart. It is theligaments that establish the range of motion for a specific joint.Locomotion, power, and strength are all supplied bymuscles. All motion is created by the contraction of a muscle.Because muscles can only pull, they are set up in opposingpairs so that we can move forwards and backwards, push andpull. A muscle is anchored to a bone at its \"origin\", but inorder for it to create motion or do work it needs to span ajoint.Before a muscle spans a joint it narrows down to a cord-like structure called a tendon. Tendons cross the joint andanchor to the bone on the other side at an insertion point.Because tendons are essentially cables that move back andforth as a muscle contracts and relaxes, they are enclosed in aprotective sheath, lined with a synovial lining to providelubrication. As a muscle contracts it shortens, pulling on thetendon that spans a joint and causing that bone to move, flex,or extend on the other side of the joint.The last structures to understand are bursae. Bursae aresacks, filled with synovial fluid, that are between the tendonsand the joints beneath them. Again, they prevent prematurewear and tear on the joint surfaces when the tendons slide backand forth across joints as the muscles contract and relax.Defmitions of terms used in describing injuries to themusculoskeletal system:Arthritis:Is an inflammatory response that occurs to thearticular surfaces of joints from wear and tear or from anunderlying disease state, causing localized pain and swelling tothe joint and possible destructive changes to the joint.Bursitis:Is an inflammation and swelling of the bursa sacfrom direct trauma, overuse, or infection, resulting in pain,tenderness, and swelling of the affected bursa.27 Dislocation: Occurs when the articular surfaces of a joint areforced out of proper alignment resulting in pain, tenderness,swelling, loss of movement, and deformity of the affectedjoint.Fracture: Occurs when a bone is broken, usually because ofdirect trauma, resulting in pain, tenderness, swelling, loss ofmovement, discoloration, and possibly deformity of theaffected bone.Sprain:Occurs when a joint is hyper-extended causingoverstretching and injury to the supporting ligaments of thatjoint.Results in pain, swelling, possibly discoloration, andloss of movement of the affected joint.Strain:Occurs when a muscle is overused or overextendedcausing microscopic tears in the body of the muscle resultingin pain, tenderness, swelling, and possibly discoloration in theaffected muscle.Tendonitis: Inflammation and swelling of a tendon caused byrepetitive overuse of a particular tendon, resulting in pain,tenderness, swelling, and crepitation (a squeaky sound andfeeling when the tendon is used) of the affected tendon.The injuries defined above have certain commonalities:they all can cause pain, tenderness, swelling, and decreasedrange of motion.In an effort to better understand how todifferentiate, diagnose, prevent, and treat these injuries, we candivide them into four groups. Each group has its own etiologyor cause, diagnosis criteria, and treatment modalities.1. Chronic or overuse ailments (\"itis\"es such as arthritis,bursitis, and tendonitis) are inflammatory conditions.2. Acute sprains and strains result from minor trauma.3. Acute dislocations result from more significant trauma.4. Fractures result from severe trauma.Over the next several issues of the newsletter we willaddress each of these conditions. In this newsletter we willbegin with the injuries that occur most commonly: sprains andstrains.SPRAINS & STRAINS Without a doubt, one of the most common injuries at work,at home, or at play is a sprained ankle. Because a sprainedankle is an injury that most of us have suffered at one time oranother, it makes a good example of how a joint becomesinjured.A sprain to a joint occurs when the joint is forced beyondits normal range of motion, causing the supportive structures(the ligaments) to be overstretched and partially or completelytorn. Any joint in the human body can suffer a sprain, but theankle is most common because it is constantly at risk. Asimple misstep going down stairs or stepping off a curb or asimple slip on a muddy trail can cause instant overextensionand ligament damage. 2BEST COPYAVAILABLEIkE KNEEmuscaCQuADRICEPS) FEMUR. SYNOVIAL-rwipSy4oVIAIMGA46FIANts LICIAMEwrART1Cui-AR._CAMLActS sprain occurs, the supporting ligaments of that jointhave been damaged. The result is either a partial tear in thefibers of the ligament or a complete tear through the ligament.The torn ligament bleeds and provokes an inflammatoryresponse, both of which contribute to swelling.The key to success in managing a sprain is to control theswelling; the less an injury swells the faster it will heal. Tocontrol swelling, you have to be able to control bleeding. Theinternal bleeding is controlled by RICE: rest, ice, compression,and elevation.REST: As soon as possible, you should make the personcomfortable sitting or lying to take the weight off the ankleand put it at rest.ICE: Cool the area down with a wet towel or t-shirt or anice pack.COMPRESSION: Wrap the ankle with an ace bandage toapply counter-pressure to the bleeding areas in the ligaments.ELEVATION: Elevate the affected footIankle above thelevel of the heart to reduce the pressure at the \"bleeders\".Sprained ligaments will tend to bleed for up to 72 hours.Therefore it is appropriate to RICE the wounded joint off andon for 72 hours. The mistake that is commonly made is toapply heat or to soak it in a warm bath; this causes dilation ofthe blood vessels, increasing bleeding and swelling in theaffected area. After 3 days, once the injury has stabilized, heatis then the treatment of choice to increase circulation for itshealing benefits.Strains, on the other hand, are injuries to the muscles,where the muscle has been overloaded or overused. The JULY/AUGUST 199628WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER treatment plan is the same; the less the area swells the fasterit will heal. The trick to understanding these injuries is realizing that thedifference between a sprain and a strain is usually academic,because you rarely suffer one without suffering the other.Typically we simply refer to the injury as a sprain or asprain/strain.Fortunately, we do not have to distinguishbetween the two because the treatment modality is the same.Along with RICE, gentle, passive range of motion exercisecan help, and taking any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAID) such as naprosyn, aspirin, ibuprofen, etc. may help to alleviate the pain and reduce the swelling. When usingNSAIDs make sure that the individual is not allergic to aspirin, is not asthmatic, and does not have a history of gastritis orulcers.The most important thing about sprains and strains is that the vast majority of them are preventable by using the properequipment for the sport, being in shape for the task at hand, and knowing your limits.An Ounce of Prevention:The best way to prevent ankle injuries while hiking is towear properly fitting hiking boots that support the anklewell.The best way to prevent knee injuries is to exerciseregularly to keep the leg muscles, especially the quadriceps, in shape.The best way to prevent back strain and brachial plexus injuries to the shoulder is to wear a properly fitting pack with a waist belt that is packed properly, keeping the majority of the weight low around your waist. Never carrymore than 90 pounds; that is the absolute upper limit ofweight that the human back can tolerate without putting it at great risk for injury. BACKCOUNTRY WATER DISINFECTIONby Rebecca S. Newton, WENIT-BWhen you want to rid your water of disease-causing organisms, your tried-and-true options are three:death by heat (boiling), death by chemical (halogenation), or exclusion by mechanical means (filtering). Whichever method you choose, it must be relatively user-friendly if it is to be usedconsistently and conscientiously. The ideal system is simple,lightweight, quick, and convenient; most of all, it is reliable, orall other factors become useless. While the need to disinfectwater comes primarily from the drive to have clean drinking water, only water of drinking quality should be used for cleaning wounds, brushing teeth, washing, and other such activities as well. 29In US forests and wild lands,Giardia lambliaandGiardia intestinalisare often the primary pests targeted for eliminationby water purification systems. Distributed worldwide, Giardiais a microscopic protozoan (5-21 microns in size), carried in itscyst form in mammal feces. In this form, it is quite hardy, and can survive two to three months in near-freezing water. Whenthe cyst is passed on to another mammal and enters its GI tract, the organism takes advantage of this warm internal environment to enter its active trophozoite phase. Here, it attaches to the wall of the small intestine, causing the intestinal distress common to this disease. Typical symptoms includerecurrent and persistent diarrhea, \"sulfur burps\", indigestion, and abdominal cramping.The incubation period is one tothree weeks, and diagnosis is difficult due to the wide variationin symptoms and the high incidence of asymptomatic infection. Humans are a major carrier ofGiardia,as are many species of wild and domestic animals. To help prevent the spread of this organism, do not dig your cathole or wash close to water sources, and maintain high standards for camp hygiene and water disinfection.HEAT/BOILINGThe most reliable means of water disinfection is, arguably, the simplest. While a five- to ten-minute boil will kill all life forms, a rolling boil is sufficient to disinfect water that is, to kill all disease-causing life forms. Increasing altitude does decrease the boiling point of water; at 19,000 feet,for example, water boils at 178\u00b0F. This, however, is not a consideration in disinfecting water, as a few minutes at 140\u00b0F will killGiardia,and a few minutes at 150\u00b0F will kill viruses and disease-producing bacteria. The fact then stands that by the time water has been brought to a rolling boil, it is safe todrink, even at altitudes up to at least 19,000 feet.Boiling requires little precision and uses resources that many backpackers are already carrying on their trips for cooking a heat source and a container. Extra fuel needs to be carried if a stove is the heat source of choice; extra wood needs to be found if a fire is the heat source used. A stove isrecommended to conserve scarce firewood and to avoid the unsightly scarring created by firepits. The primary drawback to heat as a source of disinfection is that it requires time and effort, calling for patience that hikers may not have at the time that they need more water. The equipment needed (stove, pot, and fuel) also adds a great deal of unnecessary weight to a pack if it is not serving a dualpurpose that is, if it is not already being carried for cooking.HALOGENATIONChemical disinfection systems, typically employing the halogens chlorine or iodine, are favored by many backpackers. These systems are lightweight, readily available, and relativelyinexpensive. Prepackaged tablets or crystals are easy to use, but several considerationsmust be taken into account whencalculating the amount of a given chemical needed to disinfect water. These considerations involve dosage the amount of chemical to be added andcontact time the amount of time 3 JULY/AUGUST 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER that must pass after the chemical is added before the water issafe to drink.Water temperature, pH levels, and organiccontent all influence the dosage and contact time needed fordisinfection. While temperature and pH level are difficult toinfluence in the field, it is always a good idea to reduce theamount of debris in your water before adding halogens. Abandana or a coffee filter will serve as a useful makeshiftfilter, or a commercial filter may be used. After a preliminaryfiltering, directions from the halogen system's manufacturershould be followed carefully and conservatively.Halogenation kills bacteria, protozoan cysts, and diarrhea-causing viruses. While most bacteria tend to be very sensitiveto halogenation, Giardia and viruses require longer contacttime or larger doses of the chemical. As a general rule,chemical dosage can be halved if contact time is doubled, andcold water requires a longer contact time than warm. Chlorineis particularly sensitive to pH levels, organic matter, andpollutants, and, as chlorine compounds tend to be unstable,chlorine is generally unreliable for wilderness travel. For thosewith thyroid disease or a known allergy to iodine, however,chlorine may be the only chemical option. Superchlorinationisreliable, but must be followed by dechlorination withhydrogen peroxide a caustic agent with which care must beused to make water acceptable to drink. Iodine is morereliable than chlorine, as it is less sensitive to pH levels andcontaminants, and it has a less unpleasant taste. Drink mixesmay be used to improve the taste of water after chemicaltreatment, but care must be taken not to add them until aftertreatment is completed, as they can bind with the halogen andinterfere with disinfection.Several distinct disadvantages to chemical treatment remain.Halogenation often requires even more patience in waiting forefforts to take effect than does boiling. The user must beconscientious to assure that the chemical contacts all the waterin the container even the threads around the mouth of thebottle, if appropriate. Even more serious is the problem thatthe bothersome Cryptosporidium is highly resistant to chemicaldisinfection.Contact time required to kill Cryptosporidiumwith a 1 ppm solution of chlorine is 160 hours far greaterthan the length of many backcountry trips! Reliable means ofeliminating this organism remain limited to boiling or filteringwith a device that has a pore size of less than one micron. FILTRATIONThe key to using a filter safely is knowing its capabilitiesandlimitations.Does yourfilterhavethenecessarycomponents to eliminate viruses and protozoa, or does itsimply rid your water of bacteria? While a filter that removesGiardia and bacteria may be all that is necessary for travel inthe US, a more complex system may be desirable for overseastravel. Some filters include an iodine resin that eliminates alldisease-causing organisms, while others do not even have poressmall enough to eliminate all bacteria.The greatest advantages to using a filter are that models areavailable that can kill all disease-producing organisms, and the30most up-to-date models tend to be reliable, compact, andlightweight.Afilterisconvenient;no pretreatmentpreparations are necessary, and water can often be drunkimmediately after pumping.Filtering eliminates the need towait for cooling after boiling or for the effects of halogenationto take place.As with every system, though, drawbacks to using filtersremain. The best filters may be quite expensive, while lessexpensive models may be heavy and bulky. Prices range fromroughly $30 to over $200.Replacement parts may cost asmuch as the original investment. Filters may need to becombined with chemicals in order to be fully effective againstdisease-causing organisms.Pumping water through a filtertakes time and physical effort, and the user must be cautiousnot tolet any untreated portion of the filter touch thecomponents that deliver the treated water. Finally, anymechanical system is fallible, and a filter may have a defect oracquire damage that goes undetected yet renders the systemunsafe.PREVENTION: HEALTII ANI) HYGIENE TIPSAs always, the best way to deal with infection fromcontaminated water sources and related illness is prevention.In the spirit of prevention, the following is a list of suggestionsthat can help keep your camping and travelling safe andhealthy:Always disinfect drinking water, no matter how clear andclean it appears*Wash hands frequentlywith soap and warm water,especially before cooking or eating* Do not share utensils or water bottles* Do not use chipped or rough bowls or utensils theyencourage bacterial growth*Rinse cooking gear well to remove soap residue that maycause diarrhea*Boil cooking utensils daily*Pour foods from bags whenever possible do not reach in*Rinse (with drinking-quality water) or peel fruits andvegetables before eating* When travelling abroad, keep in mind that if the watersource is questionable, the ice is tooWater treatment can feel like a nuisance whether it'sbecauseyou'reina hurrytoclimbthepeak beforethunderheads roll in or because you feel as if you're the onlycreature who's ever discovered the remote and pristine cornerof the planet in which you sit, picnicking beside a clear stream.Struggling to protect yourself from problems you can't see canfeelfutile.Butittakes only one infectionto ruin abackcountry trip, and to make the several weeks to severalmonths following your trip miserable. So find the method ofwater disinfection that fits your travel style best and befaithful to it.It will reward you in ways you'll be glad not toknow. 4 JULY/AUGUST 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER References and sources for further reading:Rick Bennett. \"Waterborne Diseases and DisinfectionTechniques\" (workshop #2 and #5) in notes from the Sixth Annual Winter Wilderness Medicine Conference, presented by the Wilderness Medical Society.

Are there any real differences between them?\" If you walk down the aislein any supermarketor drug store where the non-prescription (over-the-counter or OTC) pain medications are shelved, you will see a dizzying selectionto choose from. If you opena magazine or watch an hour oftelevision, it is hard to avoid advertisements expounding the virtues of popping a certain pain pill in preference to all others. If you read labels, though,you will discover that all thedifferent brands have one of five pain-relieving there isno consistent advantage of one over any of the others. If you had 100 people with headaches or soremuscles andfirstgave themaspirin,nexttime acetaminophen, then ibuprofen, and for the fifth occasion, naproxen, then asked them, \"Which one worked best?\"you would get as much agreement as the typical New Hampshire town meeting. The 100 people would be split into fairlyeven groups of five. And each group would be sure the other four groups were crazy or lying.There are differences between them, but the differencesare not in strength or effectiveness. They all work about thesame to bring fevers down. A few preparations add some caffeine or antihistamines that mayor may not help someone feel betterfor other reasons (keep awake or put to sleep). But the key differences are in their sideeffects on inflammation,blood clotting and side effects.If pain is accompanied bywarmth, swelling or redness (such as in arthritis or tendonitis), there are usually chemical reactions occurring thatcause inflammation. Aspirin, ibuprofen,ketoprofen,andnaproxenallreduceinflammation; acetaminophen does not have as much anti-inflammatory effect. Taking these medications on a regular schedule helps control inflammation betterthan taking them only when the pain is severe.31Aspirin, and to a lesser extent, ibuprofen and naproxen, interfere with the blood's clotting ability. This may be a positive effect to help prevent heart attacks or strokes; it could be life-threatening, though, if someone has a bleeding ulcer.Acetaminophen does not affect blood clotting. The most common side effect of aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen isto cause heartburn. These medicines can all cause ulcers in some people. They also run a risk of kidney damage in high doses in a few people. Acetaminophen does not irritate the stomach. It, however,can harm the liver if a person has liver disease or takes too high a dose repeatedly.All of these medicinescan interact with other medicines a person takes. It is best to review with your health provider what non-prescription medicines are safe to take with your prescription medicines. No medicine is without risk; consider other ways to relieve pain rest, a massage, an ice pack, meditation, a change of work pattern or lifestyle. Use thesemedicines, like all medicines,with respect, and don't be swayed by the enchantments of Madison Avenue. CONFERENCE UPDATE1996 National CollegiateEMS Foundation ConferenceHosted by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Ambulance 11-14, Troy, New YorkTo register call: Drew Leemon, NOLS at307-332-1256 Lewis Glenn, Outward Bound USA at Society1997 Winter Meetingon Update on WildernessMedicine TrainingStandardization, Accreditation, Risk Management these are the buzz words of the 90s when it comes to outdoor education and adventure programming. Integral to each of 5 JULY/AUGUST 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER these concepts is the training of staff, trip leaders, and guides,at every levelin the many different fields of expertisenecessary for employment.Somewhere, either disclosed in theinterview or hidden among the verbiage of a job description,is a reference to appropriate medical training. Ironically, inthis litigious society, medical training is the one area wherethere continues to be great ambiguity. Still today, the spirit ofthe industry is \"let the buyer beware.\" What does this thenmean to the consumer the expedition leader, the raft guide,the camp counselor and, ultimately, the injured patient? Itmeans you need to know what questions to ask....Given the environs where most outdoor education andadventure programs take place, the current trend is towardwilderness medical training, and rightly so. For years peopleall across the country have identified the fact that standard firstaid and safety programs like those designed by the AmericanRed Cross and the National Safety Council filled a veryspecific need in the urban environments, but when the attemptwas made to transfer them into the backcountry, they fell short.Increasingly over the past ten years the de facto standard usedby hiring organizations has been to either require or providetraining specifically in wilderness medicine to compensate forthe deficits of these urban medicine programs.So what is wilderness medicine and why the comment \"letthe buyer beware?\" First of all, keep in mind that prehospitalemergency medicine as we know it today is a fairly youngfield.Wilderness emergency medicine as a subspecialty ofprehospital emergency medicine has been evolving in thiscountry since the early 1970s. At its beginnings, the numberof schools offering these programs could be counted on onehand.Today, on the other hand, the number of individualswho, having taken a wilderness medicine course, feel they arenow qualified to offer their own certification program isincreasing.This becomes a problem for consumers in thatthey have no way of knowing if the wilderness medicalprogram in which they've enrolled is credible; if there is anykind of medical oversight and direction by a physician orboard of physicians; if there is an avenue for recertification; orif the certification will be recognized and accepted by theoutdoor organizations who are doing the hiring.Over the years, organizations in the United States such asSOLO, Wilderness Medical Associates,and WildernessMedicine Institute, have earned a reputation for high qualitytraining by offering the de facto industry standard programs,fighting the rec.ognitionfacceptance battles with the individualstatesandnationalorganizations,backinguptheircertifications, and demonstrating the staying power to stand bytheir credentials through thick or thin. When students walkaway from these programs with their certification cards, littlemore is later needed in the way of verification of the trainingthat they have received.Brought tolight by a group of concerned outdoororganization heads at the 1994 Wilderness Risk ManagersConference in Conway, Washington, therehas been atremendousproliferationofwildernessmedicine32certifications so many, in fact. that these organization headsdidn't know whose certifications to accept. Concerns revolvedaround whose courses included what curriculum componentsand where to look for verification of credibility and qualityassurance.As a response to these concerns, many of the providers ofwilderness medical training agreed that a movement towardstandardization was imperative and that its success dependedupon the leadership of the larger, more established wildernessmedicine schools.At the time there was perceived to be agreat crevasse separating the program efforts among whatmany dubbed \"the Big Three\" SOLO, WMA, and WMI.Collectively, for the good of the industry, the three agreed toput differences aside, to sit down with neutral representation(first thought to be an Outdoor Recreation Coalition ofAmerica (ORCA) representative, later decided tobe aWilderness Medical Society representative), and work to thatend.In February 1995, a working group called the NationalAssociation of Wilderness Medicine Educators (NAWME)gathered with the intention of establishing a not-for-profitprehospital body of educators. NAWME's primary goals wereto come to agreement on a minimum standard for theWildernessFirst Responder curriculumto work on anaccreditation process for wilderness medicine training agencies,and to look at the bigger issues of quality assurance, instructorcredentials, and recertification issues.By August 1995, the Wilderness Medical Society (anational membership organization of physicians and otherhealthcare professionals specializing in wilderness medicine)offered to be the leaders in the curriculum project in lieu ofNAWME. Their major concern was that training organizationssuch as SOLO, WMA, and WMI had such a vested economicinterest, that they were unable to represent the \"little voices.\"The counter-concernfromthe NAWME group and asignificant number of other \"younger\" providers was that theWilderness Medical Society would collect the curricula fromthese various organizations, synthesize them, and then offertheir own WMS-approved course the end result of which noorganization wanted to be a part. After receiving writtenassurance from the Wilderness Medical Society president inFebruary 1996 (which obviously does not bind the decisions offuture boards) that the WMS had no intention of offeringtraining programs or certification, NAWME was dissolved andthe task of standardizing a WFR curriculum was turned overto a subcommittee of WMS, the Prehospital EmergencyTraining Standards and Accreditation Committee (PETSAC).To date,the Wilderness First Responder curriculum,standardizationprocesscontinuesthroughPETSAC.Organizations from all over the United States and Canada areparticipating at various stages, but we're not there yet. By theend of the year,a solid draft should be complete anddiscussion will need to be turned to what part of the processwill ensue.Questions such as whether or not other trainingprograms should be tackled in the same fashion and how the 6 JULY/AUGUST 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER standardized curriculumwillbe monitored need tobeanswered.In the meantime, knowing that the efforts areunderway, there need to be some stop gap measures to assistindividuals in selecting a credible program. In order to helpthe \"buyer beware,\" the following is a list of some questions to ask before enrolling in a wilderness medical trainingprogram of any sort:1. Who currently recognizes your certification? (Call those organizations to verify.)2. Who oversees the medical curriculum? (There should be a physician or board of physicians versed in wildernessmedical protocols.)3. What kind of credentials do your instructors have? (Theyshould have a background in education, medicine, and theoutdoors and be certified at an appropriate level.)4. What other wilderness medical training agencies will recertify your certification?(Call those organizations toverify.)5. For how long is the certification valid? (Two to three years is standard longer is open to argument.)6.In what documents does the curriculum have its genesis?(ASTM and DOT tend to be considered adequate places tostart, whereas standard American Red Cross and NationalSafety Council first aid curricula are considered to be inadequate.)7. What kind of quality assurance program is there for new and veteran instructors?In the end, rest assured that there are \"legitimate\" sourcesof wilderness medical training available in the United States and Canada.Although anyone can put out a sign and print certificationcards,thewildernessmedicinetrainingorganizations that are willing to participate in efforts to benefit theoverall good of theindustry andtofurthertheunderstanding of wilderness medicine education will have thenecessary components to provide a lasting, recognized, andquality program.

NameAddressCity StateZip JULY/AUGUST 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER NA,WMN- FOR THE RECOGNITION, TREATMENT, AVDPREVENTION OF WILDERNESS EMERGENCIESSEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 1996 VOLUME the Piscataqua River,dividing coastal Maine and New Hampshire, empties into the Atlantic. The island is popular with sea kayakers, with many inlets and coves to explore. On July 23, 1994, four kayakers sought refuge against an approaching thunderstorm in an old World War II bunker on the island, thinking it would be safer than the open water. Usually, they would have been right. But not on July 23. And not in a bunker reinforced with highly- conductive steel.Others on the island during the storm reported seeing the bunker hit, but Chris Perry, one of the kayakers, doesn't remember any of that. \"All I remember,\" he said in a reportfrom the Associated Press, \"is capsizing the boat, then righting it. The next thing I remember is waking up Sunday night in the hospital.\"According to witnesses, all four were unconscious after the strike. Perry and 48-year-old John Freund required Cardio- pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Perry and two others werefortunate; Freund, the father of another of the paddlers, died in the hospital twelve hours later.* * *Shortly after midnight in July of 1982, Bob Walker* awoke to a huge clap of thunder. Although partly paralyzed after being struck, he realized he had other concerns: the group ofteenagers he was leading up Mount Moraine. He and co-leader Warren Archer set out to check the tents. In one tent theyfound an unconscious 15-year-old student, whom they were able to rouse. When they got to the tent of the third leader,Heather Barnes, there was trouble. Barnes was sharing a tent with two sisters; theyounger one, 13, was not breathing.Barnes began artificial respiration, but Walker could not finda pulse, and began CPR. Within a minute, Archer joined in to perform 2-person CPR. For ten minutes, the two worked while others obtained help at a nearby campsite. Paul Carson, aninstructor with a local guiding School, arrived and took over for Walker. Within seconds of the switch, the student gasped;a subsequent pulse check verified the return of the heartbeat, although very weak.Walker and another local guiding school instructor went down the mountain for assistance while more storms rolled in. Throughthelongnight,thepatientstruggledthrough convulsions andsemi-awareness, while the threat of more lightning caused the leadersto move the rest of the group tosafer ground a short way down the mountain. By 7:15, nearly six hours after being struck, the patient lapsed back into a coma. Pulse and breathing faded but remained present.Meanwhile, after their own epic to contact help, Walker and the instructor managed to contact the sheriffs department,which organized a rescueparty. A nearby naval air stationsent over a helicopter to try and pluck the patient off the mountain, but was thwarted by weather. Finally 10 1/2 hours after the strike, the patientwas evacuated by litter, and reachedthe hospital still comatose. She remained in a coma for three weeks before emerging rather suddenly. She appears to have recovered very well, and is back in school.Lightning has some amazing capacities, some of which we even understand. Still, when we are trying to avoid lightning, we are to a certain extent rolling dice, because lightning can do and has done whatever we least expect. So why even bother to do anything? Because, as with anything in science, though we cannot predicta particular outcome precisely, yearsof observation have demonstrated common patterns which, while not guaranteeing safety, can certainly put the odds in our favor. Before looking at how to avoid such a situation, and thedevastation it can wreak, itmay be helpful to understand thephysiology of the storm and the strike.35 +\"'\"A BOLT FROM THE BLUE\"The phenomena which causes lightning is exactly the sameas when you scuff your feet along the carpet on a cold, drywinter's day. By separating electrical charges, you are creatingan imbalance Nature wants to equalize; when the chargepotential is greater than the insulating capacity of the air (orresistance), the electricity will \"arc\" to the ground- you get ashock, and Nature has its balance.Of course,in anelectricalstorm,thechargesaresignificantly greater, so the bolt can arc over greater distances.Most often, such a storm occurs when a cooler, drier mass ofair replaces a warmer, more humid mass by burrowingunderneath and forcing the warm air upward, sometimes atgreat velocity. This rapidly rising air condenses into clouds(sometimes called \"cells\") whose tops may be over 40,000 feetabove sea level, well into the jet stream The summit ofEverest, by comparison, is 29,028 feet. This wind can push thetop of the cloud ahead, creating the classic anvil shape (seediagram).Meanwhile, static charges build as billions of collisionsoccur between ice crystals and water droplets; negative ionsare pulled from the ground, leaving the ground with a positivecharge, while the base of the cloud becomes mainly negative(the top of the cloud is also positively charged, enabling themost common lightning: within the cloud). When this potentialovercomes the air's resistance ZAP! you get a very longspark: lightning. Lightning chooses the route to the groundwith the least resistance, which is usually also the shortest.Usually. This is why mountain ridges and Empire StateBuildings are poor places to be in a thunderstorm. Moreover,in some cases, buildings and mountains reverse the charges andactually initiate their own flashes.A similar, though not usually as powerful, situation canoccur in areas where the ground heats up during the day,causing the updraft of heated air. These are called convectivestorms, and are usually not more than an hour each in duration,although several cells in succession can lengthen the durationfrom your ground perspective. Thus, it is critical to know theweather patterns in the area you are working. In the BlueRidge of Virginia, my crew was chased off the crest on nineof our twenty-five days in the field. In Minnesota, it was anoccasional problem, while in New Hampshire convectivestorms are not common.The most dangerous part of the storm is the leading edge,where the most potent charge has accumulated. Lightningusually arcs out in front of the storm, often for several miles.This little known fact is probably responsible for many deathsand injuries in people who saw the clouds and figured they hadplenty of time to get off the ridge, off the golf course, or outof the water. This could also be responsible, at least in part,for the phrase \"a bolt out of the blue.\"The actual bolt is a complex series of events, usuallystarting with a flow of negative charge (ions) traveling fromthe cloud toward the ground in a series of steps, called the\"stepped leader.\" These steps are fairly rapid, often in 50-yardsegments lasting one-millionth of a second, with an interval offifty-millionths between steps. The process takes about twenty-thousandths of a second. At this point, according to MartinUman in his book All About Lightning, the charge doesn'treally have any specific direction (i.e.. place that it wants tostrike), and not until it connects with a flow of positive ionsrushing from the ground, only tens of yards above it, is groundzero decided.Then, a huge flow of positive charge surgesback up this channel (at 20-60,000 miles per hour), creatingthe bright flash we see as well as most of the thunder. So ifsomeone asks you if lightning travels from the cloud to theground or the ground to the cloud, you may answer thememphatically \"yes.\"The charge in a single flash of lightning is enormous.Normal household current comes in at 220 volts, and mostappliances run at no more than 15 amps. In a fraction of asecond, lightning can deliver several hundred million volts(some estimates are even as high as 2 billion) at 200,000 to300,000 amps. As a result, lightning can unleash devastatingdamage, as well as create some pretty peculiar phenomena.Lightning can get to you in several ways. The most obviousis a direct strike, which only 20% survive; of those, three-quarters will have permanent neurological damage. Morecommon ways of being \"struck,\" and more survivable, are\"splash\" and \"step,\" the latter also called \"ground\" or \"ripple.\"Splash occurs when the main charge strikes a nearby object,say a tree or building, and splashes over to you, with thecharge dissipating over increasing distance. Similarly, stepcurrent also weakens over distance, but the big jolt has struckthe ground and traveled out on concentric rings, either throughthe soil, through root systems, or even through things such aswet pavement. The better the ground at conducting, the morepotent your charge at a given distance. There is also the \"blast\"effect,to be discussed later, caused by the same rapidexpansion of air (most scientists believe) which precipitatesthunder. 2 SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER36 LIGHTNING INJURIESSurprisingly, burns arenot the most severe problem indealing with a lightning-injured patient. Even the heart is only temporarily stopped in mostcases, as the electricity shocks itsimilar to a defibrillator. However, it does have an affinity for the most electrical organ inyour body: the brain. Furthermore,lightning can zero in with surgical precision to the respiratory center in the brainstem, and knock out the drive to breathe. Indeed, it is believed that the majority of cardiacarrest in lightning patients resultssecondarily from respiratory arrest. So the key in these patients isaggressive, longer-term CPR; since there is nothing structurallywrong with the heart, such as coronary artery disease, these are some of the most salvageable patients in cardiac arrest. However, since the respiratorycenter is affected, you may haveto continue artificialventilation (either pocket mask or BVM) for extended periods,even after the heart has resumed beating. At the hospital, patientswill be attached to a ventilator which performs automaticallyuntil respiration returns on itsown. This can take hoursor even days, and there iseven one report of a patient needing the ventilator for two monthsbefore respiration returnedon its own.The possibility of revivalof these patients by CPRalone, and the lack of life-threatening danger to those with pulsesand breathing, causes us toreverse our standard triage rules.Normally, in a mass casualty situation, we must writeoff pulseless patients toconcentrate resources on those who have a chance of survival (arrests from traumatic causes havea poor prognosis). The \"walkingwounded\" in a lightningscenario are probably not only goingto survive, they are potential resources to perform CPR and otherpatient care. Even though the normal backcountry protocolfor CPR is to stop if ithasn't worked within 30 minutes,exceptions are often made for lightning strike victims. Heart tissue is healthy ina lightning- injured patient not dyingbecause of diseasetherefore, we do CPR for as longas we can, since gettingoxygen to the heart can be enough to revive the patient. Thereare reports of lightningpatientsbeingsavedafterthirtyminutes of continuous CPR; however,according to Mary Ann Cooper and Christopher J. Andrews intheir chapter on Lightning from Wilderness Medicine (editedby Paul S. Auerbach),these are not well-documented.Much neurological dysfunction occurs over the longer term, and only perhaps 25percent of strike victimsescape without any neurological loss. At least half of patientsare knocked unconscious, some have partial paralysis, but mostrecover quickly, and permanentdamage will result inonly about a quarter. Some patients do suffer severe, permanent loss, but that must be assessed ina hospital, and should not affect your first aid care. As stated,most patients, except those in cardiac arrest, will survive withoutfurther intervention, allowing you to concentrate effort on pulseless or breathless victims.Burns do happen, butmost are the \"flashover effect.\" Sincelightning prefers the leastresistance, it often chooses to travelover the outside of an object. On ahot, humid day, your body is usually covered withan electrical conductor: sweat. It is mucheasier for the chargeto trave. around than through you. However, several hundred minim volts traveling through thiswater causes itto vaporize. expanding 10,000 times. The result often is that victims wiL have their clothes literallyblown off, leaving themstanding addled and naked, but otherwise unhurt. It is not recommended that we try thisas an experiment to see if it does, indeed, work.The way to get a seriousburn is to createa path for the charge to get to ground through your body, like leaning against a tree which is struck, or standing in a nice widestance with metal-spiked golf shoes rooted to the ground. Internal burnsof critical areas cranial,cardiac, pulmonarycarry high mortality.Most shotgun pellets. Both treatedas you would treatany burn. One other burn-type injurycommonly associated withlightning is now not considered to bea burn at all. Many patients would present with a \"fern-like\"or \"feathery\" pattern, which was hypothesized as being theburned imprint of nearbyvegetation or caused by the burning of fluid in the capillaries. It isnow believed to result from theflow of ions over theskin. It is apparently harmless, andno treatment is required.There are other, lesscommon injuries associated with lightning, which are treated normally, dependingon your assessment. Because of the blast effect, the victimcan be thrown violently forsome distance, resulting inany type of major or minor trauma. Thus, any patient struck by lightning(or any electricalcharge) even if heor she appears healthy needs to be evaluated in the hospital. Thepossibility of internal damage andlong-term consequencesmakes it vital that you performcomplete and thoroughprimary and secondary surveys (or initial and ongoingassessments for EMT's in thenew curriculum). Also, donot forget about hypothermia; wet and injured patients get coldvery quickly.PREVENTIONMany are the mythsassociated with lightning,and many, too, are the suggested remedies and ways to keep oneselffrom being struck. Umandiscusses the belief, whichpersisted into the 1700s, that the pealingof church bells either:scientifically, broke up the electricalchannel that lightningwould follow (wrong); or, commonly,warded off evil spirits.Such beliefs cost 103 bell ringers their lives over a 33-year period. Uman notes that Medieval churchbells are often inscribedFulgura \"I break the lightning.\"Our twentieth-centurywisdom allows us to admitthere is still much we donot know about lightning.But, there are things we do know, andsome places we definitely do not want to be. Still, as with anythingin medicine, it is mucheasier to prevent lightning injuries than to treat them. If youare in a37 3SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER situation where you are in lightning danger, the problem hasmost likely arisen in the planning stage.Most obviously, you do not want to be on a mountain peakor ridge during an electrical storm (or even if there is potentialfor one), no matter how beautiful you expect the sunset to be.Storms with such violent potential can build quickly, or movewith surprising speed. Odds are still that lightning will strikethe highest object, and, on a peak or ridge, you are it. The keyis to be off before the storm hits, or to have an alternate planif your route will take you over such geography in a storm.If you are in imminent lightning doom and trying to scurrydown the mountain, it has been suggested that going down thelee side, opposite from the approaching storm, may be safer,due to lightning's tendency to strike out in front. Abovetreeline, a boulder field is often not a good place to hunkerdown, as the rocks will probably be of fairly uniform heights,with none offering any particular protection. Gullies or ravines,while affording a lower venue, are where the rushing water isgoing to collect. The electrical current of a lightning strike hasa penchant for these natural water pathways. If you are in thatsame path...Being below treeline is often recommended as the place tobe, but it still is no guarantee against being struck. For thisreason, it is recommended that groups spread out with 30 to 40yards between individuals, so that if only one or two arestruck, there will be survivors left to do CPR. Also, if there aremultiple leaders, they should be at opposite ends of the groupso that there is a better chance that at least one will be able toassume control.Once in your (relatively) secure location, the classic\"lightning safety\" position is standing or squatting on a non-conductive pad (such as ensolite). The smaller you can scrunchyourself comfortably, with no extraneous limbs hanging over,makes it less likely for the charge to arc. This position, apartfrom being low to the ground, aids in separating you fromground current by not giving lightning a reason to arc upthrough your body and back to the ground. The pad doesn'treally insulate you from the charge; in order to protect from adirect strike, your insulation would have to be over a milethick!If you should happen to pass a pleasant looking cave onyour way down the mountain, keep on hiking. Although inspecific circumstances caves can be safe places to wait out astorm, the requirements for such are somewhat complex, andnot something you want to be figuring while Zeus is takingaim.Here is an often-asked lightning question, which soundslike it has come straight off the SAT's: You are at the exactcenter of a perfectly circular lake, in an aluminum canoe. Athunderstorm is coming at you from the west at thirty-fivemiles per hour. Where do you go? A) Into the storm. B)Away from the storm. C) Toward either lateral shore. D) Getout of the canoe and into the water, as you will no longer bethe tallest object around. or E) Find religion and use it quickly.There probably is no perfect answer to this query; however,\"A\" seems to make the most sense, as it puts you under thedangerous part of the storm the leading edge for theshortest time. \"B\" and \"C\" aren't terrible options (at leastcompared to the situation you are already in), but as to \"D;\"were I to be knocked unconscious, I would prefer to be in thecanoe rather than floating in the water. Some river guides haverelated that, in steeply-sided, narrow canyons, they feel it safestto continue down river, rather than get to shore, due to theirperception that lightning will strike at a sharp-enough angle soas to strike the walls and not the river. There may be somevalidity to this reasoning, although the author has not seen astudy done on this. It may also just be that the odds have notyet caught up with the rafters.A FINAL REITERATIONLightning is powerful and beautiful, terrible and deadly:consistently the most deadly natural disaster in the UnitedStates. As outdoor users, our best protection from lightning isnot to put .ourselves or our groups into locations and/orsituations where lightning has a good shot at us. Barring that,you may play your cards the best you can, but the dealer stillcontrols the odds. We go out into the wilds for many reasons,for the beauty, for the challenge. But when we deal with thestunning forces of Nature, discretion is certainly the better partof valor. If you choose to pit yourself against a lightningstorm, all two billion volts of it, you will lose.*Although this is an actual account, the names and places ofthose involved has been changed to protect their privacy.PRIMARY SOURCES AND FURTHER READINGAll About Lightning; Martin A.

Because thecontent is so germaine to the principles of wilderness medicine,we have reprinted this with the permission of Dr. Houston andthe ISMM.The comments that have been made about the tragedy on Everest last May are right on target. As the climbers straggled back to the South Col or died, I watched helplessly on my home computer as consultant on high altitudefor the McGillivray Freeman Company who were making an IMAX film on Everest at the time. It was bizarre, watching from thecomfort of home, as the disaster grew.I longed to shout advice: perhaps every major expedition should have a cyber- consultant who is unaffected by altitude!Pete Schoening, who had saved our lives as we struggled down after ten days of stormnear the summit of K2 in 1953, was with one of the Everest teams, and even though Pete is too experienced to have been caught, I did worry specifically for him.Also I thought back to 1938 on K2, when Pasang Kikuli (who had been with me on Nanda Devi in 1936) warned us that the weather was changing \"just like Nanga Parbat\" where he had been one of the few survivors. We turned back safely just below the summit, to climb again!Nine peoplediedhigh onEverestlast May and mountaineers can learn much from the tragedy - if we choose to do so.It was eerily reminiscent of the German disaster on Nanga Parbat in 1934 when three climbers and six Sherpas died during their disorganized retreat through storm.It was also much like the deaths on K2 in 1986, and yet again in 1995. All were major disasters, and all shared the same causes - four hostile factors - four H's - which impact humans at altitude.1. HYPDXIA impairs judgment, slows reflexes and dulls perception of reality. On Nanga Parbat in 1934 and on K2 in 1986 and 1995, experienced climbers died because of poor judgment and bad decisions. At those great heights, even using good oxygen equipment, a climber is still hypoxic because his inspiredoxygen is only that which aperson gets breathing air at 22-23,000 feet. Bear in mind that a climber who is relying on bottled oxygen is not as well acclimatized as one who is not. The climber may feel a bit better using supplemental oxygen and make better decisions perhaps, and is not as devastated by hypoxia. But he or she will be worse off when the oxygen supply runs out than is the individual who has been breathing air all along.The shock of losing supplementary oxygen is severe - like being taken in minutes from a comparatively 'safe' altitude to a very dangerous one. 52. HYPOTHERMIA dulls the mind much as hypoxia does, and even the best clothing will not fully protect against cold when a person is not active. A great deal of heat- and wateris lost when the huge volume of inhaled cold dry air is exhaled, draining body heat and water.Cold climbers are liable to make mistakes.3. HYPOGLYCEMIA (low blood sugar due to lack of food)causes similar mental impairment, in addition to weakness. The cold, hungry climber high on Everest is in serious danger.4. HYDRATION is very important because not enough water thickens the blood, making it move sluggishly through theblood vessels, thus further depriving the body of oxygen and nutritives like sugar.The brain and extremities are particularly vulnerable. Unless a person drinks at least a gallon of water a day, the totally dry air on high mountains rapidly causes dehydration.These four hazards are additive and cumulative, and, as you noted, caused most of the casualties on the expeditions I'vementioned, and doubtless have contributed to many others too.Nowadaysalesssubtledangerlurksinthe commercialization of climbs on very high peaks and may have worsened the 1996 Everest tragedy. Clients who invest a lot of money in an Everest summit attempt may press their professional guide to continue despite threatening weather and delays. The guide whose judgment is somewhat impaired at great altitude may yield to pressure, perhaps from those whose ambition exceeds their ability.An obvious problem results when many people start together up a narrow ridge: the whole train is slowed as successive climbers struggle with difficult pitches.This delayed many on Everest and they were caught by storm on the descent. The expert climber who was doing the IMAX film saw that this might happen and took his crew down instead of up.The drama of such tragedies catches public attention. Many other climbers have been caught in equally terriblecircumstances and survived. More often than not the selfless cohesion of their group has been the factor which enabled them to survive the odds against them. This was true on K2 in 1953 but not in 1986.As do many others, I believe that many of the people died on Everest in 1996 because they put ambition above prudence. Though threatened by storm, delays, and the inexperience of some, they pushed on. Some died, others made it down alone. There were many victims but there were a few heroes too.As indicated in his WMN Interview, Dr. Houston does welcome questions and comments.

The American Alpine Club is one of the firstoutdoor-related organizations to take a definitive stand on theissue.The membership of the American Alpine Club, young andold, has seen many changes take place in the sport of climbing.From clothing and tentage to ropes and protection devices,there have been countless developments as new synthetics,alloys, and methods of assembly have come along. Access toremote areas has increased as roads and air travel links haveincreased. Communications links have changed as well, goingfrom yodeling and flashing lights to two-way radios and nowcellular telephones.What has not changed in the AAC are our stated purposes,which include preservation of the mountain environment anddisseminationof knowledge regarding developmentsinmountaineering. From time to time, we have considered issuesthat may result in having an adverse effect on the mountainsand mountaineering, and then adopted Policy Statementsregarding them.The use of cellular telephones in themountains and even on climbs near the road head is one suchissue. Therefore, we offer the following on this newest formof communication:Whereas the Board of Directors of the American AlpineClub recognizes that there have been many technologicaldevelopments affecting clothing and equipment since the sportof climbing began, andWhereas the Board of Directors of the American AlpineClub recognizes that all such developments can have both apositive and negative effect on the sport of climbing,We, therefore, urge those entering into the mountainenvironments to consider the use of cellular telephone asfollows:1. The cellular telephone is not a substitute for skill andknowledge in the fundamentals of climbing, which include,but are not limited to, being able a) to find one's way(navigation), b) to prevent against being in situations thatcould readily result in life-threatening injuries, c) to treatinjuries, and d) to provide for one's own evacuation/rescuein the event of being unable to continue to climb due todifficulty, weather, illness, and/or injury.2. The cellular telephone is in and of itself not a safetydevice, nor does it guarantee the delivery of any perceivedor needed services in the mountains.403. The cellular telephone does not preclude the protocol ofletting appropriate people know where one is going andwhen one intends to return.4. Using a cellular telephone in the mountains and,inparticular, in the presence of others to call family andfriends, transact business, or resolve on-going conflicts maybe an infringement on the mountain experiences for whichmany of these others have come. These experiencesinclude quietness, a focus on the immediate environment,and a sense of personal space.5. Using a cellular telephone to ask for unnecessary services,which include but are not limited to a) asking directions, b)asking for additional clothing to be brought to the user, andc) asking to be rescued for a non-life-threatening ordisabling injury, is properly considered by those agencieswho might be called upon to render such assistance as anabuse ofthetechnology,both onapracticalandphilosophical level.6. A cellular telephone IS a communication device that mayaid in the saving of lives and limbs if used solely for thatpurpose in the mountain environment, after all the abovehave been taken into careful consideration.This policy was adopted by a unanimously passed motion at aduly constituted meeting of the American Alpine Club Boardof Directors on September 28, 1996. MOTION MISERYby Buck TiltonA plethora of \"home remedy\" recommendations havepassed down my throat including dill pickles and saltinecrackers, stewed tomatoes and saltine crackers, horseradishwith or without the crackers, and crackers all by themselves.They universally have had the same effect on \"yours truly\":none. Some experts have told me a stomach containing onlyliquids deals with motion easier than one full of solids. Othershave told me the opposite.If you've tried something and itworks, keep using it and read no more. If motion sicknessplagues you, perhaps one of these remedies will work.Focus your eyes, whenever possible, on a distant stationarypoint. Something on the horizon would be appropriate, suchas a mountain peak or a tall tree. A fixed point of referenceshould give your brain help in sorting through the mess ofmessages. If you can go below on board a ship, don't. Belowdecks you'll have no point of reference.Since motion is the culprit, attempt to avoid as much of itas possible. In a large boat, sit or stand near the center, keepyour head still and your eyes straight ahead. On an airplane,sit over the wings where the ride rocks the least.By lying down with your eyes closed, taking deep calmingbreaths and reducing the flow of messages to your brain, you 6 SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER might be able to put a stop to your ailment. But what a rotten way to spend a vacation.Chinese medicine claimsacupressure on the Nei-kuan pointwill control nausea. The magic spot lies on the inside of both wrists, between the two tendons you can feel on the thumb side of your arm, just below the bones of the wrist itself. Pressure can be applied here with one finger for at least a full minute each on both wrists, or you can wear Sea-Bands, a wrist-band available in many pharmacies for around ten dollars that presses constantly on the Nei-kuan point. Sea-Bands may be ordered, with precise directions, from Magellan's, a catalog for travelers, at (800) 962-4943.Two capsules of powdered ginger root (500 mg each) taken 20 to 30 minutes before motion prevent sickness for numerous sufferers, so they say. If you've got raw ginger root, grate one teaspoon, add it to four ounces of water and steep it for 10 minutes for the same result. Since a cup of ginger tea must be downed approximately every half hour in order to maintaina non-nauseous state, you might as well brew up a thermos-full.Antihistamines are medications that prevent motion sickness apparently by interrupting communications, the nerve impulses,between the vestibular system and the brain. Over-the-counter you can buy many antihistamines, but some have proven to be particularly effective formany people.A good bet is meclizine (Antivert, Bonine), a drug that should be taken onceevery 24 hours starting at least an hour before you expect to be rocked and rolled. Meclizine may cause mild to moderate drowsiness and a dry mouth. Cyclizine (Marezine) is another non-prescriptionantihistamine which works similarlyto meclizine but must be takenevery four to six hours starting at leastanhourbeforeyoushoveoffortakeoff. Dimenhydrinate tends to cause extreme drowsiness, but, in the plus column,it comes in liquid formsuitable for small children. Also over-the-counter in tablets and liquid, and also suitableforchildren,isdiphenhydramine(Benadryl). Available with a prescription only, promethazine (Phenergan, Mepergan) works to prevent and treat motion sickness, a bonus if you forgot to takea pill before you started feeling nauseous.Promethazine, too, causessevere drowsiness in some folks.People report successes and failures with these drugs, and the only sure-fireway to know if one of the antihistamines will work foryou is to try it.Transderm Scop (scopolamine), a patch placed behind the ear, was supposed to release small amounts of the drug over a period of three days right through your skin. When it was available, by prescription only, you could press the patch in place the night beforea trip and expect no motion sickness.Currently off the market due to the patch's failure to reliably release the medication, Transderm Scop is expected to be back in the arsenal of anti-seasickness medications by 1997.Call (800) 452-0051 formore information.BACK ISSUES AVAILABLEBack issues of the Wilderness Medicine Newsletter are available.

WMN- FOR THE RECOGNITION, TREATMENT, AND PREVENTION OF WILDERNESS 1996 ISSN-1059-6518 VOLUME Murray Hamlet, DVM; and Tilton, MSFROSTBITE:Frostbite is localized tissue damagecaused by thecold.Itcreates aspectrum of injuries depending onhowcoldthetissuebecomes.Ranging from little or no damage toextensive damage resulting in tissueloss, this spectrum of injuries can beclassified in three basic categories:frostnip, superficial frostbite, and deepfrostbite.The initial stage of injurycan be termed frostnip, and it's nota true frostbite injury. Skin is pale and numb, cold to touch but still soft and pliable.The first true frostbite is superficial frostbite.This occurs when the tissues are damaged by cold (ice crystal formation between cells and dehydration within cells) but without solid freezing of tissue.The signs and symptoms of superficialfrostbite are similar to frostnip: pale skin and numbness, both due to decreased circulation to the area. Even though the area is pale and numb, it is still soft and pliable to the touch it will dent when you pushon it. Treatment of Frostbite:Treatment of frostnip and superficial frostbite consists of skin- to-skin rewarming. The cold area should be in contact with warm skin.For example, a cold fingercan be cradled in a warm armpit, or cold feet placed against the warm belly ofyour backcountry partner. Do not massage cold tissue or placeit near a heat source, both of whichmay increase damage.Whensuperficialfrostbiteisrewarmed, a large fluid-filled blister,called a bleb, sometimes forms. If this occurs, do not pop the blister.Blebs filled with clear fluid do betterin the end than blebs filled with bloodfluid.But, no matter what fills the bleb, it is extremelyimportant to insulate the area well with dry material to prevent refreezing and evacuate the patient.If frostbite is not treated in the superficial state, it can progress to deep frostbite. Deep frostbite can be recognized because the affected area is frozen solid. This type of severe frostbite isextremely painful when rewarmed. Severely frostbitten feet, once rewarmed, typically prevent the patient from walking. Instead of rewarming, it is usually best to insulate the frozen tissue well to prevent any further freezing. It is imperative to evacuate the patient.In extreme situations, when possible,deep frostbite may be rewarmed in the field.Rewarming should be rapid without being damaging. The best method involves soaking the frozen tissue suspended in circulatingslightly-salty water pre-heated to 104-108 degrees Fahrenheit. Too much heat should be carefully avoided. Once rewarming is accomplished, the affected parts'should be gently dried, covered with an antimicrobial ointment, and kept elevated.Pain killing drugs would benefit the patient. Refreezing must be avoided. Evacuation of the patient with rewarmed frostbite should be given priority consideration.43 Prevention of Frostbite:As with hypothermia, frostbite is preventable. Unlike othermammals, humans are not covered with a warm fur coat.Instead, people have to make a conscious effort to carry anouter covering. The first rule in prevention of frostbite is tohave the proper clothing for the environment you're going intoand know how to use it.Ideal clothing will insulate well evenwhen wet. It should not be constrictive, especially in the feetwhere humans are the most susceptible to cold damage. Thereshould be extra clothing available if you do get wet.The second rule is to pay attention to your body. As soon asa cold or numb area is seen or felt, rewarm it to preventsuperficial frostbite from becoming severe deep frostbite.Stay well-hydrated, and eat often. CHILBLAIN:Chilblain results from a non-freezing cold exposure to thehands and feet, which usually produces swelling, an abnormalredness of the skin, and some discomfort. Lesions generallyoccur between the joints, rather than over them. The chronicform of chilblain is termed pernio with superficial necroticplaques about a half millimeter thick. Pernio is caused byrepeated exposures to above freezing temperatures, usuallyassociated with high humidity. This injury is produced byrecurring vasospasm and localized histamine release in thetissues which accounts for the subsequent compromise of bloodflow. Once warming begins vasodilation causes the area toappear swollen and red or purple, quite tender and warm to thetouch. Itching is usually a common initial symptom, which, asthe warming progresses, is replaced by pain and tenderness.Occasionally blisters with superficial ulcers will form.Chilblain is usually a self-limiting disease which has few long-term sequelae, although the pain from pernio injury can last alife-time.Chilblain cases are most common in cold, dampclimates such as England, although they do occur in the UnitedStates.Typically, women are affected more than men, withthe disease beginning before the age of 20 in most patients. Treatment of Chilblain:Treatment will vary based on the severity of the chilblain case.Supportive measures similar to the treatment of frostbite arerecommended.Protection from cold, gentle rewarming, anddressing with warm, soft, and dry materials will be of help. Insome cases non-steroidals may be effective early on. In others,reserpine (also used in Raynaud's Disease) may be used. Prevention of Chilblain:Here again, the best way to prevent chilblain is to dressappropriately for the conditions keep warm and dry. Wearclothing in layers so that pieces can be added or taken away asnecessary. Avoid clothes that constrict body movement. Eat44plenty of nutritious energy food and stay hydrated (\"Pee oftenand plentifully\"). SNOWBLINDNESS:If six to twelve hours after overexposure to the sun's ultravioletradiation (to which you're especially susceptible as it bouncesoff snow), your eyes feel painful, like they're \"full of sand,\"the corneas of the eye have been sunburned making themextremely sensitive to light. Because it hurts so much to openthose peepers, you are temporarily (not actually) blind. Treatment of Snowblindness:Cool, wet compresses may be applied as needed for pain. Asmall amount of antibiotic ointment may be used several timesa day for two to three days. To utilize the ointment, pull downthe bottom lid, apply a thin coating, blink a few times, andkeep still with eyes shut until the ointment melts. Alsoeffectiveinthetreatment of snowblindness isa thickapplication of artificial tears. Do not use steroids.Ifpossible, don't use the eyes for 24 hours and cover withpatches for the first 12 hours. Snowblindness almost alwaysresolves harmlessly in 24-48 hours. Prolonged discomfortwould be reason to come off the mountain and find aphysician. Prevention of Snowblindness:Problems can be prevented by wearing sunglasses that blockall, or almost all,ultraviolet light.On snow or water,sunglasses should fit well and have side-shields to blockreflected light.In mountaineering or other situations whereglasses are at risk of being blown off, always travel with aspare set.In an emergency situation, fashion a pair of glassesby cutting narrow horizontal slitsout of ensolite pad,cardboard, or other material and attach them with a piece ofparachute cord, string, or even a snare bootlace. RAYNAUD'S DISEASE:Although Raynaud's Disease is a relative of cold exposure, itis not usually considered to be one of the true cold injuries.Raynaud's is an abnormal peripheral constriction (primarily inthe hands, but also the feet) associated with emotional stress,vibration, or cold. It is often a symptom of more serious life-threatening autoimmune disease but can exist as an idiopathicsyndrome.Symptoms manifest themselves typically whenthere is a drop in temperatures, even if that drop is from 70 -50 degrees Fahrenheit temperature extremes are not arequisite.Those who do suffer from Raynaud's may findthemselves completely disabled when it comes to participatingin outdoor activities during periods of cold weather.The disease is marked by intermittent bilateral episodes ofischemia in the fingers and toes. The patient will typicallyhave the following symptoms: episodic constrictions of bloodvessels, color change, numbness, and paraesthesia in the 2 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER .affected areas. The rewanning phase is often associated with tingling and pulsating pain. In Raynaud's patients, symptoms may escalate with advancing age. Treatment of Raynaud's Disease:Treatment of Raynaud's is definitely not simple, although not participating in activities that produce vasoconstriction is an excellent first step. Avoiding cold climate activities also helps; however, people will be people. When inthese coldenvironments, keeping the torso warm is key. By maintaining a higher core body temperature and keeping the skin warm, the likelihood of a peripheral response is decreased.The use of insulated hand- and footwear isparticularly important. Thick woolen gloves covered by insulated mittens are helpful.Chemical heat pads can be effective for short periods, especially in bootsor skates.Syrnpatholytic agents and calcium channel blockers have been the most effective pharmacologic therapy and appear to give positive results in about 50% of affected patients. Nifedipine, diltiazem, prazosin, and reserpine have also been somewhat effective but have side effects that make them less desirable.Home Remedy for Raynaud'sA Pavlovian-type conditioning procedure that has proved effective in the management of Raynaud's disease and that can be performed easily at home has been developed.This procedure involves the repeated dipping of the hands in hot water at the same time the torso is being exposed to cold. The steps are as follows:Fill two containers large enough to accommodate both hands with hot tap water (about 108\u00b0F*). Place one in a cold area, either a cold room, basement, or outdoors; place the other in a warm room.Dress lightly, as you would for indoors. In a warm room,immerse both hands in the 108\u00b0F water for 2 to 5 minutes.Wrap the hands in a towel and go to the cold area. Againplace the hands in the container of 108\u00b0F water for 10 minutes.Come back indoors and again put both hands in the 108\u00b0F water for 2 to 5 minutes.Repeat this procedure 3 to 6 times daily every other day for a total of about 50 trials.*Please note: Domestic hotwater may be 120 \u00b0F as it leavesthe tap this is too hot.Significant improvement insymptoms, peripheral blood flow,and the healing of digital ulcers after this procedure has been used have been noted. Theprocess underlying this sequenceinvolves disconnecting the central constrictor message from the local one, thereby causing the peripheral vessels to dilate ratherthan to constrict in response to torso cooling.Although this procedure is time-consuming, it has been shown to produce results that can last for a number of years.Also, remissions can be induced with only a few repetitions of the immersion process.Prevention of Raynaud's Episodes:If you have a known Raynaud's episode, there are some simple measures you can take to help prevent complications. Wear heavy gloves (or more preferably mittens) and avoid situations that could put you at risk of being stranded in the cold, such as backcountry ski touring.In the cold weather months you should have added protection in your carin case you are delayed or stranded while traveling and must remain in your car for a longer-than-planned-for period. Similarly, when on the trail you should have quick heat and shelter options available.Avoiding smoking is also critical, as tobacco is known to exacerbate the disease.Editor's note: The authors have printed more in-depth versions of these topics in othersources.

Newton, WEMT-B \"Do we really need seventeen kinds of catfood?\", laughs David Kuhns. A physician's assistant who has provided medical care in parts of Asia, Africa, and North America, Kuhns remembers his first visit to an Americansupermarket following his recentreturn from Somalia. \"When I came back from Somalia, the first place I stoppedwas the supermarket.I just stood there and stared....I was so overwhelmed by the variety.\"He laughs quietly as he tells thestory, but the issues behind thequestions he has come to ask himself are quite serious. Kuhns's work abroad has redefined his perspective on the medical care that he practices in the US, and has also shaped his view on broader aspects of American culture and resources.Still, Kuhns's groundings in the emergency medical field undoubtedly rest in his wealth of experience in both rural and urban regions of the United States. Kuhns has been involved in emergency medicine since its new beginnings during \"the early days,\" the reformations of the field in the 1970s. Asa high school student in the early 1970s, he enrolled in one of the first courses of whatwas to be the precursor to today'sEMT training programs.After school, he found himself workinginthe Air Force, and continued his work in emergency medicine as an Air Force medic during the next five years. When he got out of the service in 1977, he began his training to becomea PA. This decision to return to schoolKuhns attributes in part to the work he had observed other PAs performing; he explains, \"I'd worked with PAs all the way and thought that would be the best route for me to follow.\"453 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Kuhns's PA training and one subsequent year were spent in St.Louis, Missouri, focusing on emergency medicine, including anaffiliation with the city hospital emergency department. \"Withthe next step,\" Kuhns explains, \"I was looking for a change.And I found it.\"This change brought him to northern NewEngland, first to the Maine coast and to a small island calledIsleboro. Serving a year-round population of five hundred thatswelled to nearly three thousand during the summer months,Kuhns's task was to provide medical care for the island'sresidents by himself.Working alone was hardly the only challenge that Kuhns facedduring his Isleboro days. \"The connection to the mainland wasby ferry,\" Kuhns recalls. \"That was about a three mile trip asthe seagull flies. On a good day, it would take several hoursto get somebody across.\" Looking for a change from urbanmidwestem America, Kuhns certainly had found it. In theyears that followed, Kuhns directed his energies towardmainland New England, becoming involved with the OutwardBound school, Wilderness Medical Associates, and Portland'sMaine Medical Center. Now, he has been working with MaineMed for nearly twelve years.In reaching beyond the boundaries of the United States duringthe past few years, Kuhns has discovered still more directionsin which to explore his life's work. In 1994, Kuhns took aleave of absence from his job at Maine Med to travel toSomalia with Doctors Without Borders. He returned from histrip to Somalia in March of 1995, and just eight monthslater left again with Doctors Without Borders, this time for asix-month stint in Afghanistan through May of 1996.His time abroad has brought him new reflections on hiswork and on the medical field as a whole in the UnitedStates. \"I've come to appreciate that here in the US we focusmore and more on putting a lot of time and energy into cuttingminutes off of response time, trying to fine-tune medicationsand their response, looking for the ideal drug to serve this orthat particular function.\"Kuhns believes that this focus oncontinual attempts to speed and to polish the system is theprimary factor that sets the healthcare attitudes of the US apartfrom those of other nations.As Kuhns interprets his observations, the US approachesmedical technology \"at a whole different angle from whathappens in the rest of the world.\" And how does much of therest of the world approach its own medical needs? \"[Theeffortsare]verylow-tech,verypractical,very much.public-health driven a kind of a utilitarian approach of thegreatest good for the greatest number.\" With his depth andbreadth of international and emergency medical experience,Kuhns has reason to be sensitive to the variety of opportunityin the US and to have an unusual perspective on the strengthsas well as the shortcomings of healthcare systems in thecultures with which he has worked.Ultimately, Kuhns's greatest frustration in his internationalwork is the same that feeds the roots of so many fears: thatthe impact he can make, in the end, may be minimal. Kuhns 46tells the story of the hospital and series of ten clinics aroundwhich his work in Somalia was based. While he was there,fighting broke out in the town. Just after he and the otherinhabitants were evacuated, his compound was destroyed andthe hospital gutted. \"Everything that we had done during oursix months there everything that I thought of as beingtangible was suddenly erased. And this town of 200,000 isnow evacuated, empty. And has land mines placed all throughit again.\" Driven by experiences like these, Kuhns is currentlyworking diligently on the world campaign to ban land mines.To this end, he has given presentations on the issue at anumber of national conferences and has testified before the USSenate Foreign Relations Committee.Although the frustrations in his work seem great and theimpact sometimes minimal, the rewards are very real. Toanyone considering undertaking medical work abroad to gainexperiences such as the ones he has had, Kuhns implores, \"Ifthe opportunity arises, by all means go for it. It can andmost likely will change your life.\" The best advice that hecan offer for those who choose to do so is to \"try to keep youreyes open and your mouth closed and your ears open.\"Kuhns explains how his perspective has been widened by hiswillingness to listen rather than to try to provide easy andimmediate solutions: \"I think many of us may have a tendencyto go into situations like these and think, 'We're the pros fromDover and we can tell you how we do things.' That's all welland good when you're sitting back here [in the States] in aseven hundred million dollar hospital. But when you'reworking in a bush clinic holding a handful of different drugs,and none of them are probably going to do the right thing, it'sa whole different approach.\"With this comment, Kuhns's words invoke what is perhaps themost important principle of wilderness medical care: resourcesare useless without the ability to make intelligent and creativeuse of them. He insists upon and upholds respect for thepeople who are native to the regions in which he works. \"Thelocal staff although they may not have the same expertise oftechnology or educational background that we have still hasthe wealth of experience that comes from having worked inthose situations before and from being able to put things intocontext.\"The adjustment to new contexts, in fact, is what Kuhns citesas one of the most difficult aspects of the transitions that hehas had to make in his international work. \"You lose all ofyour reference points.Just imagine:you walk into a twohundred bed hospital that doesn't have windowpanes, and thathas holes in the roof from shrapnel and bullet holes from thefighting that has been going on around it. And then you walkaround the hospital compound and find used needles andsyringes and Foley catheters and goats and chickens. And youwalk through all of that, out of a mine field, into the operatingroom....In a sentiment common to many who link their passion formedicine to a love of wilderness medicine, Kuhns notes thatwhat he treasures most about his work in wilderness medicine 4 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER is that it can sometimes restore to him this sense of contextthat is so easily lost, can allow him \"to get away fromeverything and to kind of ground myself which seems tobecome more and more difficult these days.\" Of hisinternational work, Kuhns explains that the part that he valuesmost is \"meeting the people and getting to know them.Finding out that they may have a different language, may havea different religion, may dress differently and eat differentfoods, but that there are still human qualities that are common.Not to be appalled at the differences but to look at the positiveside and to experience that has been the best thing that I'vebeen able to take away from my work.\"Asked what he views as his greatest personal contribution towilderness and international medicine, Kuhns pauses. \"Thecontributionsareverysmall-scale,\"he modestly butrealistically emphasizes again before being more specificabout his own experience. \"What I've been able to do mosteffectively has been to bring the images back to share withpeople back here just a sampling of what the experience hasbeen, to make them more appreciative of what we do have, toget them to thinking about our society. We are all humans.We all share a common thread and a common link. Whetherthat link be from Conway to Portland or from Portland toBangladesh wherever it might be there are connections.And we need to remember those.\"WMN readers who wish to contact David Kuhns with furtherquestions may write him at the following address: 172 MiddleRoad, Cumberland Center, Alpine Meadows skiarea were trying to assess the daily avalanche hazard, amassive slide let loose, burying roads and buildings. Onewoman, amazingly, was pulled alive from a building five daysafter the slide. Seven others, however, were not so fortunate.On March 24, 1996, two Massachusetts men were apparentlyadjustingtheir equipment inthe middle of a commonavalanche path in the Gulf of Slides, on New Hampshire'sMount Washington, when a skier above set off a huge slabavalanche. The men were carried 500 feet downhill at perhaps100 miles per hour, but it was more than six hours before thebodies were found in the tons of debris. Melted snow aroundtheir faces reveals that they did not die immediately from theirinjuries.Although the United States and Canada suffer only a fractionof the avalanche deaths which occur in Europe, the peopleresponsible for prevention the forecasters and rescuers arestill concerned about the loss of life, and have been workingfor the past several years to update the warning system. TheCanadian Avalanche Association (CAA) and the AmericanAssociation of Avalanche Professionals (AAAP) have recentlyrevisedandissuedtheforecastingsystem,and manyorganizations who forecast for public or private avalanche-prone lands (like the Forest Service and Park Service in theUnited States, and ski areas in both countries) are using italready. In addition to accuracy for the agencies, the additionof a color-coding system should make it easily recognizable tobackcountry users.The new system is very similar to the former, with the majordifference being the addition of a fifth category. According toChris Joosen, Snow Ranger for the White Mountain NationalForest, the extra category allows forecasters to be morespecific without getting too burdened with superfluous details.\"The system in Europe,\" says Joosen, \"is too specific; it cantend to confuse. We wanted distinctive divisions betweenlevels.\"The United States Avalanche Danger Scale (see accompanyingchart) rates the avalanche probability by the following dangerlevels: Low (represented by Green), Moderate (Yellow),Moderate to High (Orange) [Note In Canada this is called\"Considerable], High (Red), and Extreme (Red with Blackborder).While Joosen emphasizes this is not a requireddestination system, it is hoped that all posted avalanche areaswill adopt it.Joosen also adds that, although the revised system allows formore consistency for avalanche-prone ski and backcountryareas,the forecasters best indications are their intimateknowledge of a particular area. Similarly, users of potentialavalanche areas need to realize that these postings especiallyin unpatrolled areas may cover large geographical areas, andare not updated daily, so climbers and skiers need to factor intheir own common sense before entering dangerous areas.Joosen says that, despite postings, people need to be preparedto find and rescue avalanche victims on scene, and not goimmediately for help, according to The ABC of AvalancheSafety by E.R. LaChapelle, 50 percent of buried victims willdie within the first one-half hour, and only 20 percent willsurvive two hours. LaChapelle points out that only one-thirdof completely buried victims survive, and half of those are lessthan 1 1/2 feet under.Everyone entering an avalanche area, says Joosen, should carryan avalanche shovel and a transceiver, the latter worn close tothe body (not in a pocket), so it will not get ripped away whentons of snow traveling at 100 miles per hour slams into them.Still, Joosen believes the new system will make it easier forforecasters to giveskiers and mountaineers an accuraterepresentation of the danger, so they will make the prudentdecision, and not have to face that deadly white wall.Editor'snote: For more information on safe travelinavalanche-prone areas, pick up a copy of The Basic Essentialsof Avalanche Safety by Buck Tilton, published by ICS Books. 47 5 NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1996 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER UNITED STATES AVALANCHE DANGER SCALE (1996)AVALANCHE SAFETY BASICSAvalanches don't happen by accident and most humaninvolvement is a matter of choice, not chance. Most avalancheaccidents are caused by slab avalanches which are triggered bythe victim or a member of the victim's party. However, yavalanche may cause injury or death and even small slides maybe dangerous. Hence, always practice sage route finding skills,be aware of changing conditions, and carry avalanche rescuegear.Learn and apply avalanche terrain analysis and snow'stability evaluation techniques to help minimize your risk.Remember that avalanche danger rating levels are only generalguidelines. Distinctions between geographic areas, elevations,slope aspect, and slope angle are approximate and transitionzones between dangers exist.
