He is also the founder and chief curator of ButterWorld ( [butterworld.org](http://butterworld.org)), a traveling exhibition showcasing unique, rare and historical dairy artifacts from around the world. His interest in dairy history grew out of his family's fifth-generation ghee business (started by his great-great-grandfather in 1889) and the culturally significant role that dairy plays within his Indian heritage. Sandeep is a graduate of David Winston's Center for Herbal Studies' two-year herbalist training program and one-year graduate program. He has spoken at Ayurvedic conferences in the USA and India. Sandeep is passionate about cooking traditional Indian foods using lots of fresh herbs and dry spices. Hilary Andrews, ND New Speaker Hilary Andrews, ND, was born at the base of the Canadian Rockies into a family committed to nature and environmental conservation. My parents raised me with a love of the earth and of animals and it is to that end that I became a naturopathic physician. I graduated from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine - now called National University of Natural Medicine - with academic honors and was voted valedictorian by my fellow graduating class. My profound interest in optimizing childhood health and nutrition led me to examine the topic of immunizations. In 2004, I began exploring this topic in-depth and soon it became a passion of mine. I combined the scientific data regarding vaccines, the science of the body and my strong foundational knowledge of health from my naturopathic education to create an optimal approach to infectious disease. Since 2006 I have lectured extensively on the topic of immunizations and have created several CE courses on the subject. Most recently I began the most passionate job of my life-that of mommy. My naturopathic husband and I are the proud parents of an energetic, spirited son. His life has strengthened my determination to help doctors understand vaccines and learn safer ways to vaccinate. To that end they can then help parents create the happiest, healthiest babies on the planet. I hope that my passion for natural health is purely and that I serve as an inspiration.

Elaine Boland New Speaker Elaine Boland, owner of Fields of Athenry Farm, is a mother of five daughters who began her journey of providing nutrient dense meats and products in 2003. A farm was always a lifelong dream of Elaine's, but if you told her she would be providing food for the public across the country, as part of that dream, she would have laughed! When one of Elaine's daughters began having health issues with Cushing's disease, the farm took on a life of its own. The healing process put her family and farm on a journey about the relationship between the foods we eat and chronic diseases. She developed a delicious, nutrient dense bone broth that included organ meats as a way to help her daughter's organ function. As her family's health improved, the farm business grew. She went from a source of healthy foods for family and friends, to a thriving farm store and home delivery business. Most importantly, she became a resource for people looking for both knowledge and ways to feed themselves in a healthy, holistic way. Today, Elaine continues to sell her fresh, weekly butchered meats from her farm store and is shipping her nutrient dense broths across the country with the demand higher than ever.

Thomas Levy, MD, JD New Speaker Dr. Thomas Levy is a board-certified cardiologist and a bar-certified attorney. After practicing adult cardiology for 15 years, he began to research the enormous toxicity associated with much dental work, as well as the pronounced ability of properly-administered vitamin C to neutralize this toxicity. He has now written eleven books, with several addressing the wide-ranging properties of vitamin C in neutralizing all toxins and resolving most infections, as well as its vital role in the effective treatment of heart disease and cancer. Others address the important roles of dental toxicity and nutrition in disease and health. Recently inducted into the Orthomolecular Medicine Hall of Fame, Dr. Levy continues to research the impact of the orthomolecular application of vitamin C and antioxidants in general on chronic degenerative diseases. His ongoing research involves documenting that all diseases are different forms and degrees of focal scurvy, arising from increased oxidative stress, especially intracellularly, and that they all benefit from protocols that optimize the antioxidant levels in the body. His latest book examines what is perhaps the most important and yet most unrecognized reason for disease-inducing toxins: Hidden Epidemic: Silent Oral Infections Cause Most Heart Attacks and Breast Cancers. Levy has also assembled the documentation showing that the regular iron \"fortification\" of so many foods has pushed the vast majority of adults around the world into a state of increased body-wide oxidative stress secondary to iron toxicity. As a consultant to the Riordan Clinic, Dr. Levy has assembled with Dr. Ron Hunninghake multiple protocols built around optimizing vitamin C administration and assimilation into the body, along with other antioxidants and agents such as ozone, in order to bolster the immune system and facilitate recovery from a wide array of infections and chronic diseases. Currently, research is being conducted on effective ways to reverse the genetic defect preventing humans from manufacturing their own vitamin C from glucose in the liver.

Matt Rales New Speaker Matt is a livestock grazier based in Northern Virginia whose focus is on ecosystem services to the greater watershed. He grew up on a horse farm in Maryland where he spent his days exploring the forests, creeks and pastures. From an early age he found himself enamored with the natural world around him. He spent many summers fishing and camping in Canada's Northwest Territories, 100 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Here he deeply connected with the vast, treeless landscape and the relationship between reindeer and muskoxen and the grey wolves that pursued them. This was one of the formative experiences that seeded his obsession with biomimicry. During his years at Middlebury College in Vermont he was influenced by the great nature writers Aldo Leopold, Gary Snyder and Paul Shepard. Their essays and poems on past and present ecological degradation helped crystalize for Matt the need to facilitate ecological literacy in our modern culture. He spent the next decade immersed in the art and science of grazing management and land regeneration. He worked and studied alongside the most innovative farmers and ranchers managing for ecosystem health. The most formative experience during this learning journey was his time in southern Africa where he learned from leaders and herdsman at the Africa Centre for Holistic Management in Zimbabwe as well as his time spent immersed in remnant wildlife populations in Botswana's Okavango Delta, Kalahari Game Reserve and Nxai Pan National Park. He now grazes cattle on 2,000 acres in Northern Virginia where he is intimately studying soil carbon, perennial grasses and microbial life while producing nutrient-dense grass-fed beef. Matt's life mission is to work toward an agriculture that truly mimics nature. Bruce Rind, MD New Talk Dr. Bruce Rind has been practicing medicine for 41 years, and practicing integrative medicine for 36 of those years (even before the term integrative medicine existed. At that time it was called alternative, complementary or holistic medicine). Dr. Rind started out as an anesthesiologist, went on to pain management where he found the need to learn acupuncture and osteopathic medicine. From there he discovered unconventional approaches such as nutritional approaches to health. He kept learning new approaches and stuck with what resonated best with his skills and understanding. He kept taking on new skills every few years which included orthopedic medicine, an integrative approach to endocrinology, integrative approach to neurology and reversal of stroke and brain injury, thermography, Lyme treatment and developed a rapid way to clear mold or fungus from the body. In integrating various skills, Rind found new ways to support breast health such as combining osteopathic diagnostic and treatment skills with thermography and nutrition.
