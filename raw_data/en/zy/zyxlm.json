He received a veterinary and master's degrees from Cairo University and a Ph.D. from the School of Medicine University of Maryland At Baltimore (UMAB). Currently, he is a professor of microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His group's research involves developing new technologies and innovative vaccines against human tuberculosis, bovine tuberculosis and paratuberculosis. Recently, his group started to utilize nanotechnology to develop effective nanovaccines against avian influenza and coronaviruses (infectious bronchitis virus and Human SARS-CoV-2).
