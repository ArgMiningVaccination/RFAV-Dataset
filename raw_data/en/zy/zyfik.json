Acupuncture can complement our other treatment methods to provide natural pain relief and other valuable benefits. That's why we're excited to offer this form of care at True Life Chiropractic. An Ancient Form of Natural Pain Treatment Acupuncture goes back thousands of years. According to the ancient healing art of Traditional Chinese Medicine believe that life energy, or Qi, flows through channels in the body called meridians to maintain good health and proper function. Qi flow disruptions can produce a wide range of problems, from chronic pain to disease -- but the flow can be restored to normal through the insertion of fine needles at specific points on the body. Western medical science appears to support the indisputable effectiveness of acupuncture. Many acupuncture points correspond to nerve clusters that regulate signals, including pain signals, throughout the body. Studies also suggest that the needles stimulate chemical changes that increase the body's levels of endorphins, natural painkilling substances. This makes acupuncture a powerful complement to chiropractic care. Our chiropractor in Anchorage AK, Dr. Michaud, can prescribe acupuncture alongside spinal adjustments and other forms of conservative care. This not adds to your neck pain relief, back pain relief and relief of other symptoms, but it also supports our efforts to normalize your nerve function for optimal whole-body health and wellness. How Our Anchorage Acupuncturist Can Help You Our Anchorage acupuncturist will first determine the nature of your ailment and the underlying cause of your symptoms to see whether acupuncture can help. We will also make certain you're a good candidate for the procedure. (Certain circumstances such as blood-clotting disorders or pregnancy may steer us toward a different treatment modality.) Your first session of acupuncture in Anchorage may take an hour or more simply because we need to perform all these necessary initial evaluations; subsequent sessions may take much less time, depending on the complaint being treated. We find acupuncture useful for conditions such as: - Back pain relief - Neck pain relief - Sciatica and extremity pain relief - TMJ relief - Reduction of headache and migraine severity - Digestive disorder treatment - Allergy control - Anxiety and depression treatment - Lowering of high blood pressure - Constipation relief - Insomnia, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia management - Immune system and general wellness support Acupuncture needles don't cause any significant sensation or discomfort because they're so thin (about the width of a human hair). In fact, you may find your acupuncture session highly soothing and relaxing as your troublesome symptoms begin to fade. Several sessions may be needed to convey the full benefits of acupuncture in Anchorage. Need an Acupuncturist in Anchorage AK?
