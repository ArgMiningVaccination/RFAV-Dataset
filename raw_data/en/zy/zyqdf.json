In order to fight off infection or generate good protection against a disease following vaccination your immune system needs to be functioning optimally. Whenever you are schedule to receive any vaccine the following suggestions may assist you in making it more effective and minimising the possibility of side effects and adverse effects. - The following [supplements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7884658/)can help support your immune system and can be taken in the weeks leading up to and following the vaccine as well as for general health support. Consult your local practitioner for specific nutrients and doses that you may require. Recommended daily intake (RDI) levels may not be sufficient for boosting or supporting your immunity during vaccination - Vit C, Zinc, Vit D3, Probiotics - Acupuncture and Chinese herbs in the weeks before and after vaccination can ensure your health is at its best. - See you local practitioner to determine the best herbs for you - An acupuncture treatment the day or so after the vaccine can also be extremely beneficial. - Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs can also be of assistance should you have any adverse reaction to any vaccinations. - Homeopathics (such as Thuja) can be taken on the day of vaccination and daily for 2 weeks after if you prefer this style of medication - Ensure that you are healthy and have been for at least 30 days prior to vaccination (you should not have had a course of antibiotics in the last 30 days nor should you be just recovering from an illness) - Giving paracetamol to prevent fever after vaccinations may lessen the effectiveness of the immunisation, according to a [Lancet study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61208-3/fulltext). Although it reduces fever, the study found it also interferes with the body's immune response. \"Antibody responses to several vaccines were significantly lower in the group given paracetamol,\" says study author Dr Roman Prymula. Ideally avoid paracetamol for the week before and after vaccination. - Any adverse reactions should be reported to your doctor and the [Adverse Medicine Events (AME) Line](https://www.nps.org.au/adverse-medicine-events-line)(1300 134 237).
