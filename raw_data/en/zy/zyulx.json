The 50 volunteers from around the world, including three in Chicago, would participate in a clinical study in an effort to dispel what they see as a major roadblock to developing a protective vaccine against AIDS: that no human being would risk his or her life to participate in a clinical trial involving a live but weakened strain of the virus that causes the disease. Next week, leaders of the advocacy group spearheading the effort, the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care, will sit down for the first time to talk with officials from the National Institutes of Health about their idea. The physicians' group plans to unveil a more definitive research proposal in November at an international HIV/AIDS conference the group is hosting in Washington. Despite its dangers, the group wants to conduct a trial using a live vaccine because it has shown the most impressive protection against disease so far--and they don't think the AIDS epidemic affords time to wait for researchers to find ways to mimic the protective qualities in a safer vaccine. Because HIV is so deadly, there is fear that even a weakened live strain might be capable of causing AIDS or some other problem. For that reason, federal AIDS research efforts are focusing on vaccines that do not involve a live virus. A therapeutic vaccine currently being tested in HIV-infected humans includes a killed form of the virus. Also, results are mixed in research on live AIDS vaccines using monkeys, with one study resulting in serious illness in test monkeys. Licensed vaccines to date typically take two forms: live or killed. Measles, mumps and chicken pox vaccines, for example, are made of live viruses. Vaccines for whooping cough or tetanus, which are made of killed viruses, require \"booster\" shots to provide protection throughout a person's life. But many researchers are frustrated with the slow progress of AIDS vaccine development because of the safety measures and rigorous animal testing needed before injecting humans with a trial vaccine. Ideally, the Chicago group wants the approval of the Food and Drug Administration to proceed with a study. The federal sanction would help the group in many ways--from finding a vaccine manufacturer to participate, to locating a research center willing to oversee the trial. The Cambridge, Mass., manufacturer that owns the commercial rights to develop the vaccine the group is interested in using will not go forward without federal approval. Still, the group vows to proceed without federal approval, said the study's leader, Dr. Charles Farthing, medical director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. \"I would hope the physician ground swell (of support) is such that the FDA approval is not so slow,\" Farthing said. \"Nobody has really pushed them that this is an important thing to do.\" The physicians' group could proceed with their trial without the approval of the FDA by containing their study to a single state or conducting the trial in Europe. If necessary, it will seek out other versions of a live vaccine to use. \"We are going to do the study somehow. We are determined to see this through,\" said Farthing, who will be one of the study participants. The study volunteers argue that a virus as lethal and unstoppable as AIDS requires measures beyond traditional science. The risk of not exploring the safety and efficacy of a live, weakened--or attenuated--vaccine is to delay salvation for millions of people worldwide, they say. Gordon Nary is executive director of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care. The 63-year-old Chicagoan is one of the study volunteers. \"Vaccine development has really dragged on because there is an assumption by conservative scientists that people won't step up and do this,\" Nary said. \"I'm not . . . suicidal,\" Nary said. \"But globally, what you are looking at right now is 8,000 new cases a day of HIV infections, and of that, there are 1,000 HIV-infected babies born daily. If there is a risk of HIV infection (during the vaccine trials)--which I don't think is significant--it's overwhelmingly outbalanced by the fact that there isn't anyone who has worked with these babies who isn't going to do it.\" \"It's a bit premature\" to talk about injecting healthy people with a live vaccine, said Dr. Mark Grabowsky of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who invited the group to talk with him and other scientists next week at the National Institutes of Health offices in Rockville, Md. \"I admire them. That kind of activism can't help but be inspiring,\" Grabowsky said. \"But the scientific questions still remain.\" More than 2,100 healthy, uninfected people have participated in clinical HIV vaccine trials in the U.S. None of those trials has involved a live vaccine. Over the last 10 years, the government has conducted more than 43 different studies of 21 different HIV trial vaccines. The most promising candidate is being tested in more than 400 people at 14 sites in the U.S., Grabowsky said. These vaccines involve a variety of components, including killed HIV strains or genetically engineered strings of amino acids that mimic some molecular structures found on or in HIV. But live HIV vaccines pose significantly higher health risks. Because HIV is a virus that inserts itself into a person's own genetic material, it is difficult to measure the effects of live, weakened HIV. Farthing and other supporters of the study base their reasoning on two factors. First, they point to the results of accidental human trials, such as one in Australia, where six people were mistakenly infected with a weakened strain of HIV through an HIV-positive blood donor. Ten to 14 years after infection, the infected recipients were still asymptomatic. Also, they look to the success of Dr. Ronald Desrosiers, a researcher at Harvard Medical School's New England Primate Research Center, in developing a vaccine that protects monkeys from the primate equivalent of HIV, called simian immunodeficiency virus. The group would like to use Desrosiers' vaccine in their clinical trial. Desrosiers' vaccine uses a virus in which four genetic elements are deleted from the strain to weaken it but still prompt an immune response. In one study, four monkeys injected with one version of the SIV vaccine and then exposed to SIV remained healthy. But other combinations of the vaccine have prompted apparent diseases in test monkeys, Desrosiers said. The goal in developing an effective vaccine is the tradeoff between the immune response generated by a less-weakened virus and the safety resulting from a virus weakened more substantially. Desrosiers says that fixation on developing a vaccine that is 100 percent safe--something he says is unattainable--has prevented testing in humans. But Desrosiers has long envisioned his vaccine being used in high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users or young people having unprotected sexual activity. \"What are the risk benefits of people protected versus those infected with the disease? It boils down to a risk-benefit analysis,\" said Desrosiers, who has \"not yet\" agreed to participate as a subject in a human trial using his live vaccine. Research conducted by another Harvard Medical School professor, Dr. Ruth Ruprecht, who is also at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, shows 90 percent of the monkeys injected with a live SIV vaccine at birth are showing early stages of disease and half have full-blown AIDS. \"As a physician, the most important thing is do no harm,\" Ruprecht said. \"This type of virus causes harm. It causes AIDS. This is not the type of vaccine I would consider safe.\" If nothing else, the group's high-profile effort is raising awareness for the need for more vaccine research. \"The government has shown it does listen and can be influenced by outside pressure and interest and demand,\" said Peggy Johnston, the scientific director for the New York-based International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Among the study volunteers--39 of the 50 people willing to participate in the study are physicians--is Lincoln Park family physician Andrew Pavlatos. \"Physicians, as health care providers, need to follow in the footsteps of Louis Pasteur and others, and do their own treatments and put themselves at some risk for the betterment of everybody. It's about the Hippocratic oath and the higher aspirations you have as a physician in terms of serving other people,\" said Pavlatos, who sees mostly HIV-infected patients in his practice. The 38-year-old has no wife or children. \"I haven't discussed this with any of my friends; it was a very personal decision,\" Pavlatos said. \"I didn't want people thinking I was getting on a high horse and playing martyr. Despite all the advances that have happened in HIV care . . . developing vaccines should be the center of all research.\" Additional material published Sept. 25, 1997:Corrections and clarifications.Gordon Nary and Joe Zuniga were misidentified in a caption for a photo that appeared Sunday with a story about an AIDS vaccine.
