Here at NEIM, we join medicines from Eastern and Western traditions, providing Naturopathic Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Botanical Medicine, Nutrition, and Pharmacology. With the capabilities of modern science, NEIM also provides a variety of laboratory services. Naturopathic Medicine Holistic medicine, treating the body, mind, and spirit Utilizing safe, but effective therapies to restore health and to prevent disease Naturopathic Doctors are trained in both Eastern and Western medicines. They can diagnose and treat disease, can order lab tests, and if needed, prescribe certain medications. Principles of Naturopathic Medicine The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic doctors act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The Naturopathic Doctor seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic doctors follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; and Acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic doctors educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic doctors treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic doctors encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention: Naturopathic doctors emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a form of Eastern Medicine and originated in ancient China thousands of years ago. This type of medicine involves using diet, herbs, acupuncture, and cupping to help prevent and treat disease. It is based on the concept of Yin and Yang and how imbalances between these cause illness and lead to disease. Our doctors uses TCM and Acupuncture to help bring the body back into balance to help treat and prevent disease. Many conditions can benefit from TCM and acupuncture, such as: Pain (acute and chronic) Sleep disorders (e.g. insomnia) Digestive disorders (e.g. constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel disease/syndrome) Fatigue Menstrual disorders or irregularities Sexual dysfunction Migraines and other headaches Weight loss Addiction Colds/flu We are now offering an Acupuncture Happy Hour, every last Monday of the month* from 5:30 PM-6:30 PM.

It is based on two main concepts, \"like cures like\" and \"law of minimum dose.\" Homeopathic remedies are prescribed based on signs and symptoms and given in a very small dose. It was discovered that the smaller the dose, the more potent it is. Remedies are made from substances like plants, minerals, and animals, and then go through hundreds and hundreds of dilutions. They are given to help guide and stimulate the Vis Medicatrix Naturae. They are most commonly given as a sugar pellet to be dissolved under the tongue. Remedies are very easy to take and safe enough for children and in pregnancy. Homeopathy can help with chronic and acute illnesses, including grief and trauma. Botanical Medicine Botanical Medicine is the Western term for medicinal herbs. It is used in the East and West and is where pharmaceuticals originated. Many plants found on Earth contain ingredients that are very healing to the body and mind. Botanical Medicine can help with cuts and bruises, but can also help with digestion, pain, mood, energy, sleep, and much more. This can be a much safer and more effective way of treatment when compared to pharmaceuticals. Commonly given in a dried form in capsules or liquid form in a tincture. Our doctors often create a custom tincture for our patients to address specific needs. Nutrition Hippocrates once said, \"Let thy food be thy medicine.\" Food is medicine and what you eat is important for restoring health and preventing disease. Improving the diet can help prevent the need for medications and can increase quality of life. Since each person is different, one diet may not be appropriate for everyone. Our doctors take the time to make recommendations for a diet that is right for you. If you are looking for a diet to help with weight loss, our doctors can create a plan for you, but also do an evaluation to see if there is anything going on that would hinder weight loss. If the body is not healthy and not working optimally, metabolism slows down and the body has a hard time letting go of excess weight. When the body is healthy and it is getting proper nutrition, it will be at a normal body weight. Cleansing and Detoxification is a common practice in Naturopathic Medicine. Using certain foods and if needed, supplements, it is possible to stimulate the body's own ability to detox and to remove toxins that have accumulated over the years. It is also a great way to identify any food allergies or sensitivities. Food allergies are becoming more common and should not be ignored. Eating a food that the body is reacting to leads to an increase in inflammation, which can be damaging to the body. Food allergies have been correlated with digestive symptoms, joints pains, headaches, skin rashes, fatigue, and even behavioral disorders such as ADHD/ADD. Our doctors can help with identifying your food allergens and sensitivities either through an elimination diet or specialty testing, or both. Physical Exam Routine physical exams (including female & male exams) Traditional Chinese Medicine Tongue & Pulse examination Exams needed to help the doctor understand a person's symptoms Examples: listening to the heart and lungs, looking in the ears, nose, and throat, palpating the abdomen, checking reflexes or signs of the nervous system, etc. Pharmaceuticals including compounding pharmacy Naturopathic Doctors can prescribe certain medications, such as hormones, antibiotics, and medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. This also allows Naturopathic Doctors to take patients off medications. The goal of treatment is to restore health and minimize the need for medication. Often as the body becomes healthier, medications can be weaned off and only be used for emergency purposes. Pharmaceuticals are used only if necessary and is typically not the only form of treatment. Lab Testing Routine blood tests Food and environmental allergy testing Comprehensive stool testing Nutrient testing Special testing to evaluate different types of toxicities (e.g. heavy metals and mold toxins) Salivary hormone testing (e.g. adrenal hormones and sex hormones) Genetic testing (e.g. mTHFR) Small Intestinal Bowel Overgrowth (SIBO) testing And much more. Craniosacral therapy CranioSacral Therapy (CST): The Healing Power of Gentle Touch. CranioSacral Therapy is a light-touch, whole body treatment that works with the body's CranioSacral system that supports and nourishes the central nervous system - improving overall health and well-being. It helps to alleviate aches & pains and improves coping mechanisms to allow for better management of stress. CST calms the mind and restores its connection with the body. It is profoundly relaxing and restorative. CST is great for sensitive patients who do not respond well to manual therapy and even acupuncture. Mayan Uterine Massage Mayan uterine massage is a traditional Mayan healing technique that primarily addresses female reproductive concerns. The technique involves the use of massage and gentle physical alignment of the uterus, which can support female pelvic health. Mayan uterine massage can also be incorporated into Naturopathic Medicine by using other treatment options such as Botanical Medicine, Acupuncture, and Homeopathy.

GEMSTONE THERAPY Gemstone Therapy is an energetic therapy that can be used to restore overall health and wellbeing. Simply, it is based on the theory that all matter, including the various tissues of the human body, is composed of atoms possessing different types of vibration or frequencies. This results in numerous subtle energies found throughout life. It is also believed that unhealthy or diseased tissue tends to function at different frequencies. Therefore, gemstones can be used to transmit energy or manipulate sub-optimal frequencies of unhealthy tissue and restore it back to homeostasis. Each gemstone posses different frequencies and can be used for different health conditions such as fatigue, headache, depression or anxiety, digestive issues, and so much more. In Naturopathic Medicine, Gemstone Therapy is a useful adjunctive treatment that can promote physical, emotional, and spiritual well being. Your doctor will discuss with you whether this therapy will add benefit to your treatment. "}
