Since then I have added other modalities, such as neuro-muscular massage therapy, positional release, and foot reflexology, and I continue to search for more ways to help those who come to me. When I am unable to help improve a condition satisfactorily, I am usually able to assist my clients in finding the help they need. I have been blessed to be able to work as long as I have, and to have had the benefit of many teachers, and especially of my clients, from whom I have learned so much. Now it is my special privilege and pleasure to see my clients in the office of my long-time colleague and friend, Dr. Julia Wray. Clients may schedule online or by calling Sandy at 571-594-6745 Aaron Stiner, Homeopath 4-Year Practitioner Advanced Diploma, School of Homeopathy Aaron Stiner, Homeopath, is now seeing patients in-person at Cornerstone Chiropractic.
