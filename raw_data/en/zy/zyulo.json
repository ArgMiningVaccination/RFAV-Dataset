[Science & Tech](/Science-Tech) cowpox, also called vaccinia, uncommon mildly eruptive [disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/disease) of [animals](https://www.britannica.com/animal/animal), first observed in [cows](https://www.britannica.com/animal/cow) and occurring particularly in [cats](https://www.britannica.com/animal/cat), that when [transmitted](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/transmitted) to otherwise healthy [humans](https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-being) produces immunity to [smallpox](https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox). The cowpox virus is closely related to variola, the causative virus of [smallpox](https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox). The word vaccinia is sometimes used interchangeably with cowpox to refer to the human form of the disease, sometimes to refer to the causative virus, and sometimes to refer only to the artificially induced human form of cowpox. Cowpox disease, which is evident in cows from [ulcers](https://www.britannica.com/science/ulcer) on the teats, had been known as a disease of cows for hundreds of years; human cowpox occurred as a self-contained localized [ulcer](https://www.britannica.com/science/ulcer) on the hands or at other sites where scratches or abrasions allowed entry of the virus. The preventive effect of vaccination, or intentional inoculation with the vaccinia virus, was demonstrated by English surgeon [Edward Jenner](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Jenner) in 1796, following the observation that milkmaids who had been infected by cowpox during milking subsequently were immune to smallpox. His [smallpox vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox-vaccine) spread rapidly to America and the rest of [Europe](https://www.britannica.com/place/Europe) and soon was carried around the world. During the 1980s researchers discovered that [rodents](https://www.britannica.com/animal/rodent) were also a natural reservoir for the virus, and that rodents, not [cattle](https://www.britannica.com/animal/cattle-livestock), were responsible for most cowpox infections in humans.

This difference may be a result of documented contamination of earlier vaccine [cultures](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultures) with variola virus, creating a hybrid that still confers immunity to smallpox infection. Vaccinia, by the strictest definition, does not occur in nature but enters the body during vaccination; though this usually produces a self-limiting local ulcer like cowpox infection, it can cause a systemic smallpoxlike disease in patients whose immunity is compromised, and it has\u2014though rarely\u2014been found to cause [encephalitis](https://www.britannica.com/science/encephalitis). With the disappearance of human smallpox by 1980, these risks have caused the discontinuation of routine vaccination on a population-wide basis.
