The Physicians Committee is expanding its New Approach Methodology (NAM) Use for Regulatory Application (NURA) program, which trains scientists on nonanimal test methods now required by the EPA (see page 18) Ending EPA Animal Testing Neal Barnard, MD, Marilu Henner, and Chad Sandusky, PhD Sept. 10, 2019, signing ceremony with administrator of the EPA Andrew Wheeler, director of the PETA International Science Consortium Ltd. Amy Clippinger, Physicians Committee vice president of research policy Kristie Sullivan, and Physicians Committee toxicologist Esther HaugabrooksThe EPA publicly recognized the Physicians Committee's role in its plan to replace animal testing. 5 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 6Weight Loss Physicians Committee reviews published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition and the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention showed that even without counting calories, plant-based diets lead to weight loss by increasing post- meal metabolism, as well as by their naturally reduced caloric density Crohn's Disease A case study co-authored by Drs Kahleova and Barnard in the journal Nutrients followed a man whose Crohn's disease did not reach remission after more than a year of treatment During his second year of treatment, he removed all animal products from his diet and experienced a total absence of symptoms He has maintained the diet and is in complete remission Rheumatoid Arthritis A plant-based diet may alleviate painful symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis, according to a Physicians Committee review published in Frontiers in Nutrition Possible mechanisms for pain relief include reduced inflammation, joint swelling, and BMI and improved gut bacteria Gut Bacteria and Hormones Dr Kahleova also published research showing the benefits of a plant- based diet for gut health and hormones A review in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition found that fiber and other nutrients associated with plant-based diets increase the growth of beneficial gut bacteria that reduce inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk A study in Nutrients compared the effect of a veggie burger with a beef cheeseburger on hormone levels in men The veggie burger increased beneficial gastrointestinal hormones that regulate blood sugar, satiety (feeling full longer), and weight The Physicians Committee's clinical research department, led by Hana Kahleova, MD, PhD, conducted and published research showing the benefits of a plant-based diet for conditions ranging from heart health to hormones In addition to educating physicians and building the scientific literature, this research attracts widespread media attention, influencing the public to improve their health by moving animals off their plates These are some of the Physicians Committee's influential research papers published in 2019 Heart Health Researchers from the Physicians Committee and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes published a review in the journal Nutrients that compared various diets and found that a plant-based dietary pattern improves body weight, cholesterol, and blood pressure and reduces the risk for heart disease A review published in Advances in Nutrition found that people who consume the most legumes can reduce their heart disease risk by as much as 10 percent when compared to those who consume less WHAT'S NEXT? You are making it possible for the Physicians Committee to continue conducting clinical trials on health conditions including the impact of a plant-based diet on dietary cholesterol and heart health Proving the Power of a Plant-Based Diet Physicians Committee Plant-Based Research Hana Kahleova, MD, PhD 7 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 8In 2016, the Physicians Committee successfully eliminated all animal use in the teaching curricula at all medical schools in the United States and Canada We are now tackling animal use in residencies and advanced medical training, with continuing success In 2019, Physicians Committee members played a crucial role in encouraging eight more medical training programs\u2014where physicians used live animals to practice surgical techniques\u2014to switch to the human-relevant simulators used by the vast majority of programs The victories kicked off in February with Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center ending animal use for teaching emergency medicine\u2014just two months after the Physicians Committee filed a federal complaint Hennepin Healthcare followed the same month A month later, a demonstration led by Physicians Committee member Bandana Chawla, MD, prompted Baylor College of Medicine to switch to simulators In June\u2014following a decade-long campaign that included federal complaints, petitions, billboards, and demonstrations\u2014Baystate Medical Center announced that it ended animal use in its Advanced Trauma Life Support program, as well as in its emergency medicine program North Dakota State University and Sanford Health's joint trauma training program is now the last in the United States and Canada known to use animals In July, following a Physicians Committee complaint, Mayo Clinic Rochester announced: \"Emergency medicine training at Mayo Clinic ... no longer requires the use of pigs \" Maine Medical Center and Dartmouth College also stopped using animals in emergency medicine programs following pressure from the Physicians Committee 2019 also began with the Physicians Committee filing a complaint against Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School for using live pigs in its emergency medicine program Residents are instructed to cut into live pigs, including making incisions in the animal's throat to insert a breathing tube At the end of each training session, the animals are killed After seeing news coverage of the complaint, Rhode Island Rep Joseph J Solomon Jr introduced a bill to prohibit the use of live animals in medical education Rhode Island-born actress Mena Suvari penned a letter in support of the bill In April, Al Puerini, MD, and Katherine Williams, MD, joined a Physicians Committee demonstration outside Rhode Island Hospital, where Brown residents practice the emergency medicine procedures Replacing Animal Use in Medical Education The Boston Globe took note in an editorial calling on Brown to switch to simulators: \"The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which promotes alternatives to animal use in training, has been persuasively making the case that equally good or better alternatives are available.\" The Physicians Committee's Ryan Merkley, Al Puerini, MD, Katherine Williams, MD, Rep. Joseph Solomon Jr., Kerry Foley, MD, Erin Griffith, MD, and Robert Vergnani, MD Bandana Chawla, MD 9 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 10Hundreds of health care professionals and celebrities\u2014including Tracey and Jon Stewart, Hilaria and Alec Baldwin, and Suzy Amis and James Cameron\u2014joined the Physicians Committee's Let's Beat Breast Cancer initiative to help women reduce their risk for breast cancer Launched in October with breast cancer surgeon Kristi Funk, MD, the campaign focuses on four simple, science-backed strategies to help reduce breast cancer risk: eat a plant-based diet, exercise regularly, avoid alcohol, and maintain a healthy weight Dr Funk has helped thousands of women through breast cancer treatment, including celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Sheryl Crow More than 12,500 visitors to LetsBeatBreastCancer org have already signed a pledge to follow the four lifestyle guidelines Those who take the pledge are provided with information and tips for lifestyle enhancements as well as healthful recipes to reduce cancer risk \"Dairy cheese contains reproductive hormones that may increase breast cancer mortality risk \" That's the warning label the Physicians Committee is petitioning the Food and Drug Administration to require cheese manufacturers to prominently display on all dairy cheese products The petition, submitted in October during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, cites several studies linking consumption of cheese and other high- fat dairy products to increased risk of breast cancer A 2017 study funded by the National Cancer Institute compared the diets of women diagnosed with breast cancer to those without breast cancer and found that those who consumed the most American, cheddar, and cream cheeses had a 53 percent increased risk for breast cancer The authors say that components in dairy such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and other growth hormones may be among the reasons for the increased risk for cancer Beating Breast Cancer \"It's scary. Eating cheese is associated with not only a higher risk of getting breast cancer but of dying from it. I wouldn't eat (dairy) cheese,\" Physicians Committee member Deborah Wilson, MD WHAT'S NEXT? Since the fight against breast cancer doesn't end on Oct 31, your support is making it possible for the Physicians Committee to communicate year-round with pledges and health care providers about risk reduction And your support is allowing us to raise awareness and reach millions with information for preventing so many other diseases that are linked to lifestyle factors Kristi Funk, MD Lee Crosby, RD 11 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 12Since 1991, Wayne State University in Detroit, Mich , has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on heart failure and hypertension experiments in which dogs are subjected to painful procedures and killed The experiments have not advanced human medicine or provided cardiologists with new ways of treating heart disease The Physicians Committee is supporting HB 5090, legislation introduced in 2019 by Rep Sara Cambensy in Michigan, that would prohibit public institutions like Wayne State from spending taxpayer dollars to conduct painful experiments on dogs Every year, billions of dollars are funneled into research for Alzheimer's disease, yet there are no treatments that can stop or slow the progression of the disease The Physicians Committee hosted a Capitol Hill briefing in March in cooperation with Rep Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore ) to highlight the need for the National Institutes of Health to transition from animal experiments to human-relevant methods for Alzheimer's research In July, Ann Lam, PhD, medical research program director for the Physicians Committee, established a working group with stakeholders from academia, health care, and advocacy organizations to address dementia-related health disparities Many researchers continue to attempt to study Alzheimer's disease using animals However, animal models do not fully reflect human biology, and this is particularly problematic given human diversity For example, African Americans are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's when compared to non- Hispanic whites, and Latinos are 1 5 times more likely to develop the disease Human-based preclinical approaches such as genetic, epidemiological, and cell culture methods that address biases can provide greater insights for the prevention and treatment of dementia for diverse communities WHAT'S NEXT? Your generosity makes it possible for the Physicians Committee to work with local physician members to encourage the Michigan Legislature to pass the bill in 2020 Queenie's Story: Queenie, a young Dalmatian mix, arrived at Wayne State from an animal shelter on Sept 16, 2009 Experimenters implanted devices into her heart and blood vessels to induce hypertension and forced her to run on a treadmill while recovering from surgery Queenie's veterinary records show the pain and distress she went through On June 22, 2010, experimenters accidentally cracked one of the devices implanted in her body The device broke again on June 27, and laboratory personnel killed Queenie the following day Outlawing Dog Experiments Improving Alzheimer's Research In January and February 2019, analytic research firm Lincoln Park Strategies conducted a poll of 1,000 registered Michigan voters. Wayne State University was not mentioned by name during the poll. Rep.

Ask Your Local Hospital To Go #FastFoodFree!\" read Physicians Committee billboards near a hospital in Macon, Ga That's exactly what the hospital did In May, it announced, \"The McDonald's restaurant in The Medical Center, Navicent Health will be closing \" Physicians Committee members also led demonstrations at fast-food restaurants in or near hospitals across the country to raise awareness of the health risks of eating bacon and other processed meats Protests were led by Kerry Foley, MD, in Dewey Beach, Del ; Pinar Miski, MD, at the McDonald's near University of Maryland Medical Center, in Baltimore, Md ; Christie Cobb, MD, at the McDonald's near St Vincent Hospital in Little Rock, Ark ; Ted Barnett, MD, at the McDonald's near Strong Hospital in Rochester, N Y ; Saray Stancic, MD, at the Burger King in University Hospital in Newark, N J ; Paula Rothman, MD, at the McDonald's in Northside Hospital in Atlanta, Ga ; and Bandana Chawla, MD, and Munish Chawla, MD, at the Chick-fil-A Express and McDonald's at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston Both the American Medical Association and the American College of Cardiology have called on hospitals to remove processed meat from menus Patients in New York state hospitals who want to avoid cancer-causing bacon, greasy cheeseburgers, and artery-clogging meatloaf will soon have healthful plant- based options available at every meal thanks to a new law promoted by the Physicians Committee and its New York supporters The law requires hospitals to make available upon request plant-based meals and snacks that are nutritionally equivalent to other menu items The bill also requires hospitals to list the plant-based options on all written materials and menus In Washington, the Physicians Committee worked with the D C Council to introduce the Healthy Hospitals Amendment Act of 2019, a bill that would require hospitals in D C to eliminate processed meat from menus and make plant-based options available Making Hospital Food Healthy \"The McDonald's fast food restaurant inside of a Macon hospital is closing at the end of its contract. The decision to close the restaurant was announced days after a national advocacy group filed a complaint with the Macon-Bibb Health Department.\"\"New York recently passed legislation requiring hospitals to offer healthful plant- based meals that could help fight heart disease\u2014a disease accounting for nearly 40 percent of all deaths statewide. As founder and director of the Cardiac Wellness Program at Montefiore Health System, I've seen the power of a plant- based prescription firsthand.\" Physicians Committee member Robert Ostfeld, MD Baltimore Rochester WHAT'S NEXT? Thanks to you, the Physicians Committee will continue to educate hospital administrators, health care professionals, and patients about the benefits of making hospitals fast-food free We will plan more demonstrations at hospitals in 2020 and are exploring legislation requiring plant- based hospital food in additional states 15 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 16To achieve its goal of eliminating animal tests, the Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging scientists to be trained on New Approach Methodologies\u2014 nonanimal test methods such as organs on chips and computational methods\u2014an area of expertise for the Physicians Committee In 2019, the Physicians Committee trained more than 3,000 industry, government, and academic scientists via webinars, conferences, and the Physicians Committee's New Approach Methodology (NAM) Use for Regulatory Application (NURA) program Esther Haugabrooks, PhD, coordinates the NURA program, which held events in the Washington, D C , area and Houston in 2019 The events included speakers from the EPA and chemical companies including Dow and Clorox Represented among attendees were the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration, and medical device, tobacco, and chemical companies The Physicians Committee's NURA webpage includes resources and recorded lectures describing the latest nonanimal approaches in toxicology, including in vitro and in silico methods for skin and eye irritation, skin sensitization, and other topics PCRM.org/NURA WHAT'S NEXT? The Physicians Committee will continue to expand its NURA program, and thanks to you, will partner with the Johns Hopkins University to train students and early-career scientists at Summer School 2020: Innovative Science Without Animals, PCRM org/SummerSchool Fighting FDA Animal Testing Training Scientists To Replace Animal Tests More than 95 percent of new medicines fail in human clinical trials because they are unsafe or do not work, despite promising results in animal experiments In 2019, the Physicians Committee went to Capitol Hill to lobby for replacing animals with more predictive human- relevant innovations in pharmaceutical development In September, Elizabeth Baker, JD, pharmaceutical policy program director for the Physicians Committee, organized a congressional briefing on nonanimal drug development technologies in cooperation with Rep Brendan Boyle (D-Pa ) Baker also went to Capitol Hill in October with Vanda Pharmaceuticals to urge Congress to task the Food and Drug Administration with moving away from animal testing in drug development Vanda refused to conduct a dog study for its drug tradipitant, which had already begun testing in human clinical trials, so the FDA put a hold on the drug Vanda is now suing the agency \"The FDA is ignoring a large body of published scientific evidence that concludes these dog studies are uninformative,\" said Mihael H Polymeropoulos, MD, president and CEO of Vanda, who won the Physicians Committee's inaugural Trailblazer Award in December \"As the FDA integrates methods that are more accurate predictors of safety because they incorporate human biology, we can look forward to improved drug development, significant financial savings, less animal testing, and better medicines for humans.\" Elizabeth Baker, JDWHAT'S NEXT?

People don't need to weigh and measure their food and carbohydrates. A plant-based diet is a simple diet to achieve.\" Caroline Trapp, DNP, CDE \"If the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee is serious about helping Americans get healthy, it should ignore Atkins' call for cutting the carbs in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and continue to urge Americans to increase consumption of carb- rich fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes.\" Susan Levin, MS, RD, CSSD WHAT'S NEXT? You are helping the Physicians Committee continue to challenge the self-serving interests of animal agriculture giants and push for plant-based diets in the new Dietary Guidelines, which are expected to be released in late 2020 or early 2021 21 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 22\"Modernize Medical Training\" and \"End Animal Use\" read signs carried by Physicians Committee member Kerry Foley, MD, and Seattle-area residents at a Physicians Committee demonstration in November that urged the University of Washington to end the use of live animals in its surgery residency program, following a five-year span during which human simulators were used The Physicians Committee also filed a federal complaint in December regarding the use of live animals for training general surgery residents at the University of Virginia Currently, 154 of 215 surveyed surgery residency programs in the United States exclude live animals from training The Physicians Committee is also petitioning the Department of Defense to investigate the use of live animals in emergency medicine training at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, where procedures are performed on pigs, including making incisions in the animal's throat and chest in order to insert a chest tube, breathing tube, or rib spreader, or inserting needles to drain fluid from the eye or heart Naval Medical Center San Diego ended animal use for this purpose in 2014 \"Tuskegee University: You don't have to kill one to save the other ModernizeMedicalTraining org \" That was the message on Physicians Committee billboards in Tuskegee and Montgomery, Ala , in October The billboards and a federal complaint are aimed at ending Tuskegee University College of Veterinary Medicine's lethal use of live animals for veterinary training According to a statement from an anonymous graduate of Tuskegee's veterinary program, healthy dogs from an animal shelter were being used to practice surgical procedures including limb amputations At the conclusion of the training labs, the dogs were killed Records obtained by the Physicians Committee from Phenix City reveal that Tuskegee acquired 159 dogs from the Russell County-Phenix City Animal Shelter between January 2017 and September 2018 Several other veterinary schools have replaced terminal surgery labs with humane training methods Steps To End Animal Use in Medical Training 1. Share with training program administrators how other programs use more effective and humane methods. 2. File legal complaints. 3. Flood program administrators with member letters, emails, and petitions. 4. Organize protests. 5. Raise public awareness through billboards, advertisements, and hard-hitting media campaigns.Modernizing Medical Training 23 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 24\"Dr. Neal Barnard, a professor of internal medicine at George Washington University who is also critical of the guidelines, said the Johnston group's analyses show 'clear evidence that if you do reduce red meat that your risk of stroke, diabetes, heart attack and cancer not only goes down, but that it's statistically significant.'\"\"In recent years, the egg industry has sought to neutralize eggs' unhealthy image as a cholesterol- raising product by funding more studies and skewing the interpretation of the results. ... Eggs raise cholesterol, period. The science is clear.\" Physicians Committee president Neal Barnard, MD, FACC\"New Guidelines: No Need To Reduce Red or Processed Meat Consumption for Good Health,\" read the surprising headline on a news release distributed by the Annals of Internal Medicine on Sept 25 Despite the obvious health benefits of reducing meat intake\u2014 benefits that were actually outlined in the published studies\u2014the authors of the Annals guidelines, led by Bradley Johnston, were recommending continuing red meat consumption On Sept 30, the day before the Annals guidelines were published, the Physicians Committee filed a petition requesting the Federal Trade Commission to require the Annals to correct false statements regarding the consumption of red and processed meat Ultimately, the suggested \"guidelines\" were published on Oct 1, but the backlash against them was widespread A headline in The Washington Post read: \"A study says full speed ahead on processed and red meat consumption Nutrition scientists say not so fast \" The CBS Evening News, NBC News, The New York Times, and dozens of other newspapers and TV and radio stations across the country covered the Physicians Committee's FTC petition Following the release of the controversial report, documents obtained by the Physicians Committee through a public records request revealed that Johnston had hidden the fact that he had been promised a $170,000 job with Texas A&M University's AgriLife program, which spent a reported $4 5 million on beef research in 2019 alone In November, the Physicians Committee asked the Philadelphia Office of the District Attorney to investigate the Annals, a publication of the American College of Physicians, for potential reckless endangerment of the public resulting from the wide dissemination of \"dietary guideline recommendations\" that would substantially increase the risk for fatal illness Rotten Egg Industry Research In 2019, Dr Barnard also published research exposing the egg industry's role in cholesterol research and its efforts to downplay the danger of cholesterol Exposing Meat Industry Influence 25 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 26Led by James Loomis, MD, and staffed by world-class physicians and nurses, the Barnard Medical Center continued to put prevention and patient health first In 2019, the Barnard Medical Center saw its 5,000th patient and introduced exciting new programs including a 12-week, plant-based nutrition weight loss program led by Vanita Rahman, MD, who, along with Jasmol Sardana, DO, joined the Barnard Medical Center in 2019 Twenty-six health care professionals from countries ranging from Ireland to India and Slovakia to South Africa completed clinical rotations at the Barnard Medical Center in 2019 and will bring their enhanced knowledge of plant-based nutrition to their practices around the world From legislation to the lunch line, Physicians Committee experts are working to give students access to healthy plant-based school lunches In California, lawmakers introduced AB 479, a bill co- sponsored by the Physicians Committee, which would provide extra funding to schools that add or increase the number of plant-based entrees and plant milks on their menus S1472/A1624, a bill the Physicians Committee is supporting in the New York State Legislature, would provide plant-based options upon request to students in all New York public schools The legislation is supported by a Physicians Committee case study published in The Journal of Child Nutrition & Management that found vegan school lunches are much more nutritious than standard entrees Dietitians and researchers partnered with community-based foodservice provider DC Central Kitchen to pilot six vegan entrees at a public school with nearly 500 students The vegan entrees, which included sesame tofu, three-bean chili, barbecue tofu bites, southwest veggie burgers, plant-based sloppy joes, and pasta with chickpeas, had more fiber, less fat and less saturated fat, and no cholesterol, compared to the meat-based meals Revolutionizing Patient Care Advocating for Plant-Based School Lunches \"James Loomis, who practices internal medicine at Barnard Medical Center in Washington, D.C., said he believes a vegan diet is a natural fit for athletes: It 'leads to quicker recovery from workouts and better injury

more disease-fighting fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes.\" Physicians Committee member Anthony Lim, MD, JD Game Changer In 2019, Dr Loomis was featured in The Game Changers, a groundbreaking documentary on plant-based athletes Dr Loomis, whose plant-based diet fueled the Ironman Triathlon he completed in 2019, also co-authored a scientific paper that added further evidence that plant- based athletes benefit from improvements in heart health, performance, and recovery 27 | 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 ANNUAL REPORT | 28Seventy-three percent of physicians feel that patient visits should include nutrition guidance, but only 15 percent feel \"totally prepared\" to offer it, according to a poll the Physicians Committee commissioned in 2019 Sixty-five percent think doctors should be required to have some of their continuing medical education hours be related to nutrition The Physicians Committee is supporting legislation in New York state and Washington, D C , that would do just that \"It is only right that doctors understand the causes of their patients' illnesses and have the knowledge to help them get well,\" said Physicians Committee president Neal Barnard, MD, at a hearing on the Continuing Nutrition Education Amendment Act of 2019, which was introduced in Washington, D C , in November Educating Health Care Providers \"Nutrition should be a required part of
