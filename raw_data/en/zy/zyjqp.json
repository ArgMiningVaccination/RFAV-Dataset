Back to school season is here, which brings up many health concerns for new parents sending their kids off to their first day of school, especially when it comes to the controversies of vaccines. Due to concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children in Arizona and all across the US. Phoenix has the highest rate of Nonmedical Exemptions to vaccinations in the U.S. Medical experts warn that this can put the health of the Phoenix community in jeopardy as vaccine refusal and delay can increase the risk of eradicated or well-controlled diseases re-emerging. Brett Hurliman, MD, a clinical assistant professor in the [Department of Child Health](/node/2025) at the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix and a pediatrician at Phoenix Children's Hospital, answers a few of the most frequently asked questions about vaccines. If parents aren't having their children vaccinated, what is the best alternative to stop an outbreak? What can I do to make sure my child, who is vaccinated, doesn't get a vaccine-resistant strain? Parents who choose to delay or refuse certain vaccines should be made aware of the risks this decision may carry. These risks are not only for the child, but also for other individuals who the child may come in contact with. Some vaccine-preventable diseases still circulate in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. These diseases can range from mild to severe to life-threatening. Knowing your child's vaccine status is of utmost importance. At times of an outbreak, parents whose children are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated should discuss any possible prevention or treatment with their pediatrician. Vaccine-resistant disease strains are extremely rare. The most important thing a parent can do is make sure that their children are immunized fully and in a timely manner against all vaccine-preventable disease. I've heard stories of eradicated diseases like polio coming back. Is this something I should be worried about, too? With increasing rates of vaccine refusal and delay, there is always a risk of previously eradicated or well-controlled diseases re-emerging. These diseases can have life-threatening consequences, even with the best medical care. Physicians are not accustomed to recognizing, diagnosing and treating these eradicated diseases on a regular basis. Vaccines are well-studied, they are safe and they save lives. What vaccinations do children need before they enter school? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publish annual immunization schedules for safe administration of vaccines, backed by a robust body of medical literature. These schedules are created using recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice and are also approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Routine vaccines are those that are recommended for everyone in the United States, and commonly thought of as \"childhood immunizations.\" A list of these routine childhood vaccines is available on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html). The CDC does not, however, set immunization requirements for schools. Instead, each state decides which immunizations are required for a child's enrollment and attendance at school in that state. Parents are encouraged to talk with school staff members regarding specific information about their vaccine requirements. Parents also can discuss specific vaccine requirements with their pediatrician, contact their state's immunization program or Department of Health, or access the [SchoolVaxView tool](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/schoolvaxview/index.html) on the CDC website. How effective are vaccines? What dangers do parents face by not vaccinating their children? Choosing to refuse or delay vaccines may leave a child at an increased risk of illnesses that have very serious complications. The diseases that routine immunizations prevent can be very dangerous, and even deadly. With vaccination, we are able to protect [children against 14 different](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/diseases/child/14-diseases.html) infectious diseases. - Diphtheria. - Chickenpox. - Mumps. - Rotavirus. - Pneumococcal Disease. - Whopping Cough. - Measles. - Hib. - Rubella. - Hepatitis A. - Hepatitis B. - Influenza. - Tetanus. - Polio. Children who are not vaccinated following the recommended schedule are also at risk of spreading diseases to others who are not able to be protected. This unprotected population includes newborn infants who are too young for immunizations and people with weakened immune systems. What questions should parents be asking? Making the decision to vaccinate your child is one of the most important decisions that parents can make. Before deciding to vaccinate their child, parents should be encouraged to have discussions with and ask questions of their medical provider. Some of the things that parents may wish to have more information about are how vaccines work, any possible side effects, the risks and benefits of vaccination, the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and the recommended immunization schedule. Following these evidence-based discussions, pediatricians want to ensure that parents are making a well-informed decision. Are all vaccinations offered or do parents need to be aware of certain ones? All routine, recommended vaccinations should be offered by a child's primary care provider during office visits. If a child's pediatrician is unable to provide a specific, necessary vaccine, office staff should be able to assist parents in finding an alternative facility to obtain the vaccinations. Parents are always encouraged to inquire about their child's vaccine status at any office visit \u2014 well child exams, follow up appointments and sick visits. Any time a child is in their doctor's office, it is an opportunity for vaccine catch-up, if needed. What are the side effects of these vaccines? Any medication can cause side effects, including vaccines. The side effects from vaccines, should they occur, are almost always minor and resolve within a few days. These minor side effects include fevers and pain, discomfort, redness or swelling at the injection site. Serious side effects after vaccinations, such as a severe allergic reaction, can occur but are extremely rare.
