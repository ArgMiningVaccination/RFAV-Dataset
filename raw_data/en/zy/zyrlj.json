Sticking to a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water, and focusing on the psychological symptoms is vital to recovering from alcohol detox. How to Stop Alcohol Cravings Naturally Recovering from [alcohol use disorder](https://www.amethystrecovery.org/treatment/alcohol-addiction/) can be challenging. It usually involves steady support and different remedies. First of all, it's not a good idea to rely only on natural remedies for alcoholism, especially if other substances are involved. Still, there are ways to stop alcohol cravings naturally. Acupuncture Acupuncture is used in traditional Chinese medicine to help reduce the cravings for alcohol and withdrawal symptoms. It's also helpful for anxiety and depression. Researchers note that placing acupuncture needles into zones linked to alcohol-related behaviors can help curb cravings. However, the effect was weak, so combining other evidence-based therapies is essential. Meditation Part of the struggles people experience during alcohol detox is withdrawal symptoms. Anxiety, agitation, and stress are common during alcohol detox. Meditation and mindfulness can lower anxiety symptoms and even help prevent relapse. While results may vary per individual, meditation paired with therapeutic interventions can be highly successful in treating alcohol detox. Herbal Remedies Some herbal remedies, such as kudzu extract, can help people avoid binge drinking or relapse. Kudzu raises blood alcohol levels faster, making people feel intoxicated sooner. While studies show mixed results, it's known that kudzu at least can help reduce the number of drinks someone takes. Other herbal remedies include ashwagandha, which can help with alcohol withdrawal and relieve anxiety. It's important to note that more scientific studies are needed to confirm that these remedies help lower alcohol cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Tips for Natural Alcohol Detox at Home People with mild to moderate alcohol use disorder may detox at home. This is possible as long as withdrawal symptoms remain mild.

However, in some cases, withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks. Before detoxing at home, ensure you have eliminated any traces of alcohol or drugs in the house.

Foods high in vitamins and minerals include milk, beef, chicken, lean fish, broccoli, and leafy greens.
