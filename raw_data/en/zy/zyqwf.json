The purpose of this is because there is a war going on. And I think sometimes people don't realize thereality of war and what's really happening. Verse 7, And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail,nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth,and his angels were cast out with him. Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, \"Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death. What's very powerful here was that war was in heaven. So war originally originated in heaven. In this unseen realm is where war started. Now I want you tothink about something. God created three major archangels and in this creation Lucifer was thefirst one created. Lucifer was created to express God's presence. He covered the universe with praise. That was his purpose. He was the praise and worship leader of the universe. Michael wascreated to keep order. Lucifer again was created to express the presence of God through praise.Michael was created to keep order. So we see here that in this they fought. So when Lucifer exalted himself, God removed him from his position because he was no longer submissive. Hewas out of order. The reason why war started is because Lucifer went out of order. Michael wasthere to put things in order or maintain order because God is the God of order. So when Lucifer,known as satan, was cast to the earth and it's atmosphere, this influenced man. His influence nowis for man to kill man. His purpose is that mankind kill one another. Lucifer has been sentenced tothe earth and its atmosphere. So he truly believes that if he can destroy man and mankind anddestroy the earth, he can escape God's prison. So the only way to resist the influence of the self-destruction is to be covered by the blood of Christ, surrender the worldly way of life and expressthe life of Christ in us by obedience and confession. That's how they overcame\u2014by their testimony. Again, God created Lucifer to express praise that covers the universe. Again, Godcreated Michael to maintain order. God created Gabriel to carry the information of truth byrevelation to all realms of creation. I will say that again. God created Gabriel to carry truth byrevelation to all realms of creation. The basis of all things behind creation is order. Divine order.Because he is the God of order. The result of disorder is war. War represents: Wrath AgainstRebellion. When divine order is out of order\u2014In other words, when God has set a divine order and the order is out of order, the result is wrath against rebellion. Because the fruit of disorder isrebellion. So where there is rebellion, you know that things are out of order. Divine order is notfalling into place and in this it promotes war\u2014wrath against rebellion. P SALM 89:11-18 Again the basis of all things behind creation is order. Verse 11, The heavens are Yours, the earthalso is Yours; The world and all its fullness, You have founded them. The north and the south, Youhave created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Your name. You have a mighty arm; Strong is - 1 - Your hand, and high is Your right hand. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne\u2014 What's the foundation? Righteousness and Justice! So if that's the foundation of histhrone, things that are in divine order are promoting what? Righteousness and justice. If they arenot in divine order, they are promoting wrath against rebellion. He says, Mercy and truth gobefore Your face. Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound! They walk, O Lord, in thelight of Your countenance. Let me share something about the word \"blessed.\" The word blessed \u2014it says, Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound! They walk, O Lord, in the light of Your countenance\u2014 In other words, they are walking in divine order. The word \"blessed\" isthreefold. It means empowered. When you are blessed you are empowered and in thisempowerment\u2014you are empowered to prosper and you are empowered to succeed. That is called blessed. So when you speak to someone I bless you. You are not just saying some mystical word blessed. When you say I bless you, what you're saying is I pray God empower you and prosper you to succeed . So when we say we are blessed and highly favored. It's because we areempowered, we're prosperous and we are going to succeed\u2014because I'm favored! Sorighteousness and justice are the foundation of Almighty's throne. Verse 16. In Your name theyrejoice all day long, And in Your righteousness they are exalted. For You are the glory of their strength, And in Your favor our horn is exalted. For our shield belongs to the Lord, And our king to the Holy One of Israel. So if righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne, youknow that that's what he is going to establish no matter what. And anything that is out of thatorder will promote war. Wrath against rebellion. It's God's wrath against rebellion. If war startedoff in heaven, think about this, there is a constant war. If God established Michael to maintainorder, why did he bring us forth? Because he is training us up to maintain his order. This is only atraining ground. All of this is a part of training. When everything begins to go and burn in theuniverse\u2014and everything associated with this\u2014we are going to be with the Lord. We willmaintain divine order. Wherever he establishes and whatever he sets. Doesn't the bible say thatwe will rule for 1000 years. If we are going to rule for 1000 years, that means that it is going to beour responsibility under his authority to maintain divine order. That's called spiritual protocol.There is a spiritual protocol that God is requiring. And when we fall out of that spiritual protocol,we are out of order and that's what gets us in trouble. Because it opens the door to the enemy. R EVELATION 19:11-14 Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. Why? What's he doing? Gettingthings in divine order according to His protocol. Not according to man's. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. Who is the armies of heaven? We are!! In other words, you and I are now the armies of theeternal realm. We are in Holy Ghost Boot Camp/Officer's Training School. God is training up the believers to become a part of his eternal army. I was sitting with the Lord the other night and therewas such an impartation\u2014and I don't know if I can express it or explain it. But it is almost like Ifelt like we had it all wrong. Everything was just crazy and out of order! Everybody is looking atreligiosity. Everybody is looking at a church that God is in! It's all goofy!!! GOOFY!! Because people have lost sight about military! This is all about a military\u2014where there is a kingdom, thereis a military\u2014and there are citizens!! We are a kingdom! An eternal kingdom! And I began tosee ministries and other things and he began to share with me that in the other ministries, people- 2 - are looking at the area of what a ministry is doing and how many people are in it. It has nothing todo with anything\u2014God has got a specific purpose for each ministry. There are certain parts of thearmy. You have the navy, the airforce\u2014you have the marines. All of those things in the physicalrealm are associated with the spiritual realm. And there are areas that each ministry is doing\u2014butwe are all working together. There are ministries that may not believe in the gifts but it doesn'tmatter\u2014God is still using them for a specific thing. So they may be out evangelizing more. Thereare ministries where they are interceding more. Spiritual warfare. All of this is associated with battalions all over. And I began to see this whole thing. People are looking at people in a religiousaspect. Oh, you're a believer? But they look at it in a religious aspect. Not a militant aspect. SeeGod looks at it as an area\u2014he died for me and you so that we could enter his kingdom. He paidthat price. It is an eternal military. That's what it is all about. As he began to show me this, I began to look at each place totally different now. And how people are so out of rank!! And howGod is trying to get his people back in rank and get things set up and get spiritual protocol. Peoplethink they can just do anything they want because Jesus is their Lord and they are out of order andnot submissive to authority and they have none. And it's causing division and problems in thekingdom. There are no lone rangers and there's no free spirit. Everyone is submissive tosomeone. Everyone!! And if they are not, they are out order!! The Lord was imparting this in meand I began to see so much foolishness. So much confusion. So much garbage!! People thinkingthey can just do whatever they want because Jesus is their Lord and Savior. And that's not true.There is a protocol God is requiring. We must be ready because of what is coming. And it'scoming very soon. Very soon. J OSHUA 5:10-15 Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of themonth at twilight on the plains of Jericho. And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and parched grain, on the very same day. Then the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year. And it came to pass, when Joshuawas by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, \"Are You for us or for our adversaries?\" So He said, \"No, but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.\" And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, \"What does my Lord sayto His servant?\" Who was this? This was Jesus. Then the Commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua, \"Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.\" And Joshua did so. So the Commander of the army appeared to Joshua!! Now you knew it had to be the Lord because no one is allowed to worship an angel. He would have said, No don't worship me man! But because he was the Lord he allowed him to worship him. So you know it wasn't an angel. Itwas the Lord himself. He is the Commander of the army. So if he is the Commander of the army,everything was instituted and the purpose that God would create a military force\u2014an eternalmilitary force to uphold his order. And that is what we are a part of. I know it may be a little hardto comprehend this sometimes because we have been so programed for religiosity. But we have togo beyond the walls\u2014we've got to go beyond tradition. We've got to go beyond all of these areasand begin to look eternally. Living from the future into the present. When you begin to see thingsall the way past\u2014all the way past even the thousand year reign- you begin to look beyond that.We are going to have glorified bodies even the thousand year millennium. Why? So we can go toand fro. To do what? To rule\u2014to reign with Christ. Why? To keep order! So God is raising up- 3 - Reward Your Curiosity Everything you want to read. Anytime. Anywhere.
