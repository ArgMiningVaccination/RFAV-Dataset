The results from the first phase of the Moderna vaccine, which is being co-developed by researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), show that the vaccine is well-tolerated in research participants\u2014and is even generating strong immune response in older adults. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, noted that the experimental vaccine, mRNA-1273, was well-tolerated by the older trial participants, who were over 55 years of age. Since the pandemic began, we have known that older adults are more vulnerable to the complications of covid-19\u2014and hence, we need a vaccine that can cater to them. This is how the first phase of the Moderna covid-19 vaccine is progressing The phase 1 trial began on March 16, 2020, and was expanded to enroll older adults about one month later. In its expansion, the scientists said the trial enrolled 40 healthy volunteers\u201420 adults ages 56 to 70 years, and 20 adults ages 71 years and older. Ten volunteers in each age group received a lower dose of the [vaccine](https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/covid-19-vaccine-likely-to-have-50-100-efficacy-according-to-the-icmr/), and 10 participants in each age group received a higher dose. After approximately one month, the researchers said the volunteers received a second dose of the same vaccine at the same dosage. They said the volunteers attended clinic visits to track their responses to the vaccine, and assess safety throughout the study. The research found that the investigational [vaccine](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/russian-vaccine-for-covid-19-shows-strong-immune-response-against-sars-cov-2-in-trials/) was well-tolerated in this older age group\u2014although some volunteers experienced transient adverse effects, including fever and fatigue after vaccination. According to the scientists, the participants exhibited a good immune response to the vaccine, with the blood of vaccinated volunteers containing robust binding and neutralising antibodies against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. They said the immune response to the vaccine seen in older volunteers was comparable to that seen in younger age groups. Also, watch: The researchers said the study will continue to follow the older volunteers for approximately a year after second vaccination to monitor the long-term effects of the vaccine. The results from the phase 1 trial further support testing of the investigational vaccine in older adults in an ongoing large phase 3 trial, they added. (With inputs from Reuters) "}
