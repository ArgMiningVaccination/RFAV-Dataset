I typically don't, other than giving a nod to the summer and winter solstices and the spring and fall equinoxes. But recently, I've been going through seismic changes in my life. I just got married, lost a loved one, sold a major professional project, and am about to move to another country\u2014all in a span of a few weeks. I'm filled with a myriad of intense emotions. \"Overwhelmed\" doesn't do justice to how I feel. When we're at a spiritual crossroads, we seek out an opportunity to heal so we can move forward. Holistic healer Morgane Jorge [says](https://www.vogue.fr/beaute/article/rituel-bienfaits-pleine-lune) that \"full moons are the perfect time to let go of tensions and emotional blockages.\" It is the time to use introspection and spiritual cleansing to let go of what no longer serves us to move forward. Traditionally a time of profound changes, supermoons also offer a special connection to the divine feminine. [Today (August 1) is one of only four supermoons](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/31/1191072404/supermoon-sturgeon-blue-august-rare-lunar-event) we'll experience in 2023. Supermoon occurs when moon orbits closer to Earth than is normal, making it 8% bigger and 16% brighter than a normal full moon. It also has a strong effect on tides. August 1 supermoon is called the Sturgeon moon, because Native Americans found that this was when sturgeons were easiest to catch. On August 30, we're visited by the Super Blue Moon. We all know the saying \"once in a blue moon.\" A blue moon is a second full moon in one calendar month. For a blue moon to be also a supermoon is a rare phenomenon\u2014the next one will happen in 2032. Letting go of negative thoughts and feelings - Clean your space. This creates spiritual and physical space for you to welcome positivity into your life. - You may place healing crystals in your area to help create a healing zone. Consider rose quartz for self-love, amethyst for healing, tourmaline for deflecting negative energy. - Burn sage stick or palo santo. Please note that ethically and respectfully sourcing sage and palo santo is critical for both the ecosystem and Indigenous culture. If you can't be sure of the fairtrade and sustainable harvesting of these ingredients, I suggest burning coconut wax or other cleanly sourced wax candle. [Non-toxic Incense sticks](https://www.peacefuldumpling.com/newsflash-your-wellness-incense-may-be-harming-your-health)are also a great option. Finally, I have a friend who grows Korean mugwort (wormwood) in her garden and gifts me with handmade smudge sticks. You might be surprised to discover you have wild herbs or semi-wild herbs in your garden or neighborhood. - After centering yourself in your clean and purified space, write a list of all the emotions and beliefs that are holding you back. - Re-read the list with the firm intention that you are letting go of them. - You can recite several times: I free myself of the emotions, fears, and limiting beliefs that prevent me from going forward. - When you're ready, burn the list and thank yourself for taking the time to do this ritual. Outdoor purification You may find that supermoons inexplicably draw you outdoors to fully experience its beauty. Find yourself a serene place and use a smudge stick or incense to purify your body. Reflect on the blockage that is bothering you: is it anger? Guilt? Suffering? When you are ready, recite an affirmation of forgiveness and freedom. Other ideas Make moonwater. Let a flask of purified water bask in the moon's light and use it for meditation and even beauty. Manifest abundance. The larger-than-normal size of supermoon makes it the perfect symbol of abundance. Manifest your dreams under the moon's light. Moonbathing. Walk or lie still in the moon's light.
