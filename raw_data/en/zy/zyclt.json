What should I expect during a consultation? Your tailored functional medicine experience begins with two telehealth consultation options to fit your personal needs. During our initial webcam consultation with our online functional medicine doctor and team, we will extensively explore your case, getting to the root causes of why you feel the way that you do, and review any past labs you may have. During this time we will also determine if any functional medicine labs or advanced protocols are needed, and if so, which ones would be best. After this initial consultation if you choose to enter into care, Dr. Will Cole works with his functional medicine team on every case to develop a tailored health plan, created just for you and your body's needs. OPTION ONE | $720 Comprehensive consultation with functional diagnostic health practitioner During your initial telehealth consultation, a highly trained member of Dr. Cole's functional diagnostic health practitioner team will extensively explore your case, getting to the root facets of why you feel the way you do, review any past labs you may have, and answer your questions.
