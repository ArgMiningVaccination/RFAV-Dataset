Reiki is made of up of 2 Japanese words: REI-Spiritual and KI: Life Force-God/Source Energy. Everything has Energy in this Universe: our world/planets and all that exist within our Universe and the Universe itself. This Energy is ALL encompassing even though it may seem invisible or elusive. This healing technique was developed by Mikao Usui in the early 20th century. It is a safe and natural method of healing the mind, body and spirit and this is done by a practitioner who uses his/her hands on various energy centers/chakras and various body parts to realign the pure flow of energy within the body. As the body goes into a deep state of relaxation, the innate ability of the body to open the flow of energies increases allowing for healing on a deeper level. The benefits of Reiki healing include deep relaxation, raising the vibration/frequency of the body, removal of blockages of energy flow, stress reduction, strengthening of the immune system, increased energy and vitality, decreased pain just to name a few. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, Reiki healing may also help with anxiety, depression, chronic pains, chronic fatigue, insomnia, breaking of bad habits/addictions, weight loss, and recovering from side effects of medical treatments/drugs and radiation therapy from cancer treatments. Reiki may also be beneficial for those who are passing away and to their families to help bring a sense of peace and acceptance. Reiki may be done either in person or apart (referred to as Distance Reiki.) A typical session is 60 minutes while lying on a massage table with the practitioner using hands, crystals, aromatherapy, and sound/meditation-relaxation music to heal, balance, and restore the body's life force energy and chakras. Distance Reiki session is 30 minutes and is healing energy sent across time and space and may be received by the recipient no matter where they are in the world. At the time of the booking, the name of the person and where they are when receiving Reiki will need to be provided. A picture of the person receiving Reiki may be helpful though not necessary to perform Reiki. Reiki energy healing is not just about a flow of energy between practitioner and recipient. In order for Reiki to really work and have long-lasting results, the recipient must also participate by accepting responsibility for their own healing and taking an active part in the healing process. The Usui system of Reiki is more than the use of Reiki energy. It also includes an active commitment on the part of the recipient to improve oneself. In order to help with this aspect of the Reiki system, the founder Mikao Usui developed what is known as the 5 Basic Principles of Reiki. These principles or ideals are guidelines for living a gracious life and practicing virtues that guide one toward living a healthier life in body, mind, and spirit which in turn leads to healthier ways of thinking, feeling, and therefore, a healthier way of living!
