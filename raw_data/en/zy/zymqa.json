CooneyAAEP News April 2019 III Internships, mentorship and ethics: What are we doing? By Shannon K. Reed, DVM, MS, DACVS-LA An internship is not just a one-year contracted experience; it is the beginning of an individual's professional life. Creating a positive and effective experience can build momentum for an individual's career, while a negative or ineffective experience can hamper or even derail a career. The AVMA, AAEP and Veterinary Internship and Residency Matching Program (VIRMP) have published definitions and guidelines for internships on their websites. Each specifically addresses the primary purpose of an internship, which is to provide an educational experience for the intern as opposed to solely a service benefit to the organization. For veterinari- ans organizing internships and participating as mentors, ethics plays a large role. The ethics of internships can be divided into three main components: the ethics of the overall internship, the ethics toward the interns and the ethics demonstrated for the interns. Ethics of the overall internship The ethics of the overall internship begins with the mentoring veterinarian or practice taking ownership of the internship. Ethical practice requires (1) understanding the specific best practice recommendations offered by the AAEP/VIRMP for internships, (2) critically evaluating the ability of the practice to fulfill those recommendations before committing to an internship, and (3) frequently assessing the fulfillment of those recommendations. Do you have the capability to fulfill the requirements? Can you honestly and frequently evaluate if you are meeting those responsibilities in practice? Are you willing to solicit, hear and act on feedback from participants concerning the ability of your practice to meet those expectations? Practices and individuals that do not honestly evaluate or represent their capabilities to provide effective internships are not practicing ethical mentorship. Ethics toward the interns The ethics toward the interns is a large part of responsi- ble and effective mentorship. When evaluating this component, it's helpful to consider ethics as the moral principles that govern a person's behavior or conduct. Are interns treated as colleagues who are seeking additional training or as a medium for the practice to achieve success and/or financial solvency? When does effective learning through extensive mentored experience give way to overwork and exhaustion? Does the offered compensa-tion meet basic industry standards for the level of experience and educational benefits, or does it take advantage of the intern's need to complete the experience and push them to accept substandard compensation? This component must be evaluated in some way beyond self-reflection; it is not enough for an individual or practice to consider for themselves if they are treating the interns ethically, but also needs to include evaluation by participating interns or evaluation by outside colleagues as well as monitoring of industry standards and research regarding things such as compensation during training and restriction of duty hours (Adin et al. 2018). Ethics demonstrated for the interns The ethics demonstrated for the interns critically influences the future behavior of interns as veterinary professionals. This component is woven into the fabric of the internship and ingrained in the culture of the practice. In didactic learning, ethics may be a formal stand-alone class or discussed throughout various courses, and ethics are often presented as black and white rules and hind-sight-based discussions on what went wrong in cases unfamiliar to the discussants. During an internship, ethics can be learned through inten- tional discussions (and should be) as part of the formalized internship curriculum (Vertrees et al. 2012). Beyond that, ethics are learned on a different level in real-world situations, often without specific intention. What choice will be made when a high-value trainer demands medication for the barn without an associated specific patient and condition? Are rules or standards of care bent or broken to help achieve a financial or com-petitive advantage and what justifies this? How are Dr. Shannon Reed ETHICS Dr. Reed is associate professor of equine surgery at The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine and a member of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee. continued on page IVASSoCIA TIonIV AAEP News April 2019 ASSoCIA TIonInternships, mentorship and ethics, continued Access new Rotavirus Guidelines on AAEP website Comprehensive guidelines for the identification, management and prevention of rotavirus, a leading cause of diarrhea in foals up to six months of age at horse breeding centers worldwide, are now available on the AAEP's website. Published as a PDF file, the Rotavirus Guidelines document conveniently summarizes the disease's clinical signs, risk factors, diagnostic methods, control measures, biosecurity issues and other management protocols. The guidelines were created at the request of the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee by Dr. Roberta Dwyer, equine extension veterinarian and professor at the University of Kentucky; and Dr. Ashley Whitehead, senior instructor in equine clinical sciences at the University of Calgary. Drafted guidelines were then reviewed and approved by the committee and the AAEP's board of directors. \"Rotavirus is one of the most common pathogens in major breeding areas worldwide,\" said Dr. Dwyer. \"Early recogni- tion, diagnosis, treatment and biosecurity in cases of foal diarrhea are key to minimizing disease impacts to breeding farms.\"View the Rotavirus Guidelines or save them to your phone or tablet for future reference at aaep.org/guidelines/ infectious-disease-control/using-guidelines. AAEP guidelines for 17 other equine infectious diseases are also available through the site. ETHICS competing or referring practitioners treated and talked about within the practice? When medical errors or mistakes in treatment occur, are they hidden? How are staff treated within the practice? Ethics are demonstrated within a culture on macro and micro levels. The macro ethics are usually right in our faces and demand conscious decisions that are often clearly demonstrated to others. The micro ethics are little moment-to-moment decisions and choices that subcon- sciously influence mentees and help shape their future character. Practices and practitioners offering internship experiences should be attentive to what their culture is and what they are teaching intern veterinarians on both the macro and the micro level. Practices offering intern- ships should formalize discussions of ethics and decision making similar to rounds on patient or disease-based topics. This discussion should include a case-based didactic approach (Vertrees et al. 2012) as this offers an advantage over theoretical academic discussions. Themes that can be explored include client interactions, communi- cation with clients, veterinary versus client preferences, challenges and conflicts associated with learning, financial issues, relationships with industry representatives, etc. (Carrese et al. 2011). In case-based discussion, clinical ethical reasoning as a practice should be encouraged, with the consideration of the medical facts, the medical goals, the client goals and the context of the situation included. (Kaldjian et al. 2005) Providing and maintaining an internship experience is not simply about teaching early-career veterinarians the best way to suture or inject distal hock joints. It is about guiding an experience that influences the next generation of practitioners. Internship providers should intentionally consider what they create as a culture, how they handle discussion of macro ethical issues and how they demon-strate micro ethics on a moment-to-moment basis because that will be what directs the future of our profession.

The session began with dis- cussions in three primary areas: medication, AAEVT and technician utilization, and membership survey results. Following much deliberation of medication use in various disciplines of equine practice and what AAEP's role might be, the board approved formation of a task force with its charge, roster and timeline to be developed.After consideration of an AAEVT request for a closer working relationship with the AAEP, which included sug- gestions from the AAEVT executive director, the board assigned staff with developing specific recommendations to return to the board.Sally Baker provided summarized results of the most recent membership survey, which will be used as part of the triennial strategic planning process in July. Further study in several areas was recommended.Attention then turned to workgroup recommendations. Specific actions taken included: Approval of recommendations from the Infectious Disease Committee to: o revise the Parasite Control Guidelines, o publish new Rotavirus Guidelines, and o fund an in-person meeting of the committee. Approval of a recommendation from the Racing Committee to revise position statements on the use of vesicants and thermocautery/pin firing. Approval of recommendations from the AAEP-A VMA Economic Study task force to request that AVMA (1) share the equine data gathered during its annual census and (2) conduct a second, larger follow-up survey in 2022. Approval of a recommendation from the Mentorship task force to accept its proposed mentorship program and timeline. Following workgroup recommendations, the board engaged in discussions concerning the activities of the association's other councils and committees. Discussions resulted in one action item: approval of a motion to recommend that the Performance Horse Committee conduct a strategic planning session to better formulate a plan of work.During discussion of operational priorities for 2019, it was agreed that successful launch of the mentorship program, further implementation of CE initiatives and recast of the AAEP's strategic plan this summer were key priorities. In addition, discussion of the need to form a student programs task force to better evaluate how we interact with student members currently and in the future yielded consensus, although no official action was taken. In regular board business, the board: Approved the AAEP' s 2019 budget. Approved a change to the AAEP' s fiscal year from the current calendar year to one that coincides with the membership year (July 1-June 30), effective July 1, 2020. The meeting concluded with a staff update on the status of the proposed statement on the management of wild horses and burros by the BLM and current supporters. The next meeting will be held in conjunction with the Summer Focus Conference & Labs in Fort Collins, Colo., in July.AAEP board focuses on priorities, work group recommendations By David Foley, AAEP Executive Director David Foley Connect with AAEP colleagues in new Facebook group Are you among the more than 750 AAEP members engaged in discussions of veterinary or industry topics in the new AAEP Member Vet Talk group on Facebook?

Grice, VMD, MBA Editor's Note: Due to space constraints, this article focuses primarily on financial results; however, you can access the full report, including an executive summary by AAEP leaders, at aaep.org/resources/avma-aaep- equine-economic-study. The recently released report of results of the AVMA- AAEP 2016 Equine Economic Survey is comprehensive and lengthy, but full of interesting and actionable infor- mation. Survey respondents were well-matched with the changing demographics of our profession. Respondent males had an average age of 55 years, with an average of 29 years of experience. Respondent females had an average age of 39 years, with an average of 12 years of experience. Educational debt The survey report revealed that equine practitioners' average graduate educational debt at $131,325 was lower than AVMA graduate debt at $142,732. However, due to lower starting salaries, equine practitioner respondents' Debt to Income Ratio in 2016 was 2.48 compared to 1.71 for AVMA respondents. Although most have educa- tional loans, it is notable that 30% of graduates entering equine practice reported having no debt, in contrast to 20% of respondent graduates entering companion animal practice. It is possible that an equine veterinary career is becoming more readily attainable for those with strong family financial support. While this may significantly decrease monetary stress on these veterinarians, could it lower their incentive to work the long hours and emergency duties traditionally part and parcel of the profession? Or could the decreased financial pressure increase the likelihood of these veterinarians staying in an equine veterinary career? Gender wage gap The equine veterinary industry was revealed to be similar to the rest of the nation when considering the gender wage gap. Survey results indicated that first job after internship female salaries were ~$10,000 less than comparable male salaries ($63,000 versus $73,000). The United States wage gap in 2015 was reported to result in females earning 83% of males' salaries for equivalent work. Just the awareness of this disparity may spark changes within our industry. When considering the number of hours worked by gender, the data reveal that the mean reported work week for equine respondents included females at 56.6 hours, and males at 54.9 hours. When looking at veterinarians as a whole, the mean AVMA respondent-reported work week for females was 45.9 hours, and for males was 48.5 hours. Compensation Respondents' median revenue production in equine practice was reported, with owners averaging $385,832 and associates averaging $356,500. Compensation reported for veterinarians in equine practice was lower than that reported for all AVMA respondents, with a mean income of $99,000 for equine practitioners versus $112,000 for AVMA respondents. Equine owners reported a mean of $118,000 and associates a mean of $78,000 compared to the AVMA respondents who reported owners at a mean of $159,000 and associates at a mean of $90,000. It is notable that the study revealed a high variation in income among different regions and different equine sectors. Mental health Survey results showed that equine practitioners are for the most part a healthy, resilient group. Of concern, however, were the 4.6% of female respondents who reported their mental health as \"poor to very poor\" compared to just 0.7% of males. An additional 18.7% of females indicated their mental health was \"fair.\" Thus, nearly a quarter (23.3%) of females' mental health was reported as \"fair\" to \"very poor.\" It is important to remember that respondent males had an average age nearly 20 years older than respondent females, with an average of 17 years more experience. As such, males were more likely to be practice owners and have little to no remaining educational debt. Importantly, 60% of female respondents had less than 10 years in the field, so were likely to have educational debt, and could be simultane- ously raising families and/or caring for aging parents. The AVMA-AAEP 2016 Equine Economic Survey report is a gold mine of information about our industry, our practices and our professional lives. The AAEP is working to bring the results of this study to members in thoughtful, actionable ways that are easy to digest and implement. Look for this content in the months to come!At 56.6 hours, the mean reported work week for female equine practitioners exceeded their male counterparts at 54.9 hours and AVMA-respondent females at 45.9 hours. AAEP News April 2019 VII Touch Point: Use client profiles to understand differences in service needs A client's age, gender, number of horses owned and type of horses owned all should affect the way vet- erinarians approach relationship and communication issues, according to AAEP market research. The client who owns English sport horses values different things in veterinary service than the client with a single pleasure horse. The savvy and insightful veterinarian tailors his or her approach with each client based on the client's individual needs and demographic profile. One size truly does not fit all. The AAEP Touch program offers 13 different client profiles to help you better understand the individual needs of your future clients. You can view all profiles at touch.aaep.org/8-one-size-does-not-fit-all.Although the top priorities for relationship attributes and services are consistent across all demographic groups, paying attention to the subtle differences between each client type can yield the blueprint for customizing your approach within your equine practice.Touch is exclusively available to AAEP members at touch.aaep.org.

His ongoing leadership and selfless dedication to animals that are among the most in need of veterinary care is the impetus behind Dr. Turoff's recognition as the February honoree of the AAEP's Good Works for Horses Campaign. Searching for an opportunity to \"check the box\" on his friend's request, Dr. Turoff in 2001 discovered a Rural Area Veterinary Services (RAVS) program administer- ing volunteer veterinary care to Guatemala's working horses, donkeys and mules\u2014animals whose health and capacity to work are critical to families' sustenance in the region. What he expected to be a one-time expedition snowballed into a return trip six months later, followed by an opportunity from RAVS to start a similar trip to northern Peru that would continue for seven years before moving to a different part of the country.When the Equitarian Initiative became an independent entity in 2010, Dr. Turoff joined the board of directors and has contributed significantly to the growth and direction of the nonprofit that prepares volunteer vet- erinarians to deliver health care to working equids and education to their caretakers to create sustainable change. He has mentored other veteri- narians who have gone on to lead their own projects, and he has whole- heartedly embraced a core value of the initiative: to teach best practices to Central American veterinary students so that one day they'll be able to do much of this work on their own. He invites students from Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala to join him on Equitarian trips, often at his own expense, to expand their clinical skills and to create cross-border friendships that will eventually help solve regional concerns, such as Equine Infectious Anemia, that require cooperation among nations. He also initiates frequent case consultations with Central American veterinarians after they graduate and hosts veterinary students from the region as externs at his three-doctor ambulatory practice in Placerville, Calif. At the peak of his involvement, Dr. Turoff led three Equitarian trips each year\u2014to Peru, Guatemala and Nicaragua\u2014and participated in three others, encompassing 19 weeks. Now approaching 70, he has scaled back to 15 weeks annually while organizing only the Guatemala trip. In seeking other ways to continue contributing to the welfare of working equids, Dr. Turoff earned accreditation to teach English as a second language and has taught English to several Central American veterinary students who have visited his practice. Upon his retirement, Dr. Turoff intends to take month-long trips to the region to teach English to Central American veterinary students so they can pursue opportunities to study and gain valuable veterinary experience in the United States.As one who has dedicated much of his professional life to Equitarian efforts, Dr. Turoff would be thrilled if such work could develop into a sus- tainable career option. \"I would like for international equine welfare work to be a career path for veterinarians from the developed world,\" he said. \"I don't know how realistic that is\u2014it depends a lot on funding\u2014but that would be great if someone could actually do this sort of work as a primary career.\"Veterinarian improves outlook for working equids, Central American veterinary students Dr. Turoff prepares to perform an initial exam on a mule in Collpapampa, Peru. Throughout 2019, the AAEP's Good Works for Horses Campaign will spotlight AAEP-member practitioners whose volunteer efforts are improving the health and welfare of horses.

Platinum Performance\u00ae Equine contains omega-3 fatty acids for a healthy hoof wall, amino acids that provide the building blocks essential for hoof growth, and vitamins and minerals key to healthy hooves. ADVANCED HOOF SUPPORT Many horse owners and farriers tell us that when using Platinum Performance Equine\u00ae , Platinum Performance\u00aeCJ , or Platinum Performance\u00ae GI , they see healthy hoof growth within a few weeks. When horses need additional support, adding Platinum Hoof Support can provide additional trace minerals and amino acids that offer advanced support for growth and dry, brittle or cracked hooves . Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Effects of detomidine CRIs This blinded, randomised placebo-controlled study, by Miguel Gozalo-Marcilla and colleagues in Brazil and the UK, investigated the sedative and antinociceptive effects of different detomidine constant rate infusions (CRIs), with or without methadone in standing horses. Seven healthy horses with docile temperaments aged between 9 and 11 years were randomly assigned to one of ve intravenous sedation protocols: with methadone (DHM). head abovethe ground, electrical, thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds and gastrointestinal motility were evaluated several times throughout the sedation period by a blinded investigator. All horses received all treatment protocols, with a one-week wash out period between the protocols. DHM resulted in the highest thresholds for all stimuli. DH and DLM provided similar antinociception. DL did not produce any antinociception, but when combined with methadone (DLM) antinociception was mild and similar to that observed with DH. Cardiovascular function was maintained well within acceptable limits in all horses undergoing all treatments. The authors concluded that a higher dose of detomidine combined with methadone may provide better antinociceptive effects in horses undergoing procedures under standing sedation. Synovial sepsis This retrospective study by Lewis Smith and colleagues in the UK aimed to determine the incidence of synovial sepsis following intrasynovial medication in a single UK ambulatory practice. Clinical records of all horses undergoing intrasynovial medication between January 2006 and December 2011 were analysed. Intrasynovial injections performed for diagnostic analgesia were not included in the study. The hair overlying the injection site was not routinely clipped and the site was prepared for a minimum of 5 min using a combination of chlorhexidine gluconate and surgical spirit. Sterile gloves and new vials of medication were used, with concurrent use of amikacin sulphate being dependent on clinician preference. A bandage was usually placed following medication of synovial spaces of the distal limb. In total, 9456 intrasynovial medications were included in the study. Four cases (0.23%) of post-medication synovial sepsis occurred in four individual horses, with sepsis being detected 1 -17 days post-medication. Synovial sepsis devel- oped following middle carpal joint medication in three horsesand following metacarpophalangeal joint medication in one horse. Two of these cases were medicated with polysulphated glycosaminoglycans and hyaluronate (one of which also received concurrent medication with amikacin sulphate) and two were medicated with triamcinolone acetonide and hyaluronate. These results indicated that the frequency of synovial sepsis in this population of horses treated by ambulatory veterinarians was low.Preparation and storage of equine amnion In this study Annette McCoy and colleagues in the USAinvestigated the in fluence of tissue preparation and long-term storage methods on structural integrity and risk of bacterialcontamination of equine amnion. Samples for baseline bacteriology and histology were taken after removal of debris from the amniotic membranes of eight healthy mares (440 samples). The remaining tissue was divided and processed with 0.05% chlorhexidine or 2% iodine/ 0.25% acetic acid. Processed amnion samples were assigned to one of nine combinations of storage media (saline, chlorhexidine, acetic acid) and temperature (4 \u00b0C,/C020\u00b0C, /C080\u00b0C). Samples were submitted for quantitative bacteriology and histopathology at 1 and 4 weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Baseline bacterial levels ranged from <200 to >150,000 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL. None of the potentially pathogenic bacteria in baseline samples were subsequently cultured throughout the study. Nonpathogenic bacteria (median 20 cfu/mL), most commonly Bacillus sp, were cultured sporadically across storage conditions. Tissuearchitecture was minimally affected histologically by processing protocol, storage temperature, or storage duration. The two processing protocols tested here resulted in minimal bacterial contamination or loss of structural integrity of equine amnion stored for up to 12 months at 4 \u00b0C,/C020\u00b0C, or/C080\u00b0C. The authors concluded that amnion collected during the foaling season may be stored for up to 12 months without signi cant bacterial contamination or structural alterations. Locking compression plate for PIPJ arthrodesis In this retrospective study Russell Sakai and colleagues in theUSA described the clinical use of a locking compression plate (LCP) for proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) arthrodesis in 29 horses and compared outcomes for horses that underwent the procedure as a treatment for fracture of the middle phalanx (P2) versus other causes. Following a review of medical records at two veterinary teaching hospitals over a 7-year period, horses that underwent PIPJ arthrodesis of one limb were identi ed. Signalment, surgical and outcome-related variables wererecorded. Owners were contacted between 1 and 6 years after surgery to determine rehabilitation time, current use of the horse, and overall owner satisfaction with the procedure. Success was determined on the basis of owner satisfaction and outcome for intended use. Variables of interest were compared statistically between horses that underwent surgery for P2 fracture versus other reasons Surgery for treatment of P2 fracture was performed on 14 horses, and osteoarthritis, subluxation, or osteochondrosis was the reason for surgery on 15 horses. Median convalescent time after surgery (with no riding or unrestricted exercise) was 7 months. Four horses were subjected to euthanasia; of the 23 known to be alive at follow-up, 22 were not lame and 18 had returned to their intended use (eight at higher and ten at lower owner-reported levels of work). Horses undergoing arthrodesis for reasons other than fracture were signi cantly more likely to return to their previous level of work. Of the 24 \u00a92019 EVJ Ltd170 doi: 10.1111/eve.13065owners who were contacted, 22 indicated satisfaction with the procedure. Surgical arthrodesis of the PIPJ was successful in most horses in this study. The authors suggest that various nuances of the system for fracture repair need to be understood prior to its use. Effect of xylazine and butorphanol on lameness In this study Ant ^onio Alcemar Beck J /C19unior and colleagues in Brazil investigated the effect of xylazine and butorphanol on experimental hindlimb lameness in of (0.3 with butorphanol (0.01 mg/kg bwt) (XBG)were given randomly to 16 adult horses. A third control group (CG) was left untreated. All horses participated in all groups. Lameness induction was performed with the placement of a circumferential metal clamp causing pressure on the hoof wall. Sedation was assessed using a descriptive physical and behavioural scale and by the head height above ground (HHAG) before the treatment (0 min) and 20, 30 and 40 min following treatment. Objective lameness evaluations were performed before sedation (after lameness induction) and at 20, 30 and 40 min post-sedation. There was no difference in pelvic asymmetry between xylazine, xylazine with butorphanol and untreated control group at the different evaluation times. Spearman 's correlation showed that there was no correlation betweenthe factors HHAG and LI. The authors concluded that xylazine alone or associated with butorphanol at the recommended doses may be used as chemical restraint to turn an anaesthetic block of the hindlimbs into a safer procedure without masking lameness intensity for at least 40 min post-administration. Osteochondral lesions In this study Eli Hendrickson and colleagues in Norway investigated the prevalence of osteochondral lesions in the fetlock and hock joints of Standardbred horses that survived bacterial infection before 6 months of age and compared this to prevalence reported in the literature. Twenty-eight Standardbred horses were included in this study; 17 males and 11 females that presented and were diagnosed clinically with bacterial infections from 1 to 150 days of age (average: 41.3 days). A screening set of eight radiographic projections was available from all horses at 7 -85 months of age (average: 23.6 months). Lesion prevalence was compared with three previously reportedStandardbred cohorts. Osteochondral lesions were detected in one or more joints of 19/28 horses (67.9%); in the fetlock joint of 14/28 horses (50%) and the hock joint of 11/28 horses (39.3%). These prevalences were 2x higher than the corresponding prevalences in the comparison cohorts, and statisticallysigni cantly so in 5:6 comparisons. In the sepsis cohort, there was an average of 2.3 affected joints and 2.5 lesions peraffected horse, whereas there was an average of 1.5 affected joints and 1.7 lesions per affected horse in the one comparable literature cohort. Standardbred horses that survived bacterial infections before 6 months of age had more osteochondral lesions than literature comparison cohorts at screening age. Theimplication was that some of the lesions in this group werecaused by bacteria. It may become necessary to develop methods for differentiating between acquired, septic and aseptic, heritably predisposed lesions. Ureteral ostioplasty This report by Andrew Jones and Claude Ragle described aminimally invasive surgical technique for ureteral ostioplasty in two llies with ureteral ectopia. Both llies, aged 3 months and 1 month, were examined because of urinary incontinence and urine scalding. In horse 1, ultrasonography did not reveal any structural abnormalitiesof the kidneys; however, unilateral ureteral ectopia was diagnosed cystoscopically. In horse 2, CT revealed bilateral nephropathy, bilateral distended ureters (up to 3.6 cm in diameter) and bilateral performed under cystoscopic guidance. Laparoscopic scissors (horse 1) or a vessel-sealing device (horse 2) was introduced, and the tissue separating the intramural portion of the ureter from the urethra and bladder was cut longitudinally in a cranial direction toward the trigone. After surgery, both horses were continent and voided normal streams of urine for the duration of the follow-up periods of 20 and 9 months for horse 1 and horse 2, respectively. In these two cases cystoscopically guided ureteral ostioplasty provided an effective and minimally invasive surgical treatment option for correction of ureteral ectopia. S.

M. Riggsand D. W. Y. Chow Veterinary Clinical Services, The Hong Kong Jockey Club, Sha Tin; andVeterinary Specialty Hospital, the use of porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM) to repair a full thickness defect in the cornea of a Thoroughbred racehorse. The horse presented with acute keratomalacia of the right eye of 12 h duration that hadrapidly progressed to perforation of the cornea with partial iris prolapse. The cornea was surgically debrided with the horse under general anaesthesia and the defect repaired with ACell multilayer wound matrix. A temporary tarsorrhaphy was performed. The defect in the cornea was successfully repaired and the horse regained vision in the eye. Four months after surgery the defect was still undergoing remodelling and the area of opacity in the cornea was progressively reducing. Introduction Corneal ulceration is well recognised in racing Thoroughbreds (Williams and Pinard 2013). Many cases are due to direct trauma caused by track material kicked up by other horses during high speed exercise (Utter and Wotman 2009). Most of the ulcers are super cial and resolve with medical therapy. However, a small proportion of corneal injuries may progressrapidly into keratomalacia, which can lead to corneal perforation and iris prolapse (Denis 2004). Loss of vision, or even the eye, is a signi cant risk in these cases. Several types of surgical graft techniques have been previously described as treatment for severe lesions of the cornea. Conjunctiva is frequently used as pedicles or isolated island grafts to cover the defect. Corneal allografting has been described to treat corneal perforations and iris prolapse in horses with some success (de Linde Henriksen et al. 2012). Various biomaterials have also been used to repair corneal injuries including amniotic membrane (Lassaline et al. 2005; Plummer 2009), submucosa of porcine small intestine (Goulle 2012) and extracellular matrix of porcine bladder (ACell Vet corneal discs) 1(Balland et al. 2016; Mancuso et al. 2016). Pedicle-based conjunctival grafts provide mechanical support to the cornea. They also provide blood supply to the site of injury and encourage early migration of broblasts, epithelial cells and diffusion of molecules with anti-protease/anti-collagenase activity to the lesion (Mancuso et al. 2016). However, conjunctiva is opaque and grafts from this tissue leavea permanent opacity. A conjunctival graft results in a signi cant, permanent reduction in the visual eld if the lesion occupies a large proportion of the cornea (Bussieres et al. 2004). Extracellular bladder matrix products (EBM) (ACell Vet corneal discs) 1are acellular and provide temporary structuralsupport and seal to the cornea. They also contain growthfactors (Balland et al. 2016; Chow and Westermeyer 2016). Extracellular bladder matrix products promote cellularproliferation and regeneration and are progressively degraded as local tissues replace the graft. This is thought to contribute to a reduction in pain and brotic scarring (Mancuso et al. 2016). ACell Vet corneal discs 1have been found to be a viable alternative to other biomaterials as potential grafts for the treatment of keratomalacia in horses (Mancuso et al. 2016). This product is commercially available and can be storedrelatively easily. However, the cornea is approximately 29.7 -34.0 mm horizontally and 23.0 -26.5 mm vertically in the adult horse (Ramsey et al. 1999) and ACell discs are only 15 mm in diameter. Therefore, this product is too small to be used to manage large corneal defects in the horse. ACell multilayer wound matrix 1is an alternative product made of the same material as ACell discs. However, it is produced inlarger sheets, measuring 10 97 cm, which makes it potentially more suitable for large corneal lesions in horses. To our knowledge, the use of ACell multilayer wound matrix 1as a primary treatment for a perforated corneal ulcer in the horse has not previously been reported. The objective of this article is to describe the use of porcine urinary bladder acellular matrix (ACell multilayer wound matrix)1as the sole treatment for surgical reconstruction of a perforated cornealulcer with iris prolapse in a horse. Case details History A 4-year-old Thoroughbred gelding racehorse was presentedfor treatment of an acute corneal ulcer and associated keratomalacia in the right eye of 12 h duration. The horse had raced the previous day. A swab of the corneal ulcer at the time of presentation was performed and cytological examination revealed Gram-positive rods. Initial treatment by the attending veterinarian consisted of light debridement of keratomalacic tissue, placement of a subpalpebral lavage tube into the lower conjunctiva 2and administration of topical antibiotics (Levo atropine6(0.5 mL every 4 h) were also administered. The eye was covered and the horse subjected to box rest and examined hourly. Despite this treatment, the keratomalacia progressed rapidly to the extent that the cornea perforated and iris prolapse occurred within 12 h ( Fig 1 10.1111/eve.12779Clinical ndings All systemic parameters were within normal limits. On ophthalmic examination the right eye was noted to have marked blepharospasm, excessive lacrimation and conjunctival hyperaemia and perforation was visible inthe centre ofthe cornea which was associated with irisincarcerated into abrin network with extensive keratomalacia present inthe peripheral cornea. The anterior chamber was hypotonic. A dazzle reflexand menace response were present intheleft eye.

The adnexa was prepared foraseptic surgery with 1:50 povidone-iodine solution, diluted with 0.9% sterile saline solution .The conjunctival fornices were prepared with 0.9% sterile saline solution applied with cotton tipped applicators. The corneal surface was flushed only with the sterile saline due tothe corneal perforation. Aretrobulbar regional nerve block was performed using 10mLmepivicaine 0.5%12.The orbital fossa was clipped and aseptically prepared. An8cm20gspinal needle was placed through the skin perpendicular needle advanced caudally tothe globe until it reached the retrobulbar orbital cone. When the needle advances tothis location, the eye has aslight dorsal movement asthe needle passes through the after samples were collected from the surface ofthe cornea and keratomalacic tissue using sterile swabs for culture and sensitivity. Apartial keratectomy was performed using Osher Universal Corneal scissors toexcise and necrotic cornea. Abrin clot lying adjacent tothe irishad plugged the corneal defect and limited the degree ofprolapse ofthe iristothe extent that itwas unnecessary toperform an iridectomy. The corneal defect was measured using Jameson calipers. The ACell multilayer wound matrix sheet was trimmed tomatch the defect, with a1mm overlap tosecure ACell sheet was laid outside up asper manufacturer 's instructions, wetted with sterile saline and sutured tothe corneal surface using 8-0braided polyglactin15910 insimple interrupted sutures placed approximately 2mm apart. A temporary tarsorrhaphy was then performed toprotect the graft from desiccation. The horse made an uneventful recovery from general anaesthesia. Post-operative care Cytology from the samples collected atsurgery revealed hyphae and Gram-positive rods. Culture results con rmed the presence offungi (Trichosporon asahii )and bacteria (Bacillus cereus) antibiotic and oxytetracycline.

The horse was subsequently losttofollow-up after it was exported from Hong Kong. Discussion This report documents anew technique forrepair ofafull thickness defect inthe cornea ofahorse 'seye. Previous studies have demonstrated thebene discs deep corneal ulceration inwhich ACell multilayer wound matrix was used asthe sole surgical treatment forcorneal reconstruction following perforation and irisprolapse. Conjunctival grafts have been used most frequently inthe surgical treatment ofsevere corneal defects, generally with good success. However, conjunctival tissue remains atthe site ofgraft, resulting inapermanent when grafts are required. Inthe current case, the extent ofthe injury was such that approximately 90% ofthe cornea was involved, which urged ustoattempt repair when lesions involve alarge area ofthe cornea aslack of structural support may result insigni cant deformation ofthe cornea. Inaddition, thesizeofthedefect inthiscase would conjunctival tissue to create apedicle graft ofsufcient size. The tectonic support that could beachieved using conjunctiva was considered inferior tothat possible using ACell (Lassaline etal.2005). The use ofporcine small intestinal submucosa in with conjunctival grafting has previously been reported inequine corneal surgery (Bussieres etal.2004) and asasole treatment cats with deep ulcerations (Goulle 2012).

However, graft rejection, resulting in graft failure and/or even greater permanent scarring has been reported as a frequent complication (Brooks et al. 2008). Equine amniotic membrane was not available at our hospital and, given that the commercially available ACell discs are 15 mm in diameter (too small for the size of the defect), multilayer wound matrix was considered the most viable alternative. The success or failure of any graft depends on correct surgical technique, the host 's immune response and extent of concurrent in flammation (Anderson et al. 2008). Other features that relate to graft success include effective migration and differentiation of the host 's cells, controlled cellular proliferation to avoid excessive scarring and a resorption pro le of the graft inversely proportional to the rate of regeneration of the host tissue (Mieszawska and Kaplan 2010) . When faced with corneal perforation and iris prolapse, the use of intracameral diluted adrenaline (Cakmak et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2016) and viscoelastic materials (Wilkie 1999) is often recommended to induce mydriasis, reduce post-operative synechiae and reduce possible haemorrhage associated with surgery. Ocular viscoelastic products and intracameral adrenaline were not used in this case. This is a potential weakness of the case management; however, despite not using these products, a good result was still achieved. Concurrent medical therapy to combat microbial infection, suppress uveitis and reduce the activation or production ofproteolytic enzymes (de Linde Henriksen et al. 2012) are critical, in addition to surgery in cases of severe corneal ulceration. Theuse of autologous serum to help to reduce proteolytic enzyme production has been well documented as it is nontoxic and contains alpha-2 macroglobulins with antiproteinase activity (Clode 2011). Atropine has been widely used to help to reduce uveitis. It is effective at stabilising the blood-aqueous barrier, reducing vascular protein leakage, reducing the chances of synechiae formation and minimising pain from ciliary muscle spasm (Brooks 2002). Systemic nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (NSAID) were used in this case to manage post-operative inflammation and pain. After epithelialisation was complete, the use of topical NSAIDs could also have been used to helpto reduce anterior uveitis, corneal pain and in flammation (Giuliano 2004) and therefore may have been of bene ti n the management of this case. Severe corneal in flammation secondary to bacterial infection has been shown to result in sudden, rapid corneal liquefaction and perforation, as was seen in this case. Pseudmonas and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, as well as fungal infections, are especially known for their involvementin severe corneal in flammation (Clode 2011). Activation and/ or production of proteolytic enzymes, corneal epithelial cells,microbial organisms and leucocytes are responsible for stromal collagenolysis (keratomalacia) (Brooks 2002). Fungal infection as a cause of corneal ulceration in our environment has not been previously seen. Given the presence of hyphae from cytology and severity of the keratomalacia, anti-fungal therapy was instigated immediately after surgery. The availability of topical anti-fungal therapy was limited to fluconazole in our hospital. Emerging resistance to fluoroquinolones is well recognised (Asbell et al. 2008). The decision to use a topicalfluoroquinolone antibiotic prior to the results of culture and sensitivity was based on the presence of Gram-positive bacteria (from cytology), severity of the keratomalacia and devastating consequences if infection became established within the globe. We chose to maintain topical antibiotic therapy after the temporary tarsorrhaphy was opened because the corneal defect had not fully epithelialised ( Fig 2 ). Fluoroquinolones have been shown to have severe cytopathological effectson corneal epithelium (Hendrix et al. 2010), which could have impaired further healing. We chose to use an aminoglycosideon the basis of results from bacterial culture and sensitivity tests; tobramycin was chosen over gentamicin because it has been shown to be less toxic to epithelial cells of the cornea than gentamicin (Hendrix et al. 2001). Slit-lamp biomicroscopy was used to determine the degree of epithelial cover. Fluorescein stain could also have been used to assess this; however, given that slit lamp biomicroscopy was performed, fluorescein was not deemed necessary. ACell multilayer wound matrix is a biomaterial derived from porcine urinary bladder matrix. It is presented in the form oflyophilised sheets, which are composed of the same material as the ACell vet discs. The sheets are loosely bonded together and measure 150 lm thick, compared with 100 lm for ACell discs. Each sheet has two faces; the lower surface is the tunica propria , an open acellular collagen matrix, which encourages the integration of connective tissue in the bed of the wound. The upper surface corresponds to the basement membrane and has a dense acellular matrix that serves as a barrier between the epithelium and other tissues (Brown et al. 2006). The packaging sets out clear instructions as to which side is which to ensure that the discs (and sheets) are used correctly; placing the basement membrane towards the ulcer would result in extrusion of the graft (Badylak et al. 2000). Extracellular bladder matrix is, by de nition, acellular. Lack of cells greatly reduces the immunogenicity of this biomaterial. In addition, the matrix is progressively reabsorbed and is eventually entirely replaced by host tissue (Badylak et al. 2000). In human medicine, urinary bladder matrix has been used successfully to reconstruct skin (Brown et al. 2006), oesophagus (Nieponice et al. 2014), myocardium (Badylak et al. 2006) and tympanic membrane (Parekh et al. 2009). In veterinary medicine it has been reported for use in corneal reconstruction in dogs and cats (Balland et al. 2016; Chow and Westermeyer 2016) and for severe ulceration withkeratomalacia in horses (Mancuso et al. 2016). Healing processes following use of grafts using porcine urinary bladder matrix have been well documented in dogs and cats (Chow and Westermeyer 2016). The incorporation of the urinary bladder matrix into the host begins with in ltration of the graft by broblasts and capillaries during the rst week. Cellular in ltration decreases in the second week and by week 8, reorganisation of collagen bres within the matrix is evident. Full integration of the graft and host tissue is complete as early as 4 months post-surgery (Badylak et al. 1989; Lantz et al. 1990; Chow and Westermeyer 2016). To our knowledge, no research has been undertaken to examine how porcine urinary bladder matrix is incorporated,speci cally within equine corneal tissue. An interesting feature of this case was that there was still evidence of signi cant, ongoing remodelling of the graft at 4 months after surgery.This may simply be due to the fact that multilayer wound \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd176 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2019matrix is thicker than ACell vet discs and incorporation of the graft into the host tissue will take longer. Alternatively, it may reflect species variation. A temporary tarsorrhaphy was used to provide physical protection to the underlying graft and cornea, as has been reported in previous studies (Mancuso et al. 2016). Research into the bene ts of using a temporary tarsorrhaphy in equine ocular surgery is limited and is often based on clinician preference. Studies in the dog and cat have demonstrated that vascularisation of A cell grafts is usually evident around the second week and that epithelialisation is usually complete by the third week (Chow and Westermeyer 2016). In contrast, in the equine case reported here, epithelialisation was still incomplete at 3 weeks. Given the protracted healing, in retrospect it may have been advantageous to leave the temporary tarsorrhaphy in situ for a longer period of time to afford greater protection to the graft during the initialinltration and collagen reorganisation phase and until epithelialisation was complete. This is only speculative andwarrants further investigation. Corneal perforation and iris prolapse are negative prognostic events that signi cantly decrease chances of saving vision and the eye. When the cornea has become perforated, aqueous humour leaks out causing narrowing or collapse of the anterior chamber, hyphaema, hypotony and anterior movement of the corpora nigra or iris into the perforation. Perforation with iris prolapse is a high risk factor for infectious endopthalmitis (de Linde Henriksen et al. 2012). bulbi, anteriorand posterior synechiae, cataract formation 2004). In one report using conjunctival grafts, the eye was saved in 67% of ulcerative keratitis cases with iris prolapse and vision restored in only 40% of cases (Chmielewski et al. 1997). Prompt surgical intervention to reconstruct the cornea and provide a suitable scaffold to retain corneal integrity isessential. Previously, most biomaterials used for repair were combined with a conjunctival graft to provide extra support. As previously discussed, conjunctival grafts must be limited to a small proportion of the overall cornea size if an adequate visual eld is to be preserved. The use of ACell multilayer wound matrix in this case resulted in a successful repair to the cornea with both ocular survival and retained vision. The graft and cornea in the immediate vicinity were still undergoing remodelling at the time the case was lost to follow-up, although we are optimistic that the proportion of cornea that clears will progressively increase. The owners retired the horse from racing voluntarily on consideration of the nancial burden associated with further prolonged rehabilitation. Under the rules of racing in HongKong, horses must be compulsorily retired if they lose vision in one eye. Given the positive trend in the healing of this case we are con dent that vision would have been restored sufciently to avoid this outcome. The follow-up of clinical cases in veterinary practice is often limited by nancial and practical constraints. There were several procedures that could have been undertaken in the current case that may have improved our ability to judge progress. Assessment of the anterior chamber waslimited by the corneal opacity and an ultrasound may have been helpful to evaluate structures within the globe. This wasnot performed due to concern over damaging the graft during the procedure. However, ultrasound has been shown to be a very useful addition to ocular diagnostics and this would have been bene cial to assess the lens, fundus, presence of cataracts, depth of anterior chamber and degree of flare present (Gelatt et al. 2013) during the recovery period. Intraocular pressure was not monitored in this horse due to tonometry being unavailable at the hospital. The onset ofglaucoma is a known serious complication of in flammatory ocular disease (Annear et al. 2012) and ideally this would have been monitored throughout the horse 's recovery. Further limitations of this report are that it describes just a single case. However, given the successful outcome after using ACell multilayer wound matrix to repair an extensive perforated corneal ulcer, with iris prolapse and signi cant keratomalacia affecting up to 90% of the corneal surface,further investigation of this technique is warranted.

Greenberg* Ophthalmology, New England Veterinary Center and Cancer Care, Windsor, As working animals and/or animals that spend a lot of time out of doors, horses are at risk of developing catastrophic corneal disease, including corneal ulceration, keratomalacia and corneal perforation with or without iris prolapse. These conditions not only cause discomfort but depending on the degree of severity, can lead to signi cant visual impairment. It is often possible for corneal disease to be managed medically,especially when caught early and treated appropriately (Fig 1a -c). For cases that do not respond to medical therapy, worsen in the face of medical therapy, or present at a stagetoo severe for medical therapy alone to address, surgical intervention is indicated. Many surgical techniques have been described for ocular surface reconstruction in horses. The goal with any of these procedures is to provide a comfortable eyethat maintains as close to normal function as possible. In general, these procedures require specialised microsurgical technique and the use of an operating microscope, with the patient under general anaesthesia. Ulcerative keratitis and keratomalacia in horses: initial assessment and medical management The article by Davis et al. (2019) in this issue describes the medical management and surgical repair of keratomalacia and iris prolapse in a horse, using porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM= Acell). The horse initially presented to his referring veterinarian after developing an acute corneal ulcer post- racing. The ulcer was malacic and within 12 h, had progressed to an iris prolapse. In the healthy cornea, proteolytic enzymes help to maintain normal metabolism. This enzymatic activity is regulated by naturally occurring protease inhibitors, which minimise the breakdown of healthy tissue (Ollivier et al. 2007). Keratomalacia, or \"corneal melting \", is the pathologic process of stromal collagen destruction ( Fig 2a -d). Malacia occurs secondary to excessive protease mainly the such as neutrophil conjunction with the loss of normal enzymatic inhibition (Clode 2011). This process can occur secondary to bacterial or fungal infection, both of which were present in this case, or it can occur in cases of sterile corneal ulceration, initiated by upregulation of proteases from keratocytes, inflammatory cells or the precorneal tear lm. As highlighted in this case report, malacia can progress rapidly within 24 h, andnecessitates immediate, aggressive medical (and sometimes surgical) intervention. Initial steps to consider when a horse presents with a corneal ulcer include assessment of the degree of severity ofthe ulcer as well as the presence or absence of malacia, examination for an inciting cause such as a foreign body, assessment of vision and degree of anterior uveitis, evaluation for the presence of infection, and the initiation of medical therapy. Complete ophthalmic examination should be performed, utilising a slit lamp or direct ophthalmoscope to examine the cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens. If not obscured by anterior segment opacity, the fundus should also be assessed via direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy. The presence of re flexes including the dazzle re flex, direct and consensual pupillary light re flex, as well as the menace response should be evaluated to determine if vision, or the potential for vision is present. Bacterial and fungal ulcerative keratitis is quite common in horses. The most frequently reported bacterial isolates from equine corneal ulcers include Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Pseudomonas spp., although many other pathogenic beenreported (Sauer et al. 2003) ( Fig 3a -b). most commonly include spp. Fusarium spp. (Andrew et al. 1998) ( Fig 4a -d). Diagnostic testing for infection includes cytology and Gram stain, as well asaerobic bacterial and fungal culture. While waiting on the results of diagnostic testing, empirical medical therapy should be initiated. This therapy includes topical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals, along with a topical protease inhibitor. Topical antibiotic therapy for an infected ulcer should for Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Cephalosporins, bacitracin, neomycin, chloramphenicol and fluoroquinolones Gram-positive infections, while aminoglycosides, neomycin, polymyxin B and fluoroquinolones are effective against Gram-negative organisms (Clode 2011). Due to growing resistance patterns, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for ulcers with the con rmed presence of bacterial infection. An example of appropriate initial topical antibiotictherapy for an infected ulcer may consist of compounded cefazolin or a triple antibiotic solution or ointment, along with tobramycin. Anticollagenase therapy most commonly consists of autologous serum, which inhibits both MMPs and serine proteases (Ollivier et al. 2007). Depending on the degree of malacia, additional antiprotease therapy may be employed,including topical N-acetylcysteine and edetate disodium (EDTA), as well as tetracyclines, all of which inhibit MMPs via zinc and calcium chelation. Oral doxycycline has been shown to reach the preocular tear lm in horses at a dose of 20 mg/kg bwt per day (Baker et al. 2008). Oral minocycline was also recently evaluated for possible systemic treatment of keratomalacia, and while it was shown to reach the preocular tear lm, it was not shown 10.1111/eve.12808looked at in anticollagenase therapy antifungal therapy typically consists ofdrugs from the azole class such asvoriconazole and itraconazole, the the polyenes including natamycin drugs are typically 2-4h.Oral fluconazole isalso sometimes employed for fungal keratitis, bysubsequent daily doses of5mg/kg bwt (Gilger 2013). It is critical that topical corticosteroids be avoided incases ofcorneal ulceration. These medications delay corneal wound healing, and also increase the riskof infection due toeffects onlocal host immunity. Topical atropine may also beadministered totreat reflexuveitis. This drug induces cycloplegia and helps with pain control, it decreases theriskforthedevelo pment ofsynechia, and helps tostabilise flammatory medication such with discomfort and inflammation, and inthecase ofcornealperforation, broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics should also beinitiated. Ease ofadministration oftopical therapy can be improved via the placement of a subpalpebral lavage system, and thehorse should also self-trauma. and surgical considerations Horses with stromal ulcers and/or keratomalacia must be monitored frequently; these eyes should bereassessed every a) b) c) Fig1:Anexample ofamelting corneal ulcer that post-initiation oftherapy, c)healed invarying degrees of severity. \u00a92017 EVJLtd180 EQUINE VETERINARY / AE / APRIL 201912-24hafter diagnosis and initiation ofmedical therapy. In cases ofstromal ulceration with greater than 50% uveitis, orcorneal perforation surgical intervention is indicated tostabilise the ocular surface. The ideal surgical repair should bring tectonic support tothewound atitheals, improve comfort and improve corneal clarity. Described procedures forcorneal repair include conjunctival grafts, corneoconjunctival orcorneoscleral urinary bladder matrix (UBM), amniotic membrane transplants and porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS). The corneal trauma inthis case was reported to encompass 90% ofthecornea, which leaves limited surgical options This biomaterial isacellular, and therefore should incite minimal host immune response; itbrings tectonic support tothelesion, and EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2019commonly utilised in combination with other surgical procedures such as conjunctival grafts (Dorbandt et al. 2015). It is also sometimes used in cases of deep lamellar endothelialkeratoplasty or posterior lamellar keratoplasty, to replace diseased cornea once it has been removed (Clode 2011). UBM can also be used as a sole therapy, as has been reported in dogs and cats with varying degrees of ulcerative keratitis, including corneal perforation (Balland et al. 2016; Chow and Westermeyer 2016) and in horses with partial thickness ulcerative keratitis (Mancuso et al. 2016). It is eventually degraded and replaced with host tissue; when used as a soletherapy this may be associated with less post-operative discomfort and corneal scarring, although further studies are necessary to support these claims. Of the studies presented by Mancuso et al. (2016), Chow and Westermeyer (2016) and Balland et al. (2016), the overall success rate for the use of UBM alone in ulcerative keratitis was >80%, in terms of the retention of a comfortable and visual eye. Reported complicationsassociated with the use of UBM alone included graft dehiscence, and graft failure particularly in cases of corneal perforation, which sometimes necessitated a second surgical procedure or enucleation. General anaesthesia is always an inherent concern when surgery is to be pursued, especially with large animal patients such as horses. Minimising the amount of time that a horse must be anaesthetised, in lateral recumbency, is of utmost importance. This case report describes the use of a multilayer Acell graft to treat keratomalacia and a full thickness corneal perforation. Whilefurther studies are necessary, this technique is an attractive one to consider, as it signi cantly decreases anaesthesia time when compared to combined techniques of Acell or SIS with aconjunctival graft. It is also less technically challenging than some of the more advanced corneal transplantation techniques. Future studies comparing visual outcome and corneal clarity in corneal perforation cases treated with Acell alone versus other more established techniques are warranted.

Adami Department of Clinical Sciences and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hat eld, Hertfordshire, UK. *Corresponding No published reports on the occurrence of Mendelson 's syndrome (pneumonitis caused by aspiration during anaesthesia) in horses were found in the literature. Although the peculiar anatomy of the equine stomach makes horsesless prone than other species to regurgitate, gastric re flux may still occur in horses with colic under certain circumstances. The colic horses in this report had in common stomach impaction, abdominal distention and preanaesthetic placement of a nasogastric tube, which was not withdrawn prior to induction. In both cases, a signi cant volume of gastric re flux was noted pouring from the endotracheal tube during general anaesthesia for exploratory laparotomy. It was hypothesised that the cause of gastric re flux was the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and patency of the cardia, and that inhalation of gastric content occurred at induction, before tracheal intubation. Treatment, which failed to improve oxygenation, consisted of repositioning of the horses to facilitate passive drainage of gastric content from the airways, active suction through the endotracheal tubes, ventilation strategies, improvement of haemodynamics to increase the pulmonary perfusion, and administration of bronchodilators. One horse was subjected to euthanasia owing to poor prognosis. Aspiration pneumonitis should be regarded as a life-threatening, although rare, perianaesthetic complication in equine colic cases. Patency of the cardia and increased intra-abdominal pressure are possible predisposing factors. Partial or even total withdrawal of the nasogastric tube prior to anaesthetic induction and tracheal intubation performed with the horse positioned in sternal recumbency may be undertaken as preventive measures in patients at high risk of developing Mendelson 's syndrome. Introduction Aspiration of gastric content is a life-threatening complication that has been described in ruminants (Shakespeare 2012) and man (Mendelson 1946), and also experimentally reproduced in various animal models (Zucker et al. 1992; Fraisse et al. 2007; Richter et al. 2013). Its clinical manifestation in human patients is known as Mendelson 's syndrome. The unique conformation of the equine cardia (Budras and Henschel 2008) makes the occurrence of Mendelson 's syndrome less likely in horses than in other species. However, certain underlying gastrointestinal conditions, as well asveterinary interventions, may alter the anatomy and could act as predisposing factors (Carpenter and Hall 1981). This report describes aspiration pneumonitis in two horses. The pathophysiology, the treatment options and the possible preventive measures are discussed. Case 1 A 9-year-old male Andalusian horse was referred for signs of colic. Bodyweight and body condition score were 510 kg and 5/9, respectively. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 58 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, rectal temperature of 37.4 \u00b0C, absent borborygmi in all quadrants and mild abdominal distension. Chest auscultationand scrotal examination were unremarkable. Blood results revealed increased total solids (80 g/L; reference interval: 55 - 75 g/L). Nasogastric intubation yielded 11 L of re flux. Absence of peristalsis and small intestine distension were con rmed by rectal examination and ultrasonography. Anaesthesia was requested to perform exploratory laparotomy. An American Society of Anesthesiologists categoryof 4E was assigned. Preanaesthetic therapy consisted of 2 L of 7.2% hypertonic saline (Vetivex 20 1), 5 L of a balanced electrolyte solution (Vetivex 111), administered i.v. over 20 nasogastric left place and stoppered prior to induction. Endotracheal (ET) intubation was easily accomplished with a 28 size ET tube (ETT), then cuffed with a syringe to ensure air-tight seal. The horse was transported from the induction box to the surgery table by an overhead gantry crane; once in theatre it was positioned in dorsal recumbency and the ETT was connected to a circle breathing system to deliver iso flurane (IsoFlo6; end-tidal concentrations: monitoringwas performed a and included electrocardiography, capnography, pulse oximetry,spirometry, invasive blood pressure measurement and arterial blood gas analysis (VetScan i-STAT 1 8). Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was initiated with a peak inspiratorypressure between 20 and 25 cm H 2O and a tidal volume of 6 L. The lack of a hissing sound at the beginning of IPPV was interpreted as a con rmation of appropriate air-tight seal of the ETT cuff. Lidocaine (Lidocaine Injection9) was administered as a constant rate infusion 50 lg/kg/min) and a balanced \u00a92017 doi: 10.1111/eve.12781electrolyte solution was infused at rate of 5 mL/kg bwt/h. Before an indwelling arterial catheter could be placed, poor peripheral pulse quality was noted and treated with a CRI of dobutamine (Dobutamine10;1-2lg/kg bwt/min). During anaesthesia, arterial blood pressure remained within the normalranges for the species; however, the heart rate was persistently high (46 -78 beats/min) and did not change after administration of colloids (Gelofusin 9; 1.5 L). A couple of minutes after the beginning of IPPV, gastric content was noticed within the ETT lumen. The horse was placed in the Trendelenburg position to facilitate passive drainage of the aspirate. The latter was collected in a bucket and its estimated volume was 6 L. Active suction was attempted from the ETT but did not result in the drainage of further fluids from the airways. Arterial oxygen saturation, as detected by the pulse-oximeter (SpO 2), remained above 98% during the rst 40 min of the anaesthetic, to subsequently decrease to 84%. Analysis of an arterial bloodsample collected at this time con rmed hypoxaemia with arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) of 29 mmHg, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO aerosol (2 lg/ kg bwt) was administered via ETT and repeated 10 min later(1lg/kg bwt) without improvement. The inspired fraction of oxygen was increased to 1. Additionally, recruitmentmanoeuvres, consisting of three consecutive breaths, with a peak inspiratory pressure of 60, 80 and 60 cm H 2O, manually given and held for 10 s, were attempted, and repeated threetimes throughout the anaesthetic. Arterial blood gas analysis performed after the rst recruitment manoeuvre revealed only mild improvements inPaO 2and SaO 2, which increased to 40 mmHg and 65%, respectively. Arterial blood gases were repeatedly monitoredduring the anaesthetic ( Table 1 ), and revealed persistent hypoxaemia despite aggressive treatment. Hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia were also detected, and treated (KCl, 28 mEq/L at 2 -3 mL/kg bwt/h, and calcium entrapped jejunum. Jejuno-jejunostomy and castration were performed. recovery (both head and tail) was performed; post-operative sedation was not administered. Phenylephrine 12was nasal oedema. Severe respiratory distress characterised by increased inspiratory and expiratory efforts was observed before tracheal extubation. Oxygen was supplemented via the ETT (10 L/min), which was removed after swallowing,10 min after discontinuation of inhalational anaesthesia. At thispoint, nasal oxygen was supplied. Standing occurred 90 min after moving to the recovery box, and recovery was classi ed as poor. Fifteen min after standing, mild signs of colic weredetected. Physical examination identi ed a heart rate of 80 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 60 breaths/min rmed the diagnosis of pulmonary oedema. Arterial blood gas analysis was consistent with severe hypoxaemia (PaO 2 24 mmHg), which did not resolve despite the administration of 2 mg/kg bwt of i.v. after 2 h, and intranasal oxygen (4 -6L / min). Broad spectrum antimicrobials were administered as partof the medical treatment. The horse deteriorated further within the next hour, showing progressive severe respiratory distress and open-mouth breathing, and euthanasia was performed. Case 2 A 14-year-old, female French Warmblood horse weighing 530 kg was presented with acute abdominal pain. The referring veterinarian had previously sedated the horse with an unknown dose of detomidine (Domosedan13), to facilitate handling and transport to the hospital, and administered an unknown amountof i.v. crystalloids. At physical examination, the heart rate was 40 beats/min, the respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, and the rectal temperature was 37 \u00b0C. Capillary re ll time was >3 s and mucous membranes were pale and dry. Thoracic auscultation was unremarkable. Preanaesthetic haematology and blood biochemistry revealed decreased packed cell volume (33%; reference interval: 34 -45%) and red blood cells (17.8% distribution width; interval: -67%). At abdominal auscultation, borborygmi were decreased. Rectal examination and ultrasonographyrevealed marked, generalised large intestinal distention and mild peritoneal effusion, as well as a 270 \u00b0volvulus of the colon. General anaesthesia was requested forexploratory laparotomy. Preanaesthetic preparation included administration of i.v. fluids (2 L of hypertonic saline 7.2% and 5 L of a balanced electrolyte solution) and insertion of anasogastric tube, which was stoppered during induction and then left in place until recovery from anaesthesia. An American Society of Anesthesiologists category of 4E was assigned.

ND, not determined, Et, end-tidal (Narketan16; 2.2 mg/kg bwt). A 24 size ETT was inserted in the trachea and cuffed with a syringe with the horse still in lateral recumbency; thereafter, the patient was transported to theatre by an overhead crane system, and positioned in dorsal recumbency on the surgery table. The ETT was connected to a circle breathing system, iso flurane (end tidal concentration: 1.0 -1.2%) was delivered in a mixture of air/ oxygen (0.5/0.5) and IPPV initiated. Monitoring and lidocaine infusion were the same as described for Case 1. Immediately after initiation of IPPV, a large volume of gastric content was noticed within the ETT lumen which poured out into the hoses of the breathing system. The latter was disconnected from the ETT and the Trendelenburg position was used to allow drainage of the fluid from the airways. Active suction through the ETT was also attempted but failed to collect further volumes ofaspirate. Although SpO 2had remained within physiological ranges for the rst 20 min of anaesthesia, it then decreased progressively (83 -90%). Arterial blood gas analysis con rmed the accuracy of the low pulse-oximeter reading, andrevealed a decreased SaO 2and PaO 2(80% and 50 mmHg, respectively; Table 1 ). Positive end-expiratory pressure of 5c m H 2O was applied and the minute ventilation was increased from 60 to 80 mL/kg bwt. The inspired fraction of oxygen was increased to 1. Additionally, dobutamine (1 - 2lg/kg bwt/min) and fluids (20 L of Hartmann 's solution and 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch) were infused to improve cardiac output and blood and tissue oxygenation. Although normotension was maintained and the heart rate stayed within physiological ranges for the species, hypoxaemia persisted ( Table 1 ). At the end of anaesthesia, which lasted 110 min, topical phenylephrine was administered intranasally and the horse was transferred through a crane system to the recovery box, where it was positioned in left lateral recumbency. Oxygen supplementation was provided via insuf flation into the ETT (10 L/min) until extubation, performed swallowing, andafter that via nasal flation (10 L/min) until the horse achieved sternal recumbency (40 min after extubation).Recovery was poor, characterised by three attempts to stand up, moderate respiratory distress and ataxia. Standing was recorded 2 h after extubation and a recovery score of 2/5 was assigned. As soon as the horse was able to walk, it was transferred to the intensive care unit of the hospital. Thoracic auscultation performed after standing revealed the presence of bilateral crackles. Humidi ed oxygen was supplemented via nasal route (6 L/min) for the next broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The respiratory distress resolved gradually during the following 3 days, and the horse was discharged from the hospital one week after surgery. Discussion These two reports focus on aspiration pneumonitis, a potentially fatal perianaesthetic complication in equine colic cases.Aspiration, de ned as the inhalation of gastric content into larynx and lower airways (Marik 2001), has been recognised as an independent risk factor for the development of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Raghavendran et al. 2011). Anatomical peculiarities of the equine gastrointestinal system, namely thewell-developed cardiac sphincter and acutely angled implantation of the oesophagus within the gastric wall, make retrograde peristalsis, spontaneous pressure release and, therefore, regurgitation, unlikely in horses (Budras and Henschel 2008). For these reasons, aspiration of gastric content is commonly regarded as the least likely differential diagnosis of perioperative hypoxaemia in horses. Perianaesthetic regurgitation of gastric content has been described in 1945 by Curtis Mendelson as a serious complication of general anaesthesia in pregnant women (Mendelson 1946). After 70 years, and despite the continuous developments in human anaesthesia, aspiration is still one of the most feared complications, with an incidence of 1 in 3000 in anaesthetised adults and 1 in 400 -900 during caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia (Rawlinsonand Minchom 2007). The delayed gastric emptying in pregnant women, together with the increased gastric pressure caused by the enlarged uterus, are at the origin of this high incidence (Flood and Rollins 2015). Similar conditions, even if associated to a different pathophysiology, also occur in horses with colic, where the intra-abdominal pressure can be increased and gastric lling likely. Aspiration pneumonitis, also called Mendelson 's syndrome, refers to the chemical injury of the alveoli caused by the inhalation of acidic gastric content and comprises three separate phases. The early insult is the chemical burn. It takes place within the rst 5 s after aspiration and results in severe parenchymal in flammatory reaction and bronchospasm (Marik 2001; Rawlinson and Minchom 2007). Within 2 h, damage of the alveolar membrane follows, with loss of ciliated and nonciliated cells as well as of type II pneumocytes. Animal models show that hypoxaemia can only be detected at this stage, approximately 60 min after aspiration, when the breakdown of the alveolar barrier becomes evident (Fraisse et al. 2007). This is also consistent with the ndings reported here, as PaO 2and SaO 2 signi cantly decreased approximately 1 h after anaesthetic induction. Systemic in flammatory response, characterised of cytokines and proin flammatory mediators and, eventually, complement activation, only occurs at a later stage, about 4 -6 h after aspiration (Raghavendran et al. 2011). These events lead to loss of vascular integrity and extravasation of fluids and protein into the alveoli. Clinically, cases show acute respiratory distress due to bronchospasm and increased airways 'resistance, pulmonary oedema, and impairment of gas exchange (Raghavendran et al. 2011). The systemic inflammatory response may have dramatic sequelae such as ARDS and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Rawlinsonand Minchom 2007). Murine and canine animal models showed that the aspiration of 0.3 mL/kg bwt of gastric content is enough to trigger aspiration pneumonitis (Mendelson 1946; Exarhos et al. 1965; James et al. 1984), and that pH values between 2.5 and 5.9 can cause signi cant damage of the canine alveolar barrier (Exarhos et al. 1965). The equine physiological gastric pH ranges between 3.70 and 4.92 (Husted et al. 2009) and, although to the authors ' \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd185 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2019knowledge, the gastrointestinal pH of horses with colic has not been reported, starving and decreased food intake were found to lower the gastric pH below 4.0 (Husted et al. 2009). Aspiration pneumonia differs from pneumonitis as it is an infectious process, which may or may not follow aspiration, caused by bacterial colonisation of the inhaled gastric re flux. Although the gastric content of mammalians is usually regarded as sterile, there is a risk of bacterial contamination, especially after passage of a nasogastric tube. The severity of the clinical signs depends on pH, physical characteristics and volume of the aspirate, as well as on patient 's sensitivity and immune response (Rawlinson and Minchom 2007), and evenseverity of the aspiration-induced lung injury (Rotta et al. 2004). Typically, bacterial pneumonia can only be detected 48 hafter aspiration, when clinical and radiographic signs become evident (Raghavendran et al. 2011). Although horses have unique anatomical features that make gastric re flux unlikely, certain underlying conditions, as well as veterinary interventions, can act as predisposing factors. Endotracheal intubation, as an example, is most commonly accomplished with the anaesthetised horse in lateral recumbency. When the horse is in right-sided recumbency, the head is lower than the stomach, which makes passive regurgitation -and consequently aspiration - more likely to occur. The risk is even higher when the nasogastric tube is left in place during induction and keeps the cardia patent. Moreover, the abdominal distention andthe possibly increased intragastric pressure may be exacerbated during induction in horses with colic, because of the impact of the ventral abdominal wall with the floor. In the authors 'opinion, regurgitation and aspiration occurred in the horses of this report at induction, probably when the animals became recumbent, but before the trachea was intubated. Although re flux was not seen between induction and intubation, and despite the fact that anincomplete seal between the tracheal wall and the ETT cannot be excluded, it is unlikely that the horses aspirated after intubation, since the cuffs of the ETTs were in flated immediately after placement and hissing noises and volume losses from the delivery system, which would indicate a leakage, would not be detected after initiation of IPPV. Performing intubation in sternal recumbency might prevent gastric re flux to reach the larynx before the airways can be secured. The placement of a nasogastric tube is an important component of the medical management of horses withcolic, since the release the intragastric pressure is crucial to prevent a fatal stomach rupture (Win eld and Dechant 2015). Removing the tube prior to anaesthesia is regarded asundesirable by many equine clinicians, as reinserting it with the horse in dorsal recumbency can be technically challenging. However, the tube does keep the cardia patent, thus overcoming the 'sphincter safety mechanism ' (Budras and Henschel 2008). Therefore, as additionalpreventive measures, emptying the stomach immediately before induction and then withdrawing the nasogastric tube might help to avoid passive regurgitation. In man, treatment of aspiration involves positioning the patient in left lateral recumbency with the head lowered at a 30\u00b0angle -which seems rather inapplicable to equine cases -and airways active suction followed by IPPV with oxygen enriched- flow, once a patent airway has been established (Rawlinson and Minchom 2007). Whilst in human medicinesteroids are no longer recommended, the use of broad- spectrum antimicrobials to prevent the development of bacterial pneumonia is still debatable (Raghavendran et al. 2011). Nebulised bronchodilators can be used to release bronchospasm if present (Raghavendran et al. 2011). Nevertheless, the use of salbutamol in these two horses did not improve oxygenation. Regarding IPPV, in human medicine, conservative ventilation is regarded as lung- protective and is recommended in the unfortunate event of ARDS or whenever there is an increased risk of ARDS (Raghavendran et al. 2011). However, positive end-expiratory pressure and alveolar recruitment manoeuvres, althoughinvasive, have been advocated in equine improve inadequate oxygenation (Hopster et al. 2011; Moens 2013). Mechanical ventilation may be particularly useful in the event of aspiration, not only to improve gas exchange (Desai and Agrawal 2012), but also to decrease the re flux volume by drying out its aqueous component, through contact withcontinuous fresh gas flow. However, IPPV may also contribute to disseminate fluids and particulate matters into the deepest areas of the lungs. Interestingly, in both horses, the re flux could be detected at the ETT only after IPPV was initiated. One possible explanation is that mechanical ventilation allowed the gas flow to reach the deepest, dependent areas of the lungs, where the re flux might have accumulated following a deep breath during induction. Case 1 had persistent, fluid-unresponsive tachycardia in the presence of normal blood pressure values. Although the contribution of other factors such as pain, hypovolaemia, endotoxaemia and underlying cardiac conditions cannot be excluded, it is possible that tachycardia was a sequel of aspiration in this horse. It has been demonstrated that human patients suffering from Mendelson 's syndrome often show tachycardia and haemodynamic instability (Rawlinson andMinchom 2007). This was found also by other studies investigating the effects of gastric aspiration in rabbits and pigs, which identi ed hypoxaemia, pulmonary hypertension, reflux-induced lung injury, and SIRS with associated vasoplegia and decreased heart contractility as common features (Fraisse et al. 2007; Heuer et al. 2012). The decision to remove the ETT when Case 1 swallowed despite the presence of respiratory distress was based on evaluation of the available options. Severe nasal oedema, a possible cause of pulmonary oedema in equine patients through decreased patency of the upper airways, was deemed unlikely based on the detection of adequate bilateral flow from the nares after the ETT cuff was defl ated. Although upper airway obstruction could not be entirely excluded, in thisscenario maintaining the ETT in place would have been particularly useful in the perspective of initiating long-term ventilation in the recovery box. This option was not considered for safety reasons, and because to the best of the authors ' knowledge there are no published reports describing long-termventilation in standing horses. Finally, higher flow rates could have been used in both horses for nasal/via ETT post-operativeO 2supplementation to improve arterial oxygenation (Mason et al. 1987); unfortunately, the available flowmeter could deliver only a maximum flow of 10 L/min. The true incidence of Mendelson 's syndrome in horses is unknown. Although aspiration pneumonitis seems to be a rareperianaesthetic complication in this species, it can have \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd186 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2019catastrophic consequences, including death, increased cost for post-operative intensive care and decreased performance owing to the development of chronic lung disease. Preventive measures to forestall a fatal outcome could include intubation in sternal recumbency, emptying of the stomach shortly before the anaesthetic and partial withdrawing of the nasogastric tube prior to induction of anaesthesia.

Senior Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital, University in this issue by Monticelli and Adami describes two cases of aspiration pneumonitis (Monticelli and Adami 2019). It is a condition well recognised in human patients (Engelhardt and Webster 1999; Marik 2001) and aspiration of gastro-oesophageal re flux associated with anaesthesia has been reported in other veterinary species (Kogan et al. 2008; Obvey et al. 2014). It has not previously been reported in horses. This case report highlights another potential complication in anaesthetising the emergency colic case and discusses the best way to minimise respiratory complications secondary to the presence of nasogastric (NG) re flux in the perioperative period. Prompt recognition of hypoxaemia andthe presence of re flux within the endotracheal tube are key events which should lead to a presumption of the likelihood of aspiration pneumonitis while under general anaesthesia. In the two reported cases, once aspiration of gastric contents had occurred, treatment was challenging and success was limited. Guidelines (BMJ Best Practice Guidelines, 2017) for treating aspiration in human patients includes suctioning of the oropharynx, tilting to a head up position, bronchoscopy and suctioning within a few hours of the incident. Positive end- expiratory pressure and positive-pressure ventilation are not recommended until endotracheal suctioning is performed . Many of these treatments are currently impractical in thehorse. As this protocol would not be appropriate in horses, we need to consider methods of reducing the risk of aspiration. Clearly, prevention of aspiration pneumonitis caused by gastric contents is preferable to being faced with having to treat this complication. Anaesthetic risk and nasogastric intubation It is well recognised that anaesthesia for colic surgery carries signi cant risk. CEPEF-1 and 2 showed anaesthesia for colic surgery had a greater mortality rate of approximately 7.9%compared with 0.9% for healthy horses (Johnston et al. 2002). Smaller, single-centre studies have reported similar mortalityrates for anaesthesia in colic cases (Hodgson and Dunlop 1990; Young and Taylor 1993; Mee et al. 1998; Bidwell et al. 2004). Complications following general anaesthesia for colicsurgery are varied but there is little data regarding respiratory complications in the perioperative period for colic cases. Nasogastric intubation is technically easy to perform and is generally well tolerated by most horses. Reports regarding complications of NG intubation in horses are rare and are limited to trauma of the oesophagus and pharynx (Hardy et al. 1992). Epistaxis can occur secondary to NG intubation but is usually self-limiting. To our knowledge, this case report is the rst report of aspiration pneumonitis in colic cases, although it may be that this condition is under-reported. Thecase report by Monticelli and Adami (2019) raises the question of how to best manage the risk of gastric re flux in the perioperative period to reduce morbidity and mortalitydue to aspiration in colic cases. Risk factors for aspiration The risk for aspiration of gastric contents in horses is generally considered to be lower than human patients or many other veterinary species due to equine gastric anatomy (Budrasand Henschel 2008). The risk factors for aspiration hypothesised by Monticelli and Adami include gastric impaction, abdominal distention and the presence of an indwelling NG throughout the induction and maintenance phases of anaesthesia. Gastric impaction Transabdominal ultrasonography of the stomach may be useful in assessing gastric distention or impaction. It is, however, subjective and there is confl icting evidence of the sensitivity and repeatability of this method (Lores et al. 2007; Le Jeune and Whitcomb 2014). A rapid ultrasonographic scanning technique which can be employed during investigation, known as fast localised abdominal ultrasonography of horses(FLASH) scanning, also has potential to help identify cases where gastric distention is present while helping with decision making as to whether surgery may be required (Busoni et al. 2011; Naylor 2015). This may also help quickly identify horses where passage of a NG tube is bene cial. Abdominal distention Abdominal distention is often assessed subjectively in cases with an acute abdominal emergency. Transabdominal ultrasonography has value in the diagnosis of tympany and gaseous distention of the small intestine (Freeman 2003). Percutaneous trocharisation of the large colon or caecumcan be undertaken to relieve gaseous distention in cases which have been identi ed on palpation per rectum. This is not without risk and should not be performed in cases wheresurgery is an option, whenever possible (Rowe 2008). Presence of an indwelling NG tube throughout the induction and maintenance phases of anaesthesia Reflux, either spontaneous or a positive yield on the passage of a NG tube, occurs in 13% of the horses presented to the Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital for investigation of acute colic (Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital Colic Database). \u00a92017 doi: 10.1111/eve.12818Proudman et al. (2006) found that the presence of NG re flux was not associated with intraoperative death in colic cases. Such cases can provide challenges on how to best protect the airway during the perioperative period. During induction of anaesthesia with ketamine, laryngeal and pharyngeal re flexes are usually maintained but the cough re flex is abolished (Lin et al. 2015), so it is challenging to know if aspiration has occurred immediately after anaesthesia is induced. Prompt intubation with an appropriate sized endotracheal tube and in flation of the cuff to provide an airtight seal is vital to protect the airway.Intubation of the horse 's trachea while the horse is in sternal recumbency is also advocated (Donaldson 2009), but thiscan be challenging in many cases when inductions can be difcult to control, especially in painful horses or when practical or staf ng limitations preclude. Some authors advise maintaining a NG tube in situ throughout the induction and maintenance phase ofanaesthesia to encourage passive drainage of gastric contents (Doherty and Valverde 2006). Whether leaving a NG tube in place in a re fluxing horse for anaesthesia is bene cial in protecting the airway is not clear. The premise is that anin situ NG tube may allow gastric fluid to drain via a low pressure outlet but we know of no evidence of this to date. In our experience, the presence of an in situ NG tube during induction and maintenance of anaesthesia promotes passage of gastric contents along the outside of the tube as well as, or instead of, down the lumen of the tube, aspresumably the tube does not always form a seal with the oesophageal sphincter and so the low pressure outlet can be into the oesophagus itself. The other two options discussed in this case report are to remove the tube entirely prior to induction or partially withdraw the tube to sit proximal to the oesophageal sphincter. The advantage of complete removal of the NG tube is that there is no risk of the tube itself facilitating movement of gastric contents into the oesophagus. The disadvantage is that if it is subsequently considered necessary to place an NG tube, placement of an NG tube in a dorsally recumbent horse is dif cult. Partially withdrawing a tube has the advantages of keeping the tube nearly in situ but avoids producing a poorly sealed low pressure release through the oesophageal sphincter. The disadvantages with partially withdrawing the NG tube are that it is dif cult to be certain to the accuracy of the siting of the tube without the use of endoscopy, and additionally, theNG tube may move distally through the oesophageal sphincter during induction or placing the horse on the operating table. Current practice in our clinic is to attempt to remove as much re flux from the stomach as possible prior to induction of a colic case with recognised re flux before removing the tube prior to induction of anaesthesia. The exceptions to this practice are those cases where it is anticipated that gastric lavage may be required during surgery, e.g. gastric impactions. To our knowledge, there is no recent evidence of the advantage of any one of the three NG tube approaches (NG tube in situ throughout anaesthesia, removed prior to induction or partially withdrawn prior to induction) to protecting against aspiration pneumonitis caused by gastric contents in a surgical colic case with recognised re flux, over any of the others. This case report might promote a discussion of which approach each clinician/clinic adopts, but that discussion should at least now include the evidence of thiscase report that leaving NG tube in situ can still result in aspiration pneumonitis. Potential ways forward Reports focusing on the incidence of oesophageal re flux and aspiration of gastric contents are lacking in horses, therefore evidence informing the best course of action in dealing with potential NG re flux in the perianaesthetic period is needed. The options regarding NG intubation are to leave the tube in situ for anaesthesia, partially withdraw it into the oesophagus or to remove it entirely. We have found that when NG tubes are left in situ during anaesthesia, it is common for re flux to drain around the tube. It is our opinion that this may increase the risk of aspiration. Partially withdrawing the tube into the oesophagus may reduce the risk of aspiration; however, it is dif cult to determine exactly where the end of the tube is positioned inrelation to the gastric cardia. The challenges present when anaesthetising a colic case are numerous, but sudden onset hypoxaemia with the presence of gastric fluid within the endotracheal tubes and breathing system of the anaesthetic machine should highlight the possiblediagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis in horses. Protecting the airway during induction of general anaesthesia and during intubation for the delivery of anaesthetic gases is key to prevent the condition developing and aggressive therapies to treat hypoxaemia should be undertaken without delay. The case report suggests risk factors for the development of aspiration pneumonitis. Since gastric impaction or abdominal distention cannot be treated quickly prior to anaesthesia in the acute abdomen case, should we be more carefully selecting our cases where NG intubation is performed and should we be removing tubes for the anaesthetic period?

This case report concerns a4-year-old Quarter Horse gelding that was presented with pressure induced urticaria. Moderate pressure ontheskin induced nonpruritic urticaria-like swelling after approximately 3-5min, which lasted forapproximately 2- 3h.Initial treatment with cyproheptadine gave anincomplete response twice daily), dermatographism was nolonger present and no side effects occurred. Treatment was con tinued for4months, with atleast three attempts todiscontinue therapy resulting in recurrence oflesions within 24h.Lesions resolved each time within 24hofrecommencing therapy. Dermatographism did not recur after the horse was moved toanother location despite discontinuation oftherapy. Thisreport describes acase Horse presented tothe Utrecht University Equine Clinic with rstnoticed 3months prior toadmission and had worsened progressively. Onpresentation, grooming thehorse with ahard brush was enough toinduce The reaction was recognis edallover thebody, except forthedistal limbs, and was initially most obvious on the croup. Riding the horse was no longer possible because the areas where pressure was applied ontheabdomen notonly became oedematous, butshowed subsequent skin damage. Nosigns ofgeneral illness were observed. Elimination of concentrate and any other supplemental feedstuff during 6weeks did not change the occurrence of lesions. Ablood sample was taken bythe referring practitioner prior toadmission forcomplete blood count and serum chemistry. Values outside the reference range were an increased potassium, most likely theresult oftransport, and a low percentage ofbeta-globulins and minimal increased percentage ofalbumin (both not considered clinically relevant) (blood results inSupplementary Item 1). Physical examination on admittance revealed a respiratory rate of16breaths/min, pulse rate of36beats/min andtemperature of37.8 \u00b0C.Mucous membranes were pink and moist, without lesions. Lymph nodes were also unremarka ble. The coat was shiny and thehorse was shedding (considered normal for the time of year). When moderate pressure was applied by'writing 'onthe skin with anindex nger, linear lesions 3-5min, lines were nonpruritic and nonpainful and thehairs were raised. These urticarial lesions lasted for approximately 2-3h.The response was more severe when theskinwas stroked against thedirection ofhair growth, both onhaired and clipped skin. Onclipped skin thereaction after stroking was lessvisible and also noteasily palpable, possibly explained bythelack ofraised hairs (Fig 2). Adiagnosis ofdermatographism was made based on these clinical signs. Nobiopsies were taken forhistological evaluati onasthe clinical diagnosis was considered denitive. Based onextrapolation from human literature (Newcomb and Nelson 1973), mast cell degranulation and release of histamine was suspected and the horse was treated with cyproheptadine (0.3 mg/kg bwt twice daily). Onthisdosage, after the rstadministration, the horse showed signs of sedation, thus the dosage was reduced to0.2mg/kg bwt twice daily. The treatment reduced clinical signs: evaluation approximately 3hafter the third 0.2mg/kg bwt dosage revealed that the urticarial lesions induced were less pronounced. However, mild sedation persisted and ulceration Thiswork was previously presented bymeans ofaposter atthe 7th ECEIM congress inPrague, Czech Republic November (Proceedings page 89). 10.1111/eve.12784ofgingiva and tongue developed. Therapy was changed to cetirizine (0.2 mg/kg bwt twice daily Zuberbier etal.2014]). The effect ofcetirizine was evaluated the day after the switch tocetirizine treatment (approximately 3hafter the third dosage). Dermatographism was nolonger present and noside effects were noticed during the next 2days inthe hospital. Treatment was maintained over the next 4months during which time only owner derived data areavailable. The owners tried todiscontinue thetherapy atleast three times, buteach time thedermatographism recurred after one day. Signs disappeared again within 24hofresuming cetirizine treatment. The horse was maintained on cetirizine for approximately 4months intotal and was then moved to another property approxim ately 70km from itsprevious stable. Clinical signs did not recur after discontinuation of therapy atthe new location; the horse was sold 8months after presentation totheclinic and losttofollow-up. Discussion This case report describes dermatographism inahorse responsive tocetirizine therapy and incompletely responsive to cyproheptadine therapy. One previous case of dermatographism has been reported inan 8-year-old Thoroughbred gelding (Cornick and Brumbaugh 1989). These authors suspected the trigger factor tobetreatment and stress related tocarpal trauma, locally treated with a bandage and apoultice containing beech wood creosote, guaiacol and methyl salicylate. Inthat case pruritus with corticosteroids and doxylamine succinate, arstgeneration antihistamine, was equivocal, although the resolved administration ofthe antihistamine. Thecondition resolved after displayed nosigns ofrecurren ce. An important difference between the present and previously reported case (Cornick and Brumbaugh 1989) is the absence ofpruritus inthe currently described case. In horses with urticarial reactions from other causes, pruritus is also variable (Scott and Miller 2011). In the currently presented equine case, the dermatographic response was much more obvious whenstroking against thedirection ofhair growth. Thismay cause more trauma to the skin, thereby enhancing the dermatographic response. Another factor might bethefact that, inman, theconcentration ishigher around the are isapplied evident minutes after stroking (Ebken etal.1968; Mecoli etal.2011). Dermatographism in man (Fig3). severely affect quality oflife(Schoepke etal.2015), because only mild pressure can result inpruritic wheals and a burning sensation intheinvolved include physical (systemic disease, drug reactions) aswell aspsychological (stressful events) triggers (Tas/C223kapan and Harmanyeri that mast cells, histamine and IgE play animportant role (Newcomb and human skin byintracutaneous administration ofserum from affected persons and this transfer was proven tobecaused bytheIgEfraction inthis serum (Newcomb and Nelson been proposed (Tas/C223kapan and Harmanyeri 2006; Wong (2000) found asigni cant difference inthe prevalence of dermatographism (both simple and symptomatic) between the general paediatric population (24%) and children with atopic respiratory complaints (47%). Inarecent abstract by Wong and Wong (2016), 62% ofhuman with severe dermatographism also had atopic dermatitis. Fig2:The dermatographic response was much skin. Fig3:Simple / AE / APRIL 2019The horse in this case did not show signs of atopic dermatitis, nor respiratory complaints. However, an allergic component is likely because the condition seemed to resolve after moving to another property. The previously described case (Cornick and Brumbaugh 1989) spontaneously resolved and was suspected to be triggered by a physical environmental factor. In man, simple dermatographism is usually left untreated. For symptomatic dermatographism, antihistamines are the drugs of choice, besides avoidance of the stimulus if known and feasible (Zuberbier et al. 2014). In man, much is known about H1-antagonists and rst generation antihistamines are no longer recommended because they easily cross the blood -brain barrier, often causing signi cant sedation. Second generation antihistamines cross the blood -brain barrier to a much lesser extent and therefore sedative effects are less likely to occur (Zuberbier et al. 2014). Currently, second generation H1-antagonists, like cetirizine, arerecommended for adults as well as children with chronic urticarial conditions like dermatographism (Sharpe and Shuster 1993; Zuberbier et al. 2014). Given the extensive experience of clinicians in our hospital with the rst generation antihistamine cyproheptadine as treatment for horses presenting with complaints of headshaking, cyproheptadine was chosen for initial treatment in this case. In horses, some reports are available on the use of cyproheptadine in cases of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (Donaldson et al. 2002) and headshaking (Madigan et al. 1995). No data is available on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics or side-effects of cyproheptadine in horses, although a sedative effect has been reported in horses (Madigan et al. 1995). The poor response to cyproheptadine in this case may beexplained by the use of a relatively low dose because of the occurrence of side effects. The oral ulceration as seen in this horse is not a known side effect of H1-antagonists, so this was likely an incidental nding, possibly caused by a local hypersensitivity reaction or chemical burn. The clinical use (Ols /C19enet al. 2011; Lassaline-Utter et al. 2014) and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cetirizine have been investigated in the horse (Ols /C19enet al. 2007, 2008). After a histamine challenge, Ols /C19enet al. (2008) concluded that at doses of 0.2 -0.4 mg/kg bwt twice daily cetirizine reaches effective plasma concentrations with regard to wheal formation. In another study Ols /C19enet al. (2007) found that the plasma concentration peaked within1 h after oral administration and at the 0.2 mg/kg dose the terminal half-life was about 3.4 h. Cetirizine has been used in clinical studies with variable results (Ols /C19enet al. 2011; Lassaline-Utter et al. 2014). In these studies, cetirizine therapy was not associated with sideeffects, except for two out of 49 horses that showed a worsening of the symptoms of insect bite hypersensitivity during cetirizine treatment (Ols /C19enet al. 2007, 2008, 2011; Lassaline-Utter et al. 2014). An interesting nding was the resolution of dermatographism in this horse after moving to anotherlocation. This might be explained by the fact that the horse was young, so it might have been a juvenile problem, as is seen in man (Martorell et al. 2000). Another explanation might be that the horse was triggered by an unknown immune response in its original environment that was no longer present after moving to another location.Conclusion This report describes a case of equine dermatographismresponsive to the second generation H1-receptor antagonist cetirizine. After 4 months, the condition resolved after moving to a new environment. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium diphosphonic acid um salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form.INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS.WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure.PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphona tes may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sen- sitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS.Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper - kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in hors - es less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormal - ities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals.Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established.ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the field study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 866-933-2472 \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

Physical urticarias (PU) are aninducible type ofurticaria which arereproducibly generated byspeci cexternal stimuli pressure, clinical history, physical examination and response tospeci cchallenges. General measures forthe management ofpatients with PU include the identi cation and exposed topressure horses generally incontact with tack used toclean it, should ofdermatographism is typically made byusing ablunt object such asatongue blade and Brumbaugh 1989). The aetiology ofdermatographism is unknown but, similar toman, beassociated with atopy. Like other forms ofphysical urticarias, dermatographism may only manifest when allergenic foods have been eaten prior tothe pressure being applied which can clearly present a diagnostic challenge (Fadok 2014). However, ifthis isthe case, the PUmay be prior toriding (Fadok 2014). Hepati tis,upper respiratory tract infections, progesterone, statins and diabetes mellitus have been implicated as a cause of dermatographism inhuman patients (Borlu etal.2017a,b).

Cholinergic urticaria (urticaria triggered has been reported inthe horse (Logas etal.1992). Lesions were produced when the horse was vigorously exercised orbathed inhot water. For horses suspected are several subtypes in humans. Because one to hypohidrosis that anhidrosis inhorses may develop viaasimilar path which includes cellular inltration along sweat glands and pores (Fadok 2014). Noncholinergic exercise-induced urticaria cases are induced byexercise only; attack todermatographism, exercise-induced urticarias may beseen when theexercise is combined with other allergens, particularly those associated with foods (Kidd etal.1983; Beaudouin etal.2006). Some cases exercise should prevent the urticaria from developing. Regardless ofthe inciting factor(s), urticarial lesions are predominantly caused bydegranulation ofdermal mast cells, and toalesser extent basophils, macrophage and other cells that release avariety ofbiologically active compounds, including histamine, platelet-activating factor and prostaglandins. These compounds cause relaxation ofvascular smooth muscle cells and retraction ofendothelial cells, which allows focal crusting and matting ofthehair coat with subsequent focal hair loss. Treatment isaimed atstabilising mast cells and histamine urticarias are responsive toomalizumab (antihuman IgE) which supports the that PUs (Mauro etal.2012; Nam etal.2012).

Side effects associated with antihistamine use can include sedation and behaviour changes. Sedation should pass within a few days of use with the recommended antihistamines. Corticosteroids commonly used for the control of PU include prednisolone and dexamethasone. Prednisolone is dosed at 0.5- 1.5 mg/kg bwt daily as an induction dose (usually 7 -14 days) then tapered to 0.2 -0.5 mg/ kg bwt every 48 h for 2 -5 weeks for maintenance. Dexamethasone is dosed at 0.05 -0.1 mg/kg bwt per os, i.m. or i.v., every 24 h for 4 -7 days, decreasing to a maintenance dose of 0.01 -0.02 mg/kg bwt every 48 -72 h. Laminitis is the most serious complication with corticosteroid use in horses but polyuria, polydipsia, increased susceptibility to infection, mood changes and elevations in liver enzymes can also occur. Omega fatty acids can act synergistically with steroids and antihistamines to decrease in flammation. Fresh ground brown flax (0.5 -1 lb daily for a 500 kg horse) has demonstrated an anti-in flammatory effect in the skin of allergic horses (O 'Neill et al. 2002) and should be considered in horses with PU. When surface allergens are believed to be contributing to the PU, topical therapy with appropriate shampoos should decrease the need for systemic medications by removing surface irritants, bacteria, allergens and threshold by coolingand moisturising dry skin which improves the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Horses should be bathed in cool water, which will constrict surface vessels and minimise the release of histamine and other in flammatory mediators. Intradermal Skin Testing has been helpful in some cases of PU. When intradermal skin testing is used to determine the speci c allergens that contribute to the horse 's clinical signs, the allergens can be avoided and/or included in adesensitisation programme that uses allergen-speci c immunotherapy. In horses with dermatographism, the pressureof applying the permanent marker to the test site can result in pinpoint urticaria ( Fig 4 ), but this should not prevent the attending veterinarian from performing the test.

Purdy Nunoa Project, Belchertown, Massachusetts, USA Corresponding author email: srpurdy@nunoaproject.org Donkeys are highly intelligent and inquisitive animals. They interact with each other, with other species with which they cohabitate and with their environment. They need environmental stimulation to prevent development of adverse behaviours towards herd mates and their surroundings. The de nition of 'small herd 'in this clinical commentary is less than 10- 12 animals. During times of the year when they are con ned due to poor weather (excessive rain, heat or cold), it is common for them to focus moreintently on each other or objects in their environment (stalls, trees, water containers). When they are turned out on pastures with varying terrain, they spend most of their time eating and demonstrate fewer behavioural abnormalities. Mutual grooming behaviour is common among donkeys but this can escalate to traumatic alopecia in some circumstances (Br /C19ement et al. 2019). Other individuals may also pick up this habit from observation of a pair performingit. This is a type of stereotypic behaviour and may require the animals to be separated (Haupt and McDonnell 1993). If low- quality feeds such as straw are available for regular feeding, this behaviour may cease, but it is important to intervene early to avoid the establishment of habitual behaviour. The suggested cause of such behaviour is likely boredom with, or stress from, the environmental situation. Normal behaviour for donkeys housed and turned out together includes pair bonding and establishment of a social hierarchy ( Fig 1 ). Bonding behaviour is very common, and some pairs are quite distressed to the point of illness ifseparated (The Donkey Sanctuary 2016). Group hierarchy may not necessarily be based on animal size, but more likelyon temperament. Some donkeys are more social than others. In a female-dominated group, there is usually one leader who sets the tone for the group ( Fig 2 ). She may be responsible for changes in physical location of the group. It is unusual for individuals to remain alone if the group moves to a new location in such circumstances and this may indicate illness in that individual. The offspring of dominant females may stay with their dams and follow their lead or may befriend other individuals if the dam is overly aggressive towards them. When animals are con ned in close quarters, aggression levels may increase especially associated withfeeding time. This may be particularly evident when treats such as carrots are offered by caretakers. Usually, animals learn their social place quickly and keep themselves out of those types of situations. It is common for dominant animals to remind them. If a few new animals from another group are added to an existing group, the new individuals will usually tend to stay together ( Fig 3 ). Over time, they may develop new friendships in the combined group. It is common forthem to eat on pasture near their old friends although in fairly close proximity to the rest of the group. Some offspring stay very close to their dams at all times with the dam as the leader of the pair. If the dam is more nervous or highly strung,she may do well nursing her foal, but over time may lose patience with her offspring 's intentions to stay close. Close is a relative term and may be demonstrated by frequentintimate physical contact or by more distant positioning in the general area of the dam without such contact. When the group moves, those which are more tightly bound behaviourally tend to stay close while the others will follow along at a greater distance. It is common for the relationships of friendly animals to change after the birth of a foal. They may abandon their old friends, at least temporarily. A donkey dam typically foals away from the herd and is initially very protective of her foal. This can be manifested by the dam standing outside in the rain when the rest of the group has taken shelter under cover. This behaviour usually will lessen in a few days, although the dam may not allow other animals to approach her foal. Caretakers may have to bring the new pair inside a shelter to avoid bad weather conditions for the newborn. Foals are very inquisitive, and males may demonstrate somewhat rough behaviour with their dams, including mounting and nipping at them. Some dams tolerate this, but others at rst seem quiet, and then may hold the offensive foal in place by grasping it on the top of the head. This is met by a surprised reaction from the foal if it has been used to acting in this aggressive way. When the dam lets go, the foal may appear to be emotionally 'hurt 'and move away for a short time. Dams are tolerant of foal behaviour, but it appears that the dam may reach her tolerance limit. The result of such correction by the dam is usually a cessation of the foal 's aggression for a period of time, or forever (Fig 4 ). Dams will usually self-wean their offspring by 6 -8 months of age, but some allow nursing much longer. Dams will not typically allow their colts to breed them as they approach sexual maturity, but this cannot be relied upon to prevent pregnancies. It is suggested that colts be removed from the female group when they show sexual aggression with attempts at penetration of females after achieving erection. One problem that may occur is where will such colts be housed? They need separate housing and turnout to prevent unwanted pregnancies and to prevent injuries in con nement housing on small farms. It may be wise to geld such individuals if they are not planned to be used for breeding. This can be done at 5 -6 months of age. All breeding studs are not safe for housing or turnout with geldings or new studs. It is prudent for them to be separated by strong fences and distance before attempting cohabitation. If females are out of sight, this introduction may be accomplished much more easily. If geldings or new studs are turned out with established studs, there usually is a period of mounting and biting by the stud just as in a male -female breeding as the established stud exerts dominance over the new gelding or stud. This can last for up to a week or more and is not related to the stud being larger in size, just more \u00a92018 EVJ bythe dominant stud on reintroduction. Temporal and distance separation may be required during active breeding periods. Theaggression level may decrease dramatically when breeding iscompleted, or when males aremoved outofsight offemales. Male -female breeding behaviour isvery interesting in donkeys. Insome respects, itismuch different from that in horses. Afemale often shows her rstheat at8-12months of toherleft. ontheleftareunrelated butstay fairly close except atfeeding time. Female onfarleftishighly food motivated.

They are usually not able tocomplete the breeding act until closer to1year ofage. Field orpen Thestud selects theclosest jennet to breed by approaching the group and observing for receptive female behaviour. Studs pursue females inoestrus, sometimes very aggressively, especially when rstintroduced onpasture. They may bite theneck, back and front orhind legs and even draw blood. Some studs have towear a breeding muzzle toavoid injury tothe female. They usually calm down after 15-30min, and then the muzzle may be removed. Female receptivity isevidenced bybacking upto thestud and making jawing behaviour sare similar tothe horse and clitoris). Nonreceptive behaviour includes kicking atthestud and running away. Animals and handlers may beinjured during this process, especially ifit occurs inacon ned space where females cannot escape. Studs and females doexhibit preferences intheir choice and acceptance ofbreeding partners. Receptive females may also approach abreeding pair toattract thestud. Females mount each other onoccasion, with the oestrus female on thebottom. Studs may also mount geldings with which they live, and the geldings may jaw. Some jennets donot show receptivity when there isnojack present, when they are nursing afoal, when another female interferes with the Fig4:Donkey mare and neonatal foal eating together. Fig5:Stud breeding onpasture. ofthe stud, orinagroup, when there isa dominant female present. Controlled (also known as hand orappointment) breeding allows forrecording ofexact breeding dates. This process involves oestrus testing the female byallowing the stud toapproach her on alead and observing the behaviour. Itmay bebest carried out with asturdy fence between the stud and the females, but some females will only show receptive behaviour when mounted. Studs may be overly aggressive ortimid when rsttraining them tomount in controlled situations. Handlers need tobealert forsudden movements from thestud and prudent female approach ingher with the stud onalead. Females byusing alead over the nose. Vigorous jerking motions onthelead along with verbal commands usually result inaquick learning process forthe stud. Handlers should, however, beprepared foranything. Donkeys are intelligent animals and respond well to consistent, rmtraining methods. Most jacks arevery slow toachieve erection (10-40min) when compared to horses. Occasionally, studs may demonstrate obsessive behaviour such as repeated pressing of thetongue onto vertical pipes orsurfaces before achieving erection ( Fig6). It is normal for a stud to mount a female one or more times before becomin gfully erect. Itisalso common for periods of inactivity at a short distance from the female before thejack achieves a fullerection and completes abreeding. A stud may also occasionally mount erect and thrust but not ejaculate. Expect semen tobeexpelled from thevagina on toachieve fullerection ordegree ofaggressive breeding behaviour and fertility. A female may back up to the jack after having ovulated, but he may not mount her if he has recently bred her within afew hours orhas been recently collected forarticial insemination. The flehmen reaction is commonly seen instuds near females orwhere they have eliminated wastes. Thestud points hishead upwards and jennet inoestrus (Fig7).Hemay dothiswhen smelling urine and no females oestrus. Donkeys need tobeprovided behaviours. Quiet and respectful behaviour is required when handling donkeys. During breeding handlers need topay close attention asstuds may show aggressive and unpredictable behaviour when approaching females.

Limited reports of adnexal lymphoma have been documented in the literature, with no known reports of recurrence nearly a decade after mass excision. The objective is to describe a case of recurrent adnexal lymphoma in a 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding presented to the Ophthalmology service at the University of Florida Veterinary Hospital (UFVH) for evaluation of a solitary subconjunctival mass of the right eye (OD). A focal, pink, fleshy mass associated with the dorsomedial bulbar conjunctiva was noted. An excisional biopsy was performed.Histopathology revealed lymphoma with clean margins. The client declined staging and further therapy at the initial visit. Approximately 8 years later, the horse began to exhibit intermittent mild to moderate diffuse swelling of the conjunctiva OD. Six months after onset, the swelling worsened acutely and was accompanied by severe swelling of the left conjunctiva (OS). The horse then returned to UFVH and was diagnosed with diffuse, bilateral conjunctival lymphoma. Humane euthanasia was elected. T cell lymphoma was conrmed with immunohistochemistry performed post-mortem. was observedthroughout the adnexal and ocular tissues of both eyes and in the submandibular lymph nodes. Adnexal lymphoma is an uncommon neoplasm in the horse. To the authors ' knowledge, this is the rst documentation of a nodular adnexal lymphoma that involved an 8-year period without recurrence followed by development of diffuse, bilateral disease. Typically, surgical excision of the nodular form of lymphoma involving the extraocular tissues yields an improved prognosis compared with the diffuse form of the disease. Further investigation is necessary to determine if nodular forms of adnexal lymphoma represent early stages of diffuse extraocular or systemic disease. Introduction Lymphoma is a relatively uncommon neoplasm in the horsewith an incidence of approximately 1.3- 2.8% of all equine tumours and a prevalence of -0.5% in the equine population (Savage 1998; Schneider 2003); however, it is considered to be the most common neoplasia of the equine haemolymphatic system (Morris and Barton 1999). Horses with lymphoma range in age from birth (Haley and Spraker 1983; Meyer et al. 2006) to 30 years (Rebhun and Bertone 1984; Meyer et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2006; Reed et al. 2010), withthe majority of horses falling in the range of 4 -10 years of age (Schneider 2003; Epstein and Hodge 2005; Germann et al. 2008; Reed et al. 2010; Taintor and Schleis 2011). There are no reported gender predispositions (Meyer et al. 2006; Reed et al. 2010; Taintor and Schleis 2011). Arabian horses were 4.5 times more likely to have intestinal lymphoma diagnosedthan other breeds according to one report of intestinal lymphoma in 34 horses (Taylor et al. 2006). Equine lymphoma has been classi ed into the following categories on anatomic location: multicentric,alimentary, mediastinal, cutaneous Roberts and Schleis 2011). Most commonly tumours are multicentric and involve lymph nodes, and thoracic and abdominal organs (Platt 1988). In a report of 37 horses with lymphoma, 34 were determined to have the multicentric form and three horses had tumours restricted to the skin and subcutis (Morris and Barton 1999). Multiple reports exist of multicentric lymphoma with ocular manifestations (Murphy et al. 1989; Germann et al. 2008; Rendle et al. 2012). There are numerous reports of lymphoma affecting the eye(Murphy et al. 1989; Rebhun 2013; Scherrer et al. 2014; Trope et al. 2014), but limited reports exist of con rmed primary ocular or peri-ocular lymphoma. Trope et al. (2014) documented a case of solitary uveal T cell lymphoma in ahorse with no evidence of multicentric disease, and Vallone et al. (2016) documented a case of suspected malignant transformation of B cell lymphocytes in the equine cornea secondary to immune-mediated keratitis. Most reported cases of ocular and adnexal lymphoma do not include post- mortem examinations, therefore, de nitive classi cation of these tumours as primary or solitary is challenging (D 'Agostino and Brightman 2004; Schnoke et al. 2013; Scherrer et al. 2014). Clinical signs of ocular lymphoma include intermittent eyelid swelling, chronic ocular discharge, exophthalmos, extraocular corneal in ltrate, vascularisation and oedema, and chronic uveitis that is unresponsive to treatment (Murphy et al. 1998; et al. 2016). Equine lymphoma is considered a fatal systemic disease process with few treatment options due to the advanced stage of the disease when clinical signs become evident (Savage 1998; Maggs 2009); however, reports exist of isolated extraocular surgically excised with no \u00a92017 was compared with thenodular form, which manifests with small, discrete, smooth and well-vascularised nodules, typically pink, that progress in size.

Keywords: horse; ovariectomy; colpotomy Summary Bilateral ovariectomy of mares is performed most commonly to eliminate or diminish unwanted behaviour, create a teaser mare, sterilise a mare so that it can be registered in its breed association, or produce a recipient mare for embryo transfer. A practical technique of bilateral ovariectomy that can be easily performed without the mare sedated and without a surgical facility is ovariectomy through a colpotomy. Ovariectomy through a colpotomy is less expensive than ovariectomy using other approaches because it is performed with the mare standing, can be performed quickly and the only specialised instrument required is a chain /C19ecraseur. Complications of ovariectomy performed through acolpotomy are uncommon when the mare is correctly prepared for the procedure and when proper precautions are taken during and after the procedure. Both ovaries are sometimes removed from mares to eliminate the regular oestrous cycle, create a teaser mare, or produce a recipient mare for embryo transfer (Hooper et al. 1993). Surgical approaches described for bilateral ovariectomy of maresinclude celiotomy through one or both flanks, or through the vagina (Hooper et al. 1993; Palmer 1993; Pader et al. 2011). A practical technique of bilateral ovariectomy that can be performed easily without anaesthetising the mare and without a surgical facility is ovariectomy through a colpotomy, with the use of an /C19ecraseur. Ovariectomy performed with an /C19ecraseur through a colpotomy, although once performed commonly (Nichols 1988; Embertson 2009), is now performed rarelybecause of perceived dangers associated with the procedure and the increasingly widespread use of laparoscopy to remove ovaries. Ovariectomy through a colpotomy is relatively inexpensive because it is performed with the mare standing, can be performed quickly and the only specialised instrument required is an /C19ecraseur. Removing one or both ovaries through a colpotomy avoids scarring, which is common whenovariectomy is performed using other approaches. Ovariectomy through a colpotomy is usually performed to spay mares because most neoplastic ovaries are too large to be removed through a vaginal celiotomy. A neoplastic ovary is usually removed using a paramedian celiotomy (Moll et al. 1987; Westermann et al. 2003). Neoplastic ovaries less than about 10 cm in diameter, however, can be removed through a colpotomy (Colbern 1993; Moll and Slone 1998). Complications of ovariectomy performed through a colpotomy are uncommon when the mare is prepared properly for the procedure and when the correct precautions are taken during and after the procedure (Nichols 1988; Moll and Slone 1998; Embertson 2009; Pader et al. 2011).Preparation of the mare for the surgery Feed should be withheld for 24 h if the surgeon is inexperienced to reduce the number of faecal balls in the small colon, in order that a faecal ball is not confused with an ovary during the procedure. Administering 4 L of liquid paraf n1 2 -24 h in advance of surgery decreases the likelihood of faecal balls being present in the small colon. Themare is restrained in an equine should precedeadministration of butorphanol to avoid opioid-induced excitement. Sedation can be maintained by administering sedatives i.v. by constant rate infusion. Drugs commonly administered by constant rate infusion include detomidine alone (0.02 mg/kg bwt/h, (Doherty and Valverde 2006). To avoid inducing excitement when using butorphanol in combination with detomidine, a loading dose of detomidine (0.008 mg/kg bwt i.v.) should be administered dose of butorphanol (0.022 mg/kg bwt i.v.) is administered (Doherty and Valverde 2006). The mare is administered antimicrobial therapy and an anti-in flammatory, analgesic drug such HCl (0.18 mg/ kg bwt), into the epidural A mare can be ovariectomised safely through a colpotomy without receiving epidural anaesthesia (authors but addition to the vestibule and atleast a portion of the vagina, prevents the mare from defaecating during surgery. The tail is bandaged with rolled gauze, elevated and secured to the overhead cross-bar of the stock. The faeces are removed manually and the mare 's ovaries and uterus evaluated by palpation per rectum. Hair surrounding theperineum is clipped and the perineum scrubbed with an antiseptic soap. Irrigating the vagina with 1 L isotonic saline solution not only cleans the vagina and vestibule, it also induces pneumovagina, easing the introduction of a handand arm into the vagina. Preparation of the surgeon Although the procedure can be performed with the surgeon and assistant wearing only sterile obstetrical sleeves, we prefer to wear sterile surgical gowns, the arms of which are \u00a92017 EVJ friction the arm and vagina. Sterile surgical gloves are donned over thehands oftheobstetrical sleeves. The glove and sleeve onthe surgeon 'sdominant arm are lubricated with sterile KYjelly toease introducing thehand and arm into thevagina and into theabdomen after colpotomy. Surgical procedure Asmall pack ofsterile gauze swabs, tethered toasterile suture (e.g. umbilical tape) and saturated with local anaesthetic such asmepivacaine HCl orlidocaine HCl, isintroduced into (Fig1).Pressing thepack tothe vaginal branch ofthe internal pudendal artery (i.e. the vaginal artery) (Embertson 2009), which can beeasily palpated when thevagina air(Figs 2and bilateral more easily through acolpotomy created onthe right aspect ofthe vaginal fornix (i.e. the 13.30 hposition), whereas aleft-handed surgeon can perform bilateral ovariectomy more easily through acolpotomy created onthe left aspect ofthe vaginal fornix (i.e. the hposition). blade submucosa iscreated that can accommodate the entire hand into the retroperitoneal space. Fascia and peritoneum are torn with anger tocreate ahole into the abdominal cavity large enough toaccommodate thehand and forearm ofthesurgeon. Trying tothrust anger through the peritoneum, rather than tearing the peritoneum with a nger, isineffective because this manoeuvre pushes the local anaesthetic solution, toeach ovarian pedicle for several minutes (Fig 4).Thegauze toalong, sterile suture (e.g. umbilical tape) toensure that thegauze can be retrieved from the abdom en, ifthe gauze swabs are accidently dropped.

The mare should becross-tied for 2-3days toprevent itfrom becoming recumbent becaus e rising from recumbency increases abdominal pressure which, inturn, increases the likelihood ofevisceration (Embertson 2009).

A complication ofcolpotomy itself isfatal haemorrhage caused the proper location (Embertson 2009). One oftheauthors (J.S.) has observed only two surgical complications after performing over 100 ovariectom iesby colpotomy. One mare experienced severe haemorrhage, requiring multiple blood transfusions, butsurvived. The cause of severe haemorrhage was thought to result from transecting theovarian pedicle while thepedicle was under tension. Another mare strained after surgery, presumably because ofvaginitis induced byanunsuccessful attempt to suture the colpotomy. Straining gradually diminished over several days.

Wilsher* The Paul Mellon Laboratory of Equine Reproduction, \"Brunswick \", Newmarket, UK. *Corresponding Wilsher 's Present address: Sharjah Equine Hospital, Airport Road, Bridge No. 6, Al Atain Area, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates Keywords: horse; mare; uterus; early pregnancy failure; conceptus; reproduction Summary The environment the equine conceptus nds itself in when it arrives in the uterus some 6 days after ovulation will determine if it will thrive or die. The uterus will be its home for approximately the next 11 months and as such it needs to both coordinate the growth of the placenta and ensure there is enough nourishment passing to this organ for the fetus to develop normally. The trophoblast, endometrium, maternal ovaries and, later in pregnancy, the fetal gonads, all play roles in the hormonal changes that orchestrate these events. Although failures of these processes later in pregnancy can have catastrophic effects for the fetus, it is in early gestation that the foundations for a successful pregnancy are laid. This paper therefore concentrates on some of the noninfectious influences the uterus may have on survival of the young conceptus. Introduction The equine embryo endures a long oviducal transport timeand it does not enter the uterus until Day 6 -6.5 after ovulation (Battut et al. 1998). During its sojourn in the oviduct it develops to the morula or early blastocyst stage and is responsible for its own forward movement through the isthmus of the oviduct by releasing prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2) from Day 5 post ovulation (Weber et al. 1991). Once the embryo enters the uterus it requires an hospitable environment in which to survive and develop normally. This paper looks at some of the noninfectious in fluences the uterus may have on conceptus survival and development,with emphasis on early pregnancy loss since this is when the majority of pregnancy failures occur (Morris and Allen 2002;Allen et al. 2007a; Bosh et al. 2009; Nath et al. 2010; Hanlon et al. 2012; Lane et al. 2016). The uterus For pregnancy to be achieved and maintained until term, the uterus needs to be architecturally sound and provide a sufciently large area of functional endometrium to accommodate a placenta that can supply enough nutrition to produce a normal foal at term. Notwithstanding, there have been several case reports in the literature that document mares being bred following partial hysterectomy, with the surface area remaining as being key to success or otherwise (Barrell and Hendrickson 2009). A further requirement for a successful pregnancy is a competent cervix that provides an effective seal to the uterus to prevent pregnancy loss. Although congenital abnormalities of theuterus or cervix are uncommon, when present they maypreclude the uterus as a suitable home for the embryo/fetus to develop to term (Hurtgen 2007). Examples of such abnormalities include, aplasia of one uterine horn ( uterus unicornis ; Newcombe 1997; Brown et al. 2007), complete division of the uterus into two compartments each with itsown cervical canal ( uterus bicorpora bicollis : Blue 1985; Kelly and Newcombe 2009), blind vagina (Payan-Carreira et al. 2007), and cervical hypoplasia (Blanchard et al. 1982) or hyperplasia (Riera et al. 1989). The endometrium If the uterus is normal in size and structure the next requirement is a healthy and functional endometrium. Throughout pregnancy the endometrium has the task of secreting growth factors and proteins (histotroph) from its numerous exocrine endometrial glands that open into the uterine lumen. These secretions dictate the development of the fetal membranes and they feed the growing conceptus. After Day 40, when blunt primary villi of allantochorion begin to interdigitate with corresponding up-growths from the surface of the endometrium to begin the placentation process, the conceptus begins to rely more heavily on the resulting haemotrophic nutrition (Samuel et al. 1974). Nevertheless, specialised absorptive areas of the allantochorion, termed areolae, which overlie the mouths of the endometrial glands, continue to take up histotroph throughout gestation (Ellenberger et al. 2008). Age-related degenerative changes in the endometrium (endometrosis) can cause changes in the production and secretion patterns of essential histotrophic proteins and growth factors (Ellenberger et al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2009a; Lehmann et al. 2011), leading to suboptimal embryonic development, poor placentation and even fetal death (Bracher et al. 1996). In this regard, an endometrial biopsy is often used to assess and categorise the degree of endometrosis and thereby provide a prognosis for the likelihood of the mare to carry a foal to term (Kenney and Doig 1986). While the Kenny and Doig scale is still widely used, Hoffmann et al. (2009b) have suggested there is a need for a more detailed classi cation system which would take into account the quality of brosis and endometrial protein secretion patterns to provide a more precise fertilityprognosis. Other changes in the endometrium as a result of endometrosis can also impact fetal development. For example endometrial cysts located particularly around the base of the uterine horns where the conceptus becomes \u00a92017 EVJ conceptus having allofitsabsorptive choriovitelline membrane in contact with thebase extensive ofadhesions ,occludes part ofthe uterine lumen. Foreign bodies inthe uterus may also interfere with pregnancy. While most willcreate anidus ofinfection that prevents the mare from conceiving, this isnot always the case. Perhaps with regard topregnancy failure, thepresence ofaglass ball inthe uterine lumen, placed there supposedly suppress cyclicity and oestrous behaviour (Nie etal.2003), isthemost worrying. Although anecdotal reports exist ofmares conceiving and carrying the pregnancy to term despite the presence ofintrauterine balls, other mares with intrauterine balls have aborted, presumably due tothe presence oftheball (Turner etal.2015). Furthermore, several reports describe fracture ofintrauterine glass balls (Turner etal.2015; Morris etal.2017) with the likelihood that glass shards penetrate theendometrium orconcept ustoresult in infertility orpregnancy failure. Even when glass balls donot cause complications there islittle evidence toshow they modulate reproductive physiology orbehaviour (Argo Katila the presence ofastructurally sound uterus and endometrium, the embryo needs ameans ofgaining entry into the uterus.

Hence, itisimportant that the embryo can have free passage throughout the uterus, and physical obstacles likeadhesions (Fig 3)orlarge endomet rialcysts, may impede thismovement and, hence, prevent adequate liberation oftheMRP, thereby resulting in failure ofluteostasis. Administration ofsome drugs willreduce embryo motility; forexample clenbuterol movement contractions and Ginther 1984), whereas flunixin meglumine can suppress embryonic production ofprostaglandins toachieve the same result (Stout and Allen 2001a). Inthisregard, some embryo transfer centres routinely administer and resulting luteolysis (Stout 2006). However, with the increasing use of flunixin inearly pregnancy conceptus Day 14isnot always associated with falling progesterone levels, itisfrequently the ultrasonographical for progestagen supplementation. Exogenous (e.g. altrenogest) may prevent loss ifendogenous progesterone levels have indeed fallen to<1ng/mL. Inthis regard, itisimportant tonote that administration after PGF 2a administration will not always prevent embryonic death. Hence, inaclinical situation, only swift administration of exogenous progesterone when endogenous levels have fallen to<1ng/mL is likely toprevent pregnancy loss and knowledge ofwhen endogenous progesterone levels fellislikely togive some indication of whether treatment might be successful. Thisisperhaps theonly useofexogenous progesterone or synthetic progestagens concentration oraprevious history ofunexplained early pregnancy loss. Notwithstanding, there is little direct evidence to show that the amount of progesterone towhich theequine conceptus isexposed has any bearing oneither placental orfetal growth or,indeed, is associated with pregnancy loss. One study which looked atthe relationship between plasma progesterone concentrations and pregnancy lossina group of170 Standardbr edmares reported that ofthe 17 mares (9.5%) which spontaneously lost their pregnancies between 17and 42days after mating, only one showed low plasma progesterone concentrations. Furthermore, theother 16mares losttheir pregnancies intheface ofcontinuing high peripheral progesterone concentrations. This demonstrated convincingly that adeciency ofendogenous progesterone production isnotasigni cant cause ofearly pregnancy loss inthe mare (Irvine etal.1990). Inasimilar vein, Stout etal. (2004) found norelationship between plasma progesterone levels inrecipient mares and thesuccess survival inthe mare. Unlike the situation incattle and sheep where elevated peripheral Fig2:Oviducal masses found after flushing amare 'suterus / APRIL 2019progesterone concentrations inthe post conception period have been associated with anincrease inembryonic growth rate (Carter etal. 2010), administration ofexogenous progesterone 0and 6topregnant mares notimpact onpregnancy maintenance forthe altrenogest inearly pregnancy hasbeen reported toincrease the size ofthe embryo Days 35and 40in mares older than 8years (Willmann etal.2011a) and to increase the down-regulation ofprogesterone receptors in the endometrium, while increasing the expression embryo succeeds inpreventing the demise ofthe primary CLthe uterus will remain under the influence of progestero ne and progestagens for the remainder of remains aprogesterone-dominated environment throughout pregnancy. Toexert aninfluence onitstarget organ, progesterone must bind tospeci creceptor molecules. Yet, curiously, inall mammals studied todate, the continuous exposure ofthe endometrium toendogenous progesterone causes itto cease expressing progesterone receptors (PR) inthelumenal and glandular epithelia even though they ofchanges which culminate inthesecretion ofarange ofendometrial growth factors that play fundamental roles in the development and growth ofthe fetal membranes and placenta.

Interestingl y,administration ofexogenous oestrogens 1999; of exogenous oestrogen may notbeanappropriate solution to early pregnancy failure even ifdecitsinoestrogen could be detected. Furthermore, the aforementioned observations would suggest that high levels ofoestrogen are likely tobe more problematic inearly pregnancy. Notwithstanding, progesterone and oestrogen are both keyplayers during early pregnancy inthemare and, viatheir steroid receptor molecules, they orchestrate the production ofhistotroph and various growth factors bytheendometrium. These nourish the young conceptus and stimulate differentiation and growth of the placenta.

Failure ofendome trial cup development, asoccurs when donkey embryos are transferred tohorse mare recipients, results inplacental failure and abortion around 80-95days in 75% ofsuch endometrial cup reaction plays an important role ininitiating and driving placentation. Tothe authors knowledge there are nocases innormal horse pregnancies that report onpregnancy failure due toalack ofeCG. However, since eCG israrely measured during pregnancy, the development antipaternal antibodies directed tofacilitate and promote attachment and placentation (Allen 1982; 2012). a) b)Tr LE LEEGS GE GES EG Fig6:Progesterone receptor expression on (a) Day 26of gestation inanormal pregnant mare showing thetypical loss of PRinthe lumenal (LE) and glandular epithelia (GE), but their presence intheendometrial stroma (S),and (b)ina6-year-old mare that had lostherpregnancy around Day 24intheface of high progesterone levels. Progesterone receptors are atypically expressed intheglandular epithelium (GE) EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 2019So can this maternal immune response go wrong? This question is very much open to debate in both human and equine pregnancy. Following on from human studies (Beer et al. 1981; Taylor and Faulk 1981; Mowbray et al. 1985), mares have been immunised against paternal lymphocytes(Mathias and Allen 2000) in an attempt to prevent recurrent pregnancy loss presumed to be occurring as a result of the mare mounting a rejective immunological response against the paternally derived antigens on her conceptus. However, while a high percentage of repeatedly aborting mares immunised with the mating stallion 's lymphocytes carried their foal to term, so did a statistically similar percentage, albeitlower, of the control mares immunised with their own lymphocytes. So the evidence would suggest that there is no clinical justi cation for immunising pregnant mares.Nevertheless, the treatment has continued to be carried out in carefully selected cases with a high percentage of success (>80%, author unpublished data). If a mare loses her pregnancy after the endometrial cups have developed they do not die with the conceptus ( Fig 7 ), but live out their normal lifespan in the uterus while continuingto secrete eCG. This may be for a considerable period. For example Wilsher and Allen (2011) reported a mean of 134 days post ovulation for eCG levels to become undetectable in maternal serum in 61 normal pregnancies carried to term. However, eCG may remain detectable for much longer periods (Allen et al. 2007a,b; Allen and Wilsher 2012) and, rarely, mares may retain functional endometrialcups post-foaling (Steiner et al. 2006). This continued presence of eCG can be problematic as it continues to exert Day 22 conceptus Day 22 conceptus in a Day 15 uterus Day 28 conceptusEmbryo with beating heart, loss of sphericalshape and thickening ofthe mesometrial folds*embryo* *** allantois embryo allantochorionembryo Expansion of the allantois and regression of theyolk sacConceptus with beating heart, loss of sphericalshape and thickening of the mesometrial foldsEmbryonic vesicle still spherical, no embryo present Appearance of a Day 15 embryo Appearance of a Day 21 embryoDay 28 conceptus in a Day 21 uterusa) b) Fig 8: a) On the left an ultrasound image of a Day 22 pregnancy from a mare mated by arti cial insemination. The two ultrasound images on the right show Day 22 conceptuses in Day 15 uteri resulting from the transfer of Day 10 embryos to Day 3 recipient mares. b) The same pregnancies as in (a) but visualised ultrasonographically on Day 28. Note how the transferred embryos have only developedto the stage of the uterus. Hence, at Day 22 they have the appearance of Day 15 embryos and at Day 28 they appear as Day 21 embryos. (Asterisk =thickening of the mesometrial folds). \u00a92017 APRIL 2019its luteotrophic action on any follicles present in the mare 's ovaries with the net result that they generally return to oestrus and ovulate only when eCG is no longer detectable in peripheral serum (Allen 1975). Hence, mares that lose their pregnancies around Day 60 would not normally be expected to return to cyclicity for at least 2 months (Squires et al. 1980). However, interestingly, the re-use of mares aborted at 60 days as successful embryo transfer recipients when eCG is still detectable in their blood, albeit at low concentrations (Cuervo-Arango et al. 2015) suggests that neither the presence of eCG in maternal blood or endometrial cup tissuein her uterus precludes the latter as a suitable environment for the young conceptus. Embryo-uterine synchrony Although the embryo is not a completely innocent bystander in the hormonal events that in fluence the uterus, it is nevertheless at the mercy of the stage-dependent changes triggered in the uterus by the rise in progesterone concentrations post ovulation. It is important to understand that once the uterus comes under the dominance of progesterone a series of temporal changes, both quantitative and qualitative, occur in the endometrial gland secretions (Zavy et al. 1979, 1982; Hinrichs et al. 1989). With this in mind, it is easier to understand that embryo survival is not dependent on a progesterone dominated environment per se, but relies on the embryo being in an environment synchronous to its own developmental stage and one that is able to provide it with the uterine proteins and growth factors speci c for this stage. Although embryo transfer experiments have demonstrated that equineembryos can tolerate a much wider range of asynchrony with the recipient uterus than other large domestic animals, asynchrony between the embryo and uterus nevertheless has signi cant consequences on embryo development. This was well illustrated by the transfer of embryos to markedly asynchronous recipient mares in which subsequent development of the embryo became closely aligned to the temporal stage post ovulation of the recipient uterus, not to embryonic age per se ( Fig 8 ; Wilsher and Allen 2009; Wilsher et al. 2010; Stout and de Ruijter-Villani 2014). For example in normal pregnancy the embryonic vesicle expands exponentially from Day 6 when it enters the uterus (Ginther 1983; Leith and Ginther 1984), and this growth can be followed ultrasonographically during Days 11 -15 (Romagnano et al. 1989; Ginther 1998). However, when a Day 10 embryo is transferred to the uterus of a Day 3 recipient mare the periodof rapid expansion of the vesicle corresponds to uterine, not embryonic, age (Wilsher and Allen 2009). And even with the more usual degree of donor-recipient asynchrony used when undertaking commercial embryo transfer (0 to /C02 days with respect to the donor) embryonic growth and developmentwill be dictated by uterine, not embryonic, age. Embryo-uterine asynchrony problems are not only con ned to embryo transfer. For example an embryo resulting from a second, asynchronous ovulation may nd itself in an uterine environment that is more advanced by a day or more than the embryo 's developmental age, since the uterus will have been under the dominance of progesterone from the time of the rst ovulation. Embryonic vesicles at Days 13 - 15 after ovulation which are more than 2 days retarded in their development, have a high incidence of pregnancyfailure (Newcombe 2000, 2004). While a proportion of suchpregnancies will be genetically defective embryos originating from synchronous ovulations, others that are genetically normal but originate from asynchronous ovulations may also fail to survive when they nd themselves in an inappropriately advanced uterine environment (Wilsher et al. 2012a). Looking again at embryo transfer to illustrate the point, transfer of embryos to recipients that have ovulated 2 days ahead of the donor mare invariably gives lower pregnancy rates and increases early embryonic loss rate (Carnevale et al. 2000). Interestingly, administration of exogenous progesterone to mares from the day of ovulation hastens and augments their post ovulatory progesterone rise to the extent that their serum levels exceed 1 ng/mL on the day of ovulation, a full day ahead of untreated mares ( Fig 9 ). This advance in uterine age leads to increased pregnancy rates for transferred asynchronous embryos that would otherwise not survive (Wilsher et al. 2012b). Thus, it is not the amount of progesterone but the length of exposure to it that triggers these events. Progesterone 'sets the clock ticking 'on the events that initiate vital changes conducive to pregnancymaintenance and embryonic growth. Conclusions On entering the uterus, its home for the next 11 months, theequine embryo needs an hospitable uterine environment, both structurally and functionally, if it is to develop into the precocious foal at term. Its rst task is to prevent the mare from returning to oestrus and to prolong the lifespan andsecretory function of the primary corpus luteum. Once dominated by progesterone the uterus alters its endometrial gland secretions, which are likely also augmented by embryonic oestrogens. Synchrony between embryo anduterus is imperative and requires a close interdependent relationship between steroid hormone production, both ovarian and embryonic, PR and ER expression in the endometrium.
