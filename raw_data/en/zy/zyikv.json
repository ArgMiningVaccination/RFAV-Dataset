The monarch faced scepticism when he set up a holistic [fertility](/health/fertility/index.html) programme as part of his 'Royal Health Service'. The radical project at Dumfries House, the Scottish stately home he restored in 2007, offers a range of complementary therapies said to help improve pregnancy chances. Participants, many of whom have exhausted all help available on the [NHS](/news/nhs/index.html) and face huge bills for private treatments, can try out acupuncture, reflexology, massage, yoga and hypnotherapy. The free course, which operates on both GP and self-referrals, also includes relationship counselling, cookery classes and dance lessons. SUCCESS STORY: Calvin Forrest's parents Colin and Stacey took part in the programme BABY BOOM: King Charles cradles an infant, with the monarch's fertility centre helping couples to conceive Now, on its fifth anniversary, the MoS can reveal the Fertility Wellbeing programme has helped bring 40 new babies into the world. The Prince's Foundation, which runs Dumfries House, says half the women who have taken part in the first-of-its-kind project - some of whom were previously deemed 'infertile' - have gone on to become mothers soon after. In contrast, the average birth rate for [IVF](/news/ivf/index.html) patients in the UK is around 20 per cent. One of the lucky couples, Colin and Stacey Forrest, from Darvel, Ayrshire, were overjoyed to welcome baby Calvin after trying for more than two years to have a child. Mrs Forrest, whose son was born in February 2020, said: 'We've never met the King but I can't ever express our gratitude for how he's changed our lives.' Supporters say the programme's success is validation of the views of the monarch - deemed the 'Unscientific King' - who said he 'believes that safe and effective, complementary medicine can play an important role in healthcare systems'. Over a decade ago he was criticised for calling on the NHS to recognise 'the core human elements of mind, body and spirit', as well as simply treating disease. In his 'black spider memos' - released in 2015 - it was also revealed he had lobbied the last Labour Government to change public spending plans in favour of complementary medicine. The monarch faced scepticism when he set up a holistic fertility programme as part of his 'Royal Health Service'. The radical project at Dumfries House (Charles pictured outside Dumfries House in 2018), the Scottish stately home he restored in 2007, offers a range of complementary therapies said to help improve pregnancy chances Meaghan Miller, health and wellbeing co-ordinator for The Prince's Foundation at Dumfries House, said: 'The point of our Health and Wellbeing programme is to complement what the NHS is already doing. 'Couples who come to us looking to conceive have often tried various different things, but the programme looks at how the mind and body connect and can offer that reminder to create time and space for yourself 'Not every success story can definitely point to our programme as why they managed to conceive but everyone takes away something from the programme that can be helpful.' The cost of running the service is covered by the Prince's Foundation, including donations from private benefactors, as well as profits from Dumfries House Estate. It is part of the multi-million-pound Health and Wellbeing programme at Dumfries House, dubbed the 'Royal NHS', which also offers holistic treatments for chronic pain, diabetes, anxiety and menopause symptoms. It is the fruition of years of planning to bring King Charles' vision for a better society - from organic farming to eco-housing - to life. BABY BELLE 'SO THANKFUL': David and Maxine Philips with their daughter Belle, three After a failed IVF cycle, Maxine and Dave Phillips were devastated. The stress of the invasive procedure had taken its toll, both physically and mentally, and they feared further disappointment. However, after signing up for the Dumfries House programme, the Kilmarnock couple went into their next round of fertility treatment feeling 'calm and positive' - and it worked. They welcomed daughter Belle, now three, in May 2020. Mrs Phillips, 31, reckons the acupuncture and reflexology she was given helped their embryo establish itself. She said: 'We believe it helped us on our journey to having Belle. We had the one side, the IVF, which was scientific, and the other holistic side and together they made the perfect combination. 'We had been feeling so stressed going into our second cycle, it really is a rollercoaster of emotions, and that is not a good state to be in if you are trying to get pregnant. I'm so thankful we were able to attend the programme and wish there were more like it to help other couples.' BABY ELLA REFLEXOLOGY: Alison and Terry Blush with eight-month-old Ella After trying for almost seven years, Alison and Terry Blush had started to give up hope they would ever have a child together. But following 'treatment' on the 'Royal NHS', their daughter Ella - now eight months old - was born. Mrs Blush, 29, credits reflexology, one of the alternative therapies championed by the King, with correcting her monthly menstrual cycles and allowing her to fall pregnant naturally. The couple had been so desperate they had even asked their wedding guests to contribute to private IVF in lieu of a traditional gift. 'It's amazing to think we have the King to thank for our beautiful daughter,' said Mrs Blush, from East Kilbride, Lanarkshire. 'We both believe there is no way I would have got pregnant without the programme. I continued with reflexology after the course as I noticed such a positive change.'
