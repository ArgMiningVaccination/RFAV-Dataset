That approval, of course, came between the Delta and Omicron surges, when awareness was higher. The low initial uptake among those under age 5, however, was not unexpected by the Biden administration. \"That number in and of itself is very much in line with our expectation, and we're eager to continue working closely with partners to build on this start,\" a senior administration official [told ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/300000-kids-dose-covid-vaccine/story?id=86406974). With approval of the vaccine occurring after the school year was over, parents' thoughts have been focused more on vacations and less on vaccinations. \"Even before these vaccines officially became available, this was going to be a different rollout; it was going to take more time,\" the official explained. Incidence measures continue on different paths New COVID-19 cases dropped during the latest reporting week (July 1-7), returning to the downward trend that began in late May and then stopped for 1 week (June 24-30), when cases were up by 12.4%, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. Children also represent a smaller share of cases, probably because of underreporting. \"There has been a notable decline in the portion of reported weekly COVID-19 cases that are children,\" the two groups said in their [weekly COVID report](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/). Although \"cases are likely increasingly underreported for all age groups, this decline indicates that children are disproportionately undercounted in reported COVID-19 cases.\" Other measures, however, have been rising slowly but steadily since the spring. [New admissions](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions) of patients aged 0-17 years with confirmed COVID, which were down to 0.13 per 100,000 population in early April, had climbed to 0.39 per 100,000 by July 7, the CDC said on its COVID Data Tracker. [Emergency department visits](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group) continue to show the same upward trend, despite a small decline in early June. A COVID diagnosis was involved in just 0.5% of ED visits in children aged 0-11 years on March 26, but by July 6 the rate was 4.7%. Increases were not as high among older children: From 0.3% on March 26 to 2.5% on July 6 for those aged 12-15 and from 0.3% to 2.4% for 16- and 17-year-olds, according to the CDC. "}
