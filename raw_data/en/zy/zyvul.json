Review local Policies and Procedures when assessing criteria for use. If local criteria for use does not exist, follow SRC criteria for use. SRC Criteria for Use : Based on available scientific evidence, the Scientific Research Committee supports the use of remdesivir in patients requiring supplemental oxygen; however, FDA approval for RDV permits treatment for adults and pediatric patients (12 years older & weight 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID -19 requiring hospitalization. For patients not requiring supplemental oxygen due to hypoxemia (SpO2<94%) and for patients who require mechanical ventilation/ECMO, current data has not demonstrated reduction in time to clinical recovery or mortality. Treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID -19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease. Severe disease is defined as: Requiring supplemental oxygen Requiring non -invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen (supplemental oxygen through a high -flow device) Remdesivir should not be initiated routinely with the following at baseline: Room air Requiring mechanical ventilation or ECMO Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of remdesivir Expect ed to expire within 24 hours or in hospice care Hepatic impairment defined as ALT 10x ULN Dose 200 mg IV x 1 on day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily Duration Hospitalized: Up to 5 days or until hospital discharge, whichever is first *Use beyond 5 days requires CMO approval Renal Impairment Prescribing information states \"Remdesivir is not recommended in patients with eGFR<30 mL/min.\", however, expert consensus is that benefits of RDV may outweigh risk for most patients with impaired renal function.

Target Population/ Criteria for Use Restricted to infectious diseases or critical care providers In addition to patients requiring high -flow oxygen , non-invasive ventilation , mechanical ventilation or ECMO, tocilizumab may be considered in cases of progressive hypoxemia while requiring low-flow oxygen with CRP75 mcg/mL after receiving corticosteroids for at least 24 hours. Tocilizumab is not recommended for use in patients on low -flow ox ygen with a stable clinical course. Not recommended to initiate in patients with: ANC <1000/mm3, Plts <50,000/mm3, or ALT or AST >10xULN Because both baricitinib and tocilizumab are potent immunosuppressants, there is the potential for an additive risk of infection. Use of baricitinib in combination with tocilizumab is not recommended. Dose 8 mg/kg IV (max. 800 mg /dose; round to the nearest vial size - 200 mg or 400 mg ) Duration 1-2 doses If clinical signs/symptoms worsen or do not improv e after the first dose, dose may be repeated once at least 8 hours after the initial infusion. Formulation(s) IV infusion (Subcutaneous injection is not permitted for COVID -19 indication per EUA) Adverse Effects Serious infections o Caution: Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab. Some studies have reported no difference in secondary infection rate while other studies have reported a higher prevalence of secondary infection in patients receiving tocilizumab compared with patients who received placebo. indicated: An increase in serum IL -6 levels is the expected physiologic response to treatment with tocilizumab. There is no role for monitoring of serum I L-6 levels to assess clinical response or to guide decision for a second tocilizumab dose. CRP level serves as a good indicator of the inflammatory status prior to and during tocilizumab treatment. Notes Mortality benefit for tocilizumab has been demonstr ated when administered in combination with corticosteroids . Do not administer if patients have any other concurrent active infection, including localized infection. For additional detail, refer to Tocilizumab EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Sarilumab - *Only to be used as a replacement for tocilizumab based on inventory* Updated 6/8/2022 9 Regulatory Status Off-label The NIH guidelines, in addition to published literature, suggest sarilumab may be used as an alternative to replace tocilizumab based on available inventory. Currently, there is no FDA EUA for sarilumab for COVID -19. Target Population/ Criteria for Use Restricted to infectious diseases or critical care providers *Only to be used as a replacement for tocilizumab based on inventory* Do not initiate therapy in patients with: ANC <2000 mm3 Plts <150,000 mm3 ALT or AST >1.5xULN Dose 400 mg IV Duration 1 dose Formulation(s) IV infusion; compound dose for IV infusion using two 200 mg prefilled syringes Adverse Effects Serious Monitoring be given in co mbination with corticosteroids Do not administer if patients have any other concurrent active infection, including localized infection. Updated 6/8/2022 10 Anticoagulation ***EARLY (first 24 hrs of hospital admission) initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation compared with no anticoagulation among patients admitted to hospital with COVID -19 was associated with a decreased risk of 30 -day mortality and no increased risk of serious bleeding events. (BMJ. 2021 Feb 11;372:n311. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n311 .)*** Heparin preferred in AKI, dialysis, or when unable to reach anti -Xa targets with enoxaparin \u00b6Patients with BMI40, 7500 subQ q8h *NIH defines increased bleeding risk based on published clinical trials as: Platelets <50 x 109 g/L, Hgb <8 g/dL, need for dual antiplatelet therapy, known bleeding within the last 30 days requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization, known history of a bleedin g disorder, or an inherited or active acquired bleeding disorder \u00a5Based on the American Society of Hematology and NIH recommendations, clinicians should carefully assess benefits of higher intensity of anticoagulation against the risk for bleeding on a cas e-by-case basis. Patients in the clinical trials illustrating benefits with therapeutic anticoagulation utilized primarily LMWH, therefore LMWH is the preferred agent. One study (ACTION Trial) utilized rivaroxaban at therapeutic dose and did not illustrate benefit, therefore we follow NIH recommendations and recommend against using direct oral anticoagulants. Therapeutic anticoagulation should be continued for 14 days or until hospital discharge. If patient progresses to ICU level of care due to COVID -19, N IH guidelines recommend switching from therapeutic to prophylactic -dose anticoagulation unless a VTE Plasma (CCP) Anticoagulation Contraindicated? Yes Mechanical prophylaxisNo Independent compelling indication (e.g. confirmed VTE, atrial fibrillation) or high clinical suspicion of VTE? Yes Treatment dose enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subQ q12h (if available, monitor anti -Xa after 3rd dose & target 0.6 -1 units/mL) or IV high dose UFHNo All of the following are met: Non -pregnant Low flow supplemental oxygen D-dimer >ULN Not at increased risk of bleeding* Yes Treatment dose\u00a5 enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subQ q12h (if available, monitor anti - Xa after 3rd dose & target 0.6-1 units/mL) or IV high dose UFHNo units subQ q8h Updated 6/8/2022 11 CCP is available only under FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) ; however, current evidence and guidelines do not recommend the use of CCP in hospitalized patients. While the RECOVERY trial did not demonstrate a mortality benef it with CCP in hospitalized patients when compared to placebo, immunodeficient patients were not included and may still derive a benefit from this therapy. If, based on clinical judgement, a provider wishes to use CCP, patients must meet the EUA criteria f or use and ordering physician must attest to the criteria. Per the FDA, this authorization is limited to use of only high titer plasma. Guideline Recommendations for use of CCP in Hospitalized Patients with COVID -19: NIH (Updated April 21, 2021): The pan el recommends against the use of high titer or low titer CCP in patients hospitalized with COVID -19, except those enrolled in a clinical trial IDSA (Updated April 7, 2021): Among hospitalized patients with COVID -19, the panel suggest against the use of CCP . AdventHealth Transfusion Consent must be obtained from the patient/LAR prior to CCP administration (following routine SOP). Nurse must give patient/LAR CCP fact sheet prior to CCP administration. Note: Availability of CCP is dependent upon collection an d distribution of donated plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID19 and may not be readily available. **Orlando Campus : If patient is being considered for enrollment in COVID -19 clinical trials, be aware that prior or concomitant use of conv alescent plasma may exclude patient from participation. Contact clinical trial research coordinator for detailed information about restrictions with each clinical trial. ** Criteria for Use 1. Patients hospitalized with COVID -19, early in the disease course, and those with impaired humoral immunity a) FDA defines early course as prior to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation b) Transfusions administered late in the course of COVID -19, defined as requiring intubation or mechanical ventilation, have not been associated with clinical benefit Treatment Timing 1. As soon as possible, ideally within 3 days of admission or new oxygen requirement Administration 1. Treatment with CCP consists of 1 unit of high titer plasma, approximately 200 mL given over 1 hour 2. Premedicate with acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg PO 30 minutes prior to start of CCP. May repeat x1 if >12 hours from premedication administration and CCP transfusion not yet complete. Updated 6/8/2022 12 Monoclonal Antibodies for Treatment - Inpatient Bebtelovimab * The U.S. FDA has issued an EUA to permit the emergency use of bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in patients with positive results of direct SARS -CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death. *Although bebtelovimab is available under an FDA EUA, based on lack of efficacy data to prevent hospitalization or death, the committee does not recommend use of bebtelovimab if other therapies are available* Limitations of use based on geographic variant predominance Due to the predominance of the Omicron variant in the US (>99% of COVID -19 cases as of 1/18/22), casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesevimab are not authorized for use in the United States at this time . In addition, as of 3/25/2022, the FDA announce d the use of sotrovimab is no longer authorized for the treatment of COVID -19 in the US due to increases in the proportion of COVID -19 cases caused by the BA.2 variant. If a patient is hospitalized for reasons other than COVID -19, such as for an elective orthopedic procedure, and the patient reports mild -to-moderate symptoms of COVID -19, confirmed with positive results of a direct SARS -CoV-2 viral test, then treatment with bebtelovimab may be appropriate, if the patient is also a t high risk for progressing to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death, and the terms and conditions of the authorization are met , as detailed in the Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers. Benefit of treatment with bebtelovimab has not been obs erved in patients hospitalized due to COVID -19. SARS -CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID -19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Patients should be treated as soon as possible after a positive viral test for SARS -CoV-2 and within seven days of COVID -19 symptom onset . Symptom onset is the point at which a patient starts exhibiting symptoms. If a patient has a positive viral test for SARS -CoV -2 but d oes not show symptoms, they do not meet the definition of mild -to-moderate disease. Mild-to-moderate COVID -19 = actively exhibiting certain symptoms of COVID -19 illness (such as, fever, cough, sore throat, headache, malaise, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell ) Bebtelovimab is not authorized for use in patients: who are hospitalized due to COVID -19, OR who require oxygen therapy due to COVID -19, OR who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate due to COVID -19 (in those on chronic oxygen therapy due to underlying non -COVID -19 related comorbidity) Updated 6/8/2022 13 Monoclonal Antibody Mild to Moderate COVID -19 Treatment Prophylaxis Route Variant Activity Age Tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld) No Yes, pre- exposure IM Delta: Yes Omicron: Yes 12 years Bebtelovimab Yes No IV Delta: Yes Omicron: Yes 12 years Refer to AdventHealth Treatment Algorithm for Non -hospitalized Adults with COVID -19 for additional information about EUA requirements for each monoclonal antibody product. Updated 6/8/2022 14 Therapies NOT Recommended Disclaimer: The Scientific Research Committee ensures timely review of emerging experimental therapies, therefore, off -label use of therapies with only published in vitro data should NOT be implemented until reviewed and sanctioned by this committee. The recommendati ons below are subject to change based on emerging data or drug shortage information. The medications listed below have been reviewed, but due to lack of evidence, these medications are not currently recommended for the treatment of COVID -19. ACE I/ARB o The HFSA, ACC and AHA emphasize the lack of experimental or clinical data on these class of drugs in COVID -19 and recommend that patients currently taking these medications for known beneficial indications (HF, HTN, or ischemic heart disease, for example) be advised to continue. They advise against adding/removing beyond what would be done in standard practice and urge individualized treatment decisions based on patient's clinical presentation and hemodynamics. Aviptadil o Synthetic vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) o Mechanism: Binds to receptors on alveolar type II (ATII) cells in the lung ATII cells bind SARS -CoV-2 via their angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 receptors o VIP protects alveolar cells and the surrounding pulmonary epithelium by: 1. Blocking cytokines 2. Preventing apoptosis 3. Upregulating surfactant production o Animal models of respiratory distress: potent anti -inflammatory and anti -cytokine activity o Clinical data are lacking to establish the potential benefits and risks associated wi th the use of aviptadil in patients with COVID -19 o There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of aviptadil for treatment of critical COVID -19 outside of a clinical trial at this time o Phase 2b/3 data Aviptadil vs. placebo in patients treated with RD V or other approved/authorized therapies Primary endpoint = Alive & free of respiratory failure at day 28 2.8-fold increased odds of being alive and free of respiratory failure at day 28 (P=0.03) 4-fold increased odds of surviving to 60 days (P=.006) Patie nts on ventilators at time of randomization demonstrated 10 -fold increased odds of survival (P=.03) AEs = mild to moderate diarrhea, systemic hypotension o For more information on the Right to Try program, refer to Aviptadil Right to Try - NRx Pharmaceuticals Azithromycin o Based on current evidence demonstrating lack of benefit in preventing invasive mechanical ventilation or death in hospitalized patients, use of azithromycin for treatment of COVID -19 is not recommended. Bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab Updated 6/8/2022 15 o Due to the predominance of the Omicron variant in the US (>99% of COVID -19 cases as of 1/18/22), casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesevimab are no longer authorized or recommended for the treatment of COVID -19. Colchicine o Based on the results of a randomized trial in hospitalized patients with COVID -19 (RECOVERY), colchicine demonstrated no benefit with regards to 28 -day mortality or any secondary outcomes; use of colchicine in hospitalized patients is not recommended. Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine o Based on studies demonstrating harm and little clinical benefit, the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID -19 is NOT recommended outside of a clinical trial. Ivermectin o Current evidence for the benefit of ivermectin is w eak and the results of two high- quality randomized controlled trials showed no evidence of benefit , thus ivermectin should not be used for the treatment of COVID -19. This recommendation will be periodically re -evaluated if new randomized controlled trials become available. o International COVID -19 Guidelines & Statements on the Use of Ivermectin for the Treatment of COVID -19: Merck Statement on Ivermectin use in COVID -19 IDSA Guidelines for Treatment of COVID -19 - Ivermectin Statement on Ivermectin | COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines Lopinavir/ritonavir o Use of lopinavir/ritonavir is not recommended because of unfavorable pharmacodynamics and negative clinical trial data. Micronutrients (Vitamin C and Zinc) o Adjunctive use of micronutrients in COVID -19 patients beyond the recommended daily allowances for supplementation is not supported by scientific evidence. o If utilization is necessary for the treatment of nutritional deficiencies, a once daily dosing strategy should be employed. NSAIDs o There is no evidence for or against the management of fever with NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is preferred for management of fever, but each clinical scenario should be carefully evaluated. Nebulized respiratory medications o Nebulized respiratory medications should be avoided in non -intubated patients unless otherwise indicated in patients with bronchospasms to prevent the spread of the COVID -19. For COVID -19 negative non -intubated patients, nebulized respiratory medications are preferred over MDIs . o If indicated, inhalers (MDIs) with spacers are preferred for non -intubated patients. o If indicated, nebulized medications with a closed circuit may be used in intubated patients. Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) o Widespread use of tPA in critically ill COVID -19 patients is not supported by the currently published studies and is not recommended.
