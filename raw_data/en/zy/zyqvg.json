[(Print Friendly PDF)](../B127.pdf) Most livestock vaccine and health management protocols revolve around the animal's stage of production. For sheep and goats, it is recommended to vaccinate prior to lambing, weaning, and breeding. The purpose of this publication is to offer a guide in establishing a health management schedule. Every operation is unique, and it is therefore imperative that producers consult with their veterinarian before establishing a specific vaccination and health protocol. Table 1 provides information on vaccine timing, recommended and optional vaccines, and covered diseases. | | Table 1.

Your veterinarian can assist you with this process. - When treating for parasites, it is now recommended that you remain consistent with your de-worming protocol. The key is to get the appropriate dose per animal. Animals that are under-dosed have an increased risk of becoming anthelmintic-resistant. - In arid regions, worming may only be required once a year. - For external parasites like keds and ticks, topical permethrin-based products work well. - Caution: Avoid applying to dairy goats. Zeta-cypermethrin products can be used as an alternative. - Depending on weather and level of infestation, a second dose may be needed two weeks later to sufficiently treat the animals. - Ewe lambs and doelings will require an additional dose (total of three) of both Campylobacter and Chlamydia vaccines to ensure full protection prior to their first breeding season. - Older sheep and goats who have been properly vaccinated as young animals should only require annual vaccines covering the clostridial (i.e., 8-way) and anti-abortive vaccines (i.e., Vibrio). - Clostridial vaccines can be highly reactive at the vaccination site. To reduce blemishes, use clean, high-gauge needles (18 g) and subcutaneous administration techniques.
