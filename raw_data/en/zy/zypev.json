ACTION: Final rule SUMMARY. The purpose of this amendment is to release an existing quarantine on a portion of a premises and to place a new quarantine on a different portion of those premises in the Commonwealth of Kentucky because of the existence of contagious equinemetritis (CEM). CEM, a communicable disease of equidae, has been diagnosed among breeding thoroughbred horses in certain areas of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In order to protect the equine industry of the United States from this highly contagious and communicable disease and the integrity of the export of equidae from the United States, it is necessary to quarantine certain premises in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and to permit the interstate movement of such quarantined animals only in accordance with the provisions established in the regulations. The intended effect of this amendment is to stop the spread of CEM in the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 8,1980. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Dr. Ralph C. Knowles, USDA, APHIS. VS, Federal Building. Room highly contagious and communicable disease of equidae,.has been diagnosed in the Commonwealth of Kentucky among breeding horses of the thoroughbred breed. Section 75.7(a) of the regulations (9 CFR 75.7(a)) is amended to remove the existing quarantine for CEM from one portion of the premises of the Heatherway Farm in Fayette County and to place a quarantine on a different portion of the premises. The existing quarantine must be removed and anew quarantine imposed on another portion of the same Heatherway Farm premises, as a CEM-infected horse is being moved from the first to the second portion of the farm. In order to prevent the spread of CEM. It is necessary to impose a quarantine on that portion of the premises where an infected horse is kept. Accordingly, Part 75, Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows: In \u00a7 75.7(a)[1). relating to the State of Kentucky, paragraph (iv](E). relating to Fayette County, is amended to read: \u00a7 75.7 Areas quarantined.

The quarantining of specified areas in Kentucky is necessary to prevent the spread of CEM from those areas. Consequently, this amendment must be made effective immediately to accomplish its purpose in the public interest. Therefore, pursuant to the administrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found upon good cause that notice and other public procedure with respect to this final rule ae impracticable and contrary to the public interest and good cause is found for making this final rule effective less than 30 days'after publication of this document in the Federal Register. Further, this final rule has not been designated as\"significant,\" and is being published in accordance with the emergency procedures in Executive Order 12044 and Secretary's memorandum 1955. It has been determined by Dr. J. K. Atwell, Assistant Deputy Administrator,.APHIS, VS, that the emergency nature of this final rule warrants publication without opportunity for public comment and preparation of an impact analysis statement at this time. This final rule implements the regulations in Part 75. It will be scheduled for review in conjunction with the periodic review of the regulations in that Part required under the provisions of Executive Order 12044 and Secretary's Memorandum 1955.

CFR Part 92 Smuggled Birds ,AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDk. ACTION: Final Rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the regulations to provide for the quarantine and subsequent release and disposition of certain birds which enter the United' States in violation of import regulations. This action provides a means whereby' certain birds may be quarantined and tested while being held in Veterinary Services quarantine facilities and sold to recover costs involved after their release. The effect of this action will be to provide for the preservation of such birds includidg threatened and endangered species which are free of disease and permit their release into the United States for purposes other than research. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 15, 1980. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACTI Dr. E. C. Sharman, USDA, APHIS, VS, Import-Export Staff, Room 821, Hyattsvrille, MD 20782, 301-436-8170. SUPPLEMENTARY.INFORMATION: On March 30,1979, there was published in the Federal Register (44 FR 18980-18982) a proposed amendment to the regulations (9 CFR 92) which in general would provide for the quarantine and subsequent release and disposition of certain birds which enter the United' States in violation of import.regulations. The 60-day period which provided for receipt of comments concerning the proposal expired on May 29, 1979. A total-of five responses to the proposed rule were received. Three of the five.responses received were from zoological associations. The responses were as follows: 1. One of these suggested that the birds be.donated to zoos or other unspecified groups after completion of the quarantine period and that the -Department seek direct funding for disease testing required, since Federal law prohibits importation of VVND infected birds. This suggestion was rejected since no funds have been appropriated and none are available for this purposi. Further, in order to recover its costs of handling the smuggled birds, theDepartment believes that sale of the birds is the more equitable approach to taxpayers than allocating-tax:dollars to the activity. 2.'One response favored the proposal since it provides for salvaging smuggled birds and should improve cooperation received fromh-the general publicregarding information about Illegal shipments. 3. One response favored the proposal because it provides an avenue for salvaging illegally entered birds for purposes other than research. This commentator also suggested that the quarantine time be viewed as a \"guarantee of fitnebs\" rather than a\"revocation of a privilege\" and that the preservation of rare and endangered species is the greatest benefit of this proposal. 4. One respondent favored the proposal as it prevents destruction of nondiseased birds which have good. potential for breeding and suggested that the welfare of these birds Is more important than their monetary value. 5. One comment suggested that for birds refused entry necessary contacts be made to get such birds into the hands of responsible persons in the country of origin. Officials of countries of origin are contacted prior to the return of such birds. This respondent also disagreed with the \"all-in, all-out\" quarantine requirement and suggested that -endangered species should be separated from other birds and tested separately with those reacting to the test for VVND confirmed by more than one diagnostic laboratory. The Department has accepted the suggestion to separate threatened and endangered species for purposes of,quarantine and testing and has added this provision to the regulation. The number of imported birds which are classified as endangered or threatened species is less than the number of birds imported which are not so classified. Therefore, It should be easier to control such birds. Further, a distinction has been made for endangered and threatened species pursuant to the directive in section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (10 U.S.C. 1536]. This section generally mandates that Federal agencies shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the Act to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by the agency do not jeopardize the continued existence of such species. While our Department realizes that an exemption to the Endangered Species Act exists (10 U.S.C. 1540) for our Department in enforcing certain responsibilities of the Secretfry (in particular enforcing laws related to restricted or prohibited importations or possession of animals), we believe that we can attempt to further the purposes of the Act without creating an undue risk to poultry. Consequently, a limited exception to the disposal requirements has been established for threatened and endangered species exposed to disease. Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Rules and Regulations It is anticipated that such birds will remain in permanent quarantine pursuant to those requirements established by the Deputy Administrator to protect the poultry of the United States. The testing of birds entering the United States for VVND is conducted only at the National Veterinary Services Diagnostic Laboratory, Ames, Iowa, and therefore that portion of the comment suggesting that a positive VVND test be confirmed by another diagnostic laboratory is rejected. This respondent further suggested that seized birds should be offered to zoos first and then to private aviculturists interested in captive propagation programs. This suggestion was rejected since this might not always be practicable. The above discussed comments primarily suggested different options for the disposition of birds after their release from quarantine. The Department has considered the options proposed and as noted in the proposal and above, has determined that disposal by auction Is the most equitable method. Therefore, the proposed amendment is adopted as originally proposed, except that a provision has been added to \u00a7 92.2(j)(2) which will allow threatened and endangered species of birds to be quarantined and tested separately. Additional, footnote 15 of the proposal has been renumbered footnote 16 and a new footnote 15 is added to provide that birds which would require hand feeding will be refused entry. This provision is necessary because the Department does not have adequate facilities and personnel to handle such birds. PART 92--IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN ANIMALS AND POULTRY AND CERTAIN ANIMAL AND POULTRY PRODUCTS; INSPECTION AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN MEANS OF CONVEYANCE AND SHIPPING CONTAINERS THEREON Accordinily, Part 92, Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended in the following respects: 1. In \u00a7 92.1, new paragraphs (j)2)(vi) and \u00a7 92.1(v) are added to read \u00a7 92.1 Definitions. (* * * * (2)* * * (vi) Smuggled birds. Any bird which has been brought into the United States contrary to any Federal law or regulation and which has been seized by any official of any Department of theUnited States Government or which has been abandoned to the United States. (v) Port veterinarian. A veterinarian employed by Veterinary Services to perform duties required under this part at a port of entry. 2. In \u00a7 92.2(b), the reference to paragraphs \"(a), (c), (d), or (f)\" is amended to read paragraphs \"(a), (c), (d), (f), or (j).\" 3. In \u00a7 92.2, a new paragraph (J) is added to reach \u00a7 92.2 General prohibitions; exceptions& (j) Any smuggled bird shall: (1) Be refused entry into the United States and be removed from the United States, 15 or (2) Be quarantined in a Veterinary Services quarantine facility pending negative results to two consecutive tests for velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND) 19 administered not less than 30 days apart, with the first test administered within seven days after the bird enters the facility. Tissue samples from any smuggled bird which has died prior to release from quarantine shall be submitted for VVND isolation. Smuggled birds shall also be subject to such other tests and procedures to determine whether the birds are free from communicable diseases of poultry othe r than VVND when the port veterinarian determines that the bird in question has shown physical symptoms of being affected with or exposed to communicable diseases of poultry. A lot of smuggled birds placed into the quarantine facility shall be handled on an \"all-in, all-out\" basis, Provided, That birds of endangered and threatened species, as determined by the Department of Interior (16 U.S.C. 1533, as amended) shall be separated for quarantine and testing as separate lots. If VVND or any other communicable disease of poultry is diagnosed in any smuggled bird at any point or if it Is determined that any smuggled bird has been exposed to VVND or any other such communicable disease, such birds shall not be released from quarantine and shall be disposed of in accordance with procedures established by the Deputy Administrator to prevent the entry of communicable diseases of livestock or poultry into the United States. However, if endangered or threatened species are determined to be exposed such birds shall be held in 'Birds that would require handfeedng will be refused entry. \"Such tests are conducted according to the Protocol for VVND which Is available upon request from the Deputy Administrator.permanent quarantine in accordance with such conditions as the Deputy Administrator may prescribe to protect poultry of the United States. At the time any smuggled bird enters the quarantine facility, it shall be identified in a manner approved by the Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services. If the laboratory tests for VVND are negative and as determined by the port veterinarian the birds are free of clinical evidence of diseases of poultry at the end of the quarantine period, the port veterinarian shall issue an agricultural release for entry of the birds through the United States Customs Service at the termination of the quarantine period.

AGENCY: Federal Home Loan Bank Board. ACTION: Notice, qf Agency rnterpretation. of Statute. SUMMARY. Under its regulations of January 9, 1980 (45 FR 1853), the Bank Board interprets the recent temporary statutory preemption of State usury laws. The Bank Board determines that when a mortgage commitment-was made prior to December 28,1979, with language that the interest rate would be the \"prevaili.ag rate at the time 'of closing,\" the interest rate used to Close the loan would have to be the lesser of the maximum rate that would have been allowed under the relevant State usury-- law or the market rate at the time of closing.

Interpra- Date Voland Outstand. 590-1 45 FR Ing 2840 commit- menisat unsped. fled rates. The text of the interpretation reads as set forth below-and will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. Federal Home Loan Bank Board Interpretation No. 590-1 The Federal Home Loan Bank Board hereby issues the following interpretation of the effect of the recent preemption of State usury laws by Section 105 of Public Law 96-161 on the following situations involving outstanding commitments with language that the interest rate shall be \"the -. prevailing rate at the time of closing\": (i) A borrower and a: 1ender, in a State with a mortgage'us'ry ceAliig,'ehter into a commitment prior toiDecember 28, 1979, whereby the borrower can obtaina loan at-\"either x% or the'prevailing -, rate at the time of closing, at the option' of'the lender.\" (2) Assume the same facts as (1), except that the loan commitment is not phrased in the alternative, but refers'- ' only to \"the prevailing rate at the time of closing,\" \"the-highest rate permissible on the date of closing\" or similar lafiguage providing foran unspecified rate. (3)Assume the same facts as (1), except that the commitment is issued on October 1, 1979, in New York State (which requires that a fixed interest rate provided in a real estate mortgage commitment be available for at least 120 days after the completed application is submitted), and that the loan is closed on March 1, 1980, during the preemptiors period, but after expiration of the 120 day protected period permitted under Newtork law. The Bank Board imiterprets Section 105 of P. L 96-161 to require the applicable interest rate used to close a loan in all three cases to be the lesser of the , maximum rate that would have been allowed under the relevant State usury law or the market rate at the time of. closing. This interpretation is consistent with relevant principles of contract law. In\" States that had usury laws preempted by this legislation, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the parties to a loan'commitment contract cannot be held to have' intended that the prevailing rate at the time of closing wotild exc'eed that allowed by the then applicable State'law. As a general rule; they cannot be held to have contracted with the intent that-the rate prevailing at closing would be affected by a Federal preemption of State mortgage usury: laws. This conclusion is consistent with the principle of contractlaw that laws existing at the time a contract is signed govern the contract as fully as if , expressly incorporated therein. Moreover,'even f'theparties had specifically intended that\"the prevailing rate\" could be increasedby subsequent, Federal preemption of the relevant State usury limitation, the parties cannot override the intention of Congress that prior commitments not be affected'by this legislation. It is a basic principle of statutory construction that a statute will notbe' construed to have retroactive ' ' application unless there is a clear intention that such an effect was intended. The Bank-Board'finds n6, indication that Congress intefidedtlat\" Pub. L-96-161 retroactively affect existing contractual obligations. It appears clear that Congress intended the Federal override of State usury lawsto make available a greater volume of new funds for housing credit, Construing Pub. L 96-161 to affect retroactively the terms of loans that would have been made regardless of th6 Federal preemption would not contribute to the accomplishment of-the Congressional objective.

L 95-507, subsection 150). This change will allow small offerers, including nonmanufacturera, to furnish any domestically manufgctured product on Federal procurements valued- at less than $10,000 and subject to small purchase procedures. DATE: January 15,1980. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. John D. Whitmore, Jr., (202) 05-0373. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: On August 27,1979, SBA published in the Federal Register (44 FR 50046) a proposal to amend the wording of 13 CFR Part 121.3-8(c)(2)(i), nonmanufacturing provision, which would allow small offerers, including nonmanufacturers, to furnish any domestically manufactured product on Federal procurements valued at less than $10,000 and subject to small purchase procedures. A number of individuals and companies felt that the continent periodwas restrictive and re quested an' additional period in which to supply their comments. In order to assure the widest possible participation on this proposal, the time for comment was extended for an additional 30-day - period on October 26,1979 (44 FR 61602), The vast majority of comments received were favorable to the proposed change. Those comment6 opposed to this chahge were directed primarily from large manufacturers, Their comments were focused upon the adverse effects this change might have upon their companies. They also indicated that this Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Rules and Regulations change would result in higher procurement costs, longer delivery times, and that small business cannot provide the proper maintenance and repair. SBA cannot accept these statements as fact it is our position that the small business community is capable of providing an adequate distribution system, maintaining delivery schedules, and providing the repair and maintenance as required. Other comments have indicated that certain phrases contained in the proposed rule should be deleted. It was felt that the last sentence, distributor or dealer selling in substantial quantities to local commercial customers and be located within the local trading area of the Federal purchasing office awarding the contract or in the location of where the supplies or services are to be delivered;\" may be subject in part to misinterpretation and, also, may be unduly restrictive to small business. (Emphasis added.) The firms commenting felt that the phrase \"selling in substantial quantities\" cannot be quantitatively defined and, left in the current broad terms, may be subject to misinterpretation by contracting officials. (Emphasis added.) The last part of the sentence \"and be located with the local trading,\" also is difficult to define and, additionally, should not be a factor in determining a firm's size status.. SBA concurs in these two comments and will eliminate the last sentence of the proposed rule. PART 121-SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARDS Accordingly, pursuant to authority contained in Section 5(b)(6) of the Small Business Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 634, Schedule D of Part 121, Chapter I of Title 13, Code of Federal regulations is amended to read as follows: In \u00a7 121.3-8, paragraph (c)(2)(i) is revised to read: \u00a7 121.3-8 Definition of small business for Government procurements.

ADDRESSES- Objections to the Hearing Clerk (HFA-305), Food andDrug Administration, Rm. 4-65, 5600Fishers Lane, FOR INFORMATION CONTACr. Gerad L McCowin, Bureau of Foods (HFF-334), Food and Drug Administration, Department ofHealth,\" Education, and Welfare, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202-472-5690. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Introduction This document responds to six food additive petitions (FAP) requesting amendment of the indirect food additive regulations to provide for use of certain laminated containers for packaging food under heat sterilization conditions where the temperature does not exceed 2500 F. Five petitions requested use of containers composed bf layers consisting of polyolefin and polyethylene phthalate polymers and aluminum-foil bonded together by certain polyurethane laminating adhesives. Notices of filing for these five petitions were published in the Federal Register as follows: 1. FAP 6B3131, Reynolds Metal. Co., 6601 Broad St., Richmond, VA 23261. (40 FR 52076; Nov. 7, 1975). 2. FAP 6B3152, Ludlow Corp., Flexible Packaging Division, Mount Vernon, OH (formerly a division of ContinentalDiversifiedIndustries. (41 FR 5861; Feb. 10,1976). 3. FAP 38802; Sept. 13, 1976). 5. FAP 7B3297, DeSoto, Inc., 1700 S. Mount Prospect Rd., Des Plaines, IL 60018.-(43 FR 5891; Feb. 10,1978). This document is a partial response to these petitions pending assurance of \"no reasonable expectation\" of migration of 2,4-diaminotoluene to food. 2,4- Diaminotoluene is a hydrolysis product of these polyurethane adhesives and of toluene diissocyanate, an adhesive component. A recent National Cancer Institute (NCI) report indicates that 2,4- diaminotoluene ii a moderately high- potency carcinogen (NCI (1979], Carcinogenesis Technical Report Series No. 162,.Bethesda, MD). The authorization for use of these urethane adhesives is being deferred pending evaluation of the potential for 2,4- diaminotoluene to migrate into food. Further action concerning the polyurethane adhesives will be the subject-of a separate Federal Register document. A notice published in the Federal Register of June 23, 1978 (43 FR 27236), announced that food additive petition 8B3376 (FAP 8B3376), filed by Emser Industries, Inc., Teaneck, NJ, requested amendment of the regulations to provide for the use of nylon 12 laminate, produced by laminating the condensate of omega-laurolactam to aluminum foil, as a component of food containers to be used under heat sterilization conditions. The safe use of this laminate is provided for in this document. Description and Definitions The ensuing regulation provides for the safe use of a class of packaging materials having a number of unique features. These articles are layered constructions, typically bonded with adhesives. Containers can be fabricated having a wide range of shapes, flexibility, and thickness as well as different numbers of layers. High- temperature laminates have been shown to be functional for processing and packaging food at retorting temperatures (250\u00b0 F). The flexible form of such a high temperature laminated container is commonly referred to as a retortable pouch because it is heat processed in \"retort\" equipment. Food-contact articles produced in accordance with paragraph (c] of \u00a7 177.1390 (21 CFR 177.1390) arecomposite structures where the food- contact layer is usually a polyolefin resin such as a polypropylene copolymer or a polyethylene- polyisobutylene blend. The food-contact layer-is typically bonded to aluminum foil by an adhesive. There may be an optional outer layer of polyester to provide extra strength. The laminates included in paragraph (d) of \u00a7 177.1390 are composite structures where the food-contact layer, nylon 12, is fused to aluminuif foil. The aluminum foil precludes the diffusion into food of any components outside it, including adhesives, and thus serves as a functional barrier to these materials. For retortable pouches, two pieces of laminate would be heat-sealed togethei on three sides to from a pouch. After If is filled with food, the pouch would be heat sealed on the fourth side. Subsequently, the filled containers would be processed at a temperature not to exceed 250\" F [121\u00b0 C) for a time necessary to ensure sterilization. The sterilized contents are then shelf-stable for periods of at least several months at room temperature. In this way, these laminated packaging materials are functionally similar to metal cans. Proir to use, the consumer would, typically reheat the food in the container before serving. History and Background Retortable pouches have been under development in the United States for the last two decades. They have been in commeical use abroad (most notably in Japan and in several European countries) for up to 8 years. Certain types of laminated containers have been sanctioned by FDA in letters to individual manufacturers because -they employ materials in compliance with existing regulations. One group includes the \"boil-in-bags\" and \"hot-fill and hold\" container intended for use at or below 212' F (100\u00b0 C). FDA considered the polymeric food-contact films (the inner liners) of these types of articles to act as functional barriers to the adhesives used to laminate the films, FDA recently discoveredt however, that adhesive components can migrate through food-contact films when laminate containers are used In the thermal processing of foods, and has since required verification that the food- contact film serves as a functional barrier. A second group employs materials until now authorized under \u00a7 175.300 Resinous andpolymenc coatings (21 CFR 175.300), which may also function as adhesives for use In containers not to be heated above 250\" F. Provision for the use of these Federal Register I VoL 45, No. 10 1 Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Rules and Regulations materials has been incorporated into \u00a7 177.1390[c)(2] below. The knowledge that adhesive components migrate through the food-contact layer when subjected to thermalprocessing and thus become food additives dictates the need for the present regulation. The purpose of the -present regulation is to prescribe the materials for construction and conditions of use of this class of food-contact articles intended for processing at temperatures no greater than 250* F and holding of shelf-stable foods. The requirements of the new \u00a7 177.1390 will supersede any previous advisory opinion letters for such articles. Consideration of other similar packaging materials for use at or below 2120 F will be the subject of a future regulation. Special Considerations Volatile substances. A number of low- molecular-weight volatile substances, such as solvents, are routinely used in the manufacture of the food-contact films as well as the adhesives used for laminating the films. Although no explicit mention is made of quantitative limits for these volatile substances in I 177.1390(cJ(4)([ii, all high-temperature laminate articles covered by the regulation-are to be manufactured-under conditions of good manufacturing practice in accordance with paragraph (a) of \u00a7 14.5 Generalprovisions applicable to indirect food additives (21 CFR 174.5), so that such volatile materials will be removed from the article to the greatest extent possible in keeping with good manufacturing practice before filling it with food. GRAS substances. Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS] substances may be used as components of the laminated structures. Although these substances are not explicitly listed in \u00a7 177.1390, \u00a7 174.5 provides for the use of appropriate GRAS substances as well as appropriate indirect additives in the manufacture of laminate structures, provided- (1] these substances are used in accordance with good manufacturing practice; (2] they are used only in amounts necessary to-accomplish the intended effect; and (3] they are used in accordance with prescribed limitations of any relevant indirect food additive regulation. Package integrity and thermal processing. Food packaged in retortable containers is shelf-stable at ambient temperatures for extended periods similar to periods for foods packaged in the traditional can. Thus, it is necessary to take proper precautions to ensure adequate thermal processing of foods packaged in retortable containers and to ensure adequate package intergrity tomaintain the hermetic seal. Food processors using retortable containers refer to FDA's regulations-21 CFR Parts 108,110,113, and 114- relating to proper thermal processing and good manufacturing practice (GMP) for canning operations. Processors of meat and poultry containing products should contact the Food Safety and Quality Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA] to determine their requirements regarding retortable container thermal processing and package integrity. The American Society for Testing and Materials (F-2 Flexible Barrier Materials Committee) has begun to develop test methods and specifications for retortable pouches and related packages. This effort and the USDA standards follow from the substantial work on retortable pouch integrity by the U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Command. As data on package integrity are developed. FDA will reassess the need to proposed separate GMP regulations for high- temperature laminates. Miscellaneous. The 250' F (121\"C) processing temperature Is assumed to have a maximum possible error of-5\" F (L2.8\" C]. FDA has evaluated the data in the above-listed petitions and other relevant material and concludes that Part 177 (21 CFR Part 177) should be amended as set forth below. Therefore, under the Federal Food. Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec409(c](1], 72 Stat. 1786 (21 U.S.C. 348(c](1)], and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.1), Part 177 is amended as follows: 1. By adding a new \u00a7 177.1390, to The high-temperature laminates identified in this section may be safely used for food contact at temperatures not exceeding 250' F (121 C] unless otherwise specified. These articles are layeredtconstructions that are optionally bonded with adhesives. The interior (food-contact] layer(s) may be separated from the exterior layer(s) by a functional barrier, such as aluminum foil. Upon review of the physical properties of a particular construction, the Food and Drug Administration may consider other layers to serve as functional barriers. This regulation is not intended to limit these constructions as to shape, degree of flexibility, thickness. or number of layers. These layers may be laminated, extruded, coextruded, or fused. (b) When containers subject to this regulation undergo heat sterilization toproduce shelf-stable foods, certain control measures (in addition to the food additive requirements in paragraphs (c] and (d] of this section] are necessary to ensure proper food sterilization and package integrity. Refer to Parts 108, 110.113, and 114 ofthis chapter for details. (c] Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, food-contact articles produced from hlgh-temperature laminates may be safely used to, package all nonalcoholic' food types.

By the Chief, Policy and Rules Division: In the matter of amendment of \u00a7 73.606(b), Table of Assignments, Television Broadcast Stations. (Miami, West Palm Beach. Boca Raton,' and Hollywood,1 Florida). 1. Before the Commission is the Notici of Proposed Rule Making, 43 Fed. Reg. .30841, released July 12 1978, proposing to substitute UHF television Channel 64 for UHF television Channel 39 at Miami, Florida. Two counterproposals have been received-one from American Telephone and Telegraph (\"AT&T\") proposing a different substitute channel at Miami,2 and one from Market Report Corp. ('WRC\"), requesting the reassignment of Channel 39 from Miami to Hollywood, Florida, and proposing a different substitute channel at MiamLi Comments to the Notice were received from Malrite of Florida, Inc. (\"Malrite\"), an applicant for a construction permit on Channel 25 at West Palm Beach, Florida; Coral Television Corp. (\"Corarl, licensee of Station WCIX-TV, Miami Florida, and of three translator stations in this area;4 from -Contemporary Television Broadcasting, Inc. (\"Contemporary\"), an applicant for a construction permit on Channel 39 at Miami. and from Wilshire Corp., an applicant for a construction permit on Channel 53, West Palm Beach. Reply comments were received from MRC, AT&T;Malrite, Coral and Contemporary. 2. The Notice was issued on the Commissions own motion to resolve a short-spacing problem concerning applications for Channel 39 at Miami, filed by Contemporary [BPCT-5155] and for Channel 25 at West Palm Beach, filed by Malrite (BPCT-5036). The assignments meet the separation requirements but the proposed sites 1bese communities have been added to the caption. 2In addition. a substitution of channels at Boca Raton. Florida (Channel *63 for '62) would be necessary.3This roposal would also require two substitutions at West PalmBeach. Florida [Channel 61 for Channel 53 and Channel 29 foi Channel 25) and the deletion of Channel *14 from Boca aton. Florida.4Coral operates translator stations WO1AA on Channel 61at Ft. Lauderdale. Florida. W84AD on Channel 64 at North Ft. Lauderdale. Florida: and W69AA on Channel 69 at Hollywood. Florida..would not conform to the required spacing. The proposed substitution of Channel 64 for Channel 39 at Miami, was designed to resolve that problem. 3. In response to the Notice, AT&T indicates that it operates a tropospheric scatter radio system (licensed by the Commission) to transmit messages to and from Cuba. It states that it has been experiencing Interference on the frequencies it now uses due to the concurrent use of these frequencies by a Fort Lauderdale station on Channel 51. It has plans to convert to frequencies arranged close to the proposed Channel 64 assignment at Miami. AT&T therefore a urges the Commission to look to Channel 69 instead of Channel 4 as a substitute for Channel 39 at Miami. It -notes that a substitution of channels at Boca Raton would be necessary under this plan.5 4. MRC states that It was planning to file an application for Channel 39 when it learned of the Commission's proposal to substitute Channel 64 for Channel 39. It suggests that if any changes are necessary to cure the short-spacing problem these changes should involve the West Palm Beach channels since the greater number of applicants have been attracted to the Miami area and the Miami channel has been assigned longer. After doing that it urges us to reallocate Channel 39 to Hollywood, Florida, approximately 20 kilometers (16 miles) north of Miami, so that It may apply to operate a station to serve that community. MRC supports that proposal by asserting that Hollywood (1970 pop. 106,873) has increased in population to 130,000 residents 6making it the third largest city in South Florida and the seventh largest in the State. It is also one of the largest cities in the country without a commercial television assignment, according to MRC. Hollywood Is located in a different county from Miami and is a part of a separate metropolitan area-the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood SMSA. Hollywoodis described by MRC as a tourist oriented community which also has sustained growth from its port and diversifiedlight industry. To accomplish this reassignment of Channel 39 to Hollywood, it proposes to change the West Palm Beach assignments from Chanfiel 25 to Channel 29. and from Channel 53 to Channel 64 to avoid short- spacing to the reassignment of Channel 39 to Hollywood. Finally, it would delete Channel *14 at Boca Raton, to alleviate a short-spacing to Channel 29 at West Palm Beach. It .notes that Channel *14 has been 5See footnote 2 supr. 'We are not told the source of this estimate.unavailable for use at Boca Raton as a result of action taken by the Commission.7MRC also contends that if Channel 64 is substituted for Channel 39 at Miami as the Commission proposed, future assignments to south Florida and particularly in Broward County would be foreclosed. Finally, we are told that the substituted assignment of Channel 64 at Miami would adversely affect translator operations on Channel 61 at Hollywood and Channel 64 at Fort Lauderdale. both licensed to Coral to rebroadcast Station WCIX-TV (Channel 6). Miami. Whereas, MRC says its proposal to substitute Channel 67 at Miami would force only the Channel 64 translator off the air. 5. Malrite. an applicant for Channel 25 at West Palm Beach and Wilshire, an applicant for Channel 53 at Palm Beach. support the Commission's proposal. Contemporary, the applicant for Channel 39, notes that its site is in the vicinity of the Miami antenna farm (hereinafter Hallandale antenna farm) in accordance with the Commission's policy of encouraging the clustering of antennas to minimize air navigation hazards. According to Contemporary, Channel 39 has remained vacant since Its allocation 14 years ago. This it attributes to the fact that the only non- short-spaced sites are south of Miami. away from the direction of the antenna orientation and where suitable land is difficult to obtain. Under those circumstances, it asserts that the odds against an independent UHF station becoming viable are too great. 6. Coral complains that the assignment of Channel 64 to Miami would cause termination of its North Fort Lauderdale translator station.sAs the only licensee in the market that has been required to locate to the south of Miami. Coral relates that it has found it necessary to operate translators in the area north of Miami in order to serve this area. It urges us to consider this loss of a translator service which it asserts would not have offsetting benefits from the use of Channel 64 instead of Channel 39 at Miami. In this regard. Coral asserts that as a pending applicant for the proposed channel, Contemporary's programing proposals should be considered. We are told that Contemporary proposes an STV operation whereas one STV proposal is already pending in Miami and another is pending in Fort Lauderdale. Moreover. I Land %fobie,HF TSharigpl z.Docket 18261.48 F.C.C. 2d 194. 40 FR 59797 19761. 6 Coral states that when Channel 64 is activated at iami. it %ill seek to use Channel S at North Fort Lauderdale Instead of at the Hollywood location.2845 2846 ' Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Rules and Regulations, Contemporary is said to propose educational programing provided by the Dade County School Board which already provides such programing over its licensed Stations WLRN-TV (Channel 17) and WTHS-TV (Channel 2), in Miami. 7. In reply comments, AT&T urges that Channel 69 be substituted at Miami, rather then Channel 64 (proposed by the Commission) or Channel 67 fproposed by MRC) because both will present interference problems to its radio system. Also to alleviate this problem, MRC would modify.its original plan by substituting Channels 29 and 61 9 (instead of 64) for-25 and 53 atWest Palm Beach. It notes that Channels 65 and 67 would be left available for Coral's translator operations. 8. In its reply, Coral restates its. concern that at least one of its translator services will be lost under any of thegroposed options without attendant enefits. It urges that no changes are needed in the Miami area since it believes that sufficient interest exists in Channel 39 despite the southern Miami site restriction. Malrite indicates that it ,,supports the AT&T plan since it does not affect the West Palm Beach channels. It questions the need for two new channels (69 at Miami, and 39 at Hollywood) under MRC's modified plan in view of the existence of 10 Miami television stations at present. Since Hollywood is in the Miami ADI and the proposed Hollywood station would provide a city-grade service to both Hollywood and Miami (from the Hallandale antenna farm), the station's - economic impact should be considered in terms of the Miami markeL If, nonetheless, the Commission substitutes Channel 29 for Channel 25 at West Palm Beach, Malrite requests that its protected status as the only applicant be continued on the new channel. 9. Contemporary, after analyzing the expressed concerns of other parties, asks that the Commission revert back to consideration of its application requesting waiver of the Commission's spacing requirements and thereby avoid the rule making proposals. If the Commission continues to explore the rule making options it states that it will accept a modification to a channel that is not less desirable than Channel 64. 10. The modified proposal of MRC appears to provide the basis for resolving the important issues in this proceeding. The plan that is finally developed is designed to resolve the short-spacing conflict between the Miami and the West Palm Beach 'This change Is necessary to accommodate the Channel '63 for Channel '62 change at Boca-Raton.applications, provide an opportunity for a first local television service at Hollywood, permit the use of the Hallandale antenna farm for the new Miami and Hollywood stations and avoid interference problems with AT&T's radio system. While the plan offered by MRC in reply'comments involves new channel numbers,10 there are no aspects of the proposal which we believe are in conflict with existing proposals-. Thus, we have no difficulty in acting on the modifications without a further Notice. 11. The need for a first lo~al television service in Hollywood has, in our opinion, been sufficiently demonstrated. That community has shown an. appreciable increase in population, which is large enough to warrant its own assignment. The use of the Hallandale antenna farm for a Hollywood station does not suggest to us that an additional Miami station is being sought. We recognize Hollywood as part of a separate SMSA,'and it is certainly large enough to need and support local television service. The only question is whether to reassign Channel 39 from Miami to Hollywood for this purpose or to simply'drop in Channel 69. We see nothing to gain by upsetting the existing Miami allocation structure especially since an available channel (Channel 69) can be placed in Hollywood. For our own administrative purposes, we prefer to leave Channel 39 in Miami in view of the existence of a pending application for its use there. Therefore, we shall (1) make no television assignment changes at Miami, (2) assign Channel 69 to Hollywood as its first television assignment, (3) substitute Channel 29 for Channel 25 and Channel 61 for Channel 53 at West Palm-Beach to accommodate the retention of Channel 39 at Miami and to eliminate interference problems with AT&T's radio system associated with the use of Channel 64 in this area, (4) substitute Channel *63 for *62 at Boca Raton, in order to assign Channel 69 at Hollywood and (5) delete Channel *14 from Boca Raton to permit the substitute assignment-of Channel 29 at West Palm Beach. This last change involving Channel *14 is n6t inconsistent with the action taken in the land mobile sharing proceeding which froze the use -of Channel *14 at Boca Raton while providing a substitute channel (Channel *62) for noncommercial use there.1 We note that as of now the opportunity for \"1 Specifically the modifications include the substitution of Channel 61 instead of Channel 64 for 53 at West Palm Beach to accommodate the change from Channel *62 to Channel *63 at Boca Raton. \"See footnote 7. supra.an additional television service at Boca Raton would not be affected by our action herein. We know of at least ono channel (Channel 27) 12 which could be assigned to Boca Raton if an interest In its use arose. 12. As for Coral's translator operations in the area north of Miami, while we recognize that some loss of its translator service is entailed by our action here, it is well settled that the translator use of a frequency cannot foreclose the commencement of a full television broadcast use.13 Thus, Coral's translator operations must yield to the new uses of the affected frequencies allocated here. However, It Is possible that other frequencies may be available to enable continuation of Its translator service. 13. Finally, Malrite notes that Its application for Channel 25 presently has cut-off protection. It has requested that if the channel is replaced, then It desires protection from the filing of competing applications on the new channel. The same situation would apply to Wilshire's application for Channel 53 at Palm Beach, which was also cut-off. In cases like these, It has been our policy to afford protected applicants continued protection from the filing of new competing applications if during the rule making, which proposes a substitute channel, no other interest is expressed in applying for that proposed assignment.

In view of the lack of other expressed interest in applying for the West Palm Beach channels, the existing applicants will be permitted to amend their applications to specify the new freqencies substituted -herein without losing their protected status. 14. Accordingly, it is ordered, That effective February 22,1980, the Television Table of Assignments (\u00a7 73.606(b) of the Commission's Rules) is amended as follows for the communities listed below: ty channel No. Boca Raton:' Florida. ...... 63 Hollywood.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This action concerns the revision of REA Bulletin 181-3 to include additional accounting interpretation concerning the accounting for coinputer software costs. It is intended to clarify the circumstances under which software costs may be capitalized or deferred. DATE: Public comments must be received by REA no later than: March 17,1980. ADDRESS: Persons interested in the proposed revision may submit written - data, views, suggestions, or comments to the Director, Accounting and Auditing Division, Rural Electrification Administration, Room 4307, South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Due to the marked increase in the cost of purchased and in-house developed computer software the question has been raised whether or not the immediate expensing of this cost is appropriate. In some instances, purchased \"software packages\" are costing much and more than the cost of hardware. Software Defined: Computer software consists of computer programs and routines (sets of computer instructions) which direcf the operation of the computer. Software can refer to generalized routines useful in computeroperations or to programs for specific application'(such as payroll). The distinction between generalized software and application software is important. Generalized software provides operating support for individual applications.This would include programs for such tasks as making printouts of machine-readable records, sorting records, organizing and maintaining files, translating programs written in a symbolic language into machine-language instructions, and scheduling jobs through the computer. These programs are generally furnished by the manufacturer. Application software consists of a set of instructions for performing a particular data processing task. Application programs are generally written by the user installation but are frequently obtained as prewritten packages from software vendors. Application software includes programs such as payroll, billing, general ledger, as well as engineering and managerial applications.- Effect of Accounting Treatment on Cooperative Members: A major consideration is the effect the accounting treatment of software cost would have on the cooperatives and their members. Since software costs can run into not only the tens of thoisands but hundreds of thousands of dollars the effect on a cooperative's margins could be material. Under most reasonable expected circumstances the cost of.software will benefit more than one accounting period. When this is the case some form of allocating these costs should be employed. Proposed Interpretation Question\" What is t peioper accounting for the cost of computer software? Answer: Costs incurred with the purchase and/or development of computer software should be accounted for as follows: Capitalize in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment, all costs for generalized software. -Depreciate the cost over the service life (or remaining life) of the main hardware (i.e., containing central processor). If the purchase invoice does not split out or - assign a cost to The \"generalized software\" then it is appropriate to include the full amount in the hardwarecosts. Defer in Account 180, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, the cost for all applications software determined to have a service life otgreater than one year. Amortize this amount over the estimated useful life of the program or the remaining life of the hardware; whichever is less. This amortization period should not exceed five (5) years. Expense in the period incurred all costs associated with the maintenance, updating, or revision of all software, and all costs for software with a useful life of less than one year. Deferred cooperative developed applications software cost is limited to costs incurred within twelve months prior to and subsequent to the purchase and delivery of the main hardware central processing equipment. In determining the total cost of purchased or internally developed software the following items should be included: 1. Costs incurred for feasibility studls if they result in the purchase or development of software; 2. All costs related to the actual purchase or development of the sdftware. These costs must be specifically identifiable with the software and be properly supported by cards, invoices, or other documents; and 3. All costs incurred in ','testing and debugging\" the software., All costs related to training personnel in the use of the software should be expensed as incurred. Software packages are sometimes purchased for use with special purpose computer hardware that is dedicated for use in load control and load dispatch operations. Accounting Interpretation .No. 111 provides that the hardware (control equipment) is to be included in the appropriate functional plant account. For purposes of Accounting Interpretation No. 111 \"initial\" software packages dedicated for use in load control are to be considered a part of the control equipment and included In the appropriate functional plant account. I This proposed rule will not change the meaning of Accounting Interpretation No. III, however, reference to accounting for computer software will be cross-referenced in Interpretation NQ.111. We received several responses to our advance notice of proposed rulemaking. Price Waterhouse & Co. suggested that REA develop specific guidelines which Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules define the elements of cost which may be capitalized or deferred. We have incorporated this suggestion in our proposed rule. This proposal has been reviewed under the USDA criteria established to implement Executive Order 12044, \"Improving Government Regulations\".. A determination has been made that this action should not be classified\"significant\" under those criteria. A Draft Impact Analysis has been prepared and is available from Mr. Sheldon Chazin, Director, Accounting and Auditing Division.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given in accordance with the administrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, that, pursuant to Section 2 of the Act of February 2,1903, as amended, and Sections 4 and 11 of the Act of July 2, 1962 (21 U.S.C. 111, 134c, and 134), the Animal and Plant Health Inspectibn.Service Is considering amending Part 92, Title 9. Code of Federal Regulations. On Friday, July 22,1977, there was published in the Federal Register (42 FR 37535-37536) an amendment of the United States import requirements for cattle from Canada which deleted exceptions for brucellosis testing of certain cattle originating in specified areas of that country. The amendment required that certain cattle to be imported from herds other than brucellosis certified free herds shall be accompanied by a Canadian certificate showing that all the cattle are from a herd which has special brucellosis test status to qualify for export and that the cattle to be imported, with certain exceptions, must have been tested for brucelloss with negative results, within the 30 days prior to their date of entry. If all the cattle are not from such qualified herd units, all eligible cattle in the herd must be treated for brucellosis and found negative to three laboratory tests administered at intervals of at least 90 days. The intended effect of that amendment was to decrease the probablity of the introduction Into the United States of a highly infectious strain of brucellosis reported to be affecting certain cattle in Canada. The requirement that certain cattle from brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada must originate from such brucellosis qualified for export herds or be found negative to three tests Is now considered unnecessary and too restrictive by certain segments of the livestock industry in the United States. In order to respond to this concern and to provide the necessary disease control, the Department is proposing to allow certain cattle originating in brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada to be imported Into the United States with only one negative test for brucelloss within 30 days prior to the date of entry, if they originate from a heard that has been maintained as a heard unit for at least one year prior to their exportation and they are accompanied by a certificate. Changes are being proposed in sections 92.20(c) (1), (2), and (3), to more clearly reflect the fact that cattle from Canada need only meet one of the present* alternatives or the alternative proposed herein in order to qualify for Importation into the United States under these provisions. Disease control surveillance and testin programs conducted by Canadian anii'el health authorities have provided conclusive evidence that certain provinces of Canada are free of brucellosis.Five provinces, New Brunswick. Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland (including Labrador) and British Columbia have been accredited by Canadian Health of Animals authorities as brucellosis free. It was reported by those authorities that the last brucellosis infection was eliminated from these areas over 2 years ago, there are no brucellosis-quarantined herds, and there has been no vaccination for brucellosis in these areas since 1974. To maintain status as brucellosis accredited free areas, milk from dairy herds in the specified provinces of Canada are subjected to three milk ring tes for brucellosis each year. Non- dairy herds must have had a rate of 5 percent market cattle tests conducted each year or a complete herd test at the end of each 3-year period.Cattle for breeding purposes originating from areas of Canada other than these specified provinces must comply with the Canadian requirements for movement into the brucellosis accredited free provinces. The Canadian requirements may be obtained from the Canadian Department of Agriculture, Health of Animals Branch. Present J 92.1(r) defines the phrase \"brucellosis certified free herd\" as a herd in which all eligible cattle in the heard proved negative to brucellosis tests under the Canadian requirements and which Is officially certified by the Canadian Government. Proposed \u00a7 92.1(r) would retain this definitionbut would add the phrase \"as a brucellosis free listed herd.\" This phrase would be added to avoid any confusion which might arise because of the difference in terminology used by the Canadian Government and would provide the Canadian livestock industry and Canadian Government with terms of reference In common use. Proposed \u00a7 92.1(v) would define the phrase \"brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada\" as \"new Brunswick. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island (including Labrador), and British Columbia, known in Canada as brucellosis accredited free provinces.\" This definition is necessary because the term brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada would be used in proposed \u00a7 92.20(c](2) and without the proposed definition this term would be unclear. Proposed \u00a7 92.1(v) would contain the terminology used by the Canadian Government to avoid confusion which mlght'arlse because/0f the difference in terminology and would provide the Canadian livestock industry and Canadian Government with terms of reference in common use. Proposed \u00a7 92.1(w) would define the word \"herd\" as \"any group of animals2849 Federal Register / VoL 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules maintained on-common ground for any purpose, or two, or more groups. of, animals of thy, same species under common ownership or supervision; which are geographically separate&k but among which there is an interchange or, movement of animals without regard to- health status.\" This definition would eliminate the possibility of an'owner. who has two or more groups of animals in several pastures which are interchanged periodically from, designating each group as a separate herd. Geographically separated.mayL mean a fence, several feet or even miles but if the animals have-periodic interchange or movement withoutregard. to health status, they should-be considered as one her& The term common ground as used inproposed \u00a7 92.1(v) refers to. the ground, areas,. buildingor equipment communally shared by any specific group: orgroupa of animals. Itis proposed to renumber present subparagraphs (2), (3)r(4), (5), and (6) of paragraph 92.20(c)-to subparagraphs, (3); (4), (5), (6), and (7), respectivelyandto: insert a new subparagraph (2. References to such subparagraphs, within paragraph 92.20(c) would be changed accordingly. Proposed \u00a7 92.20(c)(2) would require that cattle which are to be importedinto the United States from brucellosis certified free-provinces- of Canada shall be accompanied by a certificate-issued- or endorsed by a salaried veterinariar of the Canadian Government; The certificate shall show that the cattl- originated from abrucellosis- certified free province of Canada, that the cattle have been tested for brucellosis and have been found'negative to the brucellosis test within 30 days prior to their date of entry and that the cattle originated from a herd that has been maintained as a herd unit for at least year prior to their exportation. For the purposes-of proposed \u00a7 92.20[c)[2) a herd unit would be a herd in which all the cattle were born and raised within' the herd or were moved directly from another herd located within the brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada, or were moved directly from a brucellosis certified free herd in. accordance with Canadian requirements for movement into brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada.\" The Department belieyes that without Iis definition, the term herd unit might cause confusion. The Department believes that herds in the brucellosis certified free provinces of Canadawhich meet the definition of a herdunit will have very little risk of containing cattre. which are affected with or exposed tobrucellosis. The requirement that such cattle beimported with a. certificate issued or endorsedby a salaried veterinarian of the Canadian Government is to insure that the cattle meet the requirements which the Departmentbelieves are-necessary to prevent the importation of brucellosis reactor or exposed cattle. The items which would be required to be shownron the certificate- are the-minimum requirements which, the Department, believes: are necessary to insure that cattle from. the brucellosis. certified free provinces of Canada are not affected with or exposed-to-brucellosis. Proposed \u00a7 9220(c)(2) would prohibit the importation of cattle from the brucellosis certified.free provinces of Canada if any of the cattle in the herd show apositivd reaction to a brucellosis agglutination test at any time. The Department believes that these cattle would present too great a disease-risk to: allow theirimportation into the United' States. However, if aftersuch a positive reaction, the entire herd, including the cattle to be imported, are negative to another brucellosis agglutination test, or the herd is designated-by the- Canadian Government as a brucellosis certified free herd, the cattle:may tie imported In accordance with proposed \u00a7 92.20(c)(2). Proposed'\u00a7 92.20(c)(2) would also require'that cafle to be imported into the United States from brucellosis- certified free provinces of Canada be shipp6d entirely within theboundaries of the brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada from the farm of origin directly to the United States ports of entry of Houlton, Maine, Blaine,- Sumas, Lyndon and Oroville,' Washington, and Eastportf Idaho. The Department believes this requiremenf is necessary to ensure that the cattle tobe imported do not come into contactwith animals affected with or exposed to brucellosis during shipment. The United States ports of entry which are listedin proposed \u00a7 92.20(c)(2) are the only porti -of entry which can be reachediwithout going through provinces of Canada other than the brucellosis certifiedfree provinces of-Canada. In the alternative, proposed \u00a7 92.20(c)(2) would allow shipmentsbf cattle from the brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada in vehicles sealed with Canadian Government seals to be transported through provinces other than the brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada and to enter any United States port of entrynThe numbers of the seals. would be required to be recorded on the certificate accompanying the cattle and the seals must be intact upon arrival at ,the United States port of entry and. shallonly be broken by the United States port veterinarian at the United States port of entry. Again, the Department believes that this alternative method of transporting cattle through Canada would insure that the cattle- do not come in contactwith animals affected with or exposed to brucellosis during shlpmenL Therefore, a herd established as a herd unit in these brucelrosis accredited free provinces for not less than 1 year (12 months) should provide sufficient evidence of being free of brucellosis to permit entry into the United'States on' a similar basis as is now provided in \u00a7 92.20(c)(1) of the regulations (9 CFR Part 92) for cattle-from Canadian brucellosis certified free herds. It is presently required in the regulations (\u00a7 92.20(c)(6)) that all cattle- to be imported from Canada which originate from a brucellosis-free herd or a brucellosis qualified for export herd shall be conveyed by direct movement to the port of entry without contact with other cattle that are not eligible to be exported. It is proposed to amend present \u00a7 92.20(c)(6) (redesignated \u00a7 92.20(c)(7)) to further provide that cattle originating from the specified brucellosis certified free provinces of Canada be shipped directly to the port of entry without contact with cattle that are not eligible for export. Accordingly, Part 92, Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations would be amended in the following respects, 1.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend the biologics regulations by: (1) deleting the volume limits for plasma needed for the shipping, processing, and storage of Platelet Concentrate (Human); (2) specifying that the Rh blood group designation as well ds the ABO blood group designation be included in the labeling requirements of Platelet Concentrate (Human); and (3) reducing the dating period for Platelet Concentrate (Human) and Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich stored at 19 to 6' C. This action is being taken to update the regulations concerning platelet products to reflect new scientific knowledge and experience. DATE: Written comments by March 17, 1980. ADDRESS: Written comments to the office of the Hearing Clerk (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4- 65, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Robert J. Meyer, Bureau of Biologics HFB-620), Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20205, 301-443:-1306. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of January 29,1975 (40 FR 4300), FDA issued Additional' Standards CFR 640.24(d)) requires thatb (1) the volume of original plasma used for the resuspension of the platelets shall be determined by the storage temperature, so that it will maintain a pH of not less than 6 during--the storage period; (2) the pH shall be measured on a sample of platelet concbntrates that is at the selected storage temperature; and (3) one of the following stordge temperatures and corresponding volume of resuspension plasma shall be used continuously: 20! to 24' C resuspended in,30 to plasma or 1\u00b0 to 6* C resuspended in 20 to 30 milliliters of plasma. At the time of publication of the Additional Standards for Platelet Concentrate (Human), the available evidence demonstrated that these \"conditions of temperature, volume and pH were adequate to maintain the quality of the platelets at the concentrations that were attainable by existing manufacturing techniques. Since the publication of the- Additional Standards for Platelet Concentrate (Human), there have been significant changes in platelet production. At a public workshop held on January 5, 1978, representatives of industry and the Bureau of Biologics, Food and Drug Administration, met to evaluate the current methods of platelet production and to review current data so that the criteria of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy established by the regulations for Platelet Concentrate (Human) would remain consistent with the judgment of the scientific community. It was determined at this workshop that current manufacturing techniques are producing a higher concentration of platelets in each unit of Platelet Concentrate (Human) than was being produc-d when the existing platelet concentrate standards were promulgated. The effect of this change in platelet concentration is significant, because the present upper limit of 50 milliliters for the volume of resuspension plasma for Platelet Concentrate (Human) in J 640.24(d) does not ensure the maintenance of the required pH of not less than 6 during the storage period. Indeed, in a separate study performed by the Bureau of Biologics from October 1. 1977 to December 31, 1978, 21 percent of the .units of platelet concentrate submitted as prelicensing samples were found to have a pH value less than,.& Because pH is inversely correlated to the platelet concentration and platelet viability is known to be compromised at a pH of less than 6, FDA believes that current units of Platelet Concentrate (Human) with high platelet concentrations are likely to demonstrate a decrease inpH values due to inadequate plasma volumes arid consequently become clinically ineffective. On the basis of published data arid the results of the study performed by the Bureau ofBiologics, FDA concludes that the present limits for the volume of resuspension plasma for Platelet Concentrate (Human) does not ensure the quality of the product or encourage development of techniques that Improve the yield of platelets from a unit of source blood. Therefore, FDA proposes to amend \u00a7-640.24(d) by deleting the volume limits of the resuspension plasma for Platelet Concentrate (Human) and to require that the volume of resuspension plasma be determined solely by the maintenance of a pH of not less than 6 during the storage period. Consistent with the proposed changes in \u00a7 640.24(d) FDA proposes to amend \u00a7 640.20(a) (21 CFR 640.20(a)) by revising the wording concerning the volume of resuspension plasma in the definition of Platelet Concentrate (Human). Also, FDA proposes to amend \u00a7 CFR 600.15(a)) and \u00a7 640.25(a) (21 CFR 640.25(a)) by deleting the references to the volume limits of the resuspension plasma for Platelet Concentrate (Human). The biologics regulations also require in \u00a7 640.26(e) (21 CFR 640.26(e)) that the container label for Platelet Concentrate (Human) bear the blood group designations of the source blood. This requirement was established because FDA believes that labeling Is an important factor in safety administering blood products. The user must be aware of the bloodgroup designations so that platelets may be administered to recipients of the same blood group as the donor. Although tests to identify both the ABO and Rh blood groups are required for the blood from which plasma is separated for the preparation of Platelet Concentrate (Human), the labeling requirements concerning blood group designations for platelet products is interpreted by many people to Includo only the ABO blood group designation because of its clinical importance. However, platelet products are usually contaminated with significant numbers of red blood cells which can cause immunization to the Rh antigen. Therefore, FDA believes that in the interest of patient safety, the Rh blood group designation should also be clearly specified on the labeling of platelet products to provide clinicians additional information when avoidance of Rh sensitization is indicated. Accordingly, the agency proposes to amend \u00a7 640.26(e) (21 CFR 640.26(e)) by specifying that the container label for Platelet Concentrate (Human) bear tho Rh blood group designation as well as the ABO blood group designation. To ensure the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of licensed biological Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules products, \u00a7 610.53 (21 CFR 610.53). specifies storage conditions and dating periods based upon clinical experience or laboratory tests within which licensed biological products are expected to be safe and yield their specific result. The present dating period for Platelet Concentrate (Human) and Single DonorPlasma (Human), Platelet Rich stored at 200 to 24\" C or V to 6\u00b0 C is 72 hours from the time of collection of the source blood. Published studies demonstate that although the viability and function of platelets stored at either of the required storage temperature ranges for 48 hours are comparable, the platelets stored at 1 to 6' C Tor 72 hours are substantially and significantly inferior to platelets stored at 20\u00b0 to 24. C for the same time period. Based on these published studies, FDA believes that the present 72-hour dating period for Platelet Concentrate (Human) and Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich stored at'l\u00b0 to 6 C is resulting in a product having inferior clinical efficacy. Therefore, FDAproposes to amend \u00a7 610.53(a) [21 CFR 610.53(a)) by changing the dating period for Platelet Concentrate (Human] and Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich stored at 1 to 6\u00b0 C from 72 hours to 4a hours from the time of collection of the source blood. Consistentwith these proposed changes in \u00a7 610.53(a), FDAproposes to amend \u00a7 640.25(b) (21 CFR 640.25(b)) by specifying that quality control testing be. performed at the end of the storage period. Pertinent background data on which the agency relies in proposing these amendments are on public display in the office of the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4--65,5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FDA has carefully considered the environmental effects of the proposed regulation and. because the proposed action will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment, has concluded that an environmental impact statement is not required. A copy of the environmental impact assessment is on file with the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration. Therefore, under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201, 502, and 371, B2 Stat. 1041- 1042 as amended, 52 Stat. 1052, 52 Stat. 1055-1056 as amended (21 U.S.C. 321, 352, and 371)) and the Public Health Service Act (sec. 351, 58 Stat. 702 as amended (42 U.S.C. 262)) and imder authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.1), it proposed that SubchaptetFof Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations be - amended as follows:.In Part 600, by amending \u00a7 600.15(a) in the listing therein by revising the entry for \"Platelet Concentrate (Human)\", as follows: \u00a7 10 a rarge beweto 20 and 24 C. 2.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of August 4, 1978 (43 FR 34457), FDA amended the biologics regulations to permit the use of citrate phosphate dextrose adenine solution (CPDA-1) as the anticoagulant in Whole Blood (Human) and certain products derived from Whole Blood (Human). When CPDA-1 is used as the' anticoagulant, the storage period for Whole Blood (Human) and Red Blood Cells (Human), may be extended from 21 to 35 days: At the time of publicatiop of the August 4, 1978 final rule, satisfactory data were not available demonstrating the hemostatic effect of PlateletConcentrate (Human) prepared from blood collected in anticoagulant supplemented with adenine. Consequently, CPDA-1 was not authorized.for use in Whole Blood (Human) intended for preparation of Platelet Concentrate (Human) or Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich. In response to comments received on this proposed restriction, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs stated that \"when satisfactory data are received he will propose to provide for the manufacture of Platelet Concentrate (Human) prepared from Whole Blood (Human) collected in CPDA-1\" (43 FR 34459, item No. 6). Since publication of the August 4,1978 final rule, FDA has received satisfactory data that have been placed on file with the Hearing Clerk, Food and Drug Administration, and demonstrate that 'there are no differences in the yield, stability, safety, potency, and hemostific efficacy in platelet concentrates prepared from blood collected in anticoagulant supplemented with adenine and blood collected in anticoagulant without adenine. Accordingly, FDA-is proposing to remove the restriction for the use of CPDA-1 in the preparation of Platelet Concentrate (Human) and Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich. FDA advises that when the final rule of this proposal has been published, licensed blood establishments need not wait until notification of acceptance of appropriate license amendments to prepare Platelet Concentrate (Human) and Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich from Whole Bood (Human) collected in CPDA-1. Submission of a label concurrent-with the'start of manufacture of Platelet Concentrate (Human), and Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich in CPDA-1 will constitute an amendment to the license for those products. FDA has carefidly considered the environmental effects of the proposed regulation and, because the proposed action will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment, has concluded that an environmental impact statement is not required. A copy of the environmental impact assessment is on file with the Hearing Clerk, Food and DrugAdministration.. Therefore, under the'Public Health Service Act (sec., 351, 58 Stat. 702 as amended (42 U.S.C. 262)) and under authority delegated to him (21 CFR 5.1), the Commissioner of Food and Drugs proposes to amend Part 640 as follows: 1. In \u00a7 640.22, by revising paragraph (a), to read as follows:\u00a7 640.22 Collection of source material. (a) Whole blood used as the source of Platelet Concentrate (Human) shall be dollected as prescribed in \u00a7 640.4, except that paragraphs (d)(2), and (h) shall not apply. 2. In \u00a7640.32, by revising paragraph (a), to read as follows: \u00a7 640.32 Collection of source mpterial. (a),Whole blood shall be collected, transported, and stored as pfescribed in \u00a7 640.4, except that paragraphs (d)(2) and (h) of that section shall not apply. When whole blood Is intended for Single Donor Plasma (Human); Single Donor Plasma (Human), Fresh Frozen, and Single Donor Plasma (Human), Liquid, it ,shall be maintained at a temperature between 1\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 C until the plasma Is removed. Whole blood intended for Single Donor Plasma (Human), Platelet Rich shall be maintained as prescribed in \u00a7 640.24 until the plasma is removed. The red blood cells shall be placed In storage at a temperature between'\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 C immediately after the plasma Is separated. Interested persons may, on or before March 17,1980 submit to the Hearing Clerk (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-65, 5000 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, written comments regarding this proposal.

ATF is considering revising the standards of identity in 27 CFR Part 4 to allow a fruit wine derived from a mixture of apples and pears to be designated as a cider. Presently, a product designated as cider must be derived wholly from apples' ATF wishes to gather information from consumers and industrymembers on the desirability of allowing cider to be derived from a mixture of apples and \\ pears.

Chief, Regulations and Procedures Division], Notice No. 333. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:. Thomas L. Minton, Research and Regulations Branch, 202-566-7626. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Discussion of Proposal ATF has been petitioned to permit the use of the designation \"cider\" on wine derived from a mixture of apples and pears if not more than 25 percent of the mixture is pears. By allowing this, the petitioners \"believe that an interesting market can be developed in the United States for cider\". The standard of identity for cider is set forth in 27 CFR 4.21(e)(5]. Under this standard of identity, fruit wines which are derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples may be designated \"cider\". Wine produced from a mixture of apples and pears may not be designated \"cider\", but must bear the designation \"fruit wine\". Furthermore, the fruit wine must bear a truthful and adequate statement of composition in direct conjunction with the designation \"fruit wine\". An example of a proper statement of composition would be \"Made from 80 percent apples and 20 percent pears\". Under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish standards of identity (class ahd type] forwine which provide \"adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products\". The Secretary is also required to \"prohibit deception of the consumer with respect to such products\" and to prohibit statements on the label which may mislead the consumer. In the past. ATF has denied requests for label approval on wine labeled as cider but not derived wholly from apples. These request were denied because the product labeled as cider did not conform to the standard of identity for cider. Also, ATF felt that to allow a wine derived from apples and pears to be designated \"cider\" could be misleading since we felt that the general consumer understanding of cider was that cider is produced wholly from apples. However, the standard of identity requiring cider to be derived wholly from apples has been in effect since 1935. No attempt has been made to determine if the general consumer understanding of cider has changed since that time. Precedents for allowing the designation \"cider\" for a wine derived from a mixture of apples and pears do exisL The U.S. Customs Service has held that imported fruit wine derived from apples and pears is classifiable as\"cider\" for duty purposes. Also, the United Kingdom, a leading cider producer, allows the designation \"cider\" to appear on a wine derived from a combination of both apple and pear juices if not more than 25 percent of the juice used is pear juice. Public Participation This advance notice of proposed rulemaking is being issued because we find that AFT resources and reasonable outside inquiry do not provide sufficient information to identify the best course of action regarding the revision of the standard of identity for cider. Therefore, we ask that interepted persons submit pertinent comments, opinions, or data on the subject. We specifically request information from the industry and the public on the desirability of changing the standard of identity. We also request comments concerning the- current consumer understanding ofcider.,Following are specific questions which may be addressed. Please note that we request any pertinent information and the comments are not restricted to answering just these questions. (1) What facts, studies, surveys, 'or tests, if any, show the need for establishing a new standard of identity for cider?(2) What are the possible shortcomings of the proposal? (3] Would changing the standard of identity for cider have a negative or positive impact on the cider industry? Why? (4] What regulations, if any, have been Issued by foreign countries on standards of identity for cider? (5] Does labeling a wine as \"cider\" convey the impression that the wine is derived wholly from apples? (6] If a new standard of identityis adopted should there be a statement of composition on the label giving the percentages of apples and pears? (7) If a new standard of identity for cider derived from apples and pears is adopted. what percentage of pears should be allowed?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Information Since 1965, the problem of interstate- cigarette smuggling to avoid the payment of State and local cigarettes, taxes has steadily worsened. Thirty-four States have suffered losses-in tax revenue due to this illegal enterprise: The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations has identified 14 States in which cigarettes smuggling poses a major problem., Pennsylvania loses an average of $40 million annually. Illinois and Ohio have suffered annual losses of $25 million and $30 million, respectively, as a result of cigarette smuggling. New York State and, New York City, combined, lose approximately $100 million a year in, State and local revenues due to cigarette- smuggling. Over 450 million packs of cigarettes are smuggled'into NewYork State every year. It has been estimated that 50 percent of the cigarettes sold in New York City are contraband cigarettes on which no New York State or local tax has been paid. Total revenue losses to the States as a result of cigarette smuggling have approached the $400 million mark. In many areas, this- traffic in contraband cigarettes also causes the loss of legitimate employment. Wholesalers. and vendors- of legitimate--taxpaid cigarettes hav( oftenbeen unable-to compete with the lower-cost contraband cigarettes; In NewYorkit'is estimated that one-half of the employees; of cigarette wholesalers and vendors have lost their jobs as a result ofthe detrimentaleconomic impact 6f contraband cigarettes. It is also estimated that one-third of the legitimate cigarette-wholesalers in New York have been forced-out of business. To curtail the traffic in contraband cigarettes, the Presidentapprovedpublic: Law. 95--575 on November 2,1978.. This law'made trafficking-in contraband. cigarettes a violation of Federal law and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations requiring each person Who distributes more than 60,000, cigarettes in a single.transactioir to keep records pertaining to the disposition of cigarettes. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, as an agency of the Department.of the Treasury,. is proposing those regulations-. Discussion of Proposal This proposal would amend'27 CFR Part 296-Miscellaneous Regulations- RelatingTo Cigars; and Tubes by addihga new SubpartF-Distributior of cigarettes. The requirements of this new subpart would' apply to each distributor of cigarettes. A \"distributor\" would! be anyperson who sells, ships, issues,. -gives, transfers,, orotherwise disposes ot more than 60,000 cigarettes bra single transadtiom Persons who distribute cigarettes only in quantities of 60,000 cigarettes or less would not be. considered-a \"distributor\" under the proposed regulations and would not be subject to the requirements proposed by this document Recordkeeping Requirement Public Law 95-575 makes-itunlawful for most persons to purchase, receive, possess, transport, ship, sell or , distributemore than 60,000. cigarettes in: a single quantity on which the State: cigarette tax has not been paid. However, the law does allowcertain persons to possess and handle cigarettes on which, the State tax has not been paid. These persons are referred to in the proposed regulations as \"exempted persons\". An \"exempted person\" is. defined in the proposed regulations as any person who: (1).Holds a permitas a manufacturer of tobacco products or as an export warehouse proprieto-(2) Operates a customs bonded warehiousei. ' (3) Is an agent for a manufacturer of tobacco products, export warehouseproprietor, or customs warehouse operator, (4) I a common or contract carrier transporting cigarettes under a proper bill of lading or freight bill which states the quantity, source, and destination of the cigarettes; (5) Is licensed by the State In which he possesses cigarettes to account for and pay cigarette taxes imposed by that State and who has complied with the accounting and payment requirements with respect to any cigarettes involved; or (6) Is an agent of the United States, an' individual State, or a political subdivision of a State and who has possession of cigarettes in connection with performance of official duties, (7) Operates within a foreign-trade zone established under 19 U.S.C. 81b, when the cigarettes involved have been entered into the zone under zone- restricted'status, or in respect to foreign cigarettes, have been admitted into the zone but which have not been entered, into the United States. Public Law 95-575 does not specifically authorize persons operating in a foreign-trade zone to possess or handle cigarettes on which- the State cigarette tax has not been paid'. However, domestic cigarettes entered intoa foreign-trade zone under zone- restricted status and foreign cigarettes admitted into a foreign-trade zone but not entered into the United States are similar in status to cigarettes In export warehouses or customs bonded warehouses. Since the legislation clearly intends that cigarettes in the latter status be- exempt from the contraband definition, ATF has included persons operating in a foreign-trade'zone with respect to cigarettes under this exempt status in the category of \"exempted person.\" The recordkeeping requirements of this proposal are tied to this definition of \"exempted. person\". Basically, this proposal would require each distributor of cigarettes to keep invoices, bills of lading or any other\" commercial records relating to each disposition of more than 60,000 cigarettes. Each distributor of cigarettes would be required to show certain information in his/her commercial records relating to each disposition-of more than 60,000 cigarettes,. depending on whether the distributor and the recipient of the cigarettes are exempted persons. In order not to place any undue burden. on distributors, the regulations do not require that each distributor obtain all the information authorized by 'law. Rather, only distributors who are not exempted persons, or any distributor who sells toa nonexempt'person but2856 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules does not deliver the cigarettes to the nonexempted person, are required to obtain all the authorized information regarding dispositions in excess of 60,000 cigarettes. In drafting the recordkeeping regulations, ATF has included only the precise information that the Congress sanctioned. Since the recordkeeping requirements apply only to dispositions in excess of 60,000 cigarettes, it is necessary that the commercial records show the quantity of cigarettes disposed of in a particular transaction.-The purpose of the proposed Tecordkeeping requirements is to provide ATF with a means to trace the movment of cigarettes. The ability to trace the movement of cigarettes would be.a useful aid to ATFs efforts to curtail interstate smuggling of cigarettes. ATF feels that most distributors already keep commercial records relating to each transaction as a sound commercial practice. Therefore, ATF feels that the recordkeeping requirement for dispositions by distributors who are exempted persons should not generally impose any additional burden on those cigarette distributors. ATF realizes that some items of information which would be required on dispositions from distributors who are not exempted persons are not normally included in commercial records. However, this requirement would apply only to dispositions of more than 60,000 cigarettes. ATF feels that dispositions of this size sold over-the-counter or at other commercial levels where records of disposition would not normally exist could be a major source of cigarettes which could subsequently be involved in illicit interstate trafficking. For this reason and since Public Law 95-575 specifically authorizes the requirement of this information as necessary to trace the movement of cofitraband cigarettes, ATF feels that the added recordkeeping requirements on these dispositions are justified. Under this proposal, a cigarette distributor would not be exempt from the recordkeeping requirements if he/ she divided a bona fide single dispositon of more than 60,000 cigarettes into smaller components of 60,000 cigarettes or less. A distributor may divide a single disposition of more than 60,000 cigarettes into smaller components; however, to comply with the proposed regulations, the distributor would still have to record the required information for each component of the disposition. ATF does not anticipate the widespread practice of splitting dispositions of cigarettes to avoid the recordkeeping requirements of this proposal The division of a singledisposition would normally be more costly and inconvenient to a distributor. ATF feels that this requirement would not burden most distributors since It follows generally accepted commercial practice. Also, to allow the division of a large single disposition into compenents of 60,000 cigarettes or less to avoid the proposed recordkeeping requirements would hamstring investigative efforts to curtail cigarette smuggling and would circumvent the intent of the authorizing legislation. This proposal would also require a cigarette distributor to retain his/her records of disposition for three years following the close of the calendar year in which the records are made. The distributor would also be required to keep the records at his/her business premises. Since business records are normally retained over a period of years for tax purposes, these retention requirements should not be an added burden to most distributors. Other Provisions Finally, Public Law 95-675 authorizes ATF officers, as agents of the Secretary of the Treasury. to enter a distributor's primis-s upon that distributor's consent or in accordance wi*th a duly issued search warrant. The legislative history of the House bill, HR. 8853, containing a parallel provision indicates that the search warrant requirement was intended to bring the law in line with the Supreme Court ruling in Marshal v. Barlow', Inc., 435 U.S. 307 (1978). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-1629, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978). The proposed regulations have been drafted to reflect the Congressional intent authorizing the use of an administrative Inspection warrant. Mlscellaneous Amendments The table of sections to Part 290 would be amended to reflect the addition of Subpart F. Public Participation ATF requests comments from all interested persons. All comments received before the closing date will be carefully considered. Comments received after the closing date and too late for consideration will be treated as possible suggestions for future ATF action.

A. Introduction 2. On March 19,1975, the Commission adopted its Memorandum Opinion and Order in Docket No. 18262, LandMobile Radio Service, 51 FCC 2d 945 (1975), terminating a long proceeding to provide spectrum relief for the land mobile radio services. In that proceeding, the Commission, inter alia, allocated 40 MHz to the Domestic-Public Land Mobile Radio Service for the development of a nationwide, \"cellular\" mobile radio communication system. Cellular mobile systems are generally described as mobile radio systems with a high capacity to serve subscriber units due to the coordinated reuse of a group Land Afobile Radio Svvic;, Docket No. 182= SecondReport andOrder, 75 (1974), on FCC 2d sub nozam NARUC v.

See also footnote 4. infr.of radio channels.21During the past year, the Commission and its staff have had the opportunity to review data from the operation of an AT&T developmental cellular system and to see the system in operation, and have discussed cellular technology and its future with many members of the telecommunications industry and potentially interested parties. In sum. there seems to be little doubt that cellular communications offers the best means for meeting the demands of the mobile communications market through the end of this century. The time has arrived, therefore, for the Commission to establish rules and policies for the commercial operation of cellular mobile radio systems. B. Background 3. Docket No. 1826.Z We initiated Docket No. 18262 in 1968 with a Notice of lnquiry andNotice ofProposed Rulemaking, 14 FCC 2d 311 (1968], as a first step in our effort to provide spectrum relief for land mobile radio users for the foreseeable future.3The Commission proposed to reallocate frequencies in the 806-960 MHz band to make avalable enough spectrum to accommodate the public need for both private and common carrier land mobile communications. Between 1968 and 1974, we examined how best to use these frequencies in the public interest4 4. By 1974, however, policies were refined and sharpened, and we issued our Second Report and Order, 46 FCC 2d 753 (1974).5 The frequency allocation plan changed considerably. For example, we reduced the band allocated 21n such systems, each radio channel can be used many times in separate zones or cells within an area. Mobile units communicate with an array of cell control locstions distributed throughout the system these cell sites are linked to control and switching facitles and thereby interconnected with the telephone network. The frequandes used in the cells are carefully coordinated in such a way as to permit frequency reuscin geographically separated cells without mutual interfernce-A faly developed cellular system would have the ability to locate a subscriber unit. establish a connection through an appropriate call site, and transfer (\"hand off') that connection to other cell control locations as the subscriber unit moves through the grid of cell location. The number ofcell sites in a system is dependent on the degree of channel reuse, the amount of spectrumt available, and the density of traffic on the system. See generally LandAo(AMbe Radio Service.

CI.14 cert.died. 425 U.S. 99 2(1978].2859 2860 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10-/ Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules for high capacity common carrier systems from 75 MHz to 40 MHz and specifically set aside this allocation for cellular systems. Reserve bands totaling 20 MHz were strategically placed adjacent to the cellular allocation so that additional spectrum would be available if the growth rate of cellular systems was unexpectedly rapid. We concluded that a cellular system using the full 40 MHz (with channel spacing of 40 kHz) could serve the projected urban mobile telephone market through 1990.6 5. We also reached certain conclusions on a number of critical policies:We decided that only wireline telephone companies would be permitted to operate cellular systems. 46 FCC 2d at 760. In addition, a, one system to a market policy was adopted in the belief that competing cellular systems would not b'e feasible because of the technical complexity and expense involved'and because of the large amount of spectrum needed to make such a system viable economically. Id. 6. Because of concerns iroiced by many parties about the-potential for improper cross-subsidization:and other anticompetitive acts by wireline telephone companies operating cellular systems,'we stated that we would place certain restrictions on the wireline carriers to deter anticompetitive practices. Specifically, theywould be required to establish fully separated subsidiary corporations for offering cellular service; they would not be permitted to manufacture, provide, or maintain mobile equipment; they would not be permitted to manufacture base station equipment; they would be required to submit to the Commission all contracts between the parent and subsidiary corporations and to report on all dealings betwen them; and they would be required to offer Interconnection services to the public on the same basis as to their mobile telephone subsidiaries. 46 FCC 2d at 760-61. 7. Many parties concerned with the anticompetitive effects of cross- subsidies focused on the wireline carriers' intent to enter the dispatch serv ice market. We-decided, however, that the public should not be denied the benefits of lower-cost dispatch service is cellular systems were capable'of providing it. We believed that the restrictions we imposed on the wireline carriers, as discussed above, would be sufficient to prevent anticompetitive practices. We did, however, prohibit the 646 FCC 2d at 756.provision of fleet call dispatch service 7 because it was considered spectrally inefficient. 46 FCC 2d at 761. 8. Finally, we decided that only developmental systems would be authorized at the time. This was done to provide enough time for optimal development of cellular system technology before the adoption of rules 'for commercial operation. The guidelines for cellular developmental applications were set forth in Appendix \" Cof the Second Reports -9. A year later, in response to petitions for reconsideration of our Second Report and Order, we made -additional modifications. Memorandum Opinion and Order, 51 FCC 2d 945 (1975).9 Two changes were particularly significant. 10. First, we decided to permit the telephone companies to supply and maintain mobile equipment because such a prohibition could \"be a limiting factor, particularly during the beginning period of system operation.\" Id. at 952. However, we retained our restriction against the cellular system licensees manufacturing mobile equipment. 11. Second, we decided that any qualified entity-not just wireline carriers-would be eligible to apply for a cellular authorization. Id. at 953. We recognized that if the wfreline carriers were indeed the only entities with such resources and expertise, then the restriction was unnecessary. Id. at 953. In opening entry to entities other than wireline carriers, however, we emphasized that we were not relaxing our requirement that these frequencies be used only for the development of cellular'common carrier mobile service.10 In sum, because cellular systems would only be licensed on a developmental basis, we left to a future rulemaking final decision on the policies and technical requirements to be followed in processing applications for commercial cellular service. We recognized that we might need to revisit our earlier conclusions, including our one-to-a-market policy, in -light of new developments and experience. See id. at 954. 71Feet call dispatch service enables a dispatcher atthe customer's premises to call several vehicles simultaneously. 46 FCC 2d at 761. 846 FCC 2d at 76L Developmental applicants were not subject to all of the restrictions discussed in paragraph 6, supra.

Indeed, we stated. \"We will not consider any appllcation for frequencies within the 40 MHz allocation In the Domestic Public Radio Service unless a cellular system is proposed.\" 51 FCC 2d at 953. Cf. ARCH, 66 FCC 2d 496 (1977) (rejecting non-cellular applicationi n the band reserved for cellular systems).12. The NARUC Decision, The Court of Appeals, in NARUC v. FCC, supra, note 1,'upheld our allocation of 40 MI4z for cellular systems as a reasonable exercise of the Commission's administrative discretion. In affirming the Commission's action, however, the Court did express doubts as to the effect on competition should AT&T become dominant in the provision of cellular service.' 525 F. 2d at 636. This concern arose from an apprehension that AT&T would ultimately \"operate most, if not all, of the cellular systems eventually put into operation.\" n Such a \"virtual monopoly\" in the hands of AT&T, the Court noted, would seemingly give It dominance over (or at least significant market power in] the fields of radio telephone service and dispatch . communication-two fields presently characterized, the Court observed, by healthy competition. In this regard the Court noteh our-affirmance of the 40 MHz allocation_ for the development of a cellular common carier system Is with the implicit recognition that It may be subject to successful challenges at some '-future date... We do not hold that the projected effects considered above would not constitute a breach of the antitrust component of the public convenience, interest and necessity standard, were they more Immediate in time or more susceptible of precise assessment. Nor do we nake any comment with regard to the particular applicability of antitrust statutes, which issue is not presently before us. Id. at 639. 13. The Court also expressed concern that the restrictions placed on AT&T to prevent anticompetitive effects would not be particularly effective. The Court reminded the Commissiol, therefore, of its obligation to supervise development systems with an eye to preventing anticompetitive effects, 525 F. 2d at 038. 14. The Development Systems. To date the Commission has authorized two developmental cellular systems: one Is operated by the Illinois Bell Telephone Company (EBT); the other by American Radio.Telephone Service, Inc. (ARTS). IBT's system covers the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area, while ARTS has-designed its system to cover the area from Washington, D.C., and its 21525 F. 2d at 636. This belief was based on the fact that AT&T had originally proposed the cellular system and had made a substantial Investment In its development, and It was bolstered by the Commission's apparent doubts, see 51 FCC 2d at 953, whether non-wirelino carriers would be able to muster the resources and expertise for development of cellular systems. But see ARTS, 00 FCC 2d 401 (1977) (non-wireline developmental system was authorized). Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules suburbs through Baltimore, Maryland. Both systems were authorized in 1977.12 In authorizing the IBT system we required that it be scaled down substantially from the-original proposal in order to avoid an undue impact on competition; we also required IBT to submit a detailed economic and financial report at the end of its market service test, before the second phase of the developmental system would be authorized.1s 15. We had originally stated that developmental authorizations would last only through January 1,1979, as we expected to have adopted rules for commercial operationby that time. 51 FCC 2d at 955. We later extended that time by one year and invited further developmental applications. Cellular Mobile Systems, 70 FCC 2d 1639 (1978). At this time we have received eleven quarterly developmental reports from IBT and eight from ARTS. These reports are intended to yield data which will be used in this proceeding. C. Discussion 16. In Docket 18262, we concluded that spectrum relief for the land mobile radio services could be achieved by the development of a nationwide compatible \"cellular\" mobile radio communications system. It is not the intent of this proceeding to question the merits of cellular technology or whether the demand for mobile services is likely to be satisfied without it. Rather, we are concerned here with, among other things, policies relating to the provision of mobile equipment and system facilities, their potential uses, and the market structure under which cellular mobile services will.be provided. Finalization of policies and rules concerning the wide-scale commercial offering of cellular mobile services has been contingent on the results of developmental operations and regulatory experience. The purpose of this proceeding, therefore, is to address those issues essential to the policies and rules so that commercial operation of cellular mobile communications services may begin as soon as possible. To the extent it is feasible and consistent with due process requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is our intent to make the necessary policy determinations and to adopt appropriate rules in this notice and comment 2 lols Bell Telephone Co., 63 FCC 2d 655 (1977). reconsidering 62 FCC 2d 436 (1976]. aff'dsub nom.

In attempting to establish policies and regulations appropriate for determining entry, eligibility, and the market structure of cellular systems, we first need to consider the influence of such systems on other services.\" In this regard, consideration must be given to the relationship of cellular mobile technology and the uses to which it may be put vis-a-vis other communications technologies and services. Related to this is the extent to which cellular mobile services may be used by the consumer as a complement or ' supplement to other communications services. To a large extent this involves a question of market definition. Perception of the relevant market for cellular mobile services is necessary for formulating appropriate regulatory policies relative to the provision of these services. Depending on what the relevant market is, different regulatory considerations may arise. For example, if cellular radio technology were to affect, either in its present or in Its foreseeable state of development, conventional wireline local exchange service, a different set of regulatory concerns would surface than if there were no actual or prospective competitive relationship between the two. 15The importance of the market definition, then. is to determine the public interest ramifications of cellular mobile development and utilization in light of other communications services which are, or may be, cross-elastic with. substitutable for, or complementary to cellular mobile services. 18. For purposes of analysis and comment we suggest that consideration be given to a] common carrier two-way mobile and b) conventional wireline telephone exchange as markets which cellular mobile systems may potentially affect. If two-way mobile service is the relevant market, because of a high cross-elasticity between the demand for cellular and non-cellular two-way '\"The outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable Interchangeabill of use or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product Itself and the substitutes for IL\" Brown Shoe Co. v. Urdted States. 370 US. 2K. 3(1202).iI& for example. the CommISSIOi should conclude that the actual or potential relevant market encompasses wireline local exchan e services it might be necessary to weigh the possible economies of integration, on the one band. against the potential extension ofmarketpowerby monopoly-based wirelina carrers and possible anticompetitive Incentives and opportunities which, such wireline carriers may have with respect to cellular systems. (See also paras. 27-9 infm. concerning the eligibility of wirellne carriers as cellular system licensees.)service, then we need to examine the impact of cellular operation on that market, recognizing cellular service, conventional common carrier two-way mobile telephone service, and private dispatch service as possible submarkets of the two-way market. 19. Cellular systems, however, may affect significantly an even broader market. While the uses of interconnected two-way mobile service may, perhaps, presently be perceived as separate and distinct from other services, part of this perception may relate to the generally lower quality achievable today on mobile versus landline systems. We anticipate that cellular systems, when they become operational, will be comparable in quality to landline message telephone service, and will be so perceived by consumers, especially in the portable mode. Nevertheless we do not expect. for reasons of price and use, that cellular service will easily substitute for all message telephone service. However, even if cellular systems do not offer the potential for being competitive with conventional wireline systems, cellular technology represents an evolutionary development which could be critical'to further convergence of radio and copper wire. As such, ownership and control of cellular systems could have material effect upon the pace and direction of radio technology. The Commission's obligations to future consumers may, therefore, counsel limiting the role of wireline carriers in the distribution of cellular service. (See, paras. 27-29, infra). We invite comment, therefore, on cellular's potential as a competitor of conventional two-way mobile service as well as a potential competitor of the wireline carrier's local exchange telephone service. We also seek comment on the appropriate regulatory constraints, if any, and public interest factors which should be considered with respect to a given market determination. Competitive Systems Within a Market 20. At the conclusion of Docket 1826Z, we planned to authorize, on a regular basis, only a single system to serve a given market or area.'LandMobile Service, 51 FCC 2d at 954. There are now reasons, however, why we should re-examine that approach. For instance, in the phst several years we have witnessed dramatic changes in regulatory policies: changes that have made possible the introduction of competitive goods and services in markets that had long remained closed to effective competition. The terminal equipment and the private line service markets are just two examples of where competition has benefitedthe consumer2861 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules by making available to him a variety of new options to serve his communications needs. In this environment, we deem it appropriate to reconsider our previous intention to license only one cellular operation per market. 21. In the case of cellular systems, the system design plan severely limits the number of facility-based competitors' that can enter a given local market and thus reduces the reliance we can place on marketplace forces, Cellular -- technology requires a relatively large- allocation to enable the system-(and ultimately the users) to realize the cost savings that make cellular systems attractive. This large allocation is necessary because each system requires its own switching equipment and base stations, and because each cell requires some minimum amount of spectrum at any one time. It is clear'hat within the 40 MHz allocation, the unit costs of a given cellular system fall as additional: spectrum is utilized by that.system. We believe, however,* that most ofthe economies can be realized at allocations significantly less than the full 40 MHz. Balanced against this spectrum-cost tradeoff are competitive considerations, i.e., the potential costs to society - resulting from above-competitive prices, and the loss of technological innovation and dynamism caused by insulation 'from competition.-Weighing the benefits of dconomies of scale against the benefits of competition, we propose that within the 40,MHz allocation, up to two carriers be licensed to provide cellular service in appropiate markets, consistent with the radio licensing provisions of the Act. Allodating 20 MHz to each two carriers appears to provide much of the cost savings from cellular technology as well as creates a competitive environment.16- 22. Whilewe recognize that our proposal to allow two firms to enter a market may not provide the most - competitive market structure, we'do feel. there are competitive advantages to diving the spectrum allocation between' two entities. Direct competition in a market can result in different technological approaches anti diversity of service options. Moreover, direct competition may provide some degree of price competition that otherwise would not be present. Two alternatives in the development and implementation of cellular systems can have meaningful competitive consequences in a given. market, if the two entities in that market approach cellular technology differently 'Sce paragraph 62. infra, for a discussion as to how, under this proposal. two 20 MHz allocations might be assigned among each carrier.and therefore differ in .their incentives to exjoloit the efficiencies'of cellular design. 23. In addition to the above proposal, we recognize that there are other possible approaches to accommodate potential entrants into this market.17 Because cellular technology has not been implemented commercially aiid because only two firms so far have been developing cellular systems, we are uncertain as to the feasibility and market implications associated with dividing the spectrum allocation among multiple entrants in a given market.'At this time we are not confident that we have before us the requisite information to enable us to make a public interest determination concerning how many firms should be allowed to compete in a local market and what the cost penalties associated with multiple entry might be. * Before coming to any definitive conclusion, we believe other alternatives should be explored. 24. One such alternative would be to allow the marketplace to determine the nuiiiber of firms that can efficiently. provide'cellular service in a local market. We believe that inquiry is appropriate as to whether we should consider dividing the 40 MHz allocation in a given market equally among all - applicants meeting whatever minimum requirements we.set and rely on the marketplace to determine how many of these cellular systems are viable over time. Under this scheme, one would expect that as competition evolves among the cellular systems in a market, inefficient operations would have to exit from the marketplace; and the number of competitors would shrink to the maximum efficient number. This assumes that firms will be able to readily exit from the market place if they are unable to compete effectively. Moreover, it is conceivable, that the spectrum assigned to any firm leaving a market could enter a pool that would be available to any new applicants willing to enter the market or, alternatively, be split equally among the surviving competitors. ITAttached as an appendix to this document Is a proposal which AT&T has distributed to the Commission. In advancing this proposal AT&T has submitted \"Draft Rules and Regulations\" which are hereby made a part of the record of this proceeding. -In addition to the various proposals we are putting forth for consideration, we believe that full and equal consideration should be given to AT&Ts proposal and any other proposals that might be lorthcoming. In order to provide an opportunity for public comment, however, additional proposals should be submitted within 30 days from the release of this Notice. Because we are'allowing 90 days for the filing of initial comnients, this should provide ample opportunity for public comment on any additional proposals.25. Not only would this proposal allow the marketplace to determine market structure, but it also offers the potential for, avoiding comparative hearings. Concern must be had for the potential for the comparative process to delay the actual implementation of cellular systems for years into the future, By assigning all qualified applicants frequencies and letting the marketplace determine how many will survive, we would not be forced to attempt to choose the \"best\" few applicants. An unlimited entry scheme offers the potential for the marketplace to determine the best service providers in terms of consumer acceptance and economic viability. 26. Accordingly, we Invite comment on the following issues: whether unlimited entry is an economically viable concept, how such a program might be implemented, what minimum requirements all applicants In a given market should meet how soon an applicant should be required to establish an operating system after being assigned frequencies before It would have to forfeit these frequencies, whether ,applicantswould be required to share a single group of setup channels in order to make this proposal feasible. In addition, we seek comment on any other matters that may be relevant t6 this ,unlimited entry scheme. EUgibility 27. We believe as a general principle that consumers are best served when all fitms are permitted to compete freely rather than when some are restricted or excluded from service offerings altogether. Inevitably, there are exceptions, 18 but we have made it a constant goal to hold these to a minimum. However, the potential for extension of a carrier's market power presently held in one market is a factor which-should be considered. Therefore, we believe that in establishing eligibility requirements, consideration should be given to the role wireline telephone companies should play in the provision of cellular mobile service within the same service areas in which they offer wireline telephone service. 28. Complicating any determination of appropriate regulatory arrangements for new technologies is the assessment of potential impact. A given new technology in its initial configurations may not pose any material competitive threat to an existing technology, but it might possess the potential to evolve into a formidable challenge to the embedded technology. In this context, 15See, e.g., Domestic Satellite Facilities, 35 FCC 2d 844 (1972).i I2862 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules we question whether some potential entrants may have an incentive to restrict the supply of cellular service, or otherwise limit its potential, as a means of maintaining their investment in their other services or equipment. This could result in an artificial increase in the price that consumers pay for communications services or in the carrier's failure to allow the cellular system to grow and evolve fully (both technologically and in service applications). Our obligation is not to disadvantage today's consumers or tomorrow's by licensing cellular systems to entities with incentives to refrain from fully exploiting the technology or by surrounding cellular licenses with regulatory requirements which will prevent the technology from being fully exploited. Moreover, the importance of maintaining the proper incentives for the dynamic evolution of communications technologies may warrant the payment of a premium by today's consumer for tommorow's. Yet, one of the most difficult of our decisions is the extent to which-we should inhibit entry or impose structural limitations in order to preserve or enhance the possibility that the new technology will be fully developed at some indeterminate future time, because either alternative carries the risk of adding costs to today's consumers.19 Nonetheless, we seek comment on the role wireline carriers should play in the provision of cellular mobile services within their service areas, or those of affiliated entities.2\u00b0In so doing we are not unmindfll of our previous findings with respect to the technical expertise, access to capital and nationwide compatibility which would attend participation by wireline carriers. However, ever increasing competition in the telecommunications industry, and specifically the potential for competition in the provision of cellular mobile service combined with greater appreciation for the potential technological evolution of mobile cellular technology suggest that adequate consideration be given to the cost/benefit tradeoffs associated with differing degrees of wireline carrier participation where the potential may \"Whether stfuctural limitations less severe than barring entry would suffice may be contingent upon the availability of cellular mobile services to the public on a resale basis. As toxesale in general, see paras. 34-3-, inf- - 2*Any concern we might have in this regard would represent a significant change from where we originally started. However, new questions arise because the Commission has seen the public interest benefits from competition over the past several years, and because we have learned that cellular systems may have the potential to compete in a market much broader than we had originally foreseen.exist for the extension of monopoly power.2 29. Our desire to promote different approaches to cellular development may still be largely thwarted, despite our proposal to assign two firms to a market, if only a very small number of firms are allowed to obtain the preponderance of these assignments nationwide. In the extreme, if the same two firms are granted the two cellular assignments in every city, we would have only two entities developing and Implementing this technology. Therefore, we inquire as to whether there should be any limitation on the number of licenses nationwide that any one entity may obtain in order to allow for the greatest possible diversity in technological development. In a similar vein, we also inquire as to whether there should be any separate restriction on the number of licenses a single entity might hold in the largest metropolitan areas f in fact only these markets will support full cellular development. In addition to providing for greater alternatives in technological concept and design, restricting the number of licenses held by any single entity might increase regulatory effectiveness in other ways. If the number of entities operating cellular systems throughout the country were increased, regulatory agencies would have more \"yardsticks\" on which to bade comparison of the performance of cellular operators under their jurisdiction. Such yard-stick competition could provide benchmarks for comparing system costs and prices of regulated services. Indeed, given the potential limits on direct competition in each market due to the spectrum-cost tradeoffs discussed above, yardstick competition might yield important regulatory information that may be utilized to ensure reasonable prices for cellular services. Equipment and Service 30. We have previously taken the position that cellular system licenses and their affiliates may not manufacture mobile equipment for use in their cellular systems except in the developmental phase.22 In our Memorandum Opinion, we reversed our determination, however, that carriers not be allowed to supply and maintain mobile equipment. This decision was based upon the conclusion \"that supply and maintenance of equipment may be a '\"It has been suggested that wirellne cariers may. in fact, be the only entities willing or capable of providing celuar mobile service In certain. eg. rural areas. =46 FCC 2d at 951-6Zlimiting factor, particularly during the beginning period of system operation.\" 2 31. We are no longer persuaded that supply and maintenance of mobile units would be a significant limiting factor. We feel a number of equipment vendors stand ready to serve this market and that more will enter as commercial cellular operations are commenced. We therefore seek comment on whether we should continue our policy of permitting carriers to supply and maintain mobile units for their systems, or whether we should limit carrier involvement in this area. We also seek comment on whether, f we continue to permit carriers to supply and maintain mobile units, carriers should be required to offer such equipment on a non-tariffed basis. We believe that the provision and maintenance of mobile equipment for cellular systems could be and should be a competitive business. This Commission does not regulate the supply and maintenance of equipment provided by non common-carrier vendors. As a general proposition we see no compelling need to regulate the supply or maintenance of mobile equipment. It would appear that by requiring carriers to unbundle the mobile unit from the transmission service and to de-tariff such equipment, we would (1) reduce the possibility of undetected cross-subsidization, (2) further competition. and (3) augment consumer choice, in the provision of mobile equipment. However, we also seek comment on whether carriers should be given the option of offering such equipment on either a tariffed or non-tariffed basis. 32. Since the final order Docket No. 18262, which included a proscription against manufacture of mobile units and base station equipment by cellular system licensees or their affiliates, we have had considerable experience with the furtherance of competition in the terminal equipment market. This leads us to inquire whether this proscription against manufacturing such equipment Is still warranted. We seek comment on whether removal of this proscription would be consonant with our belief, as stated in the preceding paragraph, that the mobile equipment market should be competitive. We also seek comment on whether this proscription should be removed to allow the manufacture of both mobile units and base station equipment. 33. Finally, we are also considering whether to require, as a condition of- license, that licensees or their affiliates which also design, develop or manufacture cellular system =Id at 952.2863 - 2864 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tdesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules components sell their technology at reasonable fees. We are concerned that such design, development or- manufacture by rate base regulated firms may have been financed by the monopoly ratepayer. We are also cognizant of the important relationship between risk and reward in business decision making. The merits of this suggestion are that it may accelerate the implementation of cellular systems and enable system developers to realize appropriate returns on their investments. 34. We are also seeking.cQmment on whether we should reverse our determination set forth in the Second Report, id., at 761, that cellular system licensees not provide fleet call dispatch service. \"Fleet call dispatch,\" whereby a single dispatcher can automatically call several vehicles simultaneously, was thought spectrally inefficient. We now seek comment on whether there have been technological developments which tend to lessen the degree of spectrum inefficiency that might result if licensees were allowed to proV;ide fleet call dispatch service. Resale of Cellular Services 35. Important in assessing the potential structures under which cellular services may evolve is an understanding of the viability of various marketing alternatives in light of their potential impact on the consumer. Consideratibij must be given to the competitive development of these services weighing, of course, technical and cost-related factors. In this regard, questions arise as to whether cellular system licensees should directly market services to the consumer, whether cellular services should be offered on a resale basis, and whether direct marketing and resale can co-exist within the same system. Whether resale is feasible and whether direct marketing and resale can co-exist appear dependent upon whether there is anything to \"resell\" to the consumer if -the system licensee directly markets cellular services.-It is unclear at this time whether resale of cellular mobile service is an economically viable option because it is not clear that services available to the consumer under a resale structure would be different from those obtainable from the system licensee acting as an-underlying carrier' 36. However, we recognize-that proscriptions against resale necessarily limit options available to consumers. Consequently, it is our intent not to allow restrictions on the resale-of cellular services if an entity wishes toengage in resale.24 Rather than make a premature determination regarding resale of cellular systems, we would prefer to let the marketplace decide whether resale is economically viable. Yet, for purposes of formulating policies relative to-entry, eligibility, and industry structure, consideration must be given to the various marketing alternatives by which these services can be provided. We recognize that if a resale structure is feasible, -it may afford consumers additional choices in equipment and service options and afford entreprenuers an opportunity to engage in various aspects of cellular mobile service. Accordingly, it is important that parties advocating resale as a viable option clearly set forth their perception of what exactly would be marketed and available to the consumer under a resale structure and to what extent the service could differ from that obtainable from the underlying carrier. Moreover, if resale is perceived as a competitive alternative of marketing cellular mobile servicbs, we inquire as to the nature and degree of regulation, if any, which we should exercise over those entities which may seek td offer such services on aresale basis.In addition, we invite comment on the implications of any resale structure relative to the corporate structure under which wireline carriers must provide cellular radio services.25 In this regard,,we also seek comment on the nature and degree of separation which should exist where separate subsidiary requirements are imposed. Federal-State Jurisdiction 37.1 In Docket No. 18262, we concluded that cellular service. should be designed to achieve nationwide compatibility. We have no reason to doubt the benefits of pursuing that policy today. Conimon carrier mobile telephone and dispatch services have an importantrole to play in our national telecommunications policy planning and we are particularly concerned that a cellular subscriber traveling outside of his local carrier's service area should be able to communicate over a cellular system in another city. The need for cellular nationwide compatibility is not solely to benefit the user of a car telephone, however. Its importance *applies equally t4Regulatory-Policies Concerning Resale and Shared Use of Common Carrier Servicea and Facilities (Resale and Shared Use), Docket No. 20097. 60 FCC 2d 261 (1976), recons, 62 FC.C.-2d 588 (1977]. affd American Telephqne and Telegraph Company v.

Compatibility Is also desirable because of its implications for mobile equipment supply and cost. Low user cost is a likely consequence of mass production of mobile units. Additional manufacturers would be likely to enter the mobile equipment market if the signaling complement, necessary for inter-system roaming, were standardized. An increase in the number of equipment suppliers Is likely to be ,conducive to price and product competition. 39. Many expect that the availability of cellular service 26 will increase the demand for mobile telephone service 'and foster a competitive environment. If state and local entry policies conflict with our intent to stimulate.tho growth of nationwide mobile communication service,,these expections may be frustrated. 40. Each cellular carrier will serve at one time as both a provider of local service and as an entry point into the nationwide cellular system and the public switched teldphone network. Thus, the cellular mobile service will be somewhat different In purpose from the traditional mobile services offered by common carriers. Those offerings, in the Domestic Public Land Mobile Radio Service, have generally been characterized as primarily \"local\" In nature, regardless of whether they are interconnected to the wireline network.27 Cellular systems, however, will serve both local and national purposes in providing to the consumer the ability to place a mobile radio call regardless of geographic location. 41. Our plan for the growth of a competitive nationwide industry to serve the communications needs of a highly mobile society could be frustrated by conflicting state regulation, If a state were to decide, for example, that it would franchise only one cellular system per market,28 the frequencies reserved by us for competitors of the franchised carrier would be unused, contrary to the spirit of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(g) that underlies this proceeding: to encourage the '!more effective use of radio in the public interest.\" 42. another source of potential conflict between federal and state entry requirements relating to cellular systems -2See; e.g., AT&T-Illinols Bell Telephone Company, Developmental System Report No. 10, at A111-2. , \"See, eg., Souris River Mut. Aid Tel. Corp., 20 FCC 275 (1960]. See also Mobile Tariff Filfs, 63 FCC 2d 579 (1975). \"See Mobilefone of Northwestern Pa. Inc. v. Commonwealth Tel. Co., 571 F.2d 141,147 (3d Cir. 1978] (citing Yellow Cab Co. v. Pa.'PUC 101 Pa, Super. 41, 54 A.2d 301 (1947)). Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules arises from the possibility that federal and local'authorities would apply different entry and technical standards. With respect to entry, both regulatory bodies may look to similar qualifying criteria but set different threshold requirements. We are concerned that such incompatibility between federal and local standards also could frustrate our goal of a nationwide compatible cellular network 43. We have committed a large block of spectrum to the development of cellular mobile telephone to meet the needs of this country for at least the remainder of the century. Our efforts to introduce cellular mobile in a competitive environment with nationwide compatibility, and without significant delay, could easily be frustrated if entry regulation and the development of technical standards were to remain, as they are now, a joint concern of the state and federal - agencies. See 47 C. F.R. \u00a7 22.13(f](2). Because some degree of uniformity in entry regulation is essential to our regulatory program, we intend to assert federal primacy with regard to certification of cellular operators. We request comments as to whether we should preempt the area of entry certification entirely, or whether instead, we should simply override inconsistent or conflicting state regulation. We have, in the past, expressed our view \"that the 'licensing' or 'franchising' functions are not among those reserved to the states\" pursuant to Sections 2(b) and 221(b) of the Communications Act29 51 FCC 2d at 974. We also believe that preemption of non-federal jurisdiction over technical standards is necessary to the achievement of a nationwide compatible system. 44. Our authority to preempt state regulation has been upheld where it is necessary to the intergrity of an interstate program. California v. FCC, 567 F. 2d 84 (D.C. Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1010 (1978) (FCC authorization of intrastate foreign exchange service overrode state restriction on use of facilities prohibiting such service). We expect that the traffic carried on cellular systems will be a mixture of interstate 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7-152(b]. 221(b). Even if Sections 2(b) and 221(b) were interpreted to embrace local authority over entry certification. those sections are expressly subject to the Commission's Section 301 licensing responsibilities. Our action is confined to assuring that our allocation program Is realized through centralized federal licensing. Although the Court of Appeals in NARUC did not find It necessary to decide the scope of Section 301 in order to alarm our preemption of state entry certification of entities not engaged in common carrier activities, the court did find our interpretation facially persuasive. 525 F.2d at 64&.and intrastate calls by both local and transient callers. To carry out the broad purposes of Section I of the Communications Act, we may assert jurisdiction over facilities which are used for both interstate and intrastate communications.31 To the extent that state regulations of these cellular facilities may conflict with our policies, we believe we have the authority to preempt state regulation. Comments are invited in this area. Treatment of Competing Applications 45. In our Memorandum Opinion in Docket 18262 we expressed concern that the process for comparative consideration of competing applications might cause significant delays in the implementation of cellular radiotelephone service. 51 FCC 2d at 954. In some markets we expected applications to be filed by several qualified entities. In those situations, we believed we would have to follow the traditional approach of designhting the applications for a comparative hearing, pursuant to Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, 326 U.S. 327 (1945). Because we are now considering the possibility of authorizing two systems per market, there may in some cases be no need for comparative hearings. For the most part, however, we still expect there to be more that two applicants in some areas. Long delays in making a seletion could impose substantial financial burdens on the applicants, inconvenience the public, and frustrate our goal of a nationwide compatible cellular service. It Is therefore our desire to consider all alternative procedures that may be available. Some alternatives to the present comparative process-a streamlined hearing procedure, ranking of applications on an objective basis, lotteries, and auctions--are outlined in the following paragraphs for purposes of comment. It is our tentative belief that a hybrid procedure can be developed to minimize the delay associated with the present comparative process, while retaining the benefits of comparing proposals that differ substantially on matters that may affect service to the 3'47 U.S.C. \u00a3 151 provides that one purpose of the Communications Act Is \"to make available. so far as possible, to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient.

We describe one hybrid procedure below. We Invite comments on these proposals. In addition, commenters should feel free to suggest other improvements to the existing comparative process. 46. Before describing alternative to the traditional comparative hearing, we shall explain a hybrid procedure that may aid in the expeditious resolution of comparative licensing cases. This hybrid proposal would retain the traditional comparative hearing approach but would eliminate the need for comparsion except where there exist substantial and material differences between the applications. 47. We propose to examine which factors may be relevant in choosing from among mutually exclusive applicants for a cellular system. Traditionally the comparative process has focused on the nature and extent of the proposed service (including the rates, charges, maintenance, personnel, practices, classifications, regulations, and facilities), the areas and populations to be served, and the need for the proposed service in these areas. Other areas of comparison could include plans for phased growth through cell division, marketing plans and abilities, diversification or concentration of control of telecommunications media, and effect on competition. We invite suggestions as to what criteria, if any, should be used as the basis for comparative consideration. 48. Under the hybrid plan, mutally exclusive applicants would be designated for hearing to determine which applicant comparatively would better serve the public interest. (This assumes that all applicants were found qualfied.s If not, the qualifying issues would be resolved prior to the comparative hearing.) If the applicants failed in a post-designation pleading cycle to justify any superiority on any of the comparative criteria, or if the presiding officer found on balance several applicants equally qualified, a lottery or drawing would be held to determine the outcome of the hearing. A variation on this plan would be to require the parties to plead their comparative case prior to designation, with the applicants then being designated for hearing on only those Issues for which aprimafacte case had \"In docket No. 1822 we anticipated the establshment of strict qualifications requirements for cellular applicants.

Either of these approaches, coupled with a minimum number of threshbld or basic qualifications, would, in our judgment, expedite the selection of the successful applicant.34We invite comments on these hybrid approaches both as to their practicality and legality. 49. There do, of course, ex'ist other ways to expedite the comparative process. For example, the comparative hearing procedure could be streamlined by (1) establishment of a firm. deadline for the submission of issue pleadings related to the mutually exclusive applications; (2) adherence to.a strict timetable to be established at the outset by the presiding officer, (3) the use of written testimony as often as possible; and (4) the elimination of dross- examination except upon order of the presiding officer. 50. The comparative process also could be expedited if the Commission (or the Common Carrier Bureau acting pursuant to delegated authority) were to rank the applications in designating' them for comparative hearing. Such a ranking could be done on an objective basis using such factors as may be. determined in a rulemaking proceeding., The factors, and the weight given to each factor in ranking the applications, would ensure that the public interest would be adequately considered. After designation of the applications for hearing, the various applicants would have ample opportunity to take exception to the rankings. The presiding officer would decide which applicant should be granted a license; if several applicants were tied, a lottery, could be, used to determine the winner, or a limited comparative hearing could be conducted between the highest-ranked applicants. Commenters are requested to address the criteria which should be included as a basis for comparison and the relative weights that should be assigned to each factor. 51. Another alternative is simply to implement a lottery. A lottery would be used once the Commission decided that all of the applicants met the Commission's basic qualifications requirements. The use of auctions is another alternative that appears'to be economically and administratively efficient35 We invite comment on whether legislation is necessary to make this change inprocedure. 34we Invite comment on whether all factors should be given equal welght-once a determination of superiority Is made, or whether relative weights should be assigned at the conclusion of.thls rulemaking.I m See, e.g., Crandall. W., 'Tlacing a Value on. the Electro-Magnetic Spectrum,\" unpublished..Technical Standards 52. We are aware that certain areas, because of population density and other factors, will not require fully developed cellular systems. The cellular frequency allocation will be available to applicants-proposing cellular systems. But we do not propose to require a greater sophistication in design and equipment than is needed to meet current and foreseeable demand. Consistent with this approach, we expect that single cell systems may be appropriate-in some communities. However, systems must possess the capability of graceful growth into a fully developed configuration. We reiterate our objective of a nationwide \" compatible cellular service and our intent not to license systems incompatible with this objective.36 53. In the Memorandum Opinion we described the cellular system configuration with which applicants for developmental authorization for systems utilizing the frequencies at 825--845 MHz and 870-890 MHz would need to comply.3hT setting forth this description, we intended to provide for flexibility in design within the broad constraint of our policy determination that cellular development was the most appropriate use of the assigned frequencies. We were operating in the context of system proposals which had been received in response to the First Report which indicated that a cellular service was the most practical solution to perceived demand for mobile service over the planning peri&d- We have considered whether, in light of the passage of time and marketplace changes since the First Notice, cellular technology remains the most viable solution to the perceived demand for mobile service. Without-fordclosing alternative solutions in the future, we conclude that the objective of a nationwide compatible ligh capacity mobile telephone service will be achieved most efficiently by licensing systems at 825-845 MHz and 870-890 MHz which exhibit characteristics of cellular design. Although we do not expect all cellular systems to be designed in conformance with a single prototype, we will consider in the licensing phase whether the design features contemplated by applicants comply with the guidelines which we intend to adopt. 36We believe that rules applicable to.cellular service should be distinct from those of other service offerings presently on file. It is not our intent that rules presently applicable to the Domestic Public Land Mobile Radio Service, or any other service, automatically apply to 6allular service. 3746 FCC 2d at 954-55.54. While we are maintaining a policy of \"nationwide compatibility\" and a level of quality \"comparable to the landline network,\" we do not intend by inposition of these restrictions to unreasonably limit the discretion of system designers.38 We will focus our attention upon the network interface, so as to insure that our quality and comparability goals are not frustrated. Our concern is that failure to adopt certain technical standards may result in mobile equipment causing harmful externalities to other users. 55. There are three purposes to be served by technical standards for cellular systems: (1) defining \"cellular mobile radio\" for purposes of qualifying for cellular mobile radio operating licenses, (2) assurance of compatible operation of equipment on both local and national levels, and (3) maintenance of signal quality and other quality aspects bf system performance. We intend to adopt only the minimum technical standards necessary to accomplish those purposes.39 Wherever possible, detailed standards will be left to industry groups or other voluntary standards making bodies. Furthermore, we intend to adopt only performance standards (not equipment design standards), and only standards that apply at the interfaces between categories of equipment controlled by separate entities. 56. Having tentatively concluded that multiple entry into the cellular radio market is feasible and desirable, we expect to rely heavily on market forces to reduce or eliminate the need for quality standards. We will, however, entertain suggestions for quality standards if there are areas in which we are persuaded that market forces will not produce systems capable of quality comparable to the landline telephone network. However, in order to assure truly cellular use of cellular spectrum and to assure nationwide compatibility of equipment, some standards are necessary. 57. The Commission has already adopted certain design concept requirements for developmental cellular authorization.'0These include the following: 3$We also recognize that technical rules have economic consequences.

Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday; January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules (a] A bona fide cellular configuration of base station transmitters and receivers to cover the proposed service; 41 (b] Base station transmitters radiating no more radio frequency power than required to adequately cover each cell; 51 FCC 2d at 954; (c) Base stations copnected together through a common switching and control point using wirelines; id.; (d} A radio system fully inter- connected with the public landline telephone network and capable of providing a grade of service comparable to that of the landline system; Id. at 954- 55; (e) Narrow band frequency modulation for all voice channels in the radio system, and each radio channel not exceeding 40 kHz of authorized bandwidth; 1. at 955; (f0 Radio frequency channels employed within each cell trunked for greater spectrum efficiency; id; (g) For systems in metropolitan areas, the potential for orderly evolution into a highly efficient small-cell configuration capable of handling a large number of subscribers within the allocated 40 MI:Iz of spectrum; id.; and (h) Compatibility with other cellular systems.42 In item (c) we propose to eliminate the requirement that wirelines be used to connect base stations together. We see no reason to categorically exclude' microwave or optical links, although we expect wireline links, to be used in most cases. We further propose to change \"40 kHz of authorized bandwidth,\" to \".. 30 kHz channel spacing;\" (iteme]. It has been demonstrated that 30 kHz channel spacing can provide adequate service quality, so there sleems to be no need for a greater channels spacing.4 Even though under some signalling conditions the occupied bandwith may be greater than 30 kHz, careful geographic distribution of channel assignments can avoid adjacent channel interference. Except for these two modifications, we expect to adopt the above guidelines for operational cellular systems. We invite comments, however, on specific additions or modifications which maybe needed: 4'51 FCC 2d at 954. We noted that a \"cell\" was \"an identifiable geographic compartment within the system. Specific radio frequencies are used in one cell and are re-used in a non-adjacent cell in some other part of the system. Only a fraction of the assigned radio channels are used in any one cell.\" Id. at n. 17. 451 FCC 2d at 1009. Appendix F. IV (0]; see FCC 2d 1639, 1641-42., n. 11 (1178). 4The proposed change from 40 kHz to 30 kiz Is a result of developmental experience with the ET system which suggests that a 30 kHz radio channel is reasonable.58. The most important compatibility standards will be those applicable to the interface between mobile units and the cell site. We believe the interface between the cellular system itself and the wireline telephone system is addressed sufficiently by our present rules. We specifically do not propose Commission standards for the interface between the system switching logic and the cell sites. It would appear that these system components must be controlled by a single entity. That controlling entity should have the freedom to place logic and other functions in the cell base sites and switching hardware at its discretion. Such choices might vary significantly, depending on the size and other factors of the individual communities for which the system is designed. 59. There are a number of parameters- for which technical standards at the mobile/cell site interface may be needed. For example, frequency channelling plan is probably necessary for compatibility between base stations and mobile units. We specifically request comment on the frequency location of the setup channels. A fundamental question relating to the setup channels is whether a single set of setup channels can be shared between two (or even more than two) service providers in a given area, or each service provider must have its own complement of setup channels. 60. In the context ofnationwide compatibility, we would like comment on whether it is necessary that every mobile or portable unit be capable of using every one of the available cellular channels. The maximum spectrum we are considering-60 MHz, including the 20 MHz of reserve-corresponds to 1,000 radio channels. We would like commenters to address both the technical and economic feasibility aspects of this question. 61. We recognized that there are many other parameters and protocols which must be standardized at the cell/mobile interface if full compatibility is to be achieved. We invite assistance on specific identification of those which must be adopted by the Commission. 62. We also seek comment regarding allocation of discrete blocks of frequencies to specific users. If, for example, we were to allow two entrants per market, we would propose to award the bands 825-835 MHz and 870-880 MHz -Iz and 880-890 MHz to a second applicant. Parties seeking licenses would not be permitted to request specific assignments. As an alternative we seek comment on whether discrete blocks of frequenciesshould be awarded for the exclusive use by wireline carries in the event there is more than one license per market. 63. Granting licenses in this manner is based on the belief that the propagation characteristics of frequencies in the cellular bands are sufficiently similar as not to justify claims of parties that they are entitled to particular frequencies because these frequencies would better enable them to serve the public. We also believe that the number of comparative hearings will be reduced if applicants are required to demonstrate qualifications in a single proceeding. It Is desirable that hearings be minimied. consistent with the maintenance of due process procedures and that applicants not be required to make separate applications for discrete assignments. Spectrum Allocation 64. In our 1974 Second Report \"we reduced the allocation for cellular systems from 64 MHz to 40 MHz. We expressed the belief that a 40 MHz allocation was sufficient to meet the needs of cellular users for the foreseeable future. We explained that: A 40 Mz cellular system utilizing 40 KHz channeling should have an ultimate capacity to handle about 105,000 telephone subscribers and 105,000 dispatch users (See AT&T December 1970 filing. page 40]. This is sufficient capacity to handle the predicted market for mobile telephone to theyear 190 in the largest cities, plus one quarter or more of the dispatch market in those areas. There is however, considerable uncertainty involved in predicting the mobile telephone market. This uncertainty results primarily from the possibility of the service developing into a consumer item. For this reason we have also strategically placed spectrum reserves totalling 20 MHz in proximity to the cellular allocation which could be used in the event of unexpected growth. We must stress however, that the marketing studies submitted to the Commission do not indicate that such would be the case, at least in the foreseeable future.\" We suspect that the market for cellular service has probably changed since 1974. For example, advances in technology have made the availability of portable service more likely in the next several years. In addition. consumer perception of cellular service may have changed. As a result. a larger allocation than originally contemplated may be appropriate. We also recognize that should we license more than one system in certain areas there may be a spectrum \"4aFCC2dat758. \"IdL at 758-757.2867 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15; 1980 / Proposed Rules efficiency loss which may have to be compensated for by the allocation of certain of the reserve spectrum. 65. In considering whether release of the 20 MHz block of reserve spectrum would be in the public interest, we believe the following factors should be weighed In making any such determination: (1) Comparison of the dollar cost of mature cellular systems using a 40 MHz allocation compared with a 60 MHz allocation, based on knowledge obtained in the development up to 40 MHz, and including the costs of mobile and portable units required as w6ll as - costs of fixed plant; I (2) Estimates of the ultimate cellular market, based on the record as of the time the first 40 MHz is nearly fully occupied; (3) Estimates of the time required for full utilization of the additional 20 MHz; and (4) Comparison of all of the above factors with other competing demands for the 20 MHz block of spectrum.46in this regard, ve invite comment from parties which might have alternative plans for us6 of the reserve spectrum: 66. We also seek comment on ways in which our rules can encourage compatibility with digital technblogy. As presently designed, the cellular system will employ analog circuits for voice transmission. It may be-desirable to employ digital techniques in the future. Since technology and cost trends seem to be favoring digital over analog signal processing techniques, and since we see digital techniques becoming increasingly incorporated in communications networks, considerations of system architecture suggest that the public-may be better served by a digital cellular system. Besides facilitating connectivity and otherwise contributing to a more compatible communications infrastructure, digital techniques employed in cellular radio may be appropriate for the purposes of increasing privacy and spectral \"Proposals for uses of additional frequencies in the land mobile bands at 800 and 900 MHz presently on file Include (1) United Telecommunications Council, 1.25 MHz, for utility load management; (2) National Association of Broadcasters, 5 MHz, for broadcast auxiliary service; (3) Telocator Network of America and the Ad Hoc Private Paging Committee, 3 MHz, for public and private paging systems; (4) NASA. 8 MHz. for the use and development of systems using space radio communications techniques: (5) a public air-ground radiotelephone service, 12 MH-z (6) NTIA. 13.5 MIIz, for government use: (7) the Private Radio Bureau. 24 MHz. for conventional and trunked system use in international border areas; (8) the UHF.Task Force. 9.5 MHz, for aeronautical and maritime mobile. services: (9) the Personal Radio Planning Group, 4-5 MHz, for a personal radio service: (10) estimated requirements of private dispatch users over the next ten years Is 11 MHz.efficiency. Thus, even if we do not mandate the use of digital techniques, we may wish to assure that our rules allow the graceful evolution of an analog cellular system to a digital one. Parties wishing to comment on the role of digital technology in the baids allocated for cellular service may do so inthis proceeding. Conclusion 67. Although certain aspects of this Notice are narrowly focused, parties may submit comments on all matters which they deem relevant to this proceeding. We do reiterate, however, our commitment that the bandstreserved for common carrier cellular service will not be used for systems exhibiting a non-cellular design. 68.

Federal Communications Commisslon.'7 William J. Tricarico, Secretary. Appendix Notes on CellularMobile Telephone Service\" Introdction. The Bell Systeni Is fully supportive of the FCC's stated goal of providing nationwide compatible mobile service to the public. Encouraged by the Commission's goal, we have spent approximately 100 million dollars developing and demonstrating the feasibility of cellular technology capable of nationwide application in serving the public need. Indeed, it was the Commission's foresight in looking toward broad application that justified this research and development effort. Our trial of cellular service in Chicago has exceeded our expectations. It has proven, without question, that cellular service moots an'important customer need. Time after time, trial users have expressed the thought that this service offers a major productivity inmprovement; adds measurable communications value; and improves decision making capability. The following notes cover some of the pertinent aspects of the cellular service development and its future. History Leading to Chicago Development Trial. Today's mobile service leaves much to be desired. There are only 23 IMTS channels available nationwide to provide mobile service for customers of wire-line common carriers. In New York City only 12 of the 23 channels can be utilized due to today's environment and techiology. This means that for wirellne customers, only 12 simultaneous conversations, in a city of 8,000,000, can take 47Seo attached statements by Chairman Forris, Commissioners Fogarty, Quello and Jones.S2868 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules place. Another difficultywith today's- technology is relatively high power levels. When a channel is being used in a particular area it cannot be reused within about 75 miles, as interference between channels occurs. Thus, in the example above, the 12 channels assigned in New York City arenot available to the outlying areas of NewJersey and Connecticut. Limited service availability has resulted In, large numbers of customers on \"waiting lists\"-to the degree that the FCC established priorities so that those who had a greater need for the service, ie., medical. etc, would have a better opportunity to obtain it. Service in most metropolitan areas cannot satisfy the demand. In New York, for example, people have literally been waiting years for service with no relief in sight. Even with the discouraging prospects of ever getting service, and the resultant hesitance to apply, there are about 25,000 customers on our waiting lists around the country. In addition, even when a customer is able to obtain service, he frequently is unable to complete calls during the busy hours because of channel congestion. In some areas two out of every three call attempts are unsuccessful during the busy hour. Further, evenwhen a customer is on a channel present technology- is such that significant fading or deterioration of service quaity occurs inmost downtown areas and in widely varying terrain due to signal shielding and insufficient penetration. In recognition of these conditions, the FCC instituted Docket 18262 in 1968. The Commission invited industryparticipation and the Bell System responded, in December 1971, with a technical report which demonstrated how a cellular system might be configured. n.early 1975 the Commission modified earlier actions. which limited cellular frequency allocations to wireline carriers; specifically, it opened the 40 MHz cellular allocation for common carrier service to \"any qualified entity.\" In July 1975, Illinois Bell Telephone (IBTI fied an application fora developmental cellular trial in Chicago and its application was granted March 3.1977. On March 10, 1977, AT&T, Bell Labs and IBT initiated a developmental program which encompassed a technical trial, a market trial and a cellular test bed program. These activities were designed to produce detailed informatio i on cellular technology, customer acceptance and public need for the Commission to use in its rulemaking. Chicago Developmental Trial and the PublicNeed. The developmental trial has progressed on schedule and is essentially completed. Ten developmental reports have been submitted to the FC.These reports demonstrate that the trial has fulfilled its technical and public acceptance objectives. They have conclusively shown that cellular mobile systems will meet the Commission's goal of satisfying the large public need and demand for high quality, readily accessible mobile telephone service. At present more than.1,000 Chicago business and professional people are participating in the AMPS trial. Customer response to the trial service indicates that tens of thousands of potential customers in Chicago would eagerly buy the service if itwere commercially available. In fact. In Chicago, with only word of mouth publlcity, about 1,000 potential customers have inquired as to how they might obtain service, even on a trial basis. Cellular mobile systems, when in service, will eliminate the inordinate delays historically (and currently) experienced by the public in obtainin mobile telephone service. Elimination of these long waiting periods is, by itself, a significant contribution to the public interest. Consider also the benefit of having AMPS available to persons who have a medical or public safety need for, constant reliable communications, without the obstacles of priorities and extended waiting lists. These benefits make a sufficient contribution to the public interest to dictate the offering of cellular service to'the public as soon as possible. In addition, increased productivity, personal safety and convenience add measurably to the demonstration of need for this service now. As an interesting sidelight. Bell has offered all companies (more than 50) known to have interest in mobile set manufacturing, the opportunity to test their equipment in our Chicago Developmental System. Four have taken advantage of this opportunity. Fujitsu and Hitachi, have completed their testing programs. Nippon Electric Co. (NEC] and Mitsubishi are in the design process and will deliver equipment for testing In the near future. (Under Commission order. Bell Is precluded from manufacturing mobile equipment for use in permanent cellular systems.) The suppliers of mobile sets In the Chicago trial are OKL E. F. Johnson and Motorola. Spectrum Efciency, Compatibilty and Viability. The Commission has repeatedly expressed Its objectives of spectrum efficiency and nationwide compatibility in. a modem mobile communications network. Cellular technology Is a really significant breakthrough in spectrum efficlency. Its frequency reuse concept allows many more simultaneous calls per frequency slot than present systems, thus optimizing spectrum efficiency. In short, it solves the spectrum shortage problem formobile users. For example, in the New York area with today's wireline mobile system, a maximum of 12 persons can call simultaneously: In a New York area served by a mature cellular system thousands of calls could be handled simultaneously. Cellular providetusers the equivalent of wireline service In their car. Plainly. regulators and carriers are obligated to bring this breakthrough to public use as soon as possible. We believe the AMPS trial has shown that a service which meets those spectrum efficiency objectives is now available for public use. The various characteristics of RF propagation and performance. interference problems, hand-off and channel reuse have been studied, analyzed and reported In detail to the Commission. all of which conclusively shows that cellular systems are efficient, will meet the needs of the most critical customer, and are here today. And, tomorrow's innovations will in all likelihood greatly increase their viability with the application of AMPS to digital and data services, maritime use, and automatic sensor functions:A TZrs Proposal-Structure. Spectr m nd Timely Service. The dilemma faced is that if the existing Docket 18262 rules-calling for one cellular system per market area-are adopted, multiple carriers, competing for the same market area. will become involved in time consuming and costly comparative hearings. The experience of similar ground rules In Air-Ground Service, indicate that under those conditions the public will not obtain the Intended benefit of cellular service within the next decade. Although the first Air-Ground station went into service in the late 50s some large metro areas, forwhich applications were filed almost ten years ago, have no ground stations even today. In addition, the Court of Appeals has expressed its concerns regarding possible anticompetitive aspects of current cellular allocations and harimplied that future challenges can be expected. Such challenges obviously lead to substantial delay. It appears that the public faces delay after delay in realizing the benefits of this proven service advancement unless solutions are found and promulgated. AT&T has proposed a plan which would satisfy the expressed concerns and permit the early introduction of commercial cellular systems. Presently, 40 MHz Is specifically allocated to Cellular service and a total of 45 MHz is allocated as reserve. An appropriate portion of the reserve Is adjacent to the present cellular allocations to provide for natural growth without cellular design changes. Specifically, AT&T has proposedi (1) frequency considerations as follows- -400-Mzpresently allocated to cellular reassigned to: e 20Mz asslgned. to the wireline caier In each market area e 20MHz assigned to non-wireline carriers In each market area -20 MHz of the adjacent frequencies. presently in the 45 MHz reserve for cellular and non-cellular, reallocated to a cellular service \"reserve pool\" available to both wireline and non-wireline carrier. This makes provision for timely assignment of the 3oMHz total required foran economically viable system design. For example.whn the public damand is sufficient, the FCC would be requested to authorize an additional 10 MHz prior to the splitting ofcells. Should public demand exhausta carrier's 30 MHz. and a second carrierhasnot entered the market at that location, an additional 10 MHzmay be requested to take advantage of the optimum economies of a 40 MHz system. This request could be granted upon a determination of public interest by the FCC. (2) Carriers authorized to provide cellular service would be authorized to provide Cellular system call carrying capacity to other common carriers at the same price they provide such capacity to their own distribution entities. Based on Bells Chicago trial results, small carriers distributing from a wimline system could realize a substantial income with no' capital investment risks. With capital nvestment n mobile units, they could attain even higher income. Non-wireline carrier large and small. would have the opportunity2869 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / -Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Proposed Rules to format their service offerings, in any manner they select in providing more specialized services to the public. They could combine their cellular service with present offerings, e.g., answering, paging, or \" secretarial; or they could offer new or add-on services. They could become involved in provision, installation and maintenance of mobile sets as a business opportunity apart 'from comm6n carrier activities. The above proposals bear on the spectrum allocation issue and specifically the amount 'of spectrum required for a cost efficient cellular design. It is generally agreed that the present 40 MHz allocation permits the most efficient system design. Comparatively, a 20 MHz system (excluding in-car mobile units and interconnect transmission facilities] requires investment of about 2.3 times as much; a 30 MHz system would be about 1.4 times as costly. Our proposal for reallocation and splitof the frequency band is based on analyses which indicate that it requires a system design parameter of 30 MHz to be economically viable in many markets. The. increased cost of a 20 MHz system may reduce the number of users to the point where many systems would not be viable. Thus, we recommend the commitment of 20 megahertz of the adjacent land mobile reserve to cellular which permits viable 30 MHz designed systems for competing carriers. Mobile units would be designed to operate over the full 60 MHz of the two competing systems.' ,, _AT&T agrees that c'ross-subsidizatibn of AMPS is to be avoided. It Is committed to an organizational structure and accounting methods that achieve-that objective together with the objective of viable cellular service for the long term. We believe that the structure decided upon must allow the synergistic benefits of vertical integration if the public is to receive long run maximum benefit. The benefits of AT&T's proposal are prompt introduction of a sorely needed service to the public, elimination of the delays inherent in comparative hearings, introduction of competition in the provision of cellular system capacity, and competition in the distribution of service to the end users in all cellular markets, including those with only one cellular system supplier. It will enable small carriers, who cannot make the capital investment or technically support a cellylar system of their own, to participate in cellular offerings to the public. _ AT&T envisions a near-term scenario wherein telepone companies would \" undertake to furnish cellular service in major American cities. As quickly as feasible, service would spread to smaller markets. Our customers and our regulators, both Federal and State, would, no doubt, encourage movement toward widespread availability of service. The mix of competing firms that undertake to provide cellular service will be determined by future events, but AT&T has made clear that it expects to apply for and furnish service on a widespread basis. Its past investments of both dollars and research resources could only be justified by the prospect of a major deployment of cellular service. The Lottery Question. Another issue, quite controversial at this time, is the concept of a.lottery for frequency allocation. Although the Commission has, in the matter of the FM broadcasting proceeding involving three applicants in the Media, Pa. area, designated, the lottery question for review, lottery has not been used to date due to Its many uncertainties. AT&T has previously expressed its doubts concerning the legality -and workability of a lottery.,Long court delays are a virtual certainty and will likely hinder, if not preclude, ever achieving truly-nationwide cellular service. .Sumapary The Bell System Is ready to begin installation of cellular systems in major metropolitan areas immediately upon.i issuance of satisfactory technical rules and the granting of construction permits. Itis prepared to do so in a competitive -.. environment and would commit to having service in 35 mobile serving areas covering 70 major cities by 1985 if rules are finalized in the first half of 1980 and to broaden the service to smaller markets as soon as feasible. It would provide capacity to authorized non-wireline carriers under mutually favorable terms and conditions. They may,. therefore, choose to distribute service Provided by AT&T or participate in the, provision of a competing network. The distribution agreements with non- wireline carriers will contain the same terms and conditions as those used for the distribution funqtion for Bell System companies. - Adoption of this proposal will have the ,following benefits-as compared with present FCC proposed industry structure:' (a) Expeditiously provide a much needed service to the public by eliminating costly comparative hearings that could delay service indefinitely, .(b) Offer an option for small non-wireline carriers to provide cellular services without the high initial investment required to provide cellular capacity;, (c) Maximize competition at the retail level by encouraging a wide variety of end user suppliers; . f: - -' (d) Provide for competition in the provision, of cellular system capacity in each metropolitan area, and (e) Encourage a Bell System commitment to serve this burgeoning public need and at the same time facilitate the Commission's interest in competition. November, 1979. November 30,1979.' Additional Statement of CharlesD. Ferris, Chairman Re: An Inquiry into the Use of the Bands 825- 845 MHz and 870--890 MHz for Celluar Communications Systems Over the last 11 years the Commission has attempted to foster a new form of mobile telephone service. During my term as Chairman I have seen substantial progress in this area and I look for even more in the near future. Today's Commission action places us firmly on the road toward a new age in mobile telephone service. I will do everything possible to expedite the provision of cellular mobile telephone service to the American consumer because I believe that this service'sspectrum efficiency and high quality will revolutionize the marketplace. Separate Statement of Commissioner Joseph R. Fogarty in Which Commissioners Jamos H. Quells and Anne P. Jones Join In Rb: Notice of Inquiry and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking--Cellular Communications Systems. The Commission has already firmly determined that the implementation of cellular service nationwide Is technically feasible and highly desirable from the standpoint of consumer Interest. We therefore should be moving as expeditiously as possible to provide-the necessary regulatory framework so that this great potential service may become a inarketplaco reality; In this regard, I am pleased'that this Notice Is sufficiently broad to allow the Commission to promulgate the necessary regulatory structure and requirements at the end of one comment period, The Commission's Notice properly Identifies nine Issue areas for comment (1,., market definitions, competitive systems within a market, eligibility, equipment, resale, jurisdiction, competing applications, technical standards, and spectrum allocation). In this regard, I recognize that'the Court of Appeals decision in NARUC v. FCC, 525 F.2d 630 (D.C. Cir. 1976), necessarily implicates questions of competition In many of these areas. At this point, however, I am equally concerned that the potential benefits of wireline carrier participation in the provision of cellular service, which the Commission has previously Identified, not ba ignored. In this SecondReport and Order in this proceeding, the Commission specifically found that important benefits of technical , expertise, access to capital, and nationwide compatibility would attend participation by wireline carriers in the provision of cellular service. This Notice Is clearly structured to provide an approprfate vehicle for assessing and determining these critical trade-offs. A final concern I have relates to whether wireline carriers should be permitted to manufacture, supply, and maintain mobile equipment used in cellular systems and, If so, whether such offering should be allowed on a tarriffed as well as non-tariffed basis.-In this connection, while the provision of mobile equipment on a competitive basis Is consistent with Commission policies In the field of terminal equipment generally, I believe the Commission should examine whether or, not the consumer should be free to obtain mobile equipment from a carrier on a tariffed basis. The high cost of mobile equipment might make such a tariff option extremely attractive to many users. Cellular mobile telephone service Is an exciting concept, and I am confident that the Commission will be able to expedite its consideration and decision In this proceeding so that the American people will soon have the full benefits of this significant technology.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commission is beginning a rulemaking proceeding to establish special temporary rules which would provide a simplified procedure enabling (1) any carrier holding one-way operating authority issued by this Commission to transport one or more commodities to receive special limited authority to transport return loads (new shipments originating at the already authorized destination territory, rather than the return transportation of rejected, orirefiised shipments) moving within the scope of its commodity and territorial authority and restrictions, and (2) any carrier now holding authority to transport regulated commodities to receive special limited authority to transport agricultural commodities in mixed loads. The proposed special temporary rules, set forth below, would be effective for a period of 180 days. The Commission is seeking comments on the desirability of making these changes permanent. The rulemaking is in response'to the current shortage of dieselfuel supplies in the United States. DATES: Written comments are due on or before February 14,1980. Proposed effective date: Upon publication of final rules in the Federal Register. ADDRESSES:. An original and 15 copies, if possible, of any comments should be sent to: Office of Proceedings, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACTI Donald J. Shaw, Jr., (202) 275-72924 or Howell L Sporn, (202] 275-7575. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. Background A fuel energy crisis exists within the United States. Shortages in fuel supplies and increases in the price of diesel fuel are causing disruptions in service to those shippers dependent on motor carrier transportation. The adequacy of supply available to users of middle distillates for heating, for diesel truck supplies, and other uses continues to be tenuous and appears likely to worsen as trucking operations grow. Limited opportunity exists to shift refining capacity to increase total diesel supply.Recognizing the limitations In supply, the President has made the need to reduce consumption an urgent national mandate. The Commission believes that there may be a need to authorize temporarily (1] carriers holding one-way authority from the Commission to transport return loads moving within the scope of the carrier's commodity and territorial authority and restrictions, and (2) carriers holding any common or contract carrier authority to transport so-called exempt agricultural commodities when moving in the same vehicle and at the same time as so-called regulated commodities which the carrier is already authorized to transport. Procedural Matters The Commission intends to reach a decision on this mdtter within a short period of time after the comments have been received. If final rules are adopted, we propose that they be made effective upon publication in the Federal Register. As noted above, the purpose of the proposed rules is to achieve fuel conservation. If there were a delay in the effective date of the proposed rules after the final rulemaking, affected carriers would be unable to take full advantage of this proposed fuel conservation measure when It is most needed. During the fall and winter months the demand for middle distillates is greatest. Therefore, If final rules are adopted, we believe that there would be good cause to make them effective upon publication. See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).Under 49 U.S.C. 10321, this Commission is empowered to administer, execute, and enforce all provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, to make all necessary orders, and to prescribe rules, regulations and procedures for such administration. While ordinarily the Commission performs its licensing functions on case- by-case basis, we perceive the appropriate exercise of our rulemaking authority as a vital means of efficiently carrying out our statutory mandate. The United States Supreme Court has recognized the propriety of rulemaking by a regulatory agency charged with licensing duties as a necessary alternative to the case-by-case adjudication method where the litigation of certain issues would only be time- 'wasteful and where the comprehensive treatment of these issues through the rulemaking process may be required to afford expeditious, effective relief in the public interest. 1 This Commission has in I See Weinberger v. Hynsan. Westcott 6Dwfi& 412 US. 600 (173). U.S. v. Storer Broadcasting Co.,the past, through rulemakings, made a general finding of public convenience and necessity on a nationwide basis to address a specific problem or inequitable situation.2In view of the Immediacy of the fuel crises, we believe that rulemaking presents the only viable approach for achieving signigicant fuel conservation. Background of Proposed Special Temporary Rules In freight transportation, a constant goal Is to achieve optimum vehicle use. During a time of limited fuel supply, this key factor is reinforced by escalating fuel costs. The extent of the problem of empty versus loaded truck movement have been documented by the Commission in Its Bureaus of Economics' and Operations' study entitled Emptyl Loaded Truck Miles on Interstate Ighways During 1976, (Interstate Commerce Commission, April 1979). This report showed, among other things, that 20.4 percent of all truck miles on the interstate highway system are with empty units. Sixteen point two percent of authorized carrier miles are empty. A special subsample analysis estimated that- class I regular-route scheduled common carriers operated 9.6 percent empty truck miles, while class I irregular-route non-radial common carriers operated more than double that or 21.4 percent empty truck miles.3 Similarly, a high degree of empty miles were estimated for carriers operating certain types of equipment. such as: flat- bed or low-boy trailers, 22.8 percent; tank trucks, 41.5 percent; and bulk equipment, 40.1 percent.4 Such relatively high empty mileage operations are characteristic of operations responding to the need of markets in which specialized equipment is used to provide transportation services. This equipment is operated by carriers which hold irregular-route authority and that authority is often granted by the Commission on a one-way basis (from origin point or area to market destination). The study, however, makes observations as to some of the reasons for these empty miles of vehicle 351 U.S. 192 (1955. and FederalPwerCommL .

Foremost are traffic imbalances which. result in a difference in the number of loads going into and coming out of-an area. A second cause for emptiness is the use of equipment so specialized as to preclude its use in backhaul movements (subh as tank trucks and auto carriers). In these instances, even though a load might be available in the same area in which the truck is ' unloaded, the truck could not haul it unless it were compatible with the available equipment. Little can be done to reduce empty truck miles resulting : from this short of'a major shifting of population/production centers or by major changes in packaging to enable the use of general purpose vehicles. Nevertheless, the substantial number of empty miles actually operated offers a challenge for dealing with impediments causing empty miles and opportunity for reducing empty miles in the interests of both fuel economy and efficiency. Backhaul Movements Recent information developed by a group of bulk carriers by tank vehicle decribed the backhaul situation for their segment of the industry in a May 1979, petition for return movement authority. Nine petitioners indicated they operated a total of 164,935,213 miles in 1977, of which 76,788, 254 or 47 percent were empty (and non-productive). Based upon an average fuel consumption of 4 miles per gallon, the petitioners assert they consumed 19,197,063 gallons of diesel fuel in non-production operations during 1977. Collectively, petitioners indicate they operate pursuant to 1,850 grants of authority, of which 1,809 or 98 percent are limited to one-way operations. Further, the petitioners estimate that10\" to 20 percent of their empty mileage could be saved if they were granted authority to handle return movements in the equipment used-to perform the initial one-way service. This would, on a 15 percent average, equal savings of 2,879,559 gallons per year or 319,951 gallons per carrier. Although this saving reflects the potential of only 9 specialized carriers, there is reason to believe that their operating conditions may not materially differ from approximately 300 regulated, tank carriers. Tank carriers, however due to the'specialized nature of their equipment, are at the top extreme of both operations under one-way certificates and empty-mile movements. The existence of one-way certificates is not nearly so dramatic in respect to\"other types of carriers. A review of operating certificates in the Inventory of Motor Carrier Authorities (IMCA) program, summarized in the Profile of Motor Carriers of Property Industry Subject tolCCRegulation, June 1965, offers further insight on backhaul restrictions of certificates which had been issuedup to that date. At least 29.1 percent of all specific commodity - carriers were found to be operating on one-way authorities. A potential for 15 percent fuel savings would result in savings approaching 42,477,000 gallons per year.s Therefore, although the percent of outstanding one-way authorities generally is not of the maginitude found -among tank truckers, there is significant opportunity available for fuel savings. Mixed Loads In the Empty/Loaded Truck Miles study, 28.2 percent of the trucks - surveyed were found to be hauling agricultural commodities, but ofi those, only 0.8 percent were regulated carriers hauling exempt goods. Moreover, ICC regulated carriers operating refrigerated equipment (a type commonly used in the movement of exempt commodities) were operating empty 15.9 percent of total truck capacity miles. Finally, the study found that 14.4 percent of all trucks were operating with partial loads. While the type of equipment represented by such a figure was not broken down, some portion of the equipment represented was refrigerated type, \" susceptible to more efficient full loading. These findings suggest that there is ample opportunity for regulated carriers to accept additional shipments of exempt commodities in the interest of more efficient operations. One way to - encourage this Is to remove regulatory restraints placed on mixed truckloads of exempt and regulated commodities. We - are considering adopting a special limited authority to permit regulated carriers to transport exempt commodities in the same vehicles that are carrying authorized commodities. We do not contemplate individual notice to other carriers of each request for special limited authority. In view of the proposed brief duration of these rules, the impact upon other carriers is not likely to be great. Moreover, the action of Commission field personnel in issuing the special certificates would not be a proceeding requiring resolution of disputed factual issues, but rather a sTotal special carriers 7.549,079,000 miles, TRINC'S 1976 Edition, assume 30 percent of miles on one-way authority 50 percent ' \" empty=1.132,7?23,700 empty miles, 15 percent of that forsavings=169.908,550 miles at 4 miles per gaUon=4.,477o00 gallons.ministerial act implementing the prior findings of the Commission. Special procedures to expedite the filing and processing of these applications would be established. Any grant of special limited authority would be conditioned upon compliance with all applicable requirements concerning tariff publications, evidence of security for the protection of the public, and designation of agents for service of process. Under the backhaul authority proposal, contract carriers may serve only existing contracting shippers. Our decision is intended to encourage two-day loaded operations and not to facilitate additional one-way fuel consuming services. We will instruct our field staffs to closely monitor these new operations. We do not believe that the proposed rules will have an adverse effect on the quality of the human environment. This is, however, a major regulatory action under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. Affected carriers will be able to improve their operating efficiencies, which will lead to substantial energy savings. It Is difficult to quantify the potential energy savings at this time beyond the data and assumptions already set forth in this decision. Comments are requested on the energy policy and conservation issue. A hore detailed energy analysis will be issued when we serve our decision on the need for the temporary rules. The public Is invited to comment on the-proposed temporary rules and also on the desirability of making them permanent. Written materials submitted will be available for public inspection at the offices of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 12th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, during regular business hours.

(Pan American) propose to increase their arbitrary fares, used to construct through international fares between U.S. interior points and transatlantic.points over the New York gateway..' The carriers contend the increases are necessary to offsetU.S. domestic fare increases which have been approved by the Board and are now effective in domestic tariffs. We have decided to suspend. those proposed increases that would apply to construction of through normal economy fares to and from those U.S. interior cities currently receiving nonstop services to the United Kingdomfor the same reasons set forth in greater detail in Order 79q-11-177, November 19,1979. Both carriers offer nonstop transatlantic services between Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., on the one hand, and London, on the other. In addition* British Airways provides such service between Chicago and London, and Pan American, between Seattle and London. Despite the availability of this type of servicei normal economy fares from these points are still constructed over New York by means of arbitrary fares As a result, under the proposed 'Tariff C.A.B. No. 71, Supplement No. 46, Air Tariffs Corp.. Agent.increases, a passenger using the services of British Airways in conjunction with a bundled normal economy fare in Its non- stop markets would pay per mile fares 4 to 13 percent greater than his New York counterpart.2 Similarly, a passenger using Pan American's unbundled normal economy fare in its nonstop markets would pay a per mile fare that ranges from 6 to 21 percent greater. Because this has the effect of charging passengers from these interior points excessive fares, we will suspend, pending investigation, the proposed increased arbitraries insofar as they would be used to construct through normal economy fares for British Airways and Pan American in their respective nonstop markets as listed above. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 102, 204(a), 403, 801 and 1002(j) of the Federal Aviation Act, as amended: 1. We shall institute an investigation to determine whether the arbitrarles and provisions set forth in the Appendix8 hereof, and rules and regulations or practices affecting such arbitraries and provisions, are or will be unjust or unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential, unduly prejudicial or otherwise unlawful; and if we find them to be unlawful, to act appropriately to prevent the use of such arbitraries or rues, regulations, or practices; 2. Pending hearing and decision by the Board, we suspend and defer the use of the arbitraries named in the Appendix from January 8,1980, to and including January 7,1981, unless otherwise ordered by the Board, and shall permit no changes to be made therein during the period of suspension except by order or special permission of the Board; 3. We shall submit this order to the President 4 and it shall become effective on January 8,1980; and 4.

(GNA) for the- transportation ofmaiLby aircraft in its certificated services and fixed as temporary service maiL rates, subject to retroactive adjustment by an order establishing final rates, the service mail rates established for Wien Air Alaska (Wien) by Orders 71-2-102 and 76-2- 63.1 On December 14,1979, the United States Postal Service filed a petition for reconsideration of Order 79-11-203 requesting modification of that order by incorporating a rate equalization clause.2 The Postal Service states that it has no objection in principle to hitching GNA's temporary rates to Wien's rates, but our order presents it with the problem of how to divide the-mail between GNA and Wien in a manner consistent with the policy expressed in 39USC section 101(f) to \"give highest consideration to the prompt and economical delivery of all mail.\" Since it cannot predict that GNA's finarrates will not be higher than Wien's, the Postal Service alleges thatit would be taking a considerable business risk in tendering mail to GNA under the temporary rates. The Postal Service believes that an equalization agreement would provide it with the degree of assurance about GNA's final rates for the open rates period which is necessary for planning economical mail services. On December 19,1979, GNA filed art answer to the Postal Service's petition. for reconsideration stating that GNA is willing to accept a rate equalization :All Members concurred. 1Order 79-12-84. served December 171979. established increased temporary service mail rates for Wien. which also were made applicable to GNA. 2This permits a carrier to elect to transport mail between stated points served by such carrier at a reduced rate equal to the rate then in effect-for service between such points by any other carrier.clause and suggests that the language used by the Board in its most recent show-cause order 3 proposing final rates for Wien is appropriate for this purpose. Inasmuch as the temporary rates of compensation paid GNA are based on those for Wien, and GNA has expressed a willingness to accept final rates for the temporary rate period at the level established for Wien, we find and -conclude that these temporary rates should be subject to the same equalization provisions as are now in effect for Wien. This enables the carrier to compete on a similar footing for mail, ,improves the mail service, and upholds the principle of uniform pay for like services. Without a rate competitive with that of Wien, the Postal Service would tender GNA no mail between competitive points. We will therefore modify these rates to include such provisions. Accordingly, pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. particularly sections 204(a) and 406, and the Board's Procedural Regulations promulgated in 14 CFR Part 302, 1. We amend the ordering paragraphs of Order 79-11-203 by adding anew ordering paragraph 4 and renumbering the existing ordering paragraphs, the paragraphs as amended to read as follows: \"1. We institute an investigation to determine the fair and reasonable service mad rates to be paid by the Postmaster General te Great Northern Airlines, Inc., for the transportation of mail by aircraft, the facilities used and useful therefor, and the services connected therewith, over Great Northern's entire certificated operations. 2.

The temporary service mail rates established in this order shall be paid in their entirety by the Postmaster General and shall be subject to retroactive adjustment to the date of the commencement of mail operations as may be required by the order establishing final service mail rates in this investigation. 3See Order 79-11-2?, served November?7 197M.4.

Kaylor, Secretary. (MDoc. .-131 F 2809, R- 10; Order Air Transport AssociatonLNorth Atlantic Passenger Fares; Order Adgpted by the Civil Aeronautics Board at its office in Washington. D.C, on. the 4th day of January 1980. An agreement among U.& and foreign member air carriers of the International Air Transport Association (LATA] has been filed with the Board pursuant to section 412(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (the Act) and Part 261 of the Board's Economic Regulations. It was adopted at the Composite Meeting of Passenger and Cargo Tariff Coordinating C6nferences (Fuel] held in Cannes, October 2-8,1979, and is proposed for effectiveness January 1, 1980. Agreement CA.B. 28059, R-10, is a portion of two IATA agreements AVAl Membes concurred.2875 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices proposing a third round of worldwide fare and rate increases to offset sharply rising fuel prices.' In particular; this- portion Of the agreement proposes a 5 -percent across-the-board increase in North Atlantic passenger fares while allowing individual IATA member carriers to vary the magnitude of this increase by 2 percent. The proposed increases may therefore range from 3 to 7 percent.5 We have decided to approve the agreement except as it pertains to normal economy fares. In Order 79-12-60, December 3, 1979, we largely approved a Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), filing which proposed a 7 percent fare increase in- many transatlantic markets. In particular, 'we approved increases in all first-class and promotional fares. As we stated there, rising fuel costs have unquestionably made some fare. increases necessary, and IATA's proposal is, at least with respect to first- class and promotional fares, reasonable.We cannot, however, approve the agreement's proposed increases in normal economy fares. For reasons stated in disapproving an earlier IATA agreement proposing transatlantic fare increases,3 we do not believe the public interest would be best served by our giving blanket approval to such increases. I We have already considered the other portions of Agreement C.A.B. 28059 as well as the entirety of Agreement C.A.B. 28061. See Order 79-12-127, December 20,1979. INational Airlines, Inc., Is the only U.S. air carrier ourrently providing North Atlantic passenger service which Is a paity to the agreement3Orders 79-11-186, November 28,1979, and 79-9- 123, September 20, 1979.Approval would authorize each IATA member carrier to raise normal economy fares'from 3 to 7 percent, without further Board review of the economics of the particular markets involved. For example, we recently suspended U.S.- France normal economy fare increases proposed by two carriers in individual tariff filings because we believed these fares were-already too high and no increases were warranted.4 Normal economy fare increases in other markets might be warranted, but a seven percent increase might be excessive in a market where a three percent increase is reasonable.. . Furthermore, it has been our experience that carriers subsequently file fares-at the maximum permissible level. To the extent that most IATA member carriers file for the maximum 7 percent increase, then IATA's 3-to-7 -percent flexibility has no meaning. With these considerations in mind, and despite our desire to give positive treatment to IATA filings, we believe that the public interest is best served by disapproval of the agreement ifisofar as normal economy -fares are concerned and by subsequent Board review of the individual tariff filings by the carriers. Acting under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, and particularly sections 102, 204(a) and 412: 1. We do not find that the following resolution, which has direct dpplication in air transportation as defined by the Act, is adverse to the public interest or in violation of the Act except insofar as It pertains to normal economy fares: 'Order 79-12-209. December 20,1979. Agreement IATA Tle Appricatlon CAB TC12rTc123 General increase in Passenger Fares U.SA.Europe/IsraelTC3. 1/2; 1/2/3 2. We find that the following resolution, which has direct application in air transportation as defined by the Act, is adverse to the public interest-and in violation of the Act insofar as it pertains to normal economy fares: Agreement IATA 1/2/33. We have decided that the public interest requires a grant of antitrust immunity to that portion of Agreement C.A.B. 28059, R-10, outlined in finding paragraph I above. This agreement Is a product of the IATA rate-setting machinery approved and immunized in Order E-9305, June 15,1955. In Docket 32851, we are reviewing that machinery to determine whether or not it should -continue under our approval and immunization. Pending our final decision in that docket, we will continue to consider IATA rate agreements on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, 1. We approve that portion of Agreement C.A.B. 28059, R-10, set forth in finding paragraph I above; 2. We disapprove that portion of Agreement C.A.B. 28059, R-10, set forth in finding paragraph 2 above; 3. We authorize IATA member carriers to file tariffs implementing the approved portion of Agreement C.A.B. 28059, R-10, on not less than one day's notice for effectiveness not earlier than January 15, 1980;5 and 4. Those IATA member carriers filing tariffs implementing the approved portion of Agreement C.A.B. 28059, R-10, shall mark them to expire not later than March 31,1980. We will publish this order in the Federal Register. By the Civil Aeronautics Board. Phyllis T. Kaylor, Secretary..

However, because of the need to avoid conflicts with activities involving the conduct of the 1980 census, no additional special censuses will be conducted during the period from August 1,1979 until further notice.The Bureau is, therefore, not accepting requests for cost estimates for special censuses at this time. Notification will appear herein when the Bureau is prepared to resume accepting such requests. The content of a special census is ordinarily limited to questions on household relationship, age, race, and sex, although additional items may be included at the request and expense of the sponsor. The enumeration in a special census is conducted under the same concepts which govern the decennial census. Summary results of special censuses are published semiannually in the Current Population Reports-Series P- 28, prepared by the Bureau of the Census. For each area which has a special census population of 50,000 br more, a separate publication showing data for that area by age, race, and sex is prepared. If the area has census tracts, these data are shown by tracts. The data shown in the following table are the results of special censusesconducted since November 30,1978, for which tabulations were completed betveen November 1,1979 and November 30, 1979. Dated.

Take notice that on December 27, 1979, Chattanooga Gas Company, A Division of Jupiter Industries, Inc., (Chattanooga) tendered for filing proposed changes to Original Volume No. 1 of its FERC Gas Tariff to be effective on January 1, 1980 consisting of the following revised tariff sheet: Thirty Fifth Revised Tariff Sheet No. 6 The Thirty Fifth Revised Tariff Sheet No. 6 reflects a current increase in the ' LNG rates of 34.6 cents per MMBTU and a cumulative increase of $2.413 per MMBTU. Chattanooga states the sole purpose of this revised Tariff Sheet is to adjust Chattanooga's LNG rates pursuant to its PGA provision in Section 5 of the General Terms and Conditions of its Gas Tariff to reflect the cumulative effect of the underlying rate adjustments filed for by both of its suppliers since July 1, 1979. Chattanooga states that its semi-annual-PGA filing dates are --January 1 and July 1. The suppliers' rate adjustments being tracked by Chattanooga are those filed for by Southern Natural in Docket No. RP79-72 with an effective date of September 1, 1979; in Docket Nos. RP73-64 and RP80- 49 with an effective date of January 1, 1980, and those filed for by EastTennessee in Docket Nos. RP71-15 and RP75-28 with an effective date of August 1, 1979; in Docket No. RP78-12 \" with an effective date of October 1, 1979, and in Docket Nos. RP71-15, RP75- 28, RP80-22 and RM77-14 with an effective date of January 1, 1980. Chattanooga requests the Thirty Fifth Revised Tariff Sheet No. 6 become effective on January 1, 1980, the proposed effective date of the latest rate changes by Southern Natural and East Tennessee. In the event the Commission does not accept Southern Natural's proposed tariff sheet contained in this filing, then Chattanooga will rely on its alternate rate filing also made with the Commission on December 21, 1979, to become effective on January 1,1980, As noted above, the proposed effective date of Chattanooga's rate change is January 1, 1980. Sections 22.1(c) and 24.8(d) require Chattanooga to file any proposed rate change pursuant to those Sections at least forty- five days prior to the Effective Date of Adjustment. However, because Southern Natural and East Tennessee only recently advised Chattanooga of their revised rates, Chattanooga, for good cause shown, respectfully requests that the Commission grant waiver of the forty-five day notice requirement In order that the proposed rate change will become effective January 1, 1980, as proposed. Chattanooga states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of Its jurisdictional customers. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in occordance with Sections 1.8 and 1.10 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 1.8, 1.10).

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of comment period extension under subsection 125(a) of the Clean Air Act SUMMARY- On September 6,1979 (44 FR -52030) EPA proposed to determine under subsection 125(a), 42 USC 7425(a), that projected local and regional economic and unemployment impacts that would occur if certain Ohio utilities proceeded with plans to switch from high sulfur coal to low sulfur coal to comply with sulfur dioxide emission limitations would not be sufficiently significant to necessitate action under subsections 125(b) and Cc) of the Act A public hearing was held in St. Clairsville, Ohio on November 20,1979. A public comment period was established and scheduled to close December 20, 1979 (44 FR 59287, October 15, 1979). EPA will evaluate written comments, statements presented at the public hearing and other information in making a final determination under subsection 125(a). EPA is aware that the coal use plans of major fuel burning stationary sources may have changed since EPA initiated section 125 proceedings in Ohio. Therefore, recent updated information concerning coal use plans is being requested from certain utilities and industrial facilities in Ohio under authority of section 114 of the Act. This will be done to ensure that EPA's final determinationis based on the most accurate, up-to-date coal use information. In order to permit the Agency sufficient time to obtain and evaluate these data and to permit opportunity for public review and comment on any new information obtained, EPA is extending the public comment period to February 20,1980. EPA will publish a Federal Register notice indicating the availability of the data obtained fromOhio utilities and industrial facility operators. DATES: The public comment period for the reproposed determination under subsection 125(a) of the Act will remain open until February 20,1980. ADDRESSES: The new coal use data and information obtained will be made available for inspection and copying during regular business hours at the locations designated as repositories for the Ohio section 125 proceedings (44 FR 52030, September 6, 1979).

Background The NRC received a request from the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, an organization of State officials, to \"make a determination of the most severe accident basis for which radiological emergency response plans should be developed by offsite agencies.\" In response, an EPA and NRC task force was established which prepared a report entitled \"Planning Basis for the Development of State and Local Government Radiological Emergency Response Plans in Support of Light Water Nuclear Power Plants,\" NUREG-0396, EPA 520/1-78-016, dated December 1978. Single copies of the report can be obtained by writing to the Director, Division of Technical Information and Document Control, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555.Planning Basis The major recommendation of the report is that Emergency Planning Zones (EPZ's) shouldbe established around light water nuclear power plants. The EPZ for airborne exposure has a radius of about 10 miles; the EPZ for contaminated food has a radius of about 50 miles. Predetermined protective action plans are needed for the EPZ's. The exact size and shape of each EPZ will be decided by emergency planning officials after they consider the specific conditions at each site. The report indicates that officials may have from one-half hour to several hours warning in which to implement protective actions before a release of radioactivity to the atmosphere. The chemical and physical characteristics of those radionuclides which contribute most significantly to human exposure are presented. EPA Policy EPA concurs in and endorses for use the guidance contained in the task force report. It will be EPA's policy to incorporate its recommendations into all EPA emergency response guidance to State and local officials. Dated. January 9,1980. David G.

Area; Request for - EPA Determination Regarding an Aquifer. A petition has been submitted by the Committee To Keep Our Water Pure, Ridgewood, New Jersey, pursuant to section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act, Pub. L. 93-523, requesting the- Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make a determination that the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer which underlies the communities of Ridgewood, Glen Rock, Midland Park ahd Wyckoff in Bergen County, New Jersey is the sole or principal drinking water source for the Ridgewood Area which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health. This petition is reprinted in full below: Groundwater System of the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer Ridgewood Area Petition 1. The Committee to Keep Our Water Pure is composed of a group of citizens located in the Village of Ridgewood I water service area (Midland Park, Glen Rock, Wyckoff and Ridgewood,'N.J.). The Ridgewood water service area has a population of 62,820 and is totally dependent on the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer system, that is the subject of this petition, as a sole source of drinking water for the resident population. Committee members may be contacted as follows: * Dr. George Gerliczy, 135 South Irving, Ridgewood, NJ, 652-8152 Mary Franklin, 270 Orchard Place, Ridgewood, NJ, 444-9097Mary Boutin, 440 Northern Parkway, Ridgewood, NJ, 444-2024 Donald Christman, 155 Lynch Place, Wyckoff,, NJ, 444-0176 Dr. Judith Christman, 155 Lynch Place, Wyckoff, NJ, 444-0176 Edwards, 254 Steilen Avenue, Ridgewood, NJ, 652-5874 Sharyn Feuer, 205 Fairmont Selders, 219,Brookside Avenue, Ridgewood, NJ, 652-9235' Bernice NJ, -o William Selders, 219 Brookside Avenue, Ridgewood, NJ, 652-9235 2. A petition to the Administrator and Region II Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, requesting that the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer system in the Ridgewood Area, New Jersey, be designated as a sole source aquifer as provided under Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (Public Law 93-523) which provides as follows: (e) If the Administrator determines, on his own'initiative or upon petition that an area has an acquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area aud which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health, he shall publish.. notice of that determination in the Federal Register. After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for Federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate such acquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment forFederal financial assistance may,.if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the acquifer. 3. President Jimmy Carter's Water Policy Message to the Congress of the United States on June 6, 1979 includes firm guidance on the need for high quality water as follows: \"Everywhere, water quality is fundamental to environmental quality. Clean drinking water, recreation, wildlife and beautiful natural aieas depend on protection of our water resources.\"- Protection of the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer system under Section' 1424(e) of the Safe-Drinking Water Act would measurably preserve the environment in the communities of Ridgewood, Glen Rock, Midland Park and Wyckoff, N.J. that are totally dependent on this acquifer as a source of drinking water, thereby affirmatively responding to the President's Water Policy. 4. The Ridgewood area proposed for Sole Source Aquifer designationis a 17.84 square'mile portion of the Lower Basin of the Passaic River Watershedwhich encompasses all of the communities of Ridgewood, Glen Rock, Midland Park and Wyckoff In Bergen County, New Jersey. A 1978 study by Leggette, Brashears and Graham, Inc., Cohsulting Cround-Water Geologists of Westport, Connecticut concluded that aquifer recharge does not occur by ground water movement regionally from adjacent aquifers and, furthermore, that the Ridgewood area Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer is recharged primarily through local precipitation falling on the local land surfaces, 5. Geologically, the area lies within the Piedmont Physiographic Province and is underlain by soft red shale with interbedded coarse grain sandstone which is a part of the Brunswick formation of the Triassic geologic period (about 190 million years old). Along the western edge of the area basaltic lava flows have intruded into the Brunswick Formation up to twenty-five feet in thickness. The Brunswick Formation Is overlain for much of the area by a thin mantle of unconsolidated glacial deposits of till or glacial outwash of the Pleistocene Epoch (Ice age roughly 14,000 to 80,000 years ago), In several significant areas the unconsolidated deposits are fifty to eighty feet thick. The proposed designation would apply to the Deep Shale and Sandstone bedrock (Brunswick Formation) and the overlying unconsolidated deposits, 6. The boundary of the proposed designation is shown on Exhibit 1 entitled \"Drainage Basin and Geologic Cross-Section Identifier Map.\" The external perimeter Is described by the non-common community 'boundaries of Ridgewood, Glen Rock, Midland Park, and Wyckoff. The area is bounded on the west by the First Watchung Mountain (a basaltic lava flow) which virtually precludes regional movement of groundwater from that sector. 7. The public water supply system of the Village of Ridgewood Water Department, the private Water supply of a bottled spring water purveyor (Belmar Spring Water, Glen Rock, NJ) and many industrial and private well owners depend on the aquifer system as a sole source of drinking water. A 1979 study by Metcalf and Eddy Engineers of New York, N.Y., estimated the resident population to be 62,820 in the area proposed for sole source designation. The population is distributed throughout the area's four communities as follows- Ridgewood-26,434; Glen Rock-12,367; Midland Park-7,863; and Wyckoff- 16,156. The residents are dependent upon the Village of Ridgewood Water Department as a purveyor of the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer waterI2894 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices except for about 1,200 people in Wyckoff who have private wells in the Aquifer. 8. Exhibit 1 shows the outlines of the eight drainage basins that occupy the surface terrain overlying the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer and shows the locations of the 59 deep wells of the Ridgewood Water Department. The exhibit also depicts in plan a geologic cross-section line which serves to locate the profile that is presented on Exhibit 2 entitled \"Geologic Cross Sections of Bergen County.\" The bedrock geology is further defined on Exhibit 3 entitled \"Geologic Overlay Sheet 23 Topographic Series State of New Jersey Geological Survey.\" The exhibit is presented in three sheets as follows: Sheet one of three presents a source of data and legend, sheet two of three is an overlay sheet depicting bedrock formations, sheet three of three is a topographic base map for use in conjunction with the overlay sheet. 9. It has been shown that the only source of drinking water available to the Ridgewood area resident population is from the area's 59 deep wells. Should these wells become contaminated, the next most available source of drinking water is bottled water available through supermarkets, health food stores, etc. The costs for bottled water (such as Lehigh Valley or Poland Water) is prohibitively high at 500 to 5,000 times the cost for Ridgewood Water Department drinking water (see Exhibit 4]. 10. Unfortunately, unless protection is provided, the potential for drinking water contamination exists. During the past few years, three nearby well systems (within a ten mile radius of the Ridgewood Area) which tap other portions of the deep shale and overlying surface deposits have been forced to close contaminated wells. Three wells in Fair Lawn, N.J. were found by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to contain high levels of cancer causing agents: carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethelyne, methylene chloride and chloroform. At four wells in Mahwah, N.J. were found by NJDEP to be contaminated with trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Three wells in Allendale were found by NJDEP to be contaminated with tetrachloroethylene. The Fairlawn and Allendale wells have been closeid; attempts to purge the wells by pumping to waste has not been successful and the wells remain closed. 11. Continued development in the Ridgewood area requires that a high priority be placed upon protecting the acquifer recharge area. It has been shown in the cases of Fairlawn, Mahwah and Allendale that recharge areas are fragile and that protection is imperative. The Ridgewood area may besubdivided into eight drainage basin areas for purposes of establishing a protection program (refer to Exhibit #1). 11.1 Deep Brook Basin--.43 square miles. This basin contains ten bedrock production wells which have the capability of developing a full yield potential of 610,000 gallons per day. 11.2 Diamond Brook Basin-3.13 square miles. This basin contains five bedrock production wells and several private industrial wells. Full groundwater yield potential has been estimated to be 1,330,000 gallons per day. 11.3 GoffleBrookBasL7-479 square miles. This basin Is the largest and contains 17 production wells. A real well distribution is good such that they' have the ability io develop the basins full yield potential of 2,040,000 gallons per day. 11A HoHoKus Brook MidlandPark RidgewoodBasin-0.89 square miles. The basin's four production wells are capable of developing the full yield potential of 380,000 gallons per day. 11.5 HoHoKus Brook Wyckoff Basin-I.94 square miles. The basin has no active public wells. Some test wells encountered intrusive trap rock in the Brunswick formation. Unconsolidated materials overlying bedrock have been found in depths of 80 feeL The basin's full yield potential has been modestly estimated to be 200,000 gallons per day. 11.6 Passaic River/Saddle River Basin-0.73 square miles. One production well is located in this basin. If additional wells are located a full yield potential of 310,000 gallons per day is possible. Unconcolidated deposits of 62 feet have been found in the area which are the potential source of additional water. 11.7 Saddle River-HoHoKus Brook Basin--4.61 square miles. This is the second largedt basin; It contains 22 production wells and numerous private wells which have a full yield potential of 3,000,000 gallons per day. The basin Is considered to be the most important one in the Ridgewood area. Extensive unconsolidated deposits in depths of 20 to 50 feet overly much of the bedrock. As a consequence, rapid groundwater movement occurs to replenish the deep shale and sandstone aquifer with local precipitation and surface water infiltration. 11.8 Squaw Brook Bashi-0.32 square miles. This area is underlain by Basalt rock formations and Is not considered to possess sufficient groundwater for public supply. It Is important to note that the underlying basalt serves as a barrier in the Ridgewood area's southwest sector preventing the migration of anypotential contamination into the Ridgewood area while retaining the Deep Shale and Sandstone aquifer system water reserves within the Ridgewood area. 12. A 1976 study by Geraghty and Miller, Inc. Consulting Ground-Water Geologists and Hydrologists of Port Washington, New York showed that the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer system could sustain a yield of 400,000 gallons per day per square mile of the aquifer system. The Ridgewood water department could develop and sustain a yield of seven million gallons per day. To date, aquifer water levels indicate that no significant dewatering has taken place. 13. A 1978 study by Leggette Brashears & Graham, Inc., identified three basins which have additional potential for well development. Unconsolidated deposits of up to 80 feet in depth in the Passaic River/Saddle River 0.73 square mile basin and in the HoHoKus Brook, Wyckoff 1.94 square mile basin should be explored for future well development. A third basin, the Diamond Brook 3.13 square mile basin, could be further developed by installing several bedrock wells. Therefore, these water reserves deemand immediate protection to preserve their future availability. 14. Federally sponsored projects are proceeding in the area which have the potential for impact upon the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer system. In Ridgewood USEPA sponsored Step I facilities planning has identified wastewater collection, treatment and disposal facilities which contain potential sources of groundwater pollution. The collection system was found to have an extensive problem with leaking joints and storm related bypassing of wastewater flows to basin streams. In Wyckoff, wastewater collection facilities are being constructqd. The sewer lines should be constructed to prevent pollution of the aquifer. Sole source designation will surely add a factor of safety to continued federally sponsored wastewater treatment works development in Ridgewood and Wyckoff. 15. Existing land use and water quality laws do not adequately protect the Deep Shale and Sandstone Acquifer or its recharge areas in the Ridgewood area. 16. Tha highly developed and industrialized environment of northern New Jersey provides for the potential for numerous sources of groundwater pollution including old sewer systems, septic tanks, chemical sjills, landfill2895 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices leachate, industrial waste lagoons, stockpile leachate, etc. 17. We therefore conclude: The Groundwater System of the Deep Shale and Sandstone Acquifer Ridgewood area is a sole source of drinking water for public and private wells upplies in the area. Furthermore, contamination of this aquifer would create significant hazard to public health. We conclude therefore that we must respectfully request that the Administrator and Region II Administrator of ihe USEPA determine that the Deep Shale and Sandstone Aquifer Ridgewood Area be designated as the \"sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health,\" and that you publish notice of this determination in the Federal Register as required by Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. Background On July 3, 1975, the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a final regulation concerning Federal registration of pesticide products previously registered in accordance with State pesticide laws and shipped and distributed for sale solely within intrastate commerce. See 40 CFR 162.17, 40 FR 28285, July 3, 1975. The regulation provided that all such products must be registered in compliance with Section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), unless otherwise registered by a State pursuant to section 24(c) of FIFRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Section 3(a) of FIFRA states that \"no person in any State\" may sell or distribute \"any pesticide which Is not registered with the Administrator.\" However, the 1975 regulation also provided that each intrastate registrant who submitted a notice of application for Federal registration by October 4, 1975 would be permitted to sell and distribute the intrastate pesticide product solely within intrastate commerce, \"pending the final registration decision either approving or denying the registration application.\" A number of notices of application for Federal registration of intrastate pesticide products containing the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5MT were subsequently submitted to the Registration Division of the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs. While these applications for registration of intrastate 2,4,5-T products were pending, the Agency was evaluating available evidence concerning the risks and benefits associated with the registered uses of 2,4,5-T products. On the basis of this evaluation, the Agency issued a notice of Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR) for all pesticide products containing 2,4,5-T. See 43 FR 17110, April 21,1978. Issuance of the RPAR initiated a comprehensive public review of all 2,4,5- T registrations and all pending applications for registration of 2,4,5-T products. On February 28, 1979, relying in large part on information developed and collected during the RPAR review, the Administrator ordered emergency suspension of the use of 2,4,5-T on forests, rights-of-way, and pastures, and issued notices of intent to cancel these uses. See 44 FR 15874, March 15,1979. Subsequently, on July 9,1979, EPA announced its determination concerning2898 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices the RPAR review of the remaining non- suspended uses of 2,4,5-T, and proposed to hold a hearing to determine whether or not these uses of 2,4,5-T should be cancelled. See 44 FR 41531, July 17,1979. It is expected that a consolidated formal evidentiary hearing on cancellation of all 2,4,5-T registrations will begin early this year. Reasons for Denial The Agency has reviewed all pending applications for Federal registration of intrastate pesticide products containing 2,4,5-T in the context of the information collected and generated during the RPAR review of 2,4,5-T and summarized in the 2,4,5-T suspension and cancellation notices. See 44 FR 15874, 44 FR 15897, March 15,1979. On the basis of this review, the Agency has concluded that none of these products can be expected to \"perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.\" This conclusion is based in part on numerous studies which have clearly demonstrated that 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo -p -dioxin (TCDD), an inadvertant contaminated with TCDD produce fetotoxic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects in experimental animals. When these toxicological data are considered in combination with information on the potential human exposure associated. with use and distribution of 2,4,5-T products, there is reason to conclude that humans may experience comparable effects. In particular, the Agency's Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG) has concluded that TCDD induces carcinogenic responses in mice and rats and that these effects, together with data indicating that TCDD is mutagenic, constitute evidence that TCDD is likely to be a human carcinogen. Other studies * demonstrate that exposure of experimental animals to 2,4,5-T and/or TCDD during gestation results in reduced neonatal survival and increased incidences of fetal death, skeletal deformities such as cleft palate, and kidney abnormalities in the offspring of the exposed animals. On the basis of benefits information provided by pesticide registrants, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other interested parties, and .summarized in the 2,4,5-T suspension and cancellation notices and the notice of intent to hold a hearing concerning non-suspended uses of 2,4,5-T. the Agency has analyzed the economic benefits of all uses for which intrastate 2,4,5-T products 1nay be sold and -distributed and has determined that thepotential risks associated with registration of 2,4,5-T products for any of these uses appear to outwelght the benefits. Accordingly, because none of the applications for Federal registration of intrastate pesticide products containing 2,4,5-T can satisfy the substantive requirements for registration established by sections 3(c)[5) (C) and (D) of FIFRA, all such applications are denied. Procedural Matters Section 3(c)(6) of FIFRA provides that any applicant for Federal registration of a pesticide whose application Is denied, or other interested person with the concurrence of the applicant. may request a hearing as provided in FIFRA section 6(b). This section explains the proper procedures for filing a hearing request and the consequence of failure to request a hearing in accord with these procedures. No hearing will be available with respect to denial of any particular application for Federal registration of an intrastate pesticide product containing 2,4,5-T unless the affected applicant itself either files or concurs in a timely request for a hearing. This principle will apply regardless of whether or not some other applicant requests a hearing concerning a product with similar composition or identical uses. Denial of any application for which a hearing has not been specifically requested will become final and effective 30 days after receipt of notice of such denial by the applicant or publication of this notice in the Federal Register, whichever occurs later. The Agency expects all requests for a hearing concerning denial of any application for Federal registration of intrastate pesticide products containing 2,4,5-T to be consolidated in the 2,4,5-T cancellation hearing. Applications with respect to which valid and timely hearing requests have been filed will remain pending unless and until they are denied by order of the Administrator at the conclusion of the hearing. All applicants and other interested persons who request a hearing must follow the Agency's rules of practice governing hearings, 40 CFR Part 164. Among other things, each hearing request must satisfy the following requirements: (1) It must specifically identify the intrastate application number(s) of the pesticide product(s) for which a hearing is requested; (2) It must be accompanied by objections to the Agency's refusal to iegister that are speificfor each uie of the intrastate pesticide product(s) for which a hearing is requested; and (3) It must be received by the Hearing Clerk within theapplicable thirty (30) day period. Failure to comply with these requirements will automatically result in denial of the request for a hearing. Requests for hearings must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (A-110), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. Dated. January 8,1980. OPP-30000/31B] Denial of Applications for Federal Registration of Intrastate Pesticide Products Containing Slivex AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Denial of applications for Federal registration of certain pesticide products containing 2-(2,4,5- trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (silvex) and distributed for sale solely within intrastate commerce. 'SUMMARY. This notice announces the denial of all applications for Federal registration of intrastate pesticide products containing 2-(2,4,5- trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid submitted to EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 162.17. In accordance with Sections 3(c)(6) and 6Mb) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIRA), the notice also states the reasons for such denial and informs all persons adversely affected by this action of the opportunity to request a hearing. DATE: Effective on January 15,1980, or 30 days after receipt of notice of denial by the individual applicant, whichever occurs later. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Michael Dellarco, Project Manager, Special Pesticide Review Division ('S- 791), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Room 4 7. Washington, D.C. 20460, Teephone (202) 557-8244. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 3,1975, the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated a final regulation concerning Federal registration of pesticide products previously registered in accordance with State pesticide laws and shipped and distributed for sale solely within intrastate commerce. See 40 CFR 162.17, 40 FR 28285, July 3,1975. The regulation2899 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices provided that all such products must be registered in compliance with Section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), unless otherwise registered by a State pursuant to section 24(c) of FIFRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Section 3(a) FIFRA states that \"no person in any State\" may sell or distribute \"any pesticide which is not registered with the Administrator.\" However, the 1975 xegulation also provided that each intrastate registrant who submitted a notice of application for Federal registration by October 4, 1975 would be permitted.to sell and distribute the intrastate pesticide product solely within intrastate commerce, \"pending the final registration decision either approving or denying the registration application.\" A number of notices of application for Federal registration of intrastate pesticide products containing the herbicide 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (silrex) were subsequently submitted to the Registration Division of the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs. On February 28, 1979, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency ordered emergency suspension of products containing silvex and registered for forestry, right-of-way, pasture, home and.garden, ditch bank,' aquatic weed control, and commercial/ ornamental turf uses, and issued notices of intent to cancel these uses. See 44 FR 15897, March 15, 1979. The emergency suspension ofcertain silex uses was based in part on information developed' and collected during the Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration\" (RPAR) review of 2,4,5- trichlorophenoxyacetic acid registrations. 17116, April 21, 1978. 2,4,5-T silvex both toxic chemical 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as an inadvertant but unavoidable contaminant, have comparable use patterns and correspondingly, comparable exposure potential, and may thus present similar risks. Acting in part on the basis of concerns regarding silvex identified during the RPAR review of 2,4,5-T. the Agency conducted an expendited RPAR review of -all remaining non-suspended uses of silvex and. all pending applications for registration of silvex products. Subsequently, on July 9,1979, EPA announced its determination concerning the RPAR review of the remaining non- suspended uses of silvex, and proposed to hold a hearing to determine whether or not these.uses of silvex should be cancelled. See 44 FR 41\u00a736, July 17,1979.It is expected that a consolidated formal evidentiary hearing on cancellation of all silvex registrations will begin early this year. Reasons for Denial The Agency has reviewed all pending applications for Federal registration of intrastate pesticide products containing silvex in the context of the information collected and generated during the RPAR reviews of 2,4,5-T and silvex and summarized in the 2,4,5-T and silvex suspension and cancellation notices. See 44 FR 15874, 44 FR 15897, March 15,1979. On the basis of this review, the Agency has concluded that none of these products can be expected to \"perform its intended function without-unreasonably adverse effects on the environment.\" This conclusion is based in-part on numerous studies which have clearly demonstrated that TCDD and/or silvex contaminated with TCDD can produce fetotoxic and teratogenic effects and thaf TCDD has carcinogenic effects in experimental animals. When these toxicological data are considered in combination with'information on the potential human exposure associated with use and distribution of silvex products, there is reason to conclude - that humans may experience comparable effects.

Other studies demonstrate that exposure of experimental animals to silvex and/or TCDD during gestation results in reduced neonatal survival and increased incidences of fetal death, skeletal deformities such as cleft palate, and kidney abnormalities in the offspring of the exposed animals. On the basis of benefits information' provided by pesticide registrants, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other interested parties, and sufmarized in the silvex suspension and cancellation notices and the notice of intent to hold a hearing concerning nonsuspended uses of silvex, the Agency has analyzed the economic benefits of all uses for which intrastate silvex products may be sold and ,distributed and has determined that the potential risks associated with registration of silvex products for any of these uses appear to outweigh the benefits. Accordingly, because none of the applications for Federalzregistration of intrastate pesticide products\\ containing silvex can satisfy thesubstantive requirements for registration established by sections 3(c)(5) (C) and (D) of FIFRA, all such applications are denied.

DATE: Written comments by February 14, 1980. ADDRESS: Requests for a copy of the guideline and v*'ritten comments may be addressed to the office of the Hearing Clerk (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-65, 5600 F1ishers Lane, Ropkville, MD 20857.

Pippin, Bureau of Foods (HFF-312), Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC-20204, 202-245-3092. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIOil: No tolerance for the presence in fish of the pesticide chemical chlordane has been established under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a). In the Federal Register- of March 24, 1978 (43 FR 12372), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final order cancelling the registration for chlordane and phasing out products containing chlordane. These actions were based on thepotential environmental hazard associated with the long residual effects of chlordane. As a result of the wide use of chlordane for a variety of purposes, it and its related by-products have become unavoidable environmental contaminants that are known to accumulate in fish. During a 3-year period (fiscal years 1975, 1976, and 1977) the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'collected and analyzed about 2,000 samples of various species of fish as part of its pesticide , surveillance activities. Approximately 10 percent of the samples were found to contain chlordane residues at levels ranging from -a trace to 4.83 parts per million (ppm). This information was submitted to-EPA with-a request that an appropriate action level be recommended for unavoidable residues of chlordane in fish. Afterreview of.the data submitted, the analytical capabilities available, and the amount of fish lost at different possible action levels, EPA recommended that FDA.establish an action level for chlordane in fish at 0.3 ppm. The action level develbped by EPA was from data accumulated for fresh water fish and was recommended as applying to fresh-water fish. However, to be consistent with other pesticide ' guidelines and with the concurrence of EPA, the action level established by this guideline is applicable tb all fish regardless of origin. Based on present data, FDA does not anticipate any adverse impact on the marine fishing industry from the broad application of this action level. Copies of the EPA recommendation and other supporting documents areavailable'for public examination In the office of the Hearing Clerk (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4- 65, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Interested persons may submit written comments on the guideline to the Hearing Clerk (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration (address above) preferably four copies, each Identified with the Hearing Clerk docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments will be incorporated into the public file on the guideline and may be seen In the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Dated: January 2, 1980. William F.

Searle & Co., Box 5110, Chicago, IL 60680, proposing the issuance of a foodadditive regulation to provide for the safe use of aspartame (L-aspartyl-L- phenyl-alanine methly ester) in foods as a nutritive substance with intense sweetness and with flavor-enhancing - properties. In the Federal Register of July 26, 1974 (39 FR 27317), the agency issued a food additive regulation authorizing the use of aspartame, \u00a7 Register of March 15, 1977-(42 FR 14302)). A correction in the preamble to the regulation was published in the Federal Register of September 26,1974 (39 FR 34520). James S.

The petition is filed under Section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The substance of the petition follows: 1. The petitioner states that the relevant entries to the Shoemaker Mine have deteriorated due to adverse conditions such as moisture, roof pressure, etc., leaving muh of the roof unsupported. 2. Numerous roof falls have resulted leaving these return air courses virtually impassable and extremely hazardous to travel and examine. The existing falls have had no effect on the velocity or quantity of air passing through the return air courses. 3. The return airways are not designated as return escapeways. 4. It is considered too hazardous to conduct weekly examinations for hazardous conditions; to attempt to rehabilitate these return air courses Is considered neither practical nor feasible. 5. As an alternative to weekly examinations of tle return air courses, the petitioner proposes to establish three monitoring air stations, record weekly measurements and maintain each station in a.safe condition. Immediate investigation will be conducted if marked variation in air quality and/or quantity occurs and corrective action will be initiated.

The petition Is filed under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The substance of the petition follows: 1. The petition concerns the illumination of the self-propelled mining equipment in the petitioner's mine. 2. The petitioner believes installation of illumination on its mining equipment will result in a diminution of safety to the miners affected. Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 1 Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices 3.lLow seam conditions exist in the petitioner's mine, normally 32 inches or less, and mining equipment ranges from 26 to 28 inches. 4. Because oflow-seam conditions and equipment height, the equipment operator's field of vision is frequently limited to the sides of equipment. Installation of lighting devices on sides of equipmentwould tend to blind the operator. 5. Lighting devices on top and sides of equipment would-tend to strike and render useless props, roof bolts, crossbeams and other roof support equipment. 6. Lighting devices would impair the use of cap lamps for communication between miners, preventing signals for safe operations. 7. For these reasons the petitioner requests modification of the'application of the standard to its mining equipment.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Ms. Linda Hamilton, of the Department of Labor, telephone (202) 523-7462. (This is not a toll-free number.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice Is hereby given of the pendency before the Department of an application for exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code. The proposed exemption was requested in an application filed by Dr. Edward L Hollenberg, a party in interest, pursuant to section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with procedures set forth in ERISA Procedure 75-1 (40 FR 18471, April 28,1975). Effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to Issue exemptions of the type requested to the Secretary of Labor. Therefore, this notice of pendency is issued solely by the Department. Summary of Facts and Representations The application contains representations with regard to the proposed exemption which are summarized below. Interested persons are referred to the application on filewith the Department for the complete representations of the applicant. 1. The Edward L. Hollenberg, M.D. Family Practice, Inc., an Indiana \" corporation, has been in operation since 1971. Dr Edward L. Hollenberg is the owner of 100% of the stock and is the administrator, of the Plan. The trustee of the Plan is the Indiana National Bank. As Plan trustee, the Indiana National Bank participates in investment decisions and has represented that the proposed sale of real property to Dr. Hollenberg would be in the best interests of the participants and benficlaries of the Plan. 2. The Plan was established in 1971 and had total net assets of $19,361 as of March 31, 1979 for the benefit of five participants. 3. The Partnership is comprised of the Plan and Stephen P. and Bennet R. Hollenberg, relatives of Dr. Hollenberg. The Plan holds the majority interest in the Partnership. 4. In 1973 the Partnership executed a land contract to purchase a 90-acre farm (the Property) located in Pulaski County, Indiana, at a cost of $36,000 as an investment. A balance of approximately $17,000 is now owed on the contract. 5. The Property has produced no net income to date. Although it has appreciated in value during the past several years, this has occurred only becAuse of improvements made by the Partnership. These improvements include the construcion of a feedlot at a cost of $20,000 and the creation of a pond at a cost of $6,000. 6. The gross income from the Property from 1977 to 1979 was $9,950. During this period, the Partnership incurred expenses totalling $20,255 in maintaining the Property. These expenses included materials necessary for the planting, fertilizing and spraying of trees, as well as other routine farm maintenance costs. Thus, the Partnership incurred a loss from the operation of the Property during the 1977-1979 period of $10,305. 7. Dr. Hollenberghas expended numerous hours of labor on the Property at no cost to the Plan, causing the Property to appreciate in value. This labor involved the planting, spraying, pruning and fertilizing of trees, tilling of the soil, and the performance of various other services necessary for the care and preservation of the Property. Had it been necessary for the Partnersip to employ someone to perform these services, the cost would have been substantial and would have further reduced the Property's rate of return. 8. Dr. Hollenberg wishes to purchase the Property from the Partnership for $100,000 cash, which is the higher of two2917 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices appraisals submitted, providing that this price is not less that the fair market value of the Property at the time of the assignment. The $100,000 will be reduced by the amount still payable-by the Partnership under the land contract at the time of the assignment (approximately $17,000) plus accrued interest at 61/2% from March 31,1979, the date of the last payment on the contract, and the unpaid balance (approximately $4,000) on a contract for improvements to the Property entered into by the Partnership. The assignments required to transfer the land contract to Dr. Hollenberg will be recorded with the Recorder of Pulaski County, Indiana. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction meets the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) It would be a one-time cash transacton which would be easily verifiable; (b) The plan would be able to dispose of an unprofitable investment for an amount which is equal to the fair markei value of the Property; (c) The 70% of Plan assets which are now invested in this non-income producing property will be liquidated, enabling the Plan to seek profitable investments; and (d) The individual accounts of the Plan participants will no longer be adversely affected by the retention of a non-income producing investment. Notice to Interested Persons All Plan participants and beneficiaries will be notified within a period of 7 days after the notice of pendency is published in the Federal Register, by letter containing a copy of the Notice of Pendency as published in the Federal Register and advising them of their rights to comment and/or request a hearing. I General Information The attention of interested-persons.-is directed to the following: (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance withsection 404(a)(1)(b) of the Act; nor does it affect therequirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; (2) The proposed exemption, if granted, will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b)(3) of the Act and section 4975(c)(1)(F). of the Code; (3) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(51 of the Code, the Department must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plans; and (4) The proposed exemption, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or - statutory'exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: N tice is hereby given of the pendency before the Department of an application for exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a)(1)(A) and (D) and section 406(b)(1] and (bJ(2) of the Act and from the taxes imposed by section 4975(a] and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c](1)(A), and (D) and (E) of the Code. The proposed exemption Was requested in an application filed by the Employer and'the Plan pursuant to section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with procedures set-forth in ERISA Procedure 75-1 (40 FR 184Z1, April 28,1975). The application was filed with both the Department and the Internal Revehue Service. However, effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type requested to the Secretary of Labor. Therefore, this notice of pendency is issued solely by the Department.Summary of Facts and Representations The application contains representations with regard to the proposed exemption which are summarized below. Interested persons are referred to the application on file with the Department for the complete representations of the applicants. 1. In October 1965, the Plan purchased for $60,000 real property located in downtownBessemer, Alabama from a party unrelated to the'Employer. In January 1971 a large portion of the land was paved at a cost of $15,099.75 for use as a parking facility. ' 2. Although the property has intermittently been leased to business and associations, at the present time the land is vacant, is producing no income for the Plan and has' not yielded any significant income for the past three years. 3. The property has been offered for sale through three diffeent realtors at a price of $70,000. There have been no results from these sales efforts. Prospects for selling the property are almost non~existent at the present time as business'in-the downtown area of Bessemer has been declining. 4. The Employer desires to purchase this property for a cash price equal to its appraised fair market value. An independent appraisal completed on May 2, 1979, estimated the fair market value at $54,500. The actual purchase price will be the higher of $54,500 or the fair market value at the date of the sale. 5. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed sale will' satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because it would be a one time transaction for cash and it will allow the Plan to (a) sell an otherwise unmarketable property; (b] liquidate a low yieldinvestment; and (c) eliminate an administrative burden and expense.

(This Is not a toll-free number.) SUPPLEMENTARY INOPRMATION: Notice is hereby given of the pendency before the Department of an application for exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1), 406(b)(2) and 407(a) of the Act and from the taxes imposedby section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code. The proposed exemption was requested in an application filed by Joseph Bilder, James Lee, James Missler, Jack Maxfield and Cecil Meares (the Trustees), the Trustees of the Trust, pursuant to section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c(2) of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in ERISA Procedure 75-1 (40 FR 18471, April 28,1975). The application was filed with both the Department and the Internal Revenue Service. However. effective December 31,1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17,1978) transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type requested to the Secretary of Labor. Therefore, this notice of pendency Is -issued solely by the Department. Summary of Facts and Representations The application contains representations with regard to the proposed exemption which are summarized below. Interested persons are referred to the application on file with the Department for the complete representations of the applicants. 1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which was created effective January 1. 1974. As of December 31,1977, the Plan had net assets valued at $1,334,812.92. These assets consist of stocks, bonds, other securities and cash. Four of thefive Trustees, James T. Lee, Jack Maxfield, Cecil Meares, and Joseph Bilder are partners in both the Employer and the Building Partnership. James Missler Is the fifth trustee and the Administrator of the Clinic Facility. 2. The Employer is a general partnership organized and operating under the laws of the State of Texas, whose principal place of business is Wichita Falls. Texas. It has been in existence for over 58 years. Its staff Includes 28 physicians who practice in the medical and surgical fields of general surgery, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics, gynecology, internal medicine pediatrics, radiology, general thoracic surgery, family practice, urology, oral surgery, and general medicine. The Employer also employs 154 nurses and administrative personnel. The partners of the Employer who are all practicing physicians have an aggregate annual net income from the practice of medicine of at least $1,800,000 and a net worth of at least $4,000,000. Under Texas law a partnership obligation is a joint and several obligation of all the partners of the partnership. 3. The Building Partnership is a general partnership o-Tanized and operating under the laws of Texas, whose principal place of business also is Wichita Falls, Texas. It has been in existence for over 16 years. The principal business of the Building Partnership is the ownership of the Clinic Facility, which it leases to the Employer. Of the twenty-three partners that comprise the Building Partnership, twenty-two are also partners in the Employer. 4. In the prior years of the Employer's existence, it was anticipated that the Building Partnership would own the Clinic Facility and that each partner in the Employer would also be a partner in the Building Partnership and own substantially equivalent shares in each such partnership. As the value of the Clinic Facility has increased, the cost of an ownership interest in the Building Partnership has increased. New associates (and prospective associates) entering the practice at the Employer have been unwilling to commit the large amount of cash necessary to purchase an interest in the Building Partnership. As a result, the recruiting of young physicians has become difficult. 5. The Trust proposes to purchase the Clinic Facility and adjacent real estate from the Building Partnership and lease such real property to the Employer, The details of the purchase transaction are as follows: (a) The proposed purchase price would be $1,960,000 comprising the total2921 2922 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 10 I Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices of the existing liens ($1,241,809.71 as of January 1, 1979) plus a note of $738,190.79 for the equity. The Trust has obtained an independent appraisal from the Saulsbury Appraisal Co. in Wichita Falls, Texas which represents that the' market value of the Clinic Facility as of July 11, 1978 was $2,200,000. (b) The said existing liens would remain obligations of the Building Partnership with the conveyance being made \"subject to\" such liens and the Trust not assuming such existing indebtedness. The Trust would, however, make the-payments required to satisfy such existing indebtedness, 'subject to the conditions described in paragralih (e) below. (c) The Building Partnership would be given a note by the Trust in the amount of $738;190.29 for the equity part of the purchase price. Such note would accrue interest at an interest rate of 11% per annum and would be payable in a monthly payment of principal and interest of $9,180. The payment of such note and the continued payment of the payments op the existing liens would be secured by a deed of trust (mortgage) on the subject property. The Trust would not be required to make any down payment. (d) The Employer would enter into a long-term, \"triple'net\" lease with the Trust leasing the Clinic Facility to the Employer for a \"floating\" monthly rental of 1.05% of the current appraised value of the subject realty. A new appraisal by an Independent qualified appraiser would be made every two years to update the rent. There would be'a. minimum guaranteed rent (regardless of any possible decrease in the appraisal) sufficient to pay the existing indebtedness. (e) In the event the Employer should default on its lease obligations to the Trust, the Trust would, at its election, have no further obligation of any kind to satisfy the existing mortgage indebtedness or to make any further payment against its purchase obligation to the Partnership. The Trust at its sole, discretion could (1) sell the premises and pay off the purchase obligations or (2) void the lease, return the premises to the seller and walk away from the unpaid balance of the purchase obligations with no personal liability. 6. The obligations of the Trust, which consist of four note payments and the payment on the equity note, are fully amortizable out of the lease rentals and no current or future Employer contributions will be needed for that purpose. By the end of the 15-year lease term, the lease will have generated more than enough cash to satisfy both the Trust'spurchase obligation and the existing indebtedness, as well as pay the income taxes due on the Trust's unrelated debt- financed income-pursuant to IRC Sec. 514. 7..In summary, the Trustees represent that the proposed sale will satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because (1) the Trustees of the Plan have determined that the proposed transaction is appropriate for the Plan and in the best interests of its . participants and beneficiaries; (2) it will allow the Trust to obtain a valuable property at a price less than the appraised value; (3) it will allow the Trust to purchase the Clinic Facility with no down payment and with all purchase obligations amortized out of rentals; and (4) it will allow the Trust, at its sole discretion, in the-event of a default of the lease payments to (a) sell the property and pay off all purchase obligations, or (b) void the lease, return the premises to the seller and walk away from the unpaid balance of the purchase obligations with no personal liability.

These rules provide, among other things, that opposition to the granting of an application must be filed with the Commission within 30 days after the date of notice of filing of the application is published in the Federal Register. Failure seasonably to oppose will be construed as a waiver of opposition and participation in the proceeding. Opposition under these rules should comply with rule 240(c) of the rules of practice which requires that it set forth specifically the grounds upon which it is made, and specify with particularity the facts, matters and things relied upon, but shall not include issues or allegations phrased generally. Opposition not in reasonable compliance with the requirements of the rules may be rejected. The original and one copy of any protest shall be filed with the Commission, and a copy shall also be served upon applicant's representative or applicant if no representative is named. If the protest includes a request for- oral hearing, the request shall meet the requirements of Rule 240(c)(4] of the special rules and shall include the certification required. Section 240(e) further provides, in part, that an applicant who does not intend timely to presecute itsapplication shall promptly request Its dismissal. Further processing steps will be by Commission notice or order which will be served on each party of record. Broadening amendments will not be accepted after the date of this publication except for good cause shown. Any authority granted may reflect administratively acceptable restrictive amendments to the transaction proposed. Some of the-'applications may have been modified to conform with Commission policy. We find with the exception of those applications involving Impediments (e.g,, jurisdictional problems, unresolved fitness questions, questions involving possible unlawful control, or improper divisions of operating rights) that each applicant has demonstrated, in accordance with the applicable provisions of 49 U.S.C. 11301, 11302, 11343, 11344, and 11349, and with the Commission's rules and regulations, that the proposed transaction should be authorized as stated below. Except where specifically noted this decision Is neither a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment nor does It appear to qualify as a major regulatory action under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. In those proceedings containing a statement or note that dual operations are or may be involved we find, preliminarily and in the absence of the issue being raised by a protestant, that the proposed dual operations are consistent with the public interest and the national transportation policy subject to the right of the Commission, which is expressly reserved, to impose such conditions as it finds necessary to insure that applicant's operations shall conform to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10930. In the absence of legally sufficient protests as to the finance application or any application directly related thereto filed within 30 days of publication (or, If the application later becomes unopposed), appropriate authority will be issued tp each applicant (except those with impediments) upon compliance with certain requirements which will be set forth in a notification of effectiveness of this decision-notice. To the extent that the authority sought below ma, duplicate an applicant's existing authority, the duplication shall not be construed as conferring more than a single operating right.

Accordingly, the DRC submitted a list of 31 locomotives requiring repairs costing more than $3,000 per locomotive. See \"DRC Report No. 16.\" and \"DRC Report No. 17.7 (both\" dated December 7,1979). The DRC seeks Commission authorization to repair these locomotives on the following grounds: (1) there is a shortage of locomotives and repair of these locomotives will help alleviate the shortage and help the DRC prepare the locomotive fleet for winter2925 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Notices ,operations; (2) these additional locomotives are needed because the DRC operations have expanded with increased trains; and (3) the DRC will need additional locomotives for new through freight train operations. The cost of materials and labor for repairs to these locomotives varies from $8,562 to $17,124 in DRC Report No. 1 and from $3,500 to $39,000 in DRC Report No. 17. The total cost of repairs is approximately $279,593. We believe.

Another factor considered is the effects of any decision on petitioner's interests. Samples of petitions and the text and explanation of the intervention rules can be found at 43 FR 50908, as modified at 43 FR 60277.

The following applications, filed on or after March 1,1979, are governed by Special Rule 247 of the Commission's General Rules of Practice (49 CFR 1100.247). These rules provide, among other things, that a petition to intervene either with or without leave must be filed with the Commission within 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register with a copy being furnished the applicant. Protests to these applications will be rejected. A petition for intervention without leave must comply with Rule 247(k) which requires petitioner to demonstrate that it (1) holds operating authority permitting performance of any of the service which the applicant seeks authority to perform, (2) has the necessary equipment and facilities for performing that service, and (3) has performed service within the scope of the application either (a) for those supporting the application, or, (b) where the service is not limited to the facilities of particular shippers, from and to, or between, any of the involved points. Persons unable to intervene under Rule 247(k) may file a petition for leave to intervene under Rule 247(1). In deciding whether to grant leave to intervene, the Commission considers, among other things, whether petitioner has (a) solicited the traffic or business of those persons supporting the application, or, (b) where the identity of those supporting the application is not included in the published application notice, has solicited traffic or business identical to any part of that sought by applicant within the affected marketplace. Another factor consideredis the effects of any decision on petitioner's interests. Samples of petitions and the text and explanation of the intervention rules can be found at 43 FR 50908, as modified at 43 FR 60277. Petitions not in reasonable compliance with these rules may be rejected. Note that Rule 247(e), where not inconsistent with the intervention rules, still applies. Especially refer to Rule 247(e) for requirements as to supplying a copy of conflicting authority, serving the petition on applicant's representative, and oral hearing requests.

Further processing steps will be by Commission notice, decision, or letter which will be served on each paity of record. Broadening amendments will not be accepted after the date of this publication. Any authority granted may reflect administratively acceptable restrictive amendments to the service proposed below. Some of the applications may have been modified to conform to the Commission's policy of simplifying grants of operating authority. Findings With the exceptions of those applications involving duly noted problems (e.g., unresolved common control, unresolved fitness questions, and jurisdictional problems) we find, preliminarily, that each applicant has demonstrated that its proposed service. is either (a) required by the public convenience and necessity, or, (b) will be consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101.

Between Anderson and Belton, SC Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Company (SCL), 3600 West Broad Street. Richmond, VA 23230, represented by Charles M. Rosenberger, General Attorney, Seabird Coast Line Railroad Company, P.O. Box 27581, Richmond, VA 23261, hereby give notice that on the 12th day of December, 199, it filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington, DC, an application pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11343-11345 for authority to acquire trackage rights over Norfolk Southern Railway Company and Southern Railway Company between Anderson, SC and Belton, SC, a total distance of approximately 12 miles, all in Anderson County, SC. SCL's trackage rights proposal is an essential portion of a coordination project with Southern. SCL currently owns and operates a parallel line between these two points. SCL proposes to abandon its trackage as line of railroad and to operate over theparallel Southern line via trackage rights and over segments of its abandoned line retained in place and reclassified as industrial track to continue local and through service. All existing customers between Anderson and Belton will continue to be served by SCL from the Southern line or from trackage retainedin place. In the opinion of the applicant, the granting of the.authority sought will not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. In accordance with the Commission's regulations (49 C.F.R. 1108.8) in Ex Parte No. 55 (Sub-No. 4), Implementation- National Environmental Policy Act 1969, 352 LC.C. 451(1976), any protests may include a statement indicating the presence or absence of any effect of the requested Commission action on the quality of the human environment.

On January 8,1980, the Postal Rates Committee of the Board of Governors unanimously voted to close to public observation its meeting of that date, at which the Committee discussed the Opinion and Recommended-Decision of the Postal Rate Commission dated December 5,1979, re Bulk Parcel Post (Commission Docket No. MC78-1), and the Opinion and Recommended Decision of the Postal Rate Commission dated December 17,1979, re Electronic Computer Originated Mail Service (F_- COM) (Commission Docket No. MC78-3). The Committee determined that, pursuant to section 552b(c)(10] of title 5, United States Code; and \u00a7 7.30) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the meeting was exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government in the Sunshine Act in that it was likely to specifically concern the participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding, and that the public interest did not require the discussion of this matter to be open to the public. In accordance with section 552b~f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and \u00a7 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service certified that in his opinion the meeting ffiight properly beclosed to public observation pursuant to 552b(c)(10) of title 5, United States Code; and \u00a7 7.3(j) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.

On January 8,1980, the Postal Rates Committee of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service voted to close to public observation its meeting scheduled for February 6,1980. Each of the members of the Committee (Governors Wright, Hardesty, and Sullivan] voted in favor of closing this meeting, which is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Wright, Hardesty, Allen, Camp, Ching, and Sullivan; Postmaster General Bolger, Deputy Postmaster General Conway; Senior Assistant Postmaster General Finch; and Secretary of the Board Cox. The meeting will consist of a continuation of the discussions of the Recommended Decisions of the Postal Rate Commission on Bulk Parcel Post (Commission Docket No. MC78-1) and on Electronic Computer Originated Mail (E-COM) (Commission Docket No. MC78-3) which were commenced at the Committee's meeting of January 8,1980. The Committee is of the opinion that public access to the planned discussion would be likely to disclose matters whose disclosure would be inconsistent with the public's interest in having the Committee able to discuss issues on the basis of candid exploration of those issues, without concern for unreasonably influencing particular litigation. A number of these issues are likely to be the subjects both of administrative litigation during the course of ensuing proceedings before the Postal Rate Committee and of appellate judicial litigation. Accordingly, the Committee bas determined that, pursuant to section 552b(c)(10) of title 4 and \u00a7 7.30) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern the participation of the Postal Servce in a civil action or proceeding.

In accordance with section 552b{f](l) of title 5, United States Code, and \u00a7 7.6[a) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Servicehas certified that in his opinion the portion of the meeting to be closed may properly be closed to public observation, pursuant to section 552b[c](10) of titles, United States Code, and \u00a7 7.30) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.

On January 8,1980, theBoard of Governors of the United States Postal Service voted to close to public observation a portion of its next meeting, scheduled for February 6,1980. Each of the members of the Board voted In favor of partially closing this meeting. which is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Wright, Hardesty, Allen, Camp, Ching. and Sullivan; Postmaster General Bolger; Deputy Postmaster General Conway, Senior Assistant Postmaster General Finch; and Secretary of the Board Cox. The portion of the meeting to be closed will consist of a continuation of the discussion of the Postal Service's possible strategies concerning future postal ratemaking which was commenced at the Board's meeting of December 4,1979, and continued at its meeting of January 7,1980. The Board is of the opinion that public access to the planned discussion of future postal ratemaking strategies would be likely to disclose matters. whose disclosure would be inconsistent with the public's interest in having the Board able to provide policy guidance to postal management on ratemaking Issues on the basis of candid: exploration of those issues, without concern for unreasonably influencing particular litigation. A number of these issues are likely to-be the subjects both of administrative litigation during the course of the Postal Service's next general rate proceeding before the Postal Rate Commission and of the appellate judicial litigation which will probably follow that proceeding. Accordingly the Board of Governors has determined that, pursuant to section 552b(c](3) of title 5, United States Code, and \u00a7 7.3[c) of title 39, Code of Federal Federal Register / Vol. 45, go. 10 / Tuesday, January 15, 1980 / Sunshine Act Me~tings Regulations, the portion of the meeting to be closed is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552b(b)), in that it is likely to disclose information prepared for use in connection with proceedings under chapter 36 of title 39 (having to do with postal ratemaking, o mail classification, and postal service), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of title 39. The Board determined further that, pihuant to section 552b(c)(10) of title 5 and \u00a7 7.3(j) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern the participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding. Finally, the Board of Governors has determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of its possible ratemaking strategies and positions be open to the public. -In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and \u00a7 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in his opinion the portion of the meeting to be closed may properly be closed to public observation, pursuant to sections,552b(c)(3), and 552b(c)(10) of title 5,ind section 410(c)(4) of title 39, United States Code, and \u00a7\u00a7 7.3(c) and 7.3(j) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations. , - LOUIs A.

J 290Fdea eise \"hears ofndern Term ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL REGISTER 1 CFR Ch. I Identification of Subjects In Agdncy Regulations AGENCY: Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (ACFR). ACTION: Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: We are seeking comments on a proposed new requirement for final rule documents in the Federal Register (FR) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This requirement would add a new information element to each Part of the CFR: \"List of Subjects in this Part.\" The list would help readers know whether a regulation was of interest to them, and identify persons or classes of persons affected by the regulation. The List would also help the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) prepare more complete and accurate indexes. DATE: Comments must be received by March 17,1980. -. ADDRESS: Comments should be addressed to: The Federal Register (Thesaurus), National Archives and Records Service, Washington, D.C.' 20408. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:. Carol Mahoney, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Service, Washington, D.C. 20408, Telephone (202) 523-5266. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background An important tool to the success of the \"List of Subjects in this Part\" is the Federal Register Thesaurus. In the List, agencies .would be required to identify major topics in their regulations in words taken from the Federal Register Thesaurus. We have published two previous documents on the development and use of a thesaurus to standardize terms for identifying, indexing and retrieving information contained in the FR/CFR system (39 FR 14548, 4/24/74, and 42 FR 12986, 3/7177). As indicated in these previous documents, Federal Register users frequently find the same or similar material identified in different terms by. different Government agencies. The vocabulary used by Government agencies in turn often differs from Federal Register indexing terms and users'*search terms. The use of the Thesaurus is intended to support the public information function of Federal Register publications by standardizing, wherever possible, the languagd used todescribe Federal regulations, not only _ for the OFR in carrying out its indexing function, but also for Government agencies in drafting regulations and for the public in researching regulations. When Would This Regulation be ImplementedT We anticipate that the implementation of this regulation would be accomplished in an orderly and systematic manner to enable agencies to 'develop an efficient routine for, -accomplishing its goals. The regulation would be put into operation in stages. At the outset, we would require a \"List of Subjects in this Part\" for each new Part added to an agency's regulations or for a major revision and republication of a Part..The List would be required when the regulations are published in the Federal Register. The List would also be. included in the CFR as part of the codified regulations of the agency. We would prescribe the format for this List. After this initial implementation stage, we would set up a'schedule to add \"Lists of Subjects in this Part' to all regulations in the CFR. We gee this as necessary because some regulations are infrequently revised, and to be effective, the List must be used throughout the CFR system. Many agencies are involved in improving rulemaking processes and may be interested in providing the public with this additional information tool without waiting for final action on this requirement. We will provide technical assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis to help agencies initiate this new service.' How Would the Agency Implement the Regulation? We will provided training and consult with agencies to help them -comply with -mandatory use of Thesaurus terms. This training will include information on how the Thesauivs works and how to apply it to the regulations of individual agencies. We recently used the Thesaurus to prepare a revised and expanded index to the CFR. The experience gained in this project in classifying regulations and testing the suitability of thesaurus terms will be made available to agencies through training by our staff. The Thesaurus will be a dynamic document, and-we will review any', requests fpr the addition'or d~ltionof terms in the Thesaurus. In some cases, an agency may wish to include very specific terms in its Lists which are not contained in the Thesaurus. These more specific terms may be included, so long as the appropriate Thesaurus terms are also used. The Thesaurus will bepublished periodically to reflect updates. \" Where Does an Agency Place tho \"List of Subjects in this Part?\" The \"List of Subjects in this Part\" would always be placed immediately following the Part Heading and preceding the list of sections for the Part. REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS: We seek comments from the general public and the agencies on this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. We have reprinted the Thesaurus with this document for your convenience. Ernest J. Galdi, Secretary, Administrative Committee of tho FederalRegister. January 10, 198o. Scope and Arrangement of the Federal Register Thesaurus The subject terms included in the Thesaurus were derived from terms previously usedin FR and C#R indexes, These terms were reviewed and consolidated and a cross-reference structure showing the relationships between terms was added. Various published thesauruses and indexes were consulted in selecting terms and cross- references. There are two sections to the Thesaurus. The first is an alphabetical list of all tefims with a series of. notations under each te'rn to refer users, to preferred or related terms. The second is an alphabetical listing of terms under broad subject categories, allowing the user to determine quickly the extent of coverage for any one of the categories within the Thesaurus.
