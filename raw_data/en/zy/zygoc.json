Organic strawberries and beet roots had stronger in vitro effects against colon and breast cancer cell lines Collectively, in vitro and animal studies organic/biodynamic does impact aspects of cell life, the immune system, and overall growth -Most outcomes observed in animals have not been examined in humans so far. Published meta-analyses reveal modestly higher content of phenolic compounds in organic food -Hard to tie causal relationship to health Cadmium -Linked to kidney disease -Large scientific reviews finding higher levels in conventional vs organic Mie A, Andersen H, Grandjean P, et al.

Nature will be bound into service, hounded in her wanderings, and put on the rack and tortured for her secrets .\" 25Rudolf Steiner The Power of Thinking Biodynamic Preparations Prediction of Mad Cow Disease - \"What would happen if the ox were to eat meat directly instead of plants? ..... the oxen would go mad, would turn into terribly wild, furious creatures...\" Prediction of Colony Colapse Syndrome -In 1923 Rudolf Steiner warned beekeepers that to continue down the road of industrialized beekeeping would result in the disappearance of the bees within 80 years. The first report of what is now known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) was in November of 2006 26Steiner and Medicine As early as 1917, Rudolf Steiner suggested the injection of mistletoe extracts for the treatment of cancer. -Over 60-70% of cancer patients in European countries use mistletoe as a complementary therapy today. -Clinical effectiveness of mistletoe extracts in cancer has been investigated in a great number of studies, among these 43 prospective randomized controlled trials. They report significant clinical benefits. -Johns Hopkins currently leading a phase 1 clinical trial prompted by Ivelisse Page, a Stage 4 colon cancer survivor who credits her success to mistletoe. 27Goethean Science Experiment as interactive experience -\"The human being himself, to the extent that he makes sound use of his senses, is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist.\" Goethe developed two dynamic concepts applicable across all domains -Polarity -Morphology- logical-linear -process of conscious picture building \"If we want a living perception of nature, we must become as mobile and flexible as nature herself\" Science is a conversation with nature 29How do we measure Quality Copper Chloride alone 30Picture Forming Methods 31Raw Biodynamic Milk 32Coffee 33Babies! 34Picture Forming Methods 35 36Ethical Iceberg 2 Annual emissions must drop to ~41 GtCO2e by 2020 if we are to have a feasible chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C Currently "}
