DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Nutrition Service 7 CFR Part 250 Donation of Food for Use In the United States, Its Territories and Possessions and Areas Under Its Jurisdiction AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule would-amend the Food Distribution Program Regulations (7 CFR Part 250) by permitting processors to pay refunds later than 10 days after receipt of the - refund application for processed end products containing donated cheese. Since the surpluses of-cheese have been reduced so drastically, the Department can -no longer fill requests for cheese in unlimited amounts. Set amounts of cheese have been made available to each distributing agency. Current regulations require processors to make refund payments to recipient agencies within 10 days of receipt of a refund application. The Department anticipates delays in the delivery of cheese during the second and third quarter of school year 1988-1989. The Department plans to catch up with any delayed shipments during the fourth quarter. The intended effect of this action is to amend procedures to take into consideration delayed shipments of cheese. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective November 16, 1988. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTAC . Susan Proden, Chief, Program Administration Branch, Food Distribution Division, Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia 22302 or telephone (703) 756-3660.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and has been classified not major. We anticipate that this rule will not have an annual impact on the economy of more than $100 million. No major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies or geographic regions is anticipated. This action is not expected to have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Permitting processors to pay refunds later than 10 days after~receipt of the refund application for processed end products containing cheese is necessary for the 1988-1989 school year. Shipments of donated cheese are expected to be behind schedule for the second and third quarters of the school year. The Department anticipates catching up with deliveries by the fourth quarter. The Administrator has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C.533(b), that prior notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. A significant portion of the cheese available to States for this fiscal year will be delivered too late in the year for effective use. Without the change instituted by this rule, recipient agencies would-be forced to buy products containing cheese at full price, because few processors will be willing to advance.refunds if they have not received adequate donated cheese to account for the refunds. By allowing processors to delay payment of the refunds, recipient agencies can receive the processed products with the assurance that refunds for donated cheese will eventually be forthcoming. This rule must be put in place immediately to benefit recipient agencies and processors this school year. This rule relieves processors from having to pay refunds within 10 days if anticipated shipments of cheese are delayed. For this reason, the Administrator has also determined in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication. This action has been reviewed with regard to requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Anna Kondratas Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under 10.550 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V and the final rule related notice published June 24, 1983 (48 FR 29112)). In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501- 3520), the additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements contained in this rule are subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Current reporting and recordkeeping requirements for Part 250 were approved by OMB under-control number 0584-0007. Background Section 250.30 of the current regulations sets foi'th the terms and conditions under which State distributing agencies, subdistributing agencies and recipient agencies may enter into contracts with food processors to incorporate government- donated commodities into processed end products. Donated cheese has been available to schools and other outlets such as charitable institutions in any amounts that could be utilized without waste since 1981. As a result of the abundant supply of this commodity, many distributing agencies entered into numerous processing agreements for the conversion of donated cheese into end products such as pizza. Also, the Department established the National Commodity Processing Program to further increase the number of recipient agencies receiving the benefits of .commodity assistance through processing agreements. Since 1981, over 5 billion pounds of surplus dairy commodities have been, distributed to low-income households. These distributions as well as ones made to schools and other outlets have substantially reduced the surplus of cheese available for various Food Distribution. Programs. Moreover, modifications in agricultural price- support programs have brought supply 46080 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations and demand into better balance, thereby reducing the volume of commodities the Government has been required to purchase under price-support programs. Since the surpluses of cheese have been reduced so drastically, the Department can no longer fill requests for cheese in unlimited amounts. Therefore, for the 1988-1989 School Year, State distributing agencies were notified in June of the total amount of cheese to be made available to them for the entire year. The cheese made available to States could be distributed directly to recipient agencies or furnished to processors to be used in the manufacture of end products. State agencies were also informed as to the total amount of cheese that could be ordered each quarter against the total available amount. It was recommended that State agencies inform processors of the total amount of cheese to be furnished to them for the 1988-1989 contract year as well as the amounts of cheese to be delivered each quarter of the contract year. Processors were further to be informed that sales for the year could not exceed the total amount of cheese to be delivered for the year plus any carryover inventory from the previous year. If processors went into a negative inventory status (used more cheese than was available from the State), they did so at their own financial risk. Section 250.30(k)(3) of the current regulations requires that processors make refund payments for the value of government commodities contained in processed end products to recipient agencies not later than 10 days after receipt of the refund application. The Department anticipates delays in the delivery of cheese during the second and third quarters of School Year 1988- 1989. Because of these delays, processors may not receive the total amounts of cheese that are anticipated for these quarters. The Department, however, plans to catch up with any delayed shipments during the fourth quarter, ensuring that the total amount of cheese made available for 1988-1989 is delivered. Processors who experience delays in shipments may not have physical inventory of cheese on hand to cover refund applications received during the second and third quarters. Section 250.30(k)(3) of this rule is being amended to permit processors to make refund payments to recipient agencies for end products containing cheese later than 10 days after receipt of the refund application in those quarters where cheese deliveries to the processor fell short of their allocation; Provided however, that the processor has firsthonored all requests for refunds received for end products sold during the period for which it had USDA cheese. Processors will be required to notify recipient agencies in writing that they are unable to process their refund payments at this time. This notification to the recipient agencies should take place within 10 days of receipt of the refund application. Once cheese is delivered, processors will be required to pay refunds which have been held based on the date the refund application was received. Those applications are to be processed on a first come first serve basis and payments must be processed within 10 days of receipt of the commodity. Under no circumstances should processors make sales with a promise of a refund payment in excess of their cheese allocation for the entire 1988- 1989 school year.

ACTiOw Final rule. SUMMAR. This document amends ,the Customs Regulations to implement recent legislative changes to enhance Customs enforcementof the currency reporting, and controlled substances laws and assist In preventing the Importation of merchandise contrary to law. The statutory changes concern reporting requirements for individuals and various modes of transportation,penalties, searches and seizures. To clarify vessel reporting requirements and to implement new vessel reporting requirements for small vessels arriving in the Miami, Florida, Customs District, operators -of small vessels arriving in that area will be required to stop at a designated reporting location and, through a clearly marked Customs telephone, report their arrival before proceeding in their destination. In addition to the reporting requirements, the:amendments-also implement legislative provisions of the Act which provide for civil and criminal monetary penalties and for the seizure and forfeiture of conveyances used to transport unmanifested merchandise or controlled substances as -well as the .. - merchandise thereon., This action is being taken as part of Customs continuing efforts to interdict the smuggling of controlled substances and other merchandise being introduced contrary to law into the southern Florida area and to enforce the currency reporting laws. These regulations will. close a loophole in interdiction efforts concerning the significant-number of small vessels arriving in that area carrying controlled substances, unreported monetary instruments or : undeclared merchandise. -..

The reporting requirements are consolidated in section 433, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,(19 U.S.C. 1433),.which providesin pertinet part, that'vessels must genfraly-iport to Customs - immediately upon their arrivalaid-in \" such manner as the.Selretary of the - Treasury may prescribe by. regulation.The Act amended section 401(k), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 14u1k)), to clarify that vessels arriving in.the United States after visiting a hovering vessel or a point or place where it has received merchandise is deemed to be arriving from a foreign port or place and, that controlled substances are generally to be considered as prohibited merchandise. - The Act amended section 594, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1594), * relating to the seizure and forfeiture of.' conveyances used for the importation of * prohibited merchandise; by narrowing and clarifying the previously existing exceptions to the seizure and forfeiture provisions of that section. This document implements the arrival, reporting, and conveyance seizure and forfeiture provisions of the Act as to \"small vessels\", as defined. Initially, the special procedures for reporting arrival of small vessels are being limited to arrivals-within the Miami, Florida, Customs District, as defined in \" 101.3(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 101'3(b)). Operators of small vessels - arriving in the United States.in that area -willbe-required to stop at a small vessel reporting location before proceeding to their intended destination and, through a clearly marked Customs telephone. - immediately report their arrival to Customs..The Customs officer answering the call-will ask for -information such as: Registration number, name of vessel, owner name, * operator/passenger name(s),-date(s) of birth, *foreign ports or places visited, duration of stay, foreign acquisitions, and user fee decal number, if any. The Customs officer will then instruct the vessel operator that the vessel may proceed or that further action, which .may include inspection/examination at another location, is required. The District Director of Customs at Miami will retain the authority to change the reporting locations, their number, or location. The 14 small vessel reporting stations established within the Miami, Florida. Customs District by T.D. 87-150 for small vessel arrival reporting have been expanded to 24 in number. They are: Vessels entering the Miami District southern introcoastal waterway. 1. A & B Marina, 700 Marina St., Key West, Florida 33040. 2. Tavernier Creek Marina, P.O.

The interim regulations established procedures forreporting the'arrival of small vessels in the Miami District, see \u00a7 4.2a, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.2a). They also implemented the provisions of the Act which provide for civil monetary penalties for the failure to report arrival and additional civil monetary penalties if unmanifested merchandise was on board a non- reporting vessel. The vessel manifest penalties of section 584, Tariff Act of'1930, as amended 19 U.S.C. 1584), were made applicable if the merchandise on board a non-reporting vessel consists of controlled substances. Criminal monetary penalties and Imprisonment were provided for if the failure to report arrival was intentional and if controlled substances were found on board the non-reporting vessel. The civil penalty included seizure and forfeiture provisions related to the vessel and the merchandise in addition to the monetary penalties. These regulations, it was noted, were part of Customs continuing effort to combat the problem of drug smuggling by Vessel and to more specifically deal with techniques developed by drug smugglers utilizing small vessels for that purpose. It was also noted that Customs would now have greater control over small vessels in the southern Florida area because -those vessels will now be required to go to designated reporting locations and immediately report their arrival. Thus, smugglers will not be able to proceed to private docks and unload contraband before continuing to their intended destination and then reporting their arrival to Customs. This was possible under the previously existing law and regulations which permitted the report of arrival to be delayed for as long as 24 hours after arrival in the U.S. The December 21, 1987, Federal Register notice solicited public comments on the new requirements. The comments received have been taken into consideration in formulating the final rule and are discussed in this document. Analysis of Comments On hundred sixteen comments were received in response to the solicitation of comments contained in the Federal Register notice. The comments noted operational difficulties caused by the implementation of the small boat reporting procedures in the Miami, Florida, District. Several commenters indicated that the facilities at the Watson Island reporting station, the only Dade County, Florida, location, were inadequate and that the conditions there were unsafe and crowded. Repairs have been made to the docking area, and the city of Miami has been requested to enforce the \"No Wake\" provision around the Watson Island area. In addition, reporting facilities have been established at three new locations-Matheson Hammock, Sunset Harbour and Crandon Park Marinas. Many commenters expressed concern about crowded conditions at reporting locations in the Miami and Ft. Lauderdale areas. A new reportinglocation near the entrance to Hillsboro Inlet was requested. The Customs Service has established ten additional reporting stations in the Miami District, with three in the Miami Area as indicated above, and two in the Ft. Lauderdale vicinity. A new reporting location has been established near the entrance to Hillsboro inlet at the Light House Point Marina inPompano Beach. In addition, Customs'has established a Private Marina Visa Plan in the Miami District. The plan allows the clientele of a private marina, after the marina obtains prior approval from Customs, to discharge arrival reporting responsibilities, pursuant to \u00a7 4.2a, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.2a), at that location. This plan, along with the additional reporting locations, should relieve the crowded conditions which were the subject of these comments. Several commenters complained of the inconvenience of having to go to a specific location to report their arrival. They believed that they were being discriminated against and that drug smugglers still were not going to report under the new system. We do not agree with the claim of discrimination. We note that prior to the new rporting requirements, private vessels had up to 24 hours to report their arrival. This created a large loophole In our ifiterdiction efforts in that vessels involved in smuggling could off-load their contraband at a remote location and then' report 'to Customs. With immediate reporting, private vessels are channeled into specific locations where they will report and possibly be subject to inspection. Customs, the Coast Guard, and State and local marine untis will be in a better position to more quickly distinguish suspect and non-suspect vessels. This more efficient targeting of suspect vessels will result in more efficient use of limited marine law enforcement resources which otherwise may be wasted on launches and boardings of no-suspect vessels. One commenter stated that boaters should be permitted to utilize VHF radio aboard boats to report arrival. Customs disagrees with this proposal. We believe that such reporting scheme would recreate the situation that existed before the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was enacted. Since section 433, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, requires an immediate report of arrival, and report by radio transmission can be made from an unfixed location at any time, Customs would be unable to confirm that the statutory requirement had been met. Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46083 After consideration of all the comments received, and following further review of the matter, it has been determined to adopt the interim regulations as published. Executive Order 12291 Because this document does not meet the criteria for a \"major rule\" as defined in E.O. 12291, a regulatory impact analysis was not prepared, Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) it is certified that the amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, it is not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Arnold L.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This change in the regulations decreases the maximum allowable interest rate on section 235 (Homeownership for Lower Income Families) insured loans. This final rule is intended to bring the maximum permissible financing charges for this program into line with competitive market rates. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 1, 1988. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John N. Dickie, Chief Mortgage and Capital Market Analysis Branch, Office of Financial Management, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone (202) 755-7270. (This is not a toll-free number.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following amendments to 24 CFR Chapter II have been made to decrease the maximum interest rate which may be charged on loans insured by this Department under section 235 of the National Housing Act. The maximum .interest rate on the HUD/FHA Section 235 insurance programs has been lowered from 10.50 percent to 10.00 percent. Until recently, HUD regulated interest rates not only for the Section 235 Program, but also for fire safety equipment loans insured under section 232 of the National Housing Act. However. section 429(e)(2) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (pub. L. 100-242 approved February 5, 1988) amended the National Housing Act to provide that interest onfire safety equipment loans under section 232(i) of the Act will be \"at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.\" Accordingly, these loans, like most other National Housing Act-authorized loans, now have their interest rates determined by negotiation. Accordingly, this annnouncement of a change in interest rate ceilings for FHA-insured mortgages is limited to the Section 235 Program. The Secretary has determined that this change is immediately necessary to meet the needs of the market and to prevent speculation in anticipation of a change. As a matter of policy, the Department submits most of its rulemaking to public comment, either before or after effectiveness of the action. In this instance, however, the Secretary has determined that advance notice and public comment procedures are unnecessary and that good cause exists for making this final rule effective immediately. HUD regulations published at 47 FR 56266 (1982), amending 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, contain categorical exclusions from their requirements for the actions, activities and programs specified in \u00a7 50.20. Since the amendments made by this rule fall within the categorical exclusions set forth in paragraph (1) of \u00a7 50.20, the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement or Finding of No Significant Impact is not required for this rule. This rule does not constitute a \"major rule\" as that term is defined in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation issued on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local governmental agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule provides for a small increase in the mortgage interest rate in programs of limited applicability, and thus of minimal effect on small entities. This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulationspublished on October 24,1988 (53 FR 41974) pursuant to Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 14.108, 14.117, and 14.120. List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 235 Condominiums, Cooperatives, Low and moderate income housing, Mortgage insurance, Homeownership, Grant programs: housing and community development. Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR Part 235 as follows: PART 235-MORTGAGE INSURANCE AND ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS FOR HOME OWNERSHIP AND PROJECT REHABILITATION 1. The authority citation for 24 CFR Part 235 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sections 211, 235, National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715b, 1715z); Section 7(d), Department of Housing and Urban Development Act, (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). 2. In \u00a7 235.9, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows: \u00a7235.9 Maximum Interest rate. (a) The mortgage shall bear interest at the rate agreed upon by the mortgagee and the mortgagor, which rate shall not exceed 1O.00percent per annum, except that where an application for commitment was received by the Secretary before November 1, 1988, the loan may bear interest at the maximum rate in effect at the time of application. 3. In \u00a7 235.540, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows: \u00a7 235.540 Maximum Interest rate. (a) On or after November 1, 1988, the loan shall bear interest at the rate agreed upon by the lender and the borrower, which rate shall not exceed 10.00 percent per annum, with the exception of applications submitted pursuant to feasibility letters, or outstanding conditional or firm commitments, issued prior to the effective date of the new rate. In these, instances, applications will be processed at a rate not exceeding the applicable previous maximum rates, if the higher rate was previously agreed upon by the parties. Notwithstanding these exceptions, the application w~ll be processed at the'new lower rate if requested by the mortgagee.46084 Federal Register / Vol. 53, Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46085 Date: October 31, 1988.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the Federal Register of September 28,1988 (53 FR 37801), in which it was announced that the Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4], New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, had submitted pesticide petition 8E3597 to EPA on behalf of Dr. Robert H. Kupelian, National Director, IR-4 Project, and the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Idaho and Washington. The petition requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose the establishment of a tolerance for the combined residues of the herbicide 2-[1-(ethoxyimino)butyl]-5-[2- (ethylthio)propyl]-3-hydroxy-2- cyclohexene-1-one and its metabolites containing the 2-cyclohexene-l-one moiety (calculated as the herbicide) in or on the raw agricultural commodity lentils at 30.0 parts per million (ppm). There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and Information .considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted if the objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify the relief sought. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L 90- 354, 94 Stat. 1184, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4,1981 (40 FR z4950).

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY:, This document denies a proposal to allot Channel 234A to Mandeville, Louisiana due to noncompliance with the principal city coverage requirement of \u00a7 73.315 of the Commission's Rules. The conflicting proposal to allot Channel 234A to Lacombe, Louisiana is granted. The document also denies a counterproposal by William Sailer for Channel 235A for Mandeville as well as a petition for reconsideration filed by William Seiler directed against an earlier action returning his petition for rule making for Channel 235A at Mandeville. These latter two actions are premised on the fact that a Channel 235A allotment at Mandeville would require a substitution of Channel 235A at Reserve, Louisiana, which was alloted in MM Docket No. 84-231. Finally, this document dismisses counterproposals filed by John Watkins and Beach Broadcasting Limited Partnership for the upgrade of the Channel 233A allotment at Long Beach, Mississippi, because there are merely pending applications for the Long Beach allotment and the upgrade procedure Is only available to permittees or licensees. With this action, this proceeding Is terminated. DATES: Effective December 22, 1988. The window period for filing applications on Channel 234A at Lacombe, Louisiana will open on December 23,1988, and close on January 23,1989. 46086 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Hayne, Mass Media Bureau,(202) 634-W3.,SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

SUMMARY. The Commission, at the request of KCMA, Inc., substitutes Channel 221C2 for Channel 221A at Broken Arrow, OK, and modifies its license for Station KCMA(FM) to specify operation on the higher powered channel, and substitutes Channel 255A for Channel 221A at Coffeyville, Kansas, and modifies the license of Midwest Broadcasting Co. for Station KQQF(FM) to specify the new Coffeyville channel. The Commission found that the allotment of Channel 221C2 to Broken Arrow could provide increased FM service to the area while not significantly impacting noncommercial educational services in the area. It also found that Midwest Broadasting Co. had not presented a substantial and material question of fact which would warrant a hearing on the modification of StationKQQF(FM)'s license. In addition, the Commission denied the counterproposal of Midwest Broadcasting Co. to substitute Channel 287C2 for Channel 221A at Broken Arrow and substitute Channel 221A for Channel 287A at Bixby, Oklahoma. Channel 221C2 can be allotted to Broken Arrow in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 19.7 kilometers (12.4 miles) west to avoid a short-spacing to Station KKEG, Channel 221A, Fayetteville, Arkansas. The coordinates for this allotment are North Latitude 36- 03-37 and West Longitude 96-00-57. Channel 255A can be allotted to Coffeyville in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements and can be used at Station KQQF(FM)'s present transmitter site. The coordinates for this allotment are North Latitude 37-06-28 and West Longitude 96-43-22. With this action, this proceeding is terminated. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22,1988.

Introduction The legislative history of section 4c(a) reveals that the overall purpose of that section was to prohibit certain types of noncompetitive transactions that might facilitate fraud and manipulation.2 The EFP exception to the section was added to preserve \"a common and necessary practice\" utilized by commercial market participants to facilitate basis trading, hedging, and the Oricing of cash commodity transactions.2 Section 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act states in pertinent part that: 4 It shall be unlawful to offer to enter into, enter into or confirm the execution of, any transaction involving any commodity, * * * if [the] transaction is * * * a \"wash sale\",\"cross trade\", or \"accommodation trade\", or is a fictitious sale ** * or if [the) transaction is used to cause any price to be reported, registered, or recorded which is not a true and bona fide price.

The Division of Trading and Markets (\"Division\") presented a report on EFPs to the Commission in October of 1987. In that report, the Division stated that the statutory exception for EFPs should be limited to bona fide transactions which strictly comply with the terms of section 4c(a) and exchange rules and which are not designed to accomplish some otherwise illegal purpose. At the same time, however, the Division stated that, subject to these requirements, the exception for EFPs contained in section 4c(a) should not be confined solely to those practices In existence at the time the statute Was adopted. Rather, in the Division's view, permitting EFPs to accommodate the changing needs of market participants is consistent with the intent of Congress to preserve commercial transactions, so long as those transactions are in strict compliance with the requirements of section 4c(a) and exchange rules.2 Under the Division's analysis, an evaluation of the bona fides of any EFP involves a determination of whether the cash- transaction is consistent with commercial practices for other such transactions, independent of EFPs.5 Accordingly, the Division concluded that the failure to conform to standard commercial practices may be an indication that the cash transaction, and thus the EFP, is not bona fide. As a result of the importance of the cash transaction component of the EFP to the Division's analysis, the Division recommended the adoption of regulations specifically requiring disclosure of documentation of the cash s In this connection, the Division set forth three requirements of all EFP9 derived from section 4c(a). In general, the Division concluded that all EFPs (1) must consist of integrally related cash and futures transactions, (2) must provide for a transfer of ownership of the cash commodity to the cash buyer upon performance of the terms of the contract, with delivery to take place within a reasonable period of time thereafter, and (3) must be between separate parties to the EFP. 6 It is the existence of a cash commodity transaction which distinguishes EFPs from other types of futures transactions, Accordingly. other indicia of EFP bona ides discussed in the report relate to the nature of the cash component, the pricing of the cash and futures legs of the EFP, the seller's ability to fulfill the obligation to deliver the commodity, and the buyer's acquisition of the commodity following the EFP. 46090 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules portion of an EFP in order to ensure that the exchanges and the Commission have the means of assess fully the bona fides of such transactions and to monitor this limited exception to the prohibitions against noncompetitive trading. The Commission finds merit In this recommendation and therefore is proposing to amend Regulation 1.35 in order to ensure that records of the underlying cash transactions are fully accessible to the exchanges, the Commission, and the United States Department of Justice. II. Recordkeeping Requirements Relating to EFPs A. Current Rules The present regulatory scheme broadly addresses the issue of EFP recordkeeping. Regulation 1.38(b) requires that: [elvery person handling, executing, clearing, or carrying trades, transactions or positions which are not competitively executed, including * * * trades involving the exchange of futures for cash commodities or the exchange of futures in connection with cash commodity transactions, shall identify and mark by appropriate symbol or designation all such transactions or contracts and all orders, records, and memoranda pertaining thereto. Regulation 1.35(a) requires FCMs, IBs, and members of contract markets to \"keep full, complete and systematic records, together with all pertinent data and memoranda, of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures, commodity options, and cash commodities,\" and to retain such records and produce them upon request of the Commission or the United States Department of Justice. In addition, Regulation 1.35(e)(4) directs that each contract market maintain a record showing \"by appropriate and uniform symbols, any transaction which is made noncompetitively in accordance with written rules of the contract market which have been submitted to and approved by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of [Regulation] 1.38.\" Further, Regulation 18.05, 17 CFR 18.05, provides that: [elvery trader who holds or controls a reportable futures position * * * shall keep books and records showing all details concerning all positions and transactions for future delivery in the commodity on all contract markets, * * * and all positions and transactions in the cash commodity, its products, and by-products and, in addition, commercial activities that the trader hedges in the commodity underlying the futures contract in which the trader is reportable, and that the trader furnish information concerning the futures and cashcommodity transactions to the Commission upon request. Thus, under the Commission's current regulations, every person \"handling, executing, clearing, or carrying\" EFPs must identify those transactions and all related documents. Further, every FCM must keep systematic records of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in futures, options, or cash commodities, and each trader holding or controlling reportable futures positions (\"large trader\") must keep records of all futures and cash commodity positions and transactions. Finally, every contract market must maintain a record specifically noting all EFPs. Moreover, pursuant to sections 8 and 6(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 12, 9, and Part 11 of the Commission's Regulations, 17 CFR Part 11, the Commission has access to a wide range documentation that may be relevant to matters under its jurisdiction. The Commission believes that the availability of such documentation is essential to the success of exchange surveillance programs for monitoring EFPs and determining whether they are bona fide. It is equally necessary to the Commission's ability to monitor the effectiveness of the exchanges' surveillance programs with respect to EFPs and to the Commission's ability to review such trades in the course of routine trade practice surveillance or specific investigations. The present regulations, however, do not state specifically that customers who are not large traders must document cash transactions underlying EFPs. Further, they do not place responsibility for the collection of such documents on FCMs, IBs, and contract market members, nor do they provide the contract markets with express authority to request such documents. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to adopt rules intended to assure that specific documents evidencing cash transactions underlying EFPs are created and retained in accordance with cash market practices and that the -contract markets and the Commission have an effective and efficient means of obtaining such documents upon request. B. Proposed Rules In light of the foregoing, the Commission proposes to amend Regulation 1.35 by adding a new paragraph (a-2), comprising subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), which relates to the production of documentation of cash transactions underlying EFPs. 1. Proposed Subparagraph (a-2)()- Collection of customer Documentationby FCMs, IBs, and Members of Contract Markets The Commission proposes to add to Regulation 1.35 a new paragraph (A- 2)(1) which would require that FCMs, IBs, and members of contract markets, upon request of the exchange, the Commission, or the United States Department of Justice, obtain from their customers and provide to the requesting body documentation of each transactions underlying exchanges of futures. for physicals as such documentation is defined in proposed subparagraph (a-2)(4). The Commission believes that ready access to such documentation is necessary to the thorough evaluation of EFPs. The ability to obtain that documentation from customers will allow the contract markets to examine fully EFPs and to meet their self-regulatory duties under Commission Regulation 1.51, 17 CFR 1.51, to ensure the propriety of those transactions. The production of documents similarly will facilitate the Commission's task of monitoring the bona fides of EFPs. 2. Proposed Subparagraph (a-2)(2)-- Customer Production of Documentation Upon Reqeust Proposed subparagaph (a-2)(2) is designed to serve the same regulatory surveillance purposes as proposed subparagraph (a-2)(1). Proposed subparagaph (a-2)(2) would require all customers of FCMs, IBs, and contract market members to create, retain, and produce upon request of the FCM, the IB, the contract market member, the exchange, the Commission, or the United States Department of Justice documentation of the cash transactions underlying EFP transactions. Of course, a customer's inability to produce such documentation would create a strong inference that an EFP is not bona fide.7 The Commission believes that it would not be unreasonable or inappropriate to require customers, who are parties to the cash transactions and therefore have the best access to the requested documents, to produce those documents for examination. Without this corresponding duty upon all customers, FCMs, IBs, and contract market members may lack an enforceable means of fulfilling the regulatory requirement of proposed subparagraph (a-2)(1) and instead would be forced to rely on voluntary customer cooperation for access to documents. The Commission believes that the proposal as a whole would afford an appropriate division of responsibility for document retention, collection, and production bqtween Federal Register Vol. 53, No. 221./ Wednesday, November 16,' 1988' /-Propiosed ules ,-'-46091- FCMs, IBs, their customers. 3. Proposed Subparagraph (a-2J(31-- \"Requi'ement that Contract Markets Adopt Rules Pertaining to Document Production The Commission further proposes to add a new subparagraph a-2-)3), which requires each contract market to adopt rules mandating that its member produce documentation of cash ... transactions underlying EFPs. Proposed subparagraph (a-2)(3) would provide contract markets with an enforceable right to, demand the production' f the, documentation maintained in response to proposed subparagraphs (a-2)(1) and (a-2)(2) in furtherance of their'self- regulatory responsibilities. 4. Proposed Subparagraph (a-2)(4)- Definition of \"documentation\"\" The Commission finally proposes to add a new subparagraph (a-2)(4f'i4hich' sets forth a definition of the term \"documentation\" as it is used in proposed paragraph (a-2). The proposed definition states that such documentation consists of those documents \"customarily generated in accordance with cash market practices which demonstrate the existence and nature of the cash transactions. including, but not limited to, contracts, confirmation statements, telex printouts, invoices, and warehouse receipts or' other documents of title.\" C. Limited Additional Recordkeeping Burden Imposed by Proposed Recordkeeping Rules The proposed amendment to Regulation 1.35 are intended to assure that the documentation necessary'to 'effective investigation of EFPs is available to the exchanges and to the Commission, without imposing burdensome additional recordkeeping requirements on markets bi market participants. It is important to note that FCMs and members of contract markets. must keep records \"of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity options, and cash commodities.\" Moreover, FCMs and members are frequently parties to one or both sides of an EFP transaction. Thus, where an EFP relates to an FCM's or contract market member's business of dealing in futures or cash commodities, the proposed amendments would not, impose additional recordkeeping obligations on those entities not already required by Regulation 1.35(a).Further, IBs, who normally would not be parties to cash transactions, would not be required to maintain records of, The Commission understands that commercial, practices in the markets in which EPs are transacted contemplate that some documentation of the cash transaction will be created.transactions for customers, but only to obtain and'produce them upon request. The 'Commission believes therefore that 'the proposed rdendments would impose upon FCMs, 1Bs. and contract market members only the minimum requirements necessary to assure.' effectivd monitoring of EFPs bY, the exchanges and the Commission. Further, the 'amendments would require &istb irs to produce documents which should be readily accessible. In this regard; customers who maintai\" documents in accordance with,accepted cash m rket practices should be able to comply with proposed subparagraph (a- 2)(2). Moreover; customers who are large traders already must maintain and produce upon request the required documentation in accordance with Regulation 18.05. Thus, ,the proposed amendments will not impose a significant burden on these entities. Finally, several of the exchanges presently require that their members maintain ful and complete records of EFP transactions, including cash transactions, and that members provide those records to the exchange upon request.8 The proposed Commission rule, however, will encourage consistent treatment of similar transactions by all exchanges. Of course, regardless whether exchanges now or in the future have'such-rules, exchanges may continue to request, voluntary cooperation from market participants under'existing programs relating to the exchange responsibility to monitor trading. .In addressing these proposals, commenters are encouraged to direct their comments particularly to the likely- effectiveness of the amendments in achieving :the Commissions stated goals. IV. Related Matters A. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (\"RFA\"), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires that agencies, in proposing rules, consider the impact of the rules on small businesses. The Regulation 1.35 amendments proposed here would affect contract markets, FCMs, lBs. contract' market members, and the customers of New York Mercantile Exchange (\"NYMEX\") Rule 8,12 requires that each seller and buyer satisfy the Exchange that the EFP is bona fide, and provides that clearing members shall obtain all documentation related to the EFP and make that documentation available at the Exchange's request. NYMEX also affirmatively requires that each clearing member routinely submit documentation of the cish transfer for every EFP. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Rule 538 requires that clearing members and brokers handling EFPsamaintain full and clear records of the transactions along with all pertinent memoranda, The Chicago Board of Trade's Rule 444.01 is similar, as is Commodity Exchange. Inc. Rule 4.30.FCMs, Bs, and'contract market :': members.

Proposed Regulation 1.35(a-2) will have little effect on IBs, regardless of size. Pursuant to existing Commission Regulation 1.57, 17 CFR 1.57,iBs will never handle customer EFPs independently. Regulation 1.57 requires that lBs open and carry customer accounts with FCMs and that they transmit customer orders to FCMs. Given this fact, the FCMs, not the'lBs, would have primary rdsp'onsibility foe ,customer'document collection. As a practical matter, 'an IB'Would be approached for customer documents only if an FCM failed in its. document production'duty. Thus, IBsof any size should not be significantly burdened by the proposed rules. Like' lBs, non-FOMmembers seldom will be called upon, to produce' of custoimer EFPs. Non- FCM members generally transacf EFPs for their own accounts. In those instances where no-FCM members may act as brokers to arrange EFPs between customers, those members will handle both'the cash and the futures portions of the trade and will:be acting as lBs. In some circumstances, however, the member may act as broker between customers only as to a cash transaction, which becomes part of an EFP cleared through an FCM.'In such cases, which are likely to occur infrequently, the member only will be approached for the cash documentation if the FCM clearing the EFP fails to fulfill its document production duty. Therefore, the proposed rules should not place a significant, burden on nonFCM membersof any'size.'. Finally, the Commission does not believe that proposed Regulation 1.35(a- 2) significantly will affect customers of FCMs, IBs, or exchange members that 46092 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 /Proposed Rules are also small businesses. For most EFPs, an FCM or contract market member will take the opposite side of a customer transaction and thus will be required to create and retain .- documentation and to report those transactions under existing Regulation 1.35(a). For most EFPs, then, the participation FCM or contract market member will be the primary source for documentation of cash transactions. Generally, only in those instances when two customers trade opposite one another would the customers be the ,originators of documentation-of a cash transaction, although they must.create and retain such documents for -every transaction. In most markets, customers using EFPs generally will be large entities such as commercial market participants (producers, users, etc.), trade houses, institutions, banks, pension funds, and dealers.

Customers presumably create and retain these documents in the. normal course of business for general business, financial, and tax reasons. Second, the proposed rules do not require that customers make routine submissions. The records.of only a small number of transactions will be requested annually so the temporal and monetary impacts of document production on any sngle.small entity should be minimal.

The public reporting burden for this- collection of information is estimated to average one-half hour per response for each of'the 96 FCMs, Is, or contract market -members expected to be required to collect documents from customers during a year. This estimate includes time to request, obtain, t I organize, and provide documents to the Commission or the exchange.

Finally, each customer will be required to maintain documentation ofcash\" transactions underlying EFPs in order to comply with this reporting requirement. Each of the 1700 customers transacting EFPs at reportable levels is expected to spend an average of two hours refining a large trader report document filing system and two hours actually filing documents in it during the course -of a year. The estimated 570 other customers who would be required to maintain documents under proposed Regulation 1.35(a-2) are expected to devote an average of six hours to developing a filing system and two hours to filing documents-annually.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 21, 1983. the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) submitted a proposed revision to its ozone SIP for Printpack. This SIP revision is in the form of a February 5, 1981, Opinion and Order of the Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB) PCB 80- 148. It grants a variance from the existing SIP requirements until December 31, 1985; and provides a legally enforceable compliance schedule. Under the existing federally approved SIP, Printpack's paper coating operation is subject to the 2.9 pounds of.VOC per gallon emission limitation contained in IPCB Rule 205(n(1)(C) of Chapter 2: Air Pollution of the IPCB Rules and Regulations. Final compliance is required by December 31. 1982. In lieu of the compliance date contained in the federally approved SIP, the State is proposing an extended compliance schedule for Printpack. Printpack manufactures flexible packaging for use primarily by the food industry. Printpack is located in the Northeastern Illinois urban ozone nonattainment area, which has obtained an extension to December 31, 1987, to attain the ozone national ambient air quality standard. USEPA may approve compliance date extensions for sources in such areas, if the State demonstrates that the'extension is as expeditious as practicable and will not prevent the area from attaining the ozone standard as expeditiously as practicable, butno later than the end of 1987. , OnAugust 15,1984, the IEPA, submitted Printpack's documentation of its efforts to convert to low-solventf. adhesives. Additional information was -46093 46094 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules submitted by Printpack on November 7, 1984. This documentation included: 1. Internal research and development reports which cover the period from January 1979 to January 1984, which describe Printpack's continuing efforts and progress in developing low solvent adhesives; 2. Reports which describe numerous trials to develop low-solvent adhesives; 3. A description of the company's correspondence with numerous suppliers of adhesives coatings; and 4. Information demonstrating progress made by the company in substantially reducing VOC emissions between 1981 and 1984, as a result of their research and development efforts. This documentation does not satisfy the Clean- Air Act and USEPA's policy on compliance date extensions. In particular, the State has not adequately researched the compliance status of other similar sources to determine if compliance by.the original deadline was reasonable. In the March 20, 1984, Federal Register (49 FR 10277), USEPA proposed to disapprove this proposed SIP revision because the Illinois Ozone SIP lacked an approved attainment demonstration for the Chicago nonattainment area. Since the publication of the March 20, 1984, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, IEPA has submitted a revised ozone attainment demonstration which USEPA proposed to approve on August 15,1984 (49 FR 32601). However, USEPA recently proposed to disapprove the State attainment demonstration (52 FR 26404), July 14,1987). For this reason USEPA believes that the State has not adequately demonstrated that this extension will not interfere with timely attainment of the ozone standard and RFP in the intermin. Proposed Actions USEPA is proposing that Printpack's schedule to achieve final compliance by December 31, 1985, is not approvable because it does not conform with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and policy on compliance schedules. First, the State has not shown that the requested compliance date is as expeditious as practicable. In addition, this source is located in the Chicago nonattainment area which lacks an approved attainment demonstration. A more detailed discussion of the rationale for proposing disapproval of the State submission and of the Clean Air Act and USEPA policy related to oompliance date extensions appears in Appendix A of the proposed rulemaking published on November 8, 1988 at 53 FR 45103. USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period on this notice ofsupplementalproposed rulemaking. Public comments received on or before December 16, 1988, will be considered in USEPA's final rulemaking. All comments will be available for inspection during normal business hours at the Region V office at the front of this notice. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIP approvals do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it applies only to Printpack. Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not \"Major\". It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642. Dated: March 31,1987.

USEPA's action is based upon one revision request and several amendments that were submitted by the State.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 17, 1985, July 30, 1985, and October 25, 1985, the Ohio Environmental Protection Aency (OEPA) submitted a revision request,with several amendments to its ozone SIP for ATEC. This revision consists of (1) a monthly volume- weighted average limitation (3.5 lbs. of VOC/gal), and (2) a never-to-be- exceeded (5.5 lbs of VOC/gal for any coating used) limit for an architectural aluminum extrusion coating line (KO01) located at ATEC in Mahoning County, Ohio, which is an urban nonattainment area for the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) ozone. OEPA also submitted a request to remse the attainment status designation for Mahoning County from nonattainment to attainment for the ozone NAAQS. This redesignation request is under USEPA's review, and USEPA will propose action on it in the near future. Under the existing federally approved SIP, each architectural aluminum extrusion coating line is subject to the VOC limitation containe din OAC Rule 3745-21-09 (U)(1)(iii) [3.5 lbs of VOC/ gall and is subject to the daily volume- weighted average compliance requirementsc.ontained in OAC Rule 3745-21-09 (B). USEPA approved these rules as meeting the RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act on October 31,1980 (45 FR 72122), and June 29, 1982 147 FR 28097). In lieu of the daily volume-weighted average limitation required'by the SIP, the State is proposing that the coatings used in this line (KOOI), which applies Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules a wide variety of coatings to various types of architectural aluminum extrusions, shall not exceed 3.5 lbs of VOC/gal as a monthly volume-weighted average, and 5.5 lbs of VOC/gal for any coating used. USEPA's January 20, 1984, policy memorandum entitled \"Averaging Times for Compliance with VOC Emission Limits\" contains the criteria for evaluating VOC requests for extended averaging which are as follows: Criterion I Extended averaging can be permitted where the source operations are such that daily VOC emissions cannot be determined, or where the application of RACT for each emission point is not economically or technically feasible on a daily basis, The first point is not an issue is this case because ATEC has never claimed that it is not possible to determine daily emissions. As -to the second point, control could be obtained either from the use of complying low solvent coatings or by add-on controls. OEPA submitted documentation from two coating suppliers to demonstrate that complying aluminum coatings are not currently available. However, USEPA believes this information is inconclusive. OEPA believes that add-on control is not economically reasonable for this source because the cost per ton of controlling the noncomplying coatings (which exceed the SIP allowable by less than 10 tons of VOC per year) would be excessive. In particular, OEPA noted that (1) only about 20 percentof the paints being used exceed 3.5 lbs of VOC/gal and, therefore, add-on controls would not be needed for most operations, (2) less than 20 percent of the VOC emissions are emitted from the paint bake oven, and control equipment on the oven would not bring ATEC into compliance on a daily basis, and (3) control of the spray booth emissions would require a change in the parts loading area to enclose the spray area. Additionally, control of the spray booth emissions would also require a large volume of air to be treated due to the large size of parts being painted. However, OEPA has not provided any documentation of the costs for add-on control for this source. . If the State demonstrates conclusively that complying low-solvent coatings are unavailable, then the USEPA would consider an alternative RACT determination for the existing coatings. USEPA is proposing to disapprove this revision because such a demonstration has not been submitted. A detailed discussion on the extent of such an investigation is contained inAppendix A of the proposed rulemaking published on November 9, 1988 at 53 FR 45285. Criterion 2 The area must not lack an approved SIP and there must not be any measured violations of the ozone standard. ATEC is located in Mahoning County, which has an approved 1979 ozone SIP and has had no measured violations of the ozone NAAQS from 1982 through 1985. Therefore, this SIP revision request is consistent with this criterion. Criterion 3 A demonstration must be made that the use of monthly averaging (greater than 24-hour averaging) will not jeopardize either ambient standards attainment or the reasonable further progress (RFP) plan for the area. This must be accomplished by showing that the maximum daily increase in emissions associated with monthly averaging is consistent with the approved ozone SIP for the area. OEPA has demonstrated that the growth margin for the Youngstown area is able to accommodate the maximum daily increase in emissions caused by this revision. Criterion 4 Averaging times must be as short as practicable and in no case longer than 30 days. OEPA did not submit an adequate demonstration that it is not feasible for ATEC to meet the proposed limit using a shorter averaging period (e.g., 7 days or 15 days). USEPA has reviewed this variance and has determined that it does not meet all of USEPA's criteria for monthly averaging. Therefore, USEPA is proposing disapproval of this variance. USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period on this notice of proposed rulemaking. Public comments received on or before December 16, 1988, will be considered in USEPA's final rulemaking. All comments will be available for inspection during normal business hours at the Region V office listed at the front of this notice. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision, if disapproved, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it applies to only one source, ATEC, and does not impose any new requirement on this source.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 15, 1986, the Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted a proposed revision to its ozone SIP, allowing monthly averaging for an architectural aluminum extrusion coating line (KO01). This operation is located at the Astro Shapes facility in Mahoning County, I Ohio, a nonattainment area for ozone. On July 17, 1986, USEPA notified OEPA that the May 15, 1986, submittal requesting a monthly average for Astro Shapes was deficient, as stated in USEPA's technical support document (TSD) dated July 2,1986. OEPA submitted supplemental information on August 28,1986, to support this revision. Existing SIP Requirements Under the existing federally approved SIP, the architectural aluminum extrusion coating line (K001) is subject to the control requirements contained in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Rule 3745-21-09(U)(1)(a)(iii), which limits the VOC content of extreme performance coatings to 3.5'pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, minus water. OAC Rule 3745-21-04(C)(28) requires compliance with the limit by December 31,1982. Compliance is to be determined on a 24-hour basis. USEPA approved these rules as meeting the RACT 2 requirement of the Clean Air Act on October 31, 1980 (45 FR 72122), and June 29, 1982 (47 FR 28097). Extended Averaging Time Criteria USEPA's January 20,1984, policy memorandum, entitled \"Averaging Times for Compliance With VOC Emission Limits\", contains the following criteria for evaluating VOC requests for extended averaging: Criterion 1 Extended averaging can be permitted where the source operations are such that daily VOC emissions cannot be IOEPA submitted a request to revise the attainment status designation, at 40 CFR 81.336, for Mahoning County for nonattainment to attainment for the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Mahoning County, at this time, is designated a nonattainment area. However, there have been no measured violations of the ozone NAAQs from 1982 through 1985. 2 A definition of RACT is contained in a December 9. 1970, memorandum from Roger Strelow. former Assistant Administrator for Air and Waste Management. RACT is defiend as the lowest emission limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.determined, or where the application of RACT for each emission point is not economically or technically feasible on a daily basis. Criterion 2 Sources in areas lacking approved SIP's or in areas with approved SIP's but showing measured violations, cannot be considered for longer term averages until the SIP has been revised documenting ambient standards attainment and maintenance of reasonable further progress (RFP) (reflecting the maximum daily emissions from the source with long-term averaging). Criterion 3 A demonstration must be made that the use of long-term averaging (greater than 24-hour averaging) will not jeopardize either ambient standards attainment or the RFP plan for the area. This must be accomplished by showing that the maximum daily increase in emissions associated with monthly averaging Is consistent with the approved ozone SIP. Criterion 4 Averaging times must be short as practicable, and in no case longer than 30 days. Analysis For monthly averaging to be approved, it must be demonstrated that it is infeasible to meet a daily VOC RACT emission limit, eg., through the use of add-on control or low solvent technology. If the State demonstrates conclusively that complying low-solvent coatings are available, then the USEPA would consider an alternative RACT determination for the existing coatings. In addition, it must be demonstrated that a monthly averaging period is the shortest period that is practicable and that the increase in daily emissions is consistent with the SIP. OEPA has demonstrated that add-on controls for this source would be economically unreasonable, but it has not been demonstrated that the source has completely analyzed the possibility of low solvent coatings. A detailed discussion of the extent of such an analysis appears in Appendix A of the proposed rulemaking published on November 9, 1988 at 53 FR 45285. Further, it has not been demonstrated that the application of RACT is infeasible on a less than monthly basis, and that the maximum increase in daily emissions associated with monthly averaging is consistent with the approved SIP for the Youngstown area.USEPA is proposing to disapprove this SIP revision for these reasons. USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period on this notice of proposed rulemaking. Public comments received on or before December 16, 1988, will be considered in USEPA's final rulemaking. All comments will be available for inspection during normal business hours at the Region V Office address provided at the front of this notice. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP disapproval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the effect of this disapproval is to leave in effect existing emission limitations. Therefore, there is no change or any impact on any source or community. Additionally, it applies to only one corporation, Astro Shapes. Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not \"Major\".

ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: USEPA is proposing to disapprove a site-specific revision to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. This revision is a relaxation of reasonably available control technology (RACT) for volatile organic compounds (VOC) involving the Paper Products Company (PPC) roll coating line. This facility is located in Hamilton County, Ohio, an area designated as nonattainment for ozone. USEAP is today proposing to disapprove this SIP because (1) it has not been demonstrated that it is technically or economically infeasible for PPC to meet the RACT limit, and (2) the State has not shown that this variance is consistent with an approvable attainment demonstration for the Cincinnati area. Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules DATE: Comments on this revision and on the proposed USEPA action must be received by December 16, 1988. ADDRESSES: Copies of the SIP revision are available at the following addresses for review: (It is recommended that you telephone Uylaine E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 16, 1986, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted a proposed relaxation of RACT for a roll coating line at PPC, located in Hamilton County, Ohio. The roll coating line produces paperboard used in the food industry. The proposed relaxation of RACT includes the following conditions: 1. The source shall not apply more than 10 gallons of coatings in any one day. 2. PPC must keep monthly records for all coating material used by the source. 3. PPC must submit annual reports on source emissions. The variance contains no limits on emissions or emission rates. On October 2,1986, USEPA notified that the July 16, 1986, submittal was deficient (see USEPA's September 15, 1986, technical support document (TSD)). The OEPA has not responded to USEPA's October 2, 1986, letter. Current VOC SIP Under the existing federally approved SIP, each roll coating line is subject to the control requirements contained in OAC Rule 3745-21-09(F), and the compliance schedule contained in OAC Rule 3745-21-04(C)(5). These rules require PPC to meet a limit of 2.9 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, excluding water, by April 1, 1982, USEPA approved these rules as meeting the RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act(CAA) on October 31, 1980 (45 FR 72122), and June 29, 1982 (47 FR 20897). Deficiencies in the RACT Relaxation An exemption from the VOC regulations for this source constitutes a site-specific relaxation of RACT (i.e., a source-specific redefinition of RACT). In order for such a relaxation to be approved by USEPA, PPC must demonstrate that compliance with the applicable limit is technically or economically infeasible. PPC believes that it is technically infeasible to meet the emission limits of 2.9 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (excluding water) through the use of complying coatings. According to the supplier of the vinyl resin used to formulate the coating used for PPC's paperboard product, it is technically infeasible to formulate a high solids coating using this resin due to solubility constraints. The other available options are waterbased coatings and coatings using an exempt solvent. Although it may be technically feasible to formulate a complying coating using the vinyl resin and an exempt solvent (methlyene chloride), the manufacturer of the application equipment used by PPC believes that use of this solvent would probably make the existing equipment impossible to use. Therefore, PPC believes the only remaining alternative approach is waterbased coatings. However, any waterbased coating used by PPC for its bakery trays must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to the resin supplier, there are very few water-based resins and polymers available that are FDA approvable. PPC claims that it is continually testing new water-based coatings as it becomes aware of them; but so far, nothing meets all of the criteria. USEPA has reviewed this site-specific revision for PPC and determined that the company has not provided any documentation to demonstrate that it has been looking for and testing water- based coatings. In addition, PPC must provide documentation showing either that add-on control is not cost-effective (on an annualized dollars per ton of VOC controlled basis), or that the added cost of such equipment would make it more profitable to shut down the line than to remain operating. A detailed discussion of the extent of an acceptable investigation of the feasibility of meeting a SIP limit using complying coatings or other controls is contained in' Appendix A of the proposed rulemaking published on November 9, 1988 at at 53 FR 45285. ,,Air Quality Considerations PPC is located in Hamilton County and is part of the Cincinnati ozone demonstration area.-The area is designated nonattainment for ozone and currently does not have an approved attainment demonstration. The OEPA believes that approval of this revision generally will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of the ozone NAAQS due to the small quantity of noncomplying emissions (average of 11.6 kilograms per day in 1985); however, because the variance does not limit PPC to any specific level of emissions, it is not possible to determine the effect of this revision on air quality in the Cincinnati area. This determination would have to be based on the highest emitting coating that could be used. A State seeking to revise an USEPA approved emission limit for a source in a nonattainment area should demonstrate that the requested revision would not interfere with attainment of the ozone standard by December 31, 1987, or with RFP in the interm. If, as here, the requested revision is an uncompensated relaxation-of an emission limit, the State can meet this burden by, among other means, demonstrating that the unrevised SIP provides for a sufficient \"cushion\" to accommodate the relaxation. In other words, the State could demonstrate that the unrevised SIP provides a greater level of control than is necessary to ensure RFP and timely attainment. The State has not attempted to show that the demonstration of attainment that it submitted for Hamilton County account in this way for this relaxation of the emission limit. Based upon the above information, USEPA is proposing to disapprove this site-specific SIP revision. USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period on this notice of proposed rule- making. Public comments received on or before December 16, 1988, will be considered in USEPA's final rulemaking. All comments will be available for inspection during normal business hours at the Region V office address provided at the front of this notice. Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not \"Major\". It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIP approvals do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR- 4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition 5E3160 to EPA on behalf of Dr. Robert H. Kupelian, National Director, IR-4 Project and the Agricultural Experiment Station of Florida. This petition requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose the establishment of a tolerance for combined residues of the herbicide dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA) and its metabolites monomethyl tetrachloroterephthalate acid (TPA), all calculated as dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate, in or on the raw agricultural crop group Brassica (cole) leafy vegetables, as defined in 40 CFR 180.34(f)(9)(v)(A), at 5.0 parts per million (ppm). Tolerances are currently established for residues of the herbicide in or on the following raw agricultural commodities in the crop group Brossica (cole) leafy vegetables: Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower at I ppm; collards and kale at 2 ppm; and mustard greens at 5 ppm. Broccoli, cabbage and mustard greens are the representative commodities of the proposed crop group. With the establishment of the crop group tolerance, tolerances would be established at a uniform level for residues of the herbicide at 5 ppm in or on broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kale, and mustard greens and, additionally, in or on the remaining commodities within the crop group including kohlrabi, Chinese broccoli, Chinese cabbage, Chinese mustard cabbage, broccoli raab, and rape greens at 5 ppm. Although the crop group tolerance for residues at 5 ppm will apply to all members of the Brassica leafy vegetable crop group for purposes of uniformity, actual residues based on registered use patterns are not expected to exceed existing tolerances already established for the specific commodities listed above. The incremental risk resulting from theproposed use of DCPA on the remaining commodities in the group will not significantly increase dietary risk. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for.which the tolerance is sought. The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerance include: 1. A 2-year rat feeding study with a systemic no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 50 mg/kg/day (1,000 ppm, highest dose tested). The study is not acceptable under persent EPA Guidelines. 2. A 2-year dog feeding study with a NOEL greater than 250 mg/kg (10,000 ppm). 3. A rat teratology study with maternal and fetotoxic NOELs of 2,000 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested). Data considered desirable but lacking include: a chronic feeding study and a teratology study, each in a second species; oncogenicity studies in two species; a reproduction study; and mutagenicity studies. DCPA and its metabolites appear to have low acute and chronic toxicity based on the limited studies that have been submitted to support the currently registered pesticide products. However, the Agency's recent evaluation of DCPA raised concerns about the chronic toxicological effects of two manufacturing impurities, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8- TCDD). The Agency performed a preliminary risk assessment based on the assumption that the impurities are found in DCPA residues in the same proportionas they are found in the technical product. The agency calculates the potential dietary oncogenic risk from registered uses of DCPA at 2X10-s for HCB and 1x 10-8 for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The provisional acceptable daily intake (PADI), based on the 2-year rat feeding study (NOEL of 50 mg/kg/day, or 1,000 ppm) and using a 100-fold safety factor, is calculated to be 0.5 mg/kg/ day. The theorectical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from existing tolerances for a 1.5-kg daily diet is calculated to be 0.006574 mg/kg/day; the current action for Brossica leafy vegetables will increase dietary exposure by 0.0000012 mg/kg/day, 0.02 percent. The nature of the residues is adequately understood and an adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual (PAM), Vol. II, for enforcement purposes. There are currently no actions pending against --Federal Register -'Vol. 53, No. '221 i:Wednesday, November-16, 10\u00a78 this chemilical. , ' \" Based'on the above inforniation, Considered by the Agency and hefact that there are no animal feed items inVo0iied, there will be no secondary residues in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs;, ,the tolerance established by amending 40 CFR 180.185 would piotect the public * health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerance be established as set forth below.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96- 354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C, 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a- 91u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November 7,1988. The applicant has an application pending with the Board for a general-purpose foreign-trade zone in North Haven, Connecticut (FTZ Doc. 16-88, 53 FR 9132, 3/21/88). The Miles plant (51 acres) is located at 400 Morgan Lane in West Haven. The facility employs some 1,500 persons and. is used to produce a number of pharmaceutical products such as antibiotics, antifungals, anti-infectives, and beta blockers. Miles sources many of the bulk active ingredients and materials abroad, such as nifdipine, gauze. The foreign material accounts for some 65 percent of direct costs. Some of the products are exported. Zone procedures would exempt Miles from Customs duty payments on foreign materials used in its exports. On its domestic sales, the company will be able to choose the same duty rate that applies to finished pharmaceutical products. Although the active ingredients have the same duty rate as the finished products under the current tariff schedule, the applicant indicates that under the Harmonized Tariff System, which goes into effect on January 1, 1989, the ingredients will have rates ranging from 7.4 to 81. percent, whereas the end products will have rates of 6.2 or 6.3 percent. The application indicates that zone savings would help improve the plant's international competitiveness.

Because there was no margin for Yieh -Hsing, Far East Machinery, and Kao Hsing Chang Iron and Steel, no cash deposit shall be required for those , companies. For any future entries of this merchandise from a new exporter, not covered in this or prior administrative reviews, whose first shipments occurred after April 30, 1987 and who is unrelated to any reviewed firm, a cash deposit of .89 percent shall be required. These deposit requirements are effective for all shipments of certain Taiwanese circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results of this administrative review. Yieh Hsing has requested partial revocation of the order and, as provided for in \u00a7 353.54(e) of the Commerce Regulations, has agreed in writing to animmediate suspension of liquidation and reinstatement of the order under circumstances specified in the written agreement. Yieh Hsing has had no sales at less than fair value for two years. Therefore, we tentatively determine to revoke in part the order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Taiwan with respect to Yieh Hsing. If this partial revocation is made final, it will apply to all unliquidated entries of this merchandise manufactured by Yieh Hsing and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice.

A TiON: Notice of final results of countervailing duty.administrative review. * SUMMARY: On April 27,1988, the- Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on non-rubber footwear from Argentina. We have now completed that review and determine the total bounty or grant during the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1988 to be zero for 24 firms 3.13 percent ad valorem for all other firms.

Lorenza Olivas or Bernard Carreau, Office of Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 377-2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 27, 1988, the Department of Commerce (\"the Department\") published in the Federal Register (53 FR 15094) the preliminary results of itsadministrative review of the countervailing duty order on non-rubber footwear from Argentina (44 FR 3474, January 17,1979), The Department has now conducted that administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (\"the Tariff Act\"). Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of Argentine footwear described in Part 1A of Schedule 7 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated, excluding items 700.5100 through 700.5400, 700.5700 through 700.7100, and 700.9000. These produces are currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number listed in the Appendix to this notice. The review covers the period January 1, 1988 through December 31,1988 and three programs: (1) A rebate of indirect taxes; (2) post-export financing; and (3) pre-export financing. Analysis of Comments Received We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received written comments from the Argentine Footwear Industry Federation (\"the Federation\"). Comment 1: The Federation argues that the appropriate benchmark for measuring the benefits from pre- and post-export financing is the yearly ,average of only the regulated interest rates, not the average of both the regulated and the unregulated rates. The Federation points out that, according to the Subsidies Appendix (49 FR 18016) (1984), the Department's practice of using a national- average commercial interest rate to measure the benefit from short-term preferential loan programs was adopted to avoid the administrative burden of having to compute company- specific benchmarks. The Federation maintains that it is not requesting the Department to use company-specific benchmarks. Rather, because non- rubber footwear producers provided evidence that they were able to secure standard commercial loans at the regulated interest rates, it is asking the Department to compute the benchmark using only those interest rates that were available to the specific exporters covered by this review. Department's Position: We disagree. The benchmark rate should reflect the predominant alternative sources of short-term financing available to an average firm in Argentina. Since unregulated interest rate loans make up a significant portion of the lending in Argentina, it is appropriate to include them in the national average46IL03 Federal Register / Vol 7 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices benchmark. (See Oil Country Tubular Goods from Argentina; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (53 FR 846, January 9, 1987); and 'ROses and Other Cut Flowers from, Colombia; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (52 FR 248, December 28, 1987).) .Comment 2: The Federation requests that the Department correct certain 'clerical errors in its calculations of the benefits from the pre- and post-export financing programs in the preliminary results. Department's Position: With regard to Mocassino, we have revised our calculations in those instances where we used the incorrect loan value to determine the pre-export financing benefit. We have also weight-averaged Cerro's pre-export financing benefits based on its non-rubber footwear exports to the United States. In our preliminary results, we based our benchmark rate on a six-month average of the regulated and unregulated interest rates because the level of pre- and post-export lending to most of the footwear producers was disproportionately spread between the first and second half of the year. Since the monthly regulated and unregulated rates did not vary greatly during the review period, we have now used a yearly average benchmark. (See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations and Countervailing Duty Orders: Certain Welded Carbon Steel Pipe and Tube Products from Argentina, (53 FR 37619, September 27, 1988).) Adjusting for all these changes, we determine the benefit to be 2.57 percent ad valorem for pre-export financing and 0.56 percent ad valorem for post-export financing. Comment 3: The Federation argues that the Department should grant a zero duty deposit rate to new companies that did not export to the United States during the period of review. The new exporters have individually certified that they have not received, and will not apply for, either pre- or post-export financing, the two programs preliminarily found countervailable by the Department in this review. Similarly, the Department should grant a zero duty deposit to three companies found to have received benefits during the review period that have also certified they will not receive either pre- or post-export financing in the future. Department's Position: Generally, to be considered for a zero rate for purposes of cash deposit of estimated coutervailing duties, a company must have exported during the review period. If a company has not exported duringthe review period, we have no \"track record\" on which to rely in determining the appropriate cash deposit rate. Therefore, until the new companies demonstrate otherwise, the \"all other\" rate is our best estimate of the countervailable benefits received by these companies. This has long been our practice, not only for new companies, but also for all unknown exporters. (See e.q., Certain Textile Mill Products from Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (52 FR 45010, November 24,1987); cf. Asahi Chemical Industry Co. v. United States, 548 F. Supp. 1261,1267 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1982) (Asahi), holding reasonable the Department's use of most recent price and value information to establish margins when there were no entries during the period of review.) Our policy regarding the companies that did export during the review period is to set a cash deposit rate that reflects our best estimate of the current benefit that those companies receive from countervailable programs. We normally change the cash deposit rate if a program-wide change has occurred before the publication of our preliminary results, or if some other change has occurred that we are able to verify before publishing the preliminary results. In this case, neither has occurred with respect to the new companies or the companies found to have received benefits during the period of review. Therefore, we conclude that the cash deposit rate should be the same as the assessment rate for all companies. Comment 4: The Federation contends that the cash deposit requirements of the Commerce Regulations do not apply to new exporters because new exporters were not subject to an administrative review. Therefore, it is not logical for the Department to assign the \"all other\" rate to new exporters. If the Department believes it must set a cash deposit rate for new exporters, it should base that rate on any relevant facts collected during the review, including the renunciation certifications. In this way, the duty deposit rate will realistically correspond to the established facts. Department's Position: We disagree with the Federation's contention that the cash deposit rate set in an administrative review does not apply to new exporters. Section 701 of the Tariff Act provides for the imposition of countervailing duties on all merchandise imported into the United States, the production or exportation of which receives a subsidy. Consequently, in an administrative review, we review exports of all merchandise except exports of merchandise from companiesthat have been excluded. We cannot exclude a company from a countervailing duty order once the order is issued. Requests for company exclusions must be submitted within 30 days of publication of a ntoice to initiate an investigation, and the decision as to the exclusion must be made in the Department's final determination (19 CFR 355.38). No company has been excluded from this order. All Argentine firms exporting non-rubber footwear to the United States are subject to the results of this review, including the new exporting firms. Consequently, the \"all other\" rate for duty deposit purposes applies to the merchandise exported to the United States by all firms, whether or not the firms exported during the period of review. (Cf. Asahi.) Comment 5: The Federation claims that the Department's selection of the\"all other\" rate as-the duty deposit rate for the new exporters is arbitrary and capricious. Since the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 provides for the automatic assessment of countervailing duties in the amount of the estimated duty required at the time of entry, the duty deposit rate could become the final assessed countervailing duty rate if a review is not requested. The countervailing duties actually assessed on current entries by the new exporters could reflect a \"benefit\" that bears no relation whatsoever to reality. Due process is denied the new exporters if the duty deposits required for 1988 and 1989 entries are based on outdated or erroneous information for 1986. Department's Position: We disagree with the Federation's claim that our selection of the \"all other\" rate as the duty deposit rate for new exporters is arbitrary and capricious. (See our positions on Comments 3 and 4.) The Federation has the opportunity in January 1989 to request a review of 1988 entries, and in January 1990, of 1989 entries. If we receive review requests for those years, we will collect updated information. Whether we conduct reviews or follow the automatic liquidation procedure, we believe that due process is fully served. Final Results of Review After considering all of the comments received, we determine the total bounty or grant to be zero for the 24 firms listed below and 3.13 percent ad valorem for all other firms for the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986. The following firms received no benefits during the period of review: 1. Alarsu S.A. 2. Alikon.46i04 Federal Register / Vol. 53; No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices 3.

Disposal of dredged sediments at an interim designated ODMDS has occurred in the past. Studies to support final site designation were conducted by the Corps of Engineers, Portland District, and coordinated with EPA, Region 10. Designation of a final ODMDS site at this location will provide a feasible and environmentally acceptable disposal site for present and anticipated future maintenance work in the area. Need for Action The Corps of Engineers, Portland District, has requested that EPA designate an ODMDS offshore the Chetco River, Oregon, for disposal of sediments dredged to maintain the federally authorized navigation project and for disposal of m~lerials during other actions authorized in accordance with section 103 of the MPRSA. EPA has voluntarily committed to prepare ElSs in conjunction with ocean dumping site designations. This EIS will provide the necessary informatior to evaluate alternatives and des;,iate a preferred ODMDS. Alternatives 1. No action: The no action alternative is defined as not designating an ocean disposal site and termination of ocean disposal for this area. 2. Alternative disposal options in the nearshore, mid-shelf, and shelf break region of the Pacific Ocean, and on the uplands. Scoping A scoping meeting is not contemplated. Scoping will be accomplished with affected federal, state, and local agencies, and with interested parties by correspondence, telephone contract, etc. Estimated Date of Release The draft EIS will be available in Spring 1989.

Tsakeris, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ-440), Food and Drug Administration, 8757 Georgia Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20910, 301-427-7234. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: IVD's, as defined in FDA's regulations (21 CFR 809.3[a)), are those reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. IVD's are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body. In most cases in the past, a physician supervised the collection of specimens from a patient's body and submitted the specimens to a clinical laboratory with instructions regarding which in vitro tests were to be done. Trained laboratory technicians performed the tests using IVD's. The clinical laboratory reported the test results to the patient's physician who then explained and interpreted the meaning of the test results to the patient. There has been an increasing interest in recent years in the development of certain IVD's for consumers to purchase and use to perform tests on their own body specimens and interpret the results of their own diagnostic tests. Accordingly, FDA is making available a document entitled \"Assessing the Safety and Effectiveness of Home-Use In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVD's): Draft Points to Consider Regarding Labeling and Premarket Submissions.\" Interested persons may submit to the46118 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices Docket Management Branch (address above) written comments on the draft document at any time; however, comments submitted by February 14, 1989, will be considered by FDA in preparing a final points to consider document.

Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.

General function of the committee. The committee reviews and evaluates available data on the safety and effectiveness of marketed and investigational human drugs for use inthe diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of human diseases. The committee also reviews and evaluates the quality and relevance of FDA's research program which provides scientific support for the regulation of these products. Agenda-Open public hearing. Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the committee. Those desiring to make formal presentations should notify the contact person as soon as possible. Open committee discussion. The committee will discuss a treatment IND request for IMREG (an immunosupportive biologic agent). Seating capacity is limited and seating for the public will be on a first-come basis. FDA is giving less than 15 days public notice of this Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting because it involves an expedited review of a biologic intended for a life-threatening illness, consistent with FDA's new initiative for expediting the review of such products. The next regularly scheduled meeting of the committee is January 30 to February 1, 1989. FDA did not believe it appropriate to wait that long. Attempts were made to schedule a committee meeting later in November or in early December to permit sufficient time for at least a 15- day public notice of the meeting. However, it was not possible to find a date during that period on which a quorum of committee members could meet. The agency decided that it was in the public interest to hold this scientific review on November 18, 1988, even if there was not sufficient time for the customary 15-day public notice. FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2] an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.

[FR Doc. 50-3161 Indiana Michigan Power Co4 Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Nos. DPR-58 and DPR-74, issued to the Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) for operation of Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units Nos. I and 2, located in Berrien County, Michigan. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed amendments would revise provisions in the D.C. Cook Technical Specifications (TSs) relating to milk sampling for radiological analysis. The Need for the Proposed Action The current TSs concerning milk sampling, Item 4.a of Table 3-12.1, require milk samples to be collected for radiological analysis from the following specific areas: A. Stevensville, Michigan. B. Bridgman, Michigan. C. Galien, Michigan. D. Dowagiac, Michigan. E. South Bend, Indiana. However, no milk samples are collected in Stevensville or South Bend or sectors in which these cities are located because there are no willing farmers who wish to participate in the milk sampling program. Literal TS noncompliance was caused by listing the specific towns where samples were to be taken. The proposed changes to the TSs are more consistent with the NRC guidelines. Specifically, the proposed changes require sampling at each indicator farm and each background farm. Indicator farm and background farm are defined as follows: Indicator Form Nearest milk producer in each of the land sectors within 8 miles of the plant site who is willing to participate in the radiological environmental monitoringprogram. Background Farm A milk producer in one of the less prevalent wind directions46132 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices at a distance greater than 15 miles but less than 25 miles who is willing to participate in the radiological environmental monitoring program. The number of locations sampled may vary due to the number of sectors which contain farms willing to participate in the milk sampling program. The .,possibility exists that no willing participants may be found within 8 miles of the plant site. In order to address this possibility, the proposed TSs require broad leaf vegetation sampling. Specifically, if fewer than three willing indicator farms are found, borad leaf vegetation samples will be collected and analyzed when available, Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed changes to the TSs. The proposed changes would correct the licensee's current TSs. They would make the TSs more restrictive and more in line with NRC guidelines concerning milk sampling for radiological analysis. The proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological impact. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendments do not involve systems located within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. The proposed. amendments only change the TXs in relation to obtaining milk samples for analysis and correct editorial errors. They do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the Federal Register on July 14,1988 (53 FR 26695). No request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Because the Commission has concluded that there is no significant environmental impact associated with the proposed amendments, any alternative would have either no orgreater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This would result in the licensee being in noncompliance with the TSs concerning milk sampling. Alternative Use of Resources This action involves no use of resources not previously considered in connection with the \"Final Environmental Statement Related to Operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units I and 2, dated August 1973. Agencies and Persons Consulted The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. Finding of No Significant Impact The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated February 1, 1988, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the Maude Preston Palenski Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085.

I and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Nos. DPR-58 and DPR-74 issued to Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) for operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units Nos. I and 2, located at the licensee's site in Berrien County, Michigan.Environmental Assessment identification of Proposed Action The proposed amendment would revise the provisiorls in the Technical Specifications (TSs) and License Conditions relating to fuel enrichment. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated August 19, 1988. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed amendment is needed so that the licensee can use higher enrichment fuel and provides the flexibility of extending the fuel irradiation and permitting operation of longer fuel cycles. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed amendment. The proposed revisions would permit use of fuel enriched with Uranium 235 in excess of 4 weight percent and up to 4.23 weight percent, and license would expect the fuel to be irradiated to levels above 33 gigwatt days per metric ton (GWD/MT) but not to exceed 50 GWD/ MT. The safety considerations associated with reactor operation with higher enrichment and extended irradiation have been evaluated by the Commission's staff. The staff has concluded that such changes would not adversely affect plant safety. The proposed changes have no adverse effect on the probability of any accident. The increase burnup may slightly change the mix of fission products that might be released in the event of a serious accident but such small changes would not significantly affect the consequences of serious accidents. No changes are being made in the types or amounts of any radiological effluents that may be released offsite. There is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts of reactor operation with higher enrichment and extended irradiation, the proposed changes involve systems located within the restricted area, as defined 10 CFR Part 20. They do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. The environmental impacts of transportation resulting from the use of higher enrichment fuel and extended irradiation are discussed in the Commission's assessment entitled, \"NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects of Transportation Resulting from Extended Fuel Enrichment and46133- .: , Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices Irradiation,\" dated July 7,1988 (53 FR 30355). As indicated therein, the environmental cost contribution of the proposed increase in the fuel enrichment and irradiation limits are either unchanged or may in fact be reduced from those summarized in Table S-4 as set forth in 10 CFR 51.52(c). The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the Federal Register on October 11, 1988(53 FR 39679). No request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed *following this notice. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments. Alternative, to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This would not. reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement related to the operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units I and 2. dated August 1973. Agencies and Person Consulted The Commission's' staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. Findings of No Significant Impact The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendments. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendments dated August 19,198, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the Maude Preston Palenski Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085.

Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action would authorize applicant to receive, possess, inspect, and store special nuclear material in the form of unirradiated fuel assemblies. The discussion below will be limited to- assessing the potential for environmental impacts resulting from the handling and the storage of new fuel at Limerick, Unit 2. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed action will allow the applicant to receive and store fresh fuel prior to issuance of the Part 50 operating license in order to inspect the fuel and finalize fuel preparation needed to load the fuel into the reactor vessel. Actual core loading, however, will not be authorized by the proposed license amendment. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action Once at Limerick, Unit 2, the new fuel* will be stored outdoors in the new fuel storage area. The fuel will be stored in the outer wooden shipping containers in piles stacked four high. Each pile of fuel will be covered by a five-sided box manufactured out of corrugated steel. This temporary storage of assemblies in their shipping containers will present no significant environmental impact or significant radiation exposure to plant workers. Assemblies are then moved to the refueling floor and stored in a predesignated storage area. Assemblies are removed from their shipping containers, inspected, and the fuel is then transferred to their designated storage location in the spent fuel storagepool. Criticality safety in the storage location is maintained by limiting interaction between adjacent fuel assemblies. The staff has evaluated the spent fuel pool and found it to be critically safe for all conditions of water moderation and/or reflection. The design of this storage location, combined with plant procedures, will ensure acceptable protection of the general public and plant personnel under either normal or abnormal conditions. Since the fresh fuel assemblies are sealed sources, the principal exposure pathway to an individual is via external radiation. For low-enriched uranium fuel (<4 percent U-235 enrichment), the exposure rate at I foot from the surface is norally less than I mR/hr; therefore, it is estimated that the exposure level to workers handling the fuel would be less than 25 percent of the maximum permissible exposure specified in 10 CFR Part 20. Because of the low radiation levels associated with the requested materials and activities and the applicant's radiation protection procedures, the staff concludes that fuel handling and storage activities-can be carried out without any significant occupation dose to workers or radiological impact to the environment. Only a small amount, if any, of radioactive waste (e.g.., smear papers and/or contaminated packaged material), is expected to be generated as a result of fuel handling and storage operations. Any waste that is produced will be properly stored onsite until it can be shipped to a licensed disposal facility. In the event the assemblies must be returned to the fuel fabricator, all packaging and transport of fuel will be in accordance with 10 CFR Part 71. No significant external radiation hazards are associated with the unirradiated fuel, because the radiation level from the clad fuel pellets is low and the shipping packages must meet the external radiation standards in 10 CFR Part 71. Therefore any shipment of unirradiated fuel is expected to have an insignificant environmental impact. In the unlikely event that an assembly (either within or outside its shipping container) is dropped during transfer, fuel cladding is not expected to rupture. Even if the fuel rod cladding were breached and the pellets were released, an insignificant environmental impact would result. The fuel pellets are composed of a ceramic U02 that has been pelletized and sintered to a very high density. In this form, release of UO0 aerosol is unlikely except under conditions of deliberate grinding.46134 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notic4 Additionally, U02 is soluble only in acid solution so dissolution and release to the environment are extremely unlikely. Conclusion The environmental impacts associated with the handling and storage of new fuel at Limerick, Unit 2, are expected to be insignificant. Essentially no effluents, liquid or airborne, will be released, and acceptable controls will be implemented to prevent a radiological accident, Therefore, the staff concludes that there will be no significant impacts associated with the proposed action, Alternative to the Proposed Action The principal alternative would be to deny the requested license amendment. Assuming the operating license will eventually be issued, denial of the storage only license would merely postpone new fuel receipt at Limerick, Unit 2. Although denial of the special nuclear material license for Limerick, Unit 2, is an alternative available to the Commission, it would be considered only if significant issues of public health and safety could not be resolved. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with .the Commission's Final Environmental Statement (NUREG- 0974) related to this facility. Agencies and Persons Contacted. The Commission's staff reviewed the applicant's request of May 6, 1988 and supplement dated October 28, 1988, and did not consult other agencies or persons. Finding of No Significant Impact The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the revision of Special Nuclear Material License No. SNM-1977. On the basis of this assessment, the Commission has concluded that environmental impacts created by the proposed licensing action would not be significant and do not warrant the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. Accordingly, it has been determined that a Finding of No Significant Impact is appropriate. The Environmental Assessment and the May 6, 1988, application related to this proposed action are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.

[FR Doc. 88-26440 [Docket No. 50-333] Power Authority of the State of New York; Environmental Assessment And Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC/the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of Appendix J of 10 CFR Part 50 to the Power Authority of the State of New York (PASNY/the licensee), for the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant located in Oswego County, New York. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The licensee would be exempted from the requirements of Section IIA.(b) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 to the extent that a Type A Primary Containment Integrated Leak Rate Test (PCILRT) would not have to be performed during the Reload /Cycle 9 refueling outage (which commenced in August 1988) and that the normal PCILRT retest schedule specified in Section IILD(a) of Appendix J would be restored. In addition, the licensee would be exempted from the requirements of Section IVA of Appendix J to the extent that a Type C test would not be performed during the Reload 8/Cycle 9 refueling outage on the welds of a containment isolation valve located on the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI] turbine exhaust line. This valve is to be replaced during the outage. The Need for the Proposed Action The PCILRTs performed during the 1982, 1985, and 1987 refueling outages were deemed failures in the \"as-found\" condition. Section IIIA6(b) of Appendix J states that, should two consecutive PCILRTs fail to meet the applicable acceptance criteria, a retest must be performed during each subsequent refueling outage until two consecutive tests are deemed acceptable, after which time the retest schedule specified in Section III.D(a) may be resumed. Accordingly, the licensee would be required to perform a PCILRT during theAugust 1988 refueling outage. As an alternative to performing this test, the licensee has submitted a Corrective Action Plan which entails the replacement of 33 containment isolation valves which previously were identified as having excessive leakage. Replacement of 21 of these valves would take place during the Reload 8/Cycle 9 outage. Implementation of the Corrective Action Plan will ensure that the intent of Section IIIA.8(b) is met, in that unacceptable containment leakage is identified and corrected. In accordance with Section T.A of Appendix J, a Type A, B or C test (as applicable) is required to be performed following any major modification or replacement of a component which is part of the primary reactor containment boundary. The licensee has determined that the welds of one of the valves to be replaced, located on the HPCI turbine exhaust line, cannot be pressure tested. Also, since the replaced manual valve is not used for containment isolation, it is not subject to PCILRT requirements. Accordingly, the licensee has requested an exemption from Section IV.A. In lieu of a Type A, B or C tests, the licensee has proposed 100 percent radiography of the affected weld as well as dye penetrant or magnetic particle tests. This will ensure that the intent of Section IV.A, (the identification of leakage resulting from replacement of a component which is part of the primary containment boundary) is met. Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action The proposed action would ensure that excessive leakage from containment isolation valves is identified and corrected and would provide a level of safety at least equivalent to that attained by compliance with Sections IIl.A.6(b] and IV.A of Appendix I to 10 CFR Part 50. On this basis, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with this proposed exemption. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves features located entirely within the restricted areas as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact Therefore, the Commission concludes thatthere are no significant * nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.46135 46136 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices Alternative Use of Resources This action involves no use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement (construction permit and operating license) for the James A.

Background Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from October 26, 1988 through November 4, 1988. The last biweekly notice was published on November 2, 1988 (53 FR 44247). NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATING LICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commission will not normally make a final determination unless it receives a request for a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory Publications Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By December 16, 1988 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written petitionfor leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's \"Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings\" in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which.petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contention set forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to particip, te fully in the conduct of the Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 /-Notices hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,. should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so iniorm the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700]. The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the following message addressed to (Project Director): petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of theGeneral Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. Arkansas Power & Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-313 and 50-368, Arkansas Nuclear One, Units 1 and 2, Pope County, Arkansas Date of amendment requests: May 27, 1988 Description of amendment requests: The amendments would modify'the Technical Specifications (TSs) for each unit by adding operability and surveillance requirements for the core- exit.thermocouples (CETs. The GET system is one of the inadequate core cooling (ICC) monitoring systems. These systems and the associated TSs are required by NUREG-0737, Section I.F.2, as specified by Generic Letter 83-37. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination. The Commission has provided guidance for the application of criteria for no significant hazards consideration determination by providing examples of amendments that are considered not likely to involve significant hazards considerations (51 FR 7751). These examples include: Example (ii), A change that constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the Technical Specifications: e.g., \"a more stringent surveillance requirement.\" The new operability and surveillance requirements for the CET system of each unit constitute additional limitations, restrictions, and controls not presently included in the Technical Specifications. Therefore, the proposed amendments are within the scope of the example. Since the applications for amendment involve proposed changes that are encompassed by an example for which no significant hazards consideration exists, the staff has made a proposed determination that the applicationsinvolve no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Tomlinson Library, Arkansas Tech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 Attorney for licensee: Nicholas S. Reynolds. Esq., Bishop, Cook, Purcell and Reynolds, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502 NRC Project Director: Jose A. Calvo Carolina Power & Light Company at al., Docket No. 50-325, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 1, Brunswick County, North Carolina Date of application for amendment May 27, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change the reactor water level setpoint for the isolation of the Group 1 primary containment isolation valves from low level 2 to low level 3. The proposed amendment also reflects plant modifications that are necessary. New slave units will be added for the low level 3 instrumentation and their tag numbers will be identified in the Technical Specifications. Master trip units will be upgraded and the Technical Specifications will reflect the new tag numbers for low level Z. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a no significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee evaluated the proposed changes in accordance with the standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) and provided the following analysis: 1. The setpoint change has been evaluated with respect to several operating parameters, including the minimum critical power ratio (MCPR]. peak vessel pressure, radiation release, and shutdown capability during abnormal operating transients. Fuel cladding integrity during a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) and the reactor response during an anticipated transient without acram (ATWS) event were also evaluated. Results of this evaluation are provided in the GE Topical Report NEDC-30601-P, \"Safety Review of Water Level Setpoint Change for Brunswick Steam Electric Plant Units 1 and 2.\" As46137 46138 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices stated in Section 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 of that report, the change will not cause a reduction in MCPR, an increase in the peak pressure, an increase in radiation release, a cause of equipment damage, a reduction in plant shutdown capability, or a decrease in core cooling capability. The main steam isolation valve (MSIV) water level setpoint change has no impact on LOCA events previously evaluated, nor does it cause consequences of accidents previously evaluated to be increased. 2. Several operating parameters have been evaluated to support the setpoint change, including MCPR, peak vessel pressure, radiation release, and shutdown capability during abnormal operating transients. Fuel cladding integrity during a LOCA and reactor response during an ATWS event were also evaluated. Results of this evaluation are provided in the GE Topical Report NEDC- 30001-P. \"Safety Review of Water Level Setpoint Change for Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units I and 2.\" None of these evaluations indicated that any new or different type of accident would be created by the change. In addition, the present function and structure of the Group I isolation valves remains unchanged, thereby eliminating possible operator confusion and training problems that could lead to a new or different type of accident. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3. The effects of the setpoint change for LOCA events has been reviewed, and it has been determined that the change has no impact. As stated in NEDC-30601-P, large and intermediate LOCA events will not be affected because the rapid depressurization and rapid inventory loss will cause the MSIV to close almost immediately after the accident, before any fuel failure could occur. Thus, the lower MSIV trip will not increase inventory loss from the reactor core or radiation release to the environment. For a small break LOCA. the highest peak cladding temperature for the worst case single failure (i.e., failure of the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system) is considerably less than the 2200' F peak clad temperature limit. Therefore, the setpoint change will have no effect on the limiting maximum average planar linear heat generation rate (MAPLHGR). For a loss of feedwater flow event under the proposed amendment, the reactor would not be isolated while HPCI and reactor core isolation [cooling] (RCIC) are operating. Reactor core isolation cooling system flow would compensate for steam flow through the turbine control valves to the main condenser, thereby maintaining water level above low level 3, keeping the MSIVs open, and preventing the S/RVs from opening. Thus, the MSIV setpoint change will not compromise core cooling capability for the loss of feedwater flow event. Furthermore, it reduces suppression pool heatup for this event because the main condenser is available for a longer time. The low level 3 reactor water level selpoint for the Group 1 primary containment isolation system valves still \"ensures the effectiveness of the instrumentation used tomitigate the consequences of accidents\" as demonstrated by the evaluation in Sections 4 and 5 of NEDC-3001-P. Thus, for the reasons described above, the margin of safety is not reduced and may actually be increased. Based on the above, the licensee has determined that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

E. Jones. General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, P. 0. Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director: Elinor G. Adensam Carolina Power & Light Company et al., Docket No. 50-325, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 1, Brunswick County, North Carolina Date of application for amendment: June 9, 1988 Description of amendment requesk\" The proposed change to Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 1, (BSEP) Technical Specification Tables 3.3.5.2-1 and 4.3.5.2-1 is requested to address alternate shutdown capability requirements associated with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R. Reactor vessel water level transmitter B21-LT-N026A currently provides indication on the remote shutdown panel (B21-LI-R6O04AX), as well as on the control panel in the control room (via B21-LT-604A, and level transmitter B21- LT-N026B provides indication only on the control panel (via B21-LI-R604B). The remote shutdown panel is located in the reactor building. The proposed -modification would have level transmitter B21-LT-NO26A providing indication to only the control panel in the control room (on B21-LI-R604A) and level transmitter B21-LT-N026B will provide Indication on the remote shutdown panel (B21-LI-R6O04BX) and, via the remote shutdown panel, on the control panel (B21-LI-R604B). The licensee states that these modifications are being made to address alternate shutdown capability requirements associated with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G. The above described level transmitters and indicators are identified in the TechnicalSpecifications and, subsequently, need to be changed to support the modification. Basis for proposed no signifi cant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a no significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2] create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3 involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Carolina Power & Light Company (the Company) has reviewed this proposed license amendment request and determined that its adoption would involve no significant hazards consideration for the following reasons: 1. The instrumentation being rewired provides reactor water level indication as part of the plant monitoring instrumentation required for 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix, R, Section II.G. It provides no direct protection against any of the accidents identified in Chapter 15 of the Updated Final Safety Analysis (UFSAR). By rewiring these instruments, the Train A instrumentation will feed the control room and the Train B instrumentation will feed the remote shutdown panel thereby satisfying the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G. The purpose and function of the instrumentation will not change; only the indication point will be exchanged between instrument trains. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Rewiring of level transmitter loops B21- LT-N026A and B21-LT-NO26B will allow the Company to safely shutdown the unit using the Alternate Safe Shutdown Procedures. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated will not be created because this instrumentation will not be performing any different function from its current function, This modification is being made to address the commitments associated with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G which require the Train A instrumentation to feed the control room and the Train B instrumentation to feed the remote shutdown panel. The new configuration will ensure consistent indication, i.e., Train A or Train B, in both the control room and at the remote shutdown panel. The necessary indication will be available to the operator at the proper location under fire scenarios which would take out either the Train A or Train B instrumentation. 3. The proposed modification will ensure proper indication in the appropriate area in Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, Novemiber 16, 1988 / Notices the event of a fire that takes out either the Train A or Train B instrumentation. Currently, transmitter B21-LT-NO20A feeds the remote shutdown panel, and transmitter B21-LT-NO26B feeds the control room. Commitments associated with compliance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section lll.G requires that Train A feed the control room and Train B feed the remote shutdown panel. This is to ensure that in the event of a fire that takes out Train A, there will be indication to the remote shutdown panel from Train B, and in a fire that takes out Train B, there will be indication to the control room from Train A. Thus, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Based on the above reasoning, the licensee has determined that the proposed changes involve no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-3297. Attorney for licensee: R. E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, P. 0. Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director Elinor G. Adensam Carolina Power & Light Company et al., Docket No. 50-325, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 1, Brunswick County, North Carolina Date of application for amendment: June 27, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification (TS) Tables 3.3.5.6-1, 3.3.5.6-2 and 4.3.5.6-1 to replace instrument tag number TS-CR-863 with TS-CIT-863-3. This change is needed as a result of planned upgrading of instrumentation during the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Unit 1, refueling outage of November 1988. Item 2 in each of the above tables lists chloride leak detection instrumentation in the condensate pump discharge. This instrumentation provides indication of chloride intrusion in the feedwater and condensate systems. Chlorides pose a long-term threat to the integrity of stainless steel piping systems. The change is necessary due to a plant modification that will replace the instrument represented by TS-CR-863-3 with an upgraded conductivity cell and analyzer represented by tag number TS-CIT-863-3. The upgraded components are capable of detecting and compensating for temperature transients that may occur in the sample being analyzed. The new conductivity analyzer will provide a direct and continuous reading without relying on a recorder, and will also provide an output to a recorder for trending purposes. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a no significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (i) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has determined that: I. The accidents analyzed in Chapter 15 of the Updated FSAR are not affected by the chloride leak detection instrumentation change because the function of the instrument is not altered and the chloride limits established in TS 3/4.4.4 are not being changed. In addition, the new instruments being installed are capable of detecting and compensating for temperature transients which may occur in the sample being analyzed. The current system requires additional data processing to achieve the same results. Based on this reasoning, CP&L has determined that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. As stated above, the chloride leak detection instrumentation provides protection from long-term piping degradation in the feedwater and condensate systems caused by chloride intrusion. No possibility of a new or different kind of accident is created because the new instruments perform the same basic function as the ones they are replacing. Also, the reactor coolant system chloride limits established in TS 3/4AA are not being changed. The new instrument has enhanced capabilities; it processes the data into a more useful form prior to readout. Based on the above reasoning, CP&L has determined that the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The margin of safety is not reduced because, as stated above, the new. instruments perform the same basic function as the ones they are replacing and the chloride limits established in TS 3/4.4.4 are not being changed. In fact, the new instruments have enhanced capabilities which may provide the user with better data, thereby providing earlier indication ofchloride intrusion, and perhaps avoiding long-term problems with pipe degradation due to chloride intrusion. Based on this reasoning, CP&L has determined that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Based on the above reasoning, the licensee has determined that the proposed changes involve no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Adensam Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-456 and 50-457, Braidwood Station, Unit Nos. I and 2, Will County, Illinois Date of application for amendments: November 26,1986 and January 14, 1988 Description of amendments request: In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, the licensee submitted an amendment to the Braidwood Nuclear Power Station Security Plan to reflect recent changes to that regulation. The proposed amendment would modify paragraph 2.F of Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-72 and NPF-77 to require compliance with the revised plan. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: On August 4,1986 (51 FR 27817 and 27822), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission amended Part 73 of its regulations, \"Physical Protection and Plants and Materials,\" to clarify plant security requirements to afford and increased assurance of plant safety. The amended regulations required that each nuclear power reactor licensee submit proposed amendments to its security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55. The licensee submitted its revised plan on November 26, 1986 and January 14, 1988, to satisfy the requirements of the amended regulations. The Commission proposes to amend the license to reference the revised plan.46139 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, the Commission indicated that it was amending its regulations \"to provide a more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the current levels of protection\" and that the \"Commission believes that the clarification and refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments are appropriate because they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.\" The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of the criteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists by providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazards considerations and examples of actions involving significant hazards consideration (51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involving no significant hazards considerations is example (vii) \"a change to conform a license to changes in the regulations, where the license change results in very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.\" The changes in this case fall within the scope of the example. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.

Attorney to licensee: Michael Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, illinois 60603. NRC Project Director: Daniel R. Muller Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket No. 50-374, LaSalle County Station, Unit 2, LaSalle County, Illinois Date of application for amendment: September 14, 1988 Brief description of amendment The proposed amendment to Operating License No. NPF-18 would revise the LaSalle Unit 2 Technical Specifications in support of the second reload for LaSalle Unit 2. Startup for Cycle 3 is currently scheduled for January 1989. The proposed reload fuel and analyses including the previously approved SAFER/GESTR-LOCA Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) Analysis are changes resulting from analyses performed to expand the operating region and allow equipment out-of-service and changes that are administrative or provide clarification. The proposed changes for LaSalle Unit 2 are identical to those previously submitted and approved for use at LaSalle Unit 1, except for minorcalculation differences in the results for transient analyses and include: 1. Provision for operation in the expanded operating domain including revised APRM and RBM setpoint changes incorporated using standard and previously approved methodology. 2. Use of extended burnup fuel (GE 8x8EB) with increased LHGR limit of 14.4 Kw/ft. 3. Use of improved transient and LOCA analysis methods which allow use of a lower tau-B value in determining the MCPR operating limit as a function of scram time, and deletion of the single loop MAPLHGR limit multiplier of 0.85. 4. Provision for operation with certain equipment inoperable or out of service. Specifically, one of the following systems or components may be out of service when the appropriate Technical Specification Actions are satisfied: a. Turbine Bypass System b. End-of-Cycle Recirculation Pump Trip (EOC-RPT) c. One Safety Relief Valve (SRV) d. Feedwater Heaters 5. Several changes for clarification or administrative purposes were proposed including- a. Deletion of GEXL correlation and GETAB statistical model in the bases of the safety limit section. b. Revision to the Control Rod Program Controls Technical Specification to require the RWM to be demonstrated operable in Operational' Condition 1, prior to reaching 20% power, when reducing thermal power. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether no significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has determined, and the NRC staff agrees, that the proposed amendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the use of the proposed operating limits is specifically analyzed to ensure that the input assumptions of all existing transient and accident analyses remain valid. These analyses are performedusing a methodology which has received review and approval for other similar plants including LaSalle Unit 1. The Technical Specification Actions included in the proposed revisions do not significantly affect the probability of an accident previously analyzed because the required time intervals for corrective action are consistent with the existing specifications. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the proposed MCPR, MAPLHGR, and LHGR limits represent limitations on reactor operating state which do not directly affect the operation, or function of any system or component. As a result, there is no impact on or addition of any systems or equipment whose failure could initiate an accident. The proposed operating domain is evaluated to retain the originally required design margins to system integrity during normal operation, transients and accidents and therefore, do not cause significant new loads or stresses on mechanical systems or boundaries. The proposed allowances for operating with prescribed equipment inoperable or out-of-service do not cause physical changes to any systems and therefore do not induce new failure modes. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because no changes to safety limits protective system logic or design are involved. The analyses used to evaluate reactor and system performance are performed using standard methods and the calculated operating limits maintain conservative margin to safety limits to accommodate the anticipated performance during transients and accidents. Changes which are administrative in nature do not affect the operating limits of the plant or the consequences of analyzed transients. Local Public Document Room location: Public Library of Illinois, Valley Community College, Rural Route No. 1, Oglesby, Illinois 61348. Attorney to licensee: Michael Miller. Esq., Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois 60603 NRC Project Director: Daniel R. Muller Commonwealth Edison Company (CECo), Docket No. 50-265, Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2, Rock Island County, Illinois Date of application for amendments: July 7, 1988 Description of amendments request: There are two changes associated with the proposed license amendment. The first change results from the completion46140 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices of a Unit 2 Detailed Control Room Design Review (DCRDR) Human Factors modification which resulted in the relocation of the drywell temperature indicator from the 902-21 (back) panel to the 902-3 (front) panel. Such a change would be incorporated into Technical Specifications (TS) Table 3.2-4 and 4.2-2 of DPR-30. The remaining proposed changes would correct typographical errors associated with the same TS tables. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration deterniination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists. As stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not; (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a) the licensee has provided the following evaluation of their amendment application addressing these three standards. CECo has evaluated the proposed Technical Specifications changes and determined that they do not present a significant hazards consideration. Based on the criteria for defining a significant hazards consideration established in 10 CFR 50.92(c), operation of QCNPS in accordance with the proposed changes: (1) Will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because only the location of the drywell temperature indication has been changed (from the back to the front panel) in the Control Room. This is an enhancement over the previous location to make it more observable for operators. Functions and range of the drywell instrument remain the same. This modification was considered to be a change in the conservative direction. (2) Will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because there were no hardware changes (addition or deletion of equipment) per-se, nor are there any new modes of operation associated with this amendment. The changes to Tables 3.2-4 and 4.2-4 reflect changes to equipment (instrumentation) location only. (3) Will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because revising an instrument locationreadout in the control room does not adversely affect the operation of any plant systems. Therefore, the margin of safety has not been unchanged as a result of this change. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation related to the proposed changes and concurs with their conclusions. In addition, administrative and editorial TS changes are considered representative of example (i) in the Commission's guidance (51 FR 7751) for examples of no significant hazards, which is defined as \"a purely administrative change to TS; for example a change to achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specification, correction of an error, or change in nomenclature.\" Therefore the NRC staff proposes to determine that this amendment request does not involve significant hazards considerations based upon a preliminary review of the application, the licensee's evaluation of no significant hazards, and NRC guidance.

Muller Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-254 and 50-265, Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, Rock Island County, Illinois Date of application for amendments: October 5, 1988 Description of amendments request: This amendment would delete Figure 6.1-1, 'Corporate Organization,\" and Figure 6.1-2, \"Station Organization,\" from the Technical Specifications (TS) and would revise Section 6 to require inclusion of these organization charts in the QA Topical Report. However, the NRC will continue to be notified of licensee organization changes through other regulatory controls. In accordance with 10 CFR 50.34(b)(6(i), the applicant's organizational structure is required to be included in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). Chapter 13 of the FSAR provides a description of the station organization and a detailed organization chart. Updates to the FSAR are required by 10 CFR 50.71(e) to be submitted annually to the NRC. Even though Figures 6.1-1 and 6.1-2 would be deleted from TS, Section 6 of the TS would be revised to require inclusion of these organization charts in the CECo QA Topical. Whereupon, Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 50, and 10 CFR 50.4(b)(7),will govern any changes made to the organization as it is described in the Quality Assurance (QA) Program. Finally, it is CECo's normal practice to inform the NRC of organizational changes affecting their nuclear facilities prior to implementation. Basis for proposed no sinificant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendment to an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) involve a significant increase in the probability of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. CECo evaluated the proposed TS changes and determined, and the NRC staff agrees that: (1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because deletion of the organization charts from the TS does not affect plant operation, nor does it involve any physical modification of the plant. Furthermore, the aforementioned administrative and regulatory controls remain in force to ensure that organizational changes are reviewed by the NRC. (2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated because the proposed change is administrative in nature; and does not physically alter any systems or components, or the way they are operated. (3) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because CECo through its Quality Assurance programs, and its commitment to maintain only qualified personnel in positions of responsibility, and other required controls, assures that safety-related operations will be performed at a high level of competence. Futhermore, this amendment does not change any setpoints or operating parameters. Consequently, removal of organization charts from the Technical Specifications will not affect the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation related to the proposed changes and concurs with their conclusions.4614146141 Federal Register /Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices In addition, the associated editorial TS changes proposed by CECo are considered representative of example (i) in the Commission's guidance (51 FR 7751) for examples of no significant hazards, which is defined as \"a purely administrative change to TS; for example a change to achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications, correction of an error, or change in nomenclature.\" Therefore the NRC staff proposes to determine that this amendment request does not involve significant hazards considerations based upon a preliminary review of the application, the licensee's evaluation of no significant hazards, and NRC guidance.

Muller Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: July 26, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.6 to clarify the emergency power requirements for the Control Room Area Ventilation System. The word \"train\" is substituted for the word \"system\" where reference is made to one of the two independent trains which comprise the ventilation system for the control room area shared by the two Catawba units. Also, TS 3/4.7.6 and its Bases are revised to eliminate the possibility of misinterpreting the existing TS requirements for diesel generator (D/G) operability when one or both Catawba units are shutdown. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee, in its submittal of July 26, 1988, provided the following discussion and analysis with regard to the three 10 CFR 50.92 standards: The Control Room Area Ventilation (VC) and Chilled Water (YC) Systems combine to form one system which is designed to maintain a suitable environment in the following plant areas at all times; Control Room, Cable Room, Battery Room, Switchgear Rooms, Motor Control Center Rooms, and the Electrical Penetration Rooms at elevation 594+0. The VC/YC System is shared between both Units. There are two 100% redundant trains of VC/YC equipment. Each is capable of being powered by Unit 1 or Unit 2 Essential Auxiliary Power, but under normal conditions both trains are aligned to Unit 1. Tw6 diesel generators (D/ Gs) are provided per Unit to energize the Essential Auxiliary Power buses during emergency conditions. Technical Specification 3.7.6 specifies that two independent trains of VC/YC shall be Operable during all operational modes. If one train becomes Inoperable while either Unit is in Mode 4, Hot Shutdown, or above, the Inoperable train must be restored to Operable status within seven days, or the operating Units must be shutdown. If both Units are below Mode 4 and one train is Inoperable, tie train must be restored to Operable status within seven days or the Operable train must be operated in the filter mode. If both trains are Inoperable. or with the Operable train not capable of being powered by an Operable emergency power source, all core alterations and positive reactivity changes must be suspended on both Units. The requirement for an Operable emergency power source is only specifically stated for Units operating below Mode 4. However, the bases for Technical Specification 3.7.6 states that the operability of VC/YC ensures that ambient air temperature does not exceed allowable limits for equipment and instrumentation, and the Control Room will remain habitable, during and following all credible accident conditions. This implies that an Operable emergency power supply should be a prerequisite to VC/YC operability in all modes. Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 specifies for each individual Unit that two separate and independent D/Gs are required to be Operable per Unit, if the Unit is in Mode 4, or above. Below Mode 4, Technical Specification 3.8.1,2 applies and only one D/ G is required Operable per Unit. Action Statement c. for Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 specifies that when one D/G becomes Inoperable, all required systems (or trains) that depend on the remaining Operable D/G as a source of emergency power, must be verified Operable within two hours, or the Unit must be shutdown. This is intended to provide assurance that a loss of offsite power event, while one DIG is Inoperable, will not result in a complete loss of safety function of critical systems. it is also the reason Technical Specification 3.7.6 does not specifically require that VC(YC have an Operable emergency power source in Mode 4, or above. This action statement is deficient with respect to VC/YC because VC/YC is aUnit shared system, and Technical Specification 3.8.1.1 applies only to individual Units, In order for VC/YC operability to be protected by this Action Statement, the D/G must become Inoperable while the Unit is in Mode 4, or above. There is no such Action Statement in Technical Specification 3.8.1.2 since only one D/G is required Operable, and the Unit is already shut down. This amendment request would remove the ambiguity as to the emergency power source requirements for the VC System by stating the requirements in the VC System Technical Specification. To clarify the requirements the Specification is to be split into two separate Specifications. The first Specification * (Technical Specification 3.7.6.1) would state the requirements for the VC System when either unit is in Modes 1, 2, 3 or 4. This Specification will now specifically require that each train of the VC System be capable of being powered by an Operable emergency power source whenever either unit is in Mode 1, 2, 3 or 4. This will alleviate the confusion which is currently contained in the Specification as to the emergency power source requirements when one unit is in Modes 1, 2, 3 or 4 and the other unit is in Modes 5 or 6. Technical Specification 3.7.6.2 is being proposed to clearly state the VC System requirements when both units are in Modes 5 or 6. The proposed changes to the VC System Specification will also specify that the requirements are to be performed on a per train basis, The VC System is comprised of two independent and redundant trains. The current wording is that which appears in the Standard Technical Specification and should be changed to more clearly reflect what is in place at Catawba. These proposed changes will add clarification to the requirements of the VC System Specification. The changes will not delete any current requirements or operating restrictions contained in the Specifications and will not allow the plant to be operated in any different mode or configuration. As such, these changes are considered to be administrative in nature and do not involve any Significant Hazards Considerations. The proposed amendment does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident. The operating parameters and the design of the VC System are unchanged and no new modes of operation will be introduced by this amendment request. All previous accident analyses are still applicable and remain unchanged by this proposal. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes will not change the design or allowed modes of operation of the VC System. As such, no new failure modes are intioduced and no new types of accidents are possible. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. These changes will add clarification to the46142 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices existing Specification without changing any of the current requirements. For the above reasons, Duke Power concludes that this proposed amendment does not involve any Significant Hazards Considerations. The staff has reviewed the proposed changes to TS 3/4.7.6, and agrees with the licensee's evaluation of each of these changes with respect to the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92. On this basis, the Commission has concluded that the requested changes meet the three standards and, therefore, has made a proposed determination that the amendment application does not involve a significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: York County Library, 138 East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 Attorney for licensee: Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422 South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 NRC Project Director:. David B. Matthews Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units I and 2, York County, South Carolina Date of amendment request October 6,1088 Description of amendment requesk\" The proposed amendments would revise Technical Specification (TS) Table 3.3-3, Item 14.g., to reflect a proposed modification to the pumphouse pit level instrumentation of the Nuclear Service Water (RN) System. The system is designed to supply cooling water to various heat loads in both the safety and non-safety portions of each unit. This modification would change the swapover logic of the RN system. There are currently four level transmitters per pit at the RN pumphouse. Two are safety-related and two are not safety-related. The - modification will upgrade I out of the 2 non-safety level transmitters per pit to safety grade. This would accommodate a 2 out of 3 logic instead of the present 1 out of 2 logic. Past experience has shown that a single spurious failure to the \"low\" position of one level transmitter can initiate a swapover when there is an adequate water level in the RN pits. Inadvertently challenging the system with numerous valves changing position and starting all RN pumps is unnecessary and reduces the reliability of the system. The failure mode of all the safety grade level transmitters is the same. They fail low on loss of power. This is desirable in order to realign suctionfrom Lake Wylie to the Standby Nuclear Service Water Pond (SNSWP) which is the ultimate heat sink. The proposed amendments would also temporarily waive the requirements of the Action Statement for Item 14.S. in Table 3.3-3, for 48 hours per pit, on a one time basis in order to allow orderly implementation of this modification. During this time at least one RN pit will be available, The 48 hours is needed for implementation of the modification on each pit separately. During this period, the pit willbe inoperable only from the standpoint of automatic realignment to the SNSWP from its normal supply if low level is sensed in the affected pit. All necessary automatic functions would still occur in the opposite pit. The only automatic valve actuation which is activated by train specific pit level instrumentation is the loop cross-over isolation valves. Closure of these valves is only required in the event of design basis accident accompanied by a failure of a pit supply valve to open when an emergency diesel generator or nuclear service water pump is out-of-service for extended maintenance. All four diesel generators and nuclear service water pumps will be maintained in an operable status for the duration of the requested 48 hour period. Therefore, the RN system would be capable of performing its design function during any design basis event, including any concurrent postulated single failure, throughout the requested 48 hour period. In a letter to Duke Power Company dated September 30, 1987, the NRC staff noted that this proposed modification would improve the overall reliability of the RN System. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR Part 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possiblity of new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendments do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously-evaluated because the proposed modification would increase the reliability of the RN system by eliminating unnecessary actuations of the swapover instrumentation andcomponents, and during implementation of the modification the system would be capable of performing its intended function during any design basis event. The proposed amendments do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the RN system design basis would not be changed as a result of this modification, and the proposed modification would improve the reliability of the system. The proposed amendments do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the modification would enhance the reliability of the RN system by decreasing the likelihood of inadvertent actuations, and during implementation of the modification the RN system would be capable of performing its intended function during any design basis event. Accordingly, the Commission has concluded that the requested changes meet the three standards and, therefore, has made a proposed determination that the requested license amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Matthews Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50414, Catawba Nuclear Station, Units I and 2, York County, South Carolina Date of amendment request October 7, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise Section 6.2 \"Organization\" of the Technical Specifications (TS) to delete the offsite and onsite organization charts, Figures 6.2-1 and 6.2-2. In place of the charts, the revision would add general requirements which capture the essential features of the organizational structure that are defined by the existing organization charts. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility46143 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 /,Notices in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee, in its submittal of October 7,1988, provided the following discussion and analysis with regard to the three 10 CFR 50.92 standards; This proposed amendment would incorporate the guidance contained in the NRC's Generic Letter 88-06, dated March 22, 1988. The Generic Letter provided for deletion of the organization charts contained within Section 6 of the Technical Specifications provided certain statements be added to cover particular administrative control requirements. This proposed amendment has been developed based on the Generic Letter guidance. The NRC Staff concluded and Duke Power concurs that the removal of organization charts from the Technical Specifications will provide greater flexibility to implement changes in organization structure but will not reduce plant safety. The proposed amendment does not involve an increase in the -probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident. This amendment is administrative in nature and does not change the design or operation of the facility. The accident analyses are therefore unaffected by this proposal. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The design and operation of the facility will not be changed by this amendment and no new modes of operation will be introduced. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This change is administrative in nature and therefore has no effect on any margin of safety. The NRC's discussion in their Generic Letter 88-06 concluded that any facility incorporating the changes outlined in the Generic Letter will have greater flexibility to implement changes to their organizational structures and will not reduce plant safety. For the above reasons, Duke Power concludes that this proposed amendment does not involve any Significant Hazards Considerations. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's submittal against the guidance provided in Generic Letter (GL) 88-06, \"Removal of Organization Charts from Technical Specification Administrative Control Requirements.\" The proposed TS revisions, deleting the organization charts and adding more flexible provisions regarding organizational structure, are in accord with this guidance. As also recommended in GL 88-06, the FinalSafety Analysis Report (FSAR) contains the offsite and onsite organization charts (Figures 13.1.1-1 and 13.1.2-1) and the qualifications for those positions designated by the charts as requiring a Senior Reactor Operator or Reactor Operator license (FSAR, Section 13.1.3.1). The staff therefore finds that the proposed revisions do not adversely affect the organizational characteristics which are important to the safe operation of the facility. The staff also agrees with the licensee's evaluation of the proposed revisions with respect to the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92..On this basis, the Commission has concluded that the requested amendment meets the three standards and, therefore, has made a proposed determination that the amendment application does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Matthews Duquesne Light Company, Docket No. 50-412, Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2, Shippingport, Pennsylvania Date of amendment request: October 24, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would extend the interval for several 18-month surveillances: reactor trip system response time, reactor trip bypass breakers automatic undervoltage trip check, engineered safety feature (ESF) logic response time, manual actuation switches for several ESF systems, reactor trip P-4 interlock, seismic monitoring instruments, containment isolation check valve lift tests, containment isolation phase B isolation valve actuations, containment recirculation spray valve actuations, diesel generator maintenance inspection, and battery discharge test. To perform these surveillances, the licensee would have to shutdown the unit. Therefore, the licensee requested that the surveillances specified above be permitted to be done at the first refueling outage, but no later than April 1, 1989. If approved, the amendment would permit extension of the 18-month intervals by several days to about three months. The amendment would thus avert a reactor shutdown only to perform surveillances. The licensee agreed to perform these surveillances if there is an unscheduled shutdown ofsufficient duration before the refueling outage. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed schedular extensions are not made as a result of, nor would they lead to any design changes. When approved by the staff, only certain surveillance intervals would be extended. The affected systems will continue to perform as stated in the licensee's Final SafetyAnalysis Report (FSAR); other requirements regarding these components/systems are not changed. From experience in the past, surveillances were performed usually to confirm that components were operable as designed. The probability of finding inoperable components was not high, and consequently, the probability of occurrence of an accident can only be increased by an insignificant amount if the surveillance interval is extended by a small amount. Therefore, the answers to questions (1) and (2) would be negative. The safety limits assumed in FSAR analyses are not affected by the proposed amendment since all assumptions are expected to remain unchanged. Hence the answer to question (3) is also negative. On such basis, the staff proposes to determine that the requested amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: B. F.

The amendment would change the maximum allowable control element assembly (CEA) drop time from 2.7 seconds to 3.1 seconds. The application is the result of the licensee's review of NRC Information Notice No. 88-47 entitled, \"Slower-than-Expected Rod- Drop Time Testing.\" Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determinabon: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideratioi exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (I) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment application and made a no significant hazards consideration determination. In regard to the first standard, the licensee provided the following analysis: Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The change does not affect any active hardware involving plant operation; rather it affects an acceptance criterion for confirming the required performance of the existing control element assembly (CEA) hardware. Therefore, the proposed change does not increase the probability of an accident previously analyzed. The impact of changing the CEA drop time from 2.7 to 3.1 seconds on all safety analysis related Design Basis Events (DBE's), for which a scram of the CEA's is predicted, was assessed by specifically re-analyzing only the most limiting events with respect to the various safety analysis fuel and system criteria. In particular, the following events were re-analyzed: Loss of Condenser Vacuum (LOCV) Loss of Forced Reactor Coolant Flow Pre-Trip Steam Line Break (SLB) Hot Full Power CEA Ejection (CEA Ejection) --it-has been demonstrated that the events are either totally unrelated to CEA drop time considerations or are not significantly impacted. Additionally, it was demonstrated for each potentially impacted analysis that the consequences of the analysis remain unchanged or are bounded by the existing analysis. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. With respect to the second standard, the licensee stated:Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change in the Technical Specifications does not affect any active hardware involving plant operation, rather it affects only an acceptance criterion for confirming the required performance of the existing CEA hardware. Therefore, the proposed change would not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. With regard to the third standard, the licensee provided the following rationale: Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety The increased CEA drop time has been evaluated for its impact on the current licensed safety analysis. The results of the re- analysis for those transients which are potentially impacted by the proposed change show that the reference analyses are valid or that the new analysis results still show acceptable results with respect to the acceptance criteria. Therefore, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety. The staff has reviewed the analysis provided by the licensee in support of a no significant hazards consideration determination. The staff believes that the licensee has met the standards for such a determination. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Reis, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: Herbert N. Berkow Florida Power and Light Company, et al., Docket No. 50-389, St. Lucie Plant, Unit No. 2, St. Lucie County, Florida Date of amendment request: October 24, 1988 Description of amendment request: The amendment would expand the Departure from Nucleate Boiling and Linear Heat Rate-related Axial Shape Index limits contained in Figures 3.2-4 and 3.2-2, respectively. In addition, a similar expansion of limits is proposed for the Linear Heat Rate-related Limited Safety System Setpoints as contained in Figure 2.2-2. The licensee is requesting these changes to give the plant greater flexibility at low and intermediate power levels. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists(10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment application and provided a no significant hazards consideration determination. In regard to the first standard, the licensee provided the following analysis: Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Axial Shape Index (ASI) limits are used as initial assumptions for all Design Basis Events (DBEs) evaluated in the safety analysis. The expansion of these ASI limits for lower powers is applicable only to those DBEs that are evaluated between hot full and hot zero power. Events are not typically analyzed at intermediate power levels. Events initiated from intermediate power levels (100% greater than initial power greater than 0%) are unaffected since these are bounded by the results of events initiated from either the full power or zero power events. The existing safety analyses for these events use input parameters that are axial shape dependent, such as scram reactivity insertion curves, which are more adverse (conservative) than the Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) and Limiting Safety System Setpoint (LSSS axial shape limits at all power levels in order to bound future cycles' operation. It was verified, using current methodology and the proposed ASI limits, that the current safety analysis remains valid. The current ASI limits allowed by the Departure from Nucleate Boiling [DNB) and Linear Heat Rate (LHR) LCOs and LSSSs are expanded for greater operational flexibility at lower powers. (These] proposed changels) will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed limits are still conservative with respect to the actual calculated limiting values. With regard to the second standard, the licensee stated: Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes in the Technical Specifications do not affect' any active hardware involving plant operation, nor do they alter the assumptions or methodology of the safety analyses. Therefore, they will not create the possibility of a new or different46145q Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices kind of accident from any previously evaluated. With regard to the third standard, the licensee provided the following rationale: Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The wider ASI bands allowed at lower powers have been reviewed for their impact upon the current licensed safety analysis. The licensed safety analysis of record remains unchanged'due to the expanded ASI range for low powers. Therefore, there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination analysis. Based upon the review, the staff believes that the licensee has met the three standards. Based upon the above discussion, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes do not Involve a significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Indian River Junior College Library, 3209 Virginia Avenue, Fort Pierce, Florida 33450 Attorney for licensee: Harold F.

Berkow Florida Power and Light Company, et aL, Docket No. 50-389, St. Lude Plant, Unit No. 2, St. Lucie County, Florida Date of amendment request: October 24,1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would relax the maximum allowable primary loop resistance temperature detector (RTD) delay time from 8 seconds to 16 seconds. This delay time is a factor that must be considered in the thermal margin/low pressure reactor trip. According to the licensee, this change would provide increased operational flexibility without decreasing the margin of safety. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendmentapplication and provided a no significant hazards consideration determination. In regard to the first standard, the licensee provided the following analysis: Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) response time affects only measurement hardware which passively ascertains the coolant temperature condition, not active hardware impacting the plant's physical thermal-hydraulic operations. Therefore, the proposed change does not increase the probability of occurrence of any accident. As described before, the safety analyses demonstrate that the same degree of protection is available at the longer RTD response times since the ex-core power detectors (which do not depend on RTD response time) now provide the required protection when more realistic physics inputs are used. With regard to operations, it should be noted that the plant will be operated In the same manner as before. Therefore, the calculated consequences of the accidents will not increase due to this change. With regard to the second standard, the licensee stated: Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not affect any active hardware involving plant operation, nor does it alter the basic methodology of the safety analyses. Therefore, it will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those accidents previously evaluated. With regard to the third standard, the licensee provided the following rationale: Use of the modified specification would not involve significant reduction in a margin of safety. The value of the RTD response time affects the ability of the delta T-power calculator to accurately measure power during a transient. It has been demonstrated that the ex-core power detectors will provide an adequate power measurement input to the Thermal Margin/Low Pressure (TM/LP) trip for the full spectrum of possible power excursions associated with the CEA withdrawal events with a slight increase in margin to the TM/LP trip setpoint. Thus, the margin of safety is not reduced. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination analysis. Based upon this review, the staff believes that the licensee has met the three standards. Based upon the above discussion, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Reis, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: Herbert N. Berkow Illinois Power Company, Soyland Power Cooperative, Inc., Western Illinois Power Cooperative, Inc. (the licensees), Docket No. 50-461, Clinton Power Station, Unit No. 1, DeWitt County, Illinois Date of amendment request: September 23, 1988 Description of amendment request: This proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Sections 3.8.1.1 and 3.8.1.2, which are the Limiting Conditions for Operation specified for the AC electrical power sources, to change the number of gallons of fuel oil specified for the Division II diesel generator (1B). These Technical Specifications indicate the minimum amount of diesel fuel that should be available for the diesel generators. The licensees have requested to change the number of gallons of fuel oil specified for the Division II diesel generator (1B) from 41,500 to 45,000. The licensees have prepared a plant modification to replace the Fuel Pool Cooling and Cleanup (FC) System pump motors (1A and 1B) and remove the associated LOCA shunt trips. This modification is in accordance with their commitment \"Until the first refueling, the pump motors will be tripped on a LOCA signal.... By'the first refueling, replacement motors qualified to the maximum environment conditions will be installed and the LOCA-trip signal will be removed.\" Removing the associated LOCA shunt trips and ensuring the FC pump motors are qualified to operate in a post-LOCA environment allows the pump motors to be regarded as safety-related essential loads powered from the Class 1E emergency busses. This effectively increases the maximum expected emergency loading for the associated diesel generators (1A and 1B). The resultant increase in the maximum expected loading thus requires a revision of the minimum fuel oil volume specified in the Technical Specifications to ensure that the diesels are capable of supplying and maintaining emergency power for all essential loads. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined that it involves no significant hazards considerations. According to 10 CFR46146 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed change will ensure that an adequate volume of diesel fuel is available for the diesel generator (1B) to perform its intended function in mitigating the consequences of the design basis accident while carrying the maximum expected load (including the associated FC pump motor). The increased maximum expected loading for the diesel generator(s), resulting from the plant modification, does not exceed the rated capacity of the diesel generators. The impact of the proposed change is confined to two areas of concern: diesel generator operability and the ability to maintain an adequate supply of high quality cooling water in the spent fuel storage pool(s) under post-accident conditions. The changes associated with the plant modification have been evaluated and found to have no adverse impact on the diesel generators' capability to perform their intended function during or following a design basis accident (DBA-LOCA). With respect to any concerns regarding the spent fuel storage pool, including the FC pump motors as essential loads, will ensure that an FC pump is available for cooling and maintaining the volume and quality of water in the spent fuel storage pools under post-accident conditions. The proposed change therefore does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the increased minimum amount of diesel fuel to be stored for diesel generator 1B is well within the storage capacity of the fuel storage tank. In addition, the added electrical load requiring the extra amount of diesel fuel does not cause the maximum expected load for diesel generator 1B to exceed its rated capacity. The electrical loading and fuel storage demand for diesel generator 1B. will still be in compliance with the original design requirements.For the reasons stated above, the staff believes this proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.

Muller Long Island Lighting Company, Docket No. 50-322, Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, Suffolk County, New York Date of amendment request: May 19, 1988 Description of amendment request: This amendment would revise Technical Specifications 3.5.2a.2.b, Emergency Core Cooling Systems -Shutdown, and 3.5.3.1b.3 Suppression Pool Water Level, to read \"...equivalent to an indicated level of 11.5 feet\" rather than \"...equivalent to a level of 9 feet\". This change reduces the potential for operator misinterpretation but does not affect the minimum 100,000 gallons of water availability requirement for the condensate storage tank. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 the licensee has reviewed the proposed changes and has concluded as follows: The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of Shoreham Nuclear Power Station -Unit I in accordance with this change would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change merely clarifies and identifies the Condensate Storage Tank (CST) level (indicated level) which meets or exceeds the technical specification requirement of maintaining 100,000 gallons of water available for Core Spray system use. The CST low-low level alarm (since May 19, 1982) has always been set at an indicated level of 13 feet asmeasured from the bottom of the tank. This was always the intended level which was to be used for ECCS reserve. (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. It has been determined that a new or different kind of accident will not be possible due to this change. Design documentation specifically calls out a low- low level alarm and a CST transfer pump trip at an indicated level of 13 feet of tank evaluation. Without the foregoing pumps to drain the tank, the ECCS systems are the only users of the water volume below the 13 foot level. If the suction line elevation [approximately 1.75 ft.) is deducted from the 13 ft., a useable volume of 11.25 ft. is achieved. This is equivalent to an approximate available volume of 133,800 gallons. (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The use of an 11.5 ft. indicated level as proposed in the technical specification change clarifies the 1.5 foot (i.e., 13 ft.-11.5 ft) operational deviation that has always existed. If the CST transfer pumps do not deenergize -due to malfunction -at the 13 ft. level, the operator is permitted the same period of time to deenergize the pumps and not place himself in a technical specification violation. The staff reviewed the licensee's determination that the proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration and agrees with the licensee's analyses. Accordingly, the staff proposes to determine that the . proposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) fur determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists. A, proposed amendment to an Operating46147 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices License for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability of consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or I3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) reviewed the proposed change and determined, and the NRC staff agrees, that: (1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because deletion of the organization charts from the Technical Specifications does not affect plant operation. The NRC will continue to be informed of organizational changes through other required controls. * 10 CFR 50.341b)(B)li) requires that the applicant's organizational structure be included in the Final Safety Analysis Report. Chapter 13 of the SNPS Final Safety Analysis Report provides a description of the LILCO/ SNPS organization and detailee organization charts. * As required by 10 CFR 50.71(e), LILCO submits annual updates to the FSAR. * to i0 CFR So and 10 CFR 50.3(a)(3) gover changes to organization described in LILCO's Quality Assurance Program. LILCO is mindful that some organizational changes may require prior NRC approval. Also, it is LILCO's practice to inform the NRC of organizational changes affecting the nuclear facility prior to implementation. LILCO intends to continue this practice for future organizational changes. (2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the proposed change is administrative in nature, and no physical alterations of plant configuration or changes to setpoints or operating parameters are proposed. (3) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Through the Company's strong Nurlear Quality Assurance Program and its commitment to maintain only qualified personnel in positions of responsibility, it is assured that safety functions performed by the nuclear organizations will continue to be performed at a high level of performance. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Box 1535, Richmond, Virginia 23212 NRC Project Director: Walter R. ButlerLouisiana Power and Light Company, Docket No. 50-382, Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit 3, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana Date of amendment request: September 21,1988 Description of amendment requesr The proposed amendment would change the Technical Specifications by deleting the Ammonia Detection System. Ammonia detection would be provided by the Broad Range Toxic Gas Detection System which is currently in the Technical Specifications. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Broad Range Toxic Gas Detection (BRTGD) system provides toxic gas chemical protection for the control room. The BRTGD system detects ammonia and thereby duplicates the function of the ammonia detection system. Deleting the ammonia detection system will not significantly reduce the protection to the control room envelopment from an ammonia toxic chemical release. The BRTGD system will isolate the control room before the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) concentrations for ammonia is reached. The technical specifications for the BRTGD system is equivalent to those for the Ammonia Detection System and either system provides for control room isolation as the availability of the system declines. Deletion of the ammonia system as a duplicate to the BRTGD system does not involve a significant increase in the probabilities or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The function of both the BRTGD and ammonia systems is solely to isolate the control room in the unlikely event of a toxic chemical release in the area. The BRTGD and ammonia system do not provide any other protective function. Since the BRTGD system will provide ammonia detection, the deletion of the ammonia detection system will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.The ammonia detection system setpoint is 50 ppm ammonia and will respond in .33 seconds for concentration at and above 50 ppm. The BRTGD system responds at different times for any concentration above environmental background; the higher the concentration, the faster the response time. For concentration of ammonia of concern at the control room, the BRTGD system will have a faster response time than the ammonia system and while the BRTGD will respond below 50 ppm, the ammonia detection system will not. Such a comparison evaluation demonstrates equivalent or better protection by the BRTGD system. Therefore, the deletion of the ammonia detection system will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the amendment does not involve a no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a no significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not- [1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.461L48 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerations in its request for a license amendment. The licensee's analysis of the proposed amendment against the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 is reproduced below. a. The proposed change will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. As a result of the proposed amendment, there will not be physical changes to the facility, and all Operating Procedures, Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings, and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications will remain unchanged. SERI will continue in its present role under the Operating Agreement and Ownership Agreement. There will be no changes to the operating organization or personnel as a result of the transaction(s) described herein. b. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The design and design bases of GGNS Unit 1 will remain the same. Therefore, the current plant safety analyses will remain complete and accurate in addressing the licensing basis events and in analyzing plant response and consequences. Further, the Operating Procedures, Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings, and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications are not - affected. As such, the plant conditions for which the design basis accident analyses were performed are still valid. c. The proposed amendment will not involve a reduction in any margin of safety. Plant safety margins are established through Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings, and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications. Because there will be no change to either the physical design of the plant or to any of these settings and limits, there will be no change to any of the margins of safety. The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Hinds Junior College, McLendon Library, Raymond, Mississippi 39154 Attorney for licensee: Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esquire, Bishop, Liberman, Cook, Purcell and Reynolds, 1200 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: Elinor G. AdensamNortheast Nuclear Energy Company, et al., Docket No. 50-423, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, -Unit No. 3, New London County, Connecticut Date of amendment request: October 5, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.1.1.3, \"Moderator Temperature Coefficient,\". to allow a more negative moderator temperature coefficient in the Limiting Condition for Operation, TS 3.1.1.3b, and in the associated Surveillance Requirement, TS 4.1.1.3b. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Moderator Temperature Coefficient (MTC) represents the relationship between the reactor coolant system (RCS) temperature and core reactivity. Near the end of the operating cycle the MTC is strongly negative, that is, decreasing RCS temperature causes a substantial increase in core reactivity. Thus, for accidents that involve a significant decrease in RCS temperature, such as a steam line break accident, the MTC strongly influences the severity of the accident. The purpose of TS 3/ 4.1.1.3b is to assure that the facility will not operate with an MTC more negative than the value incorporated in the safety analyses. The following MTC values are presently in the TS: \" TS 3.1.1.3b -The Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) the end-of-life MTC is -4.0 x 10,' delta K/K/\u00b0 F. Should the MTC be more negative than 'the LCO MTC, the reactor would have to be shutdown within 12 hours. TS 4.1.1.3b -The Surveillance Requirement (SR) MTC -3.1 x 10\" delta K[K/\u00b0 F. The SR MTC must be measured within 7 effective full power days (EFPD) after reaching an equilibrium RCS boron concentration of 300 ppm. If the SR MTC is more negative than -3.1 x 10\"4 delta K/ K[\u00b0 F, the MTC must be remeasured at least every 14 EFPD during the remainder of the fuel cycle. Accident analyses do not explicitly input an MTC, but rather a constant moderator density coefficient (MDC). Converting the MDC used in the accident analyses to an MTC is a simple calculation which accounts for the rate of change of moderator density with temperature at the conditions of interest; namely, hot full power. In addition, the MTC that is measured must be corrected to reflect the assumptions used in the safety analysis which includes control rod positions. In this regard, the MDC used in the Millstone Unit 3 accident analysis would be equivalent to an MTC of-5.5 x 10\"4 delta K/K/r F. Westinghouse has recently developed a refined methodology for comparing themeasured MTC with the accident analysis MDC. The method developed by Westinghouse is documented in WCAP-11951, \"Safety Evaluation Supporting a More Negative EOL Moderator Temperature Coefficient Technical Specification for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station Unit 3,\" September 1988. By using the methodology of WCAP-11951 for Millstone Unit 3, the following changes are proposed by the licensee for TS 3/ 4.1.1.3b: * TS 3.1.1.3b -4.0 x 10\" delta K/ K/\u00b0 F. No change in the safety analysis is involved and the safety analysis MTC value of -5.5 x 10\"* delta K/K/\u00b0 F is still considered bounding. Title 10 CFR Part 50, Section 50.92 contains standards for determining whether a proposed license amendment involves significant hazards considerations. In this regard, the proposed changes to the TS does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change to the LCO and SR MTCs provide adequate assurance that Millstone Unit 3 will not be operated with an MTC more negative than the equivalent MDC assumed in the safety analysis. The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident since no changes to plant equipment or operating modes are involved. Finally, no safety margins are reduced since there are no changes in the safety analyses. Accordingly, the staff has made a proposed determination that the application for amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.

Brief description of amendment: In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, the licensee submitted an46149 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices amendment to the Physical Security Plan for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1, to reflect recent changes to that regulation. The proposed amendment would modify paragraph 3.C of Facility Operating License No. DPR-40 to require compliance with the revised plan. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: On August 4,1986 (51 FR 27817 and 27822), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission amended Part 73 of its regulations, \"Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,\" to clarify plant security requirements to afford an increased assurance of plant safety. The amended regulations required that each nuclear power reactor licensee submit proposed amendments to its security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55. The licensee submitted its revised plan on December 2, 1986, with additional information on January 9, 1988 and September 30, 1988, to satisfy the requirements of the amended regulations. The Commission proposes to amend the license to reference the revised plan. In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, the Commission indicated that it was amending its regulations \"to provide a more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the current levels of protection\" and that the \"Commission believes that the clarification and refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is appropriate because they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.\" The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of the criteria for determining whether a sigificant hazards consideration exists by providing certain examples of actionsinvolving no significant hazards considerations and examples of actions involving significant hazards considerations (51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involving no significant hazards considerations is example (vii) \"a change to conform a license to changes in the regulations, where the license change results in very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.\" For the foregoing reasons, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: W. Dale Clark Library, 215 South 15th Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68102 Altorneyfor licensee: LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby, and MacRae, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20036NRC Project Director: Jose A. Calvo Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket No. 50-352, Limerick Generating Station, Unit 1, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Date of amendment request: September 29,1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change the Technical Specifications (TSs) to: (1) delete the primary containment isolation valves and instrumentation associated with the permanent removal of the RHR head spray piping and (2) modify the reportability requirements for seismic monitor XR-VA-151 whenever the reactor head has been removed. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: Limerick Units I and 2 are BWR-4 reactors. All BWR-4s were designed with three penetrations at the top of the reactor vessel head, one four-inch and two six-inch penetrations. One of the six-inch penetrations was intended to provide a water spray to the space at the top of the reactor vessel. Located above the reactor core are the steam separators and dryers. It was postulated that during cooldown of the reactor system, a spray of water would be required to cool the large mass of metal in the separators and dryers. The source of water was primary coolant from the residual heat removal (RHR) system. Over 15 years ago, it was found that this RHR head spray was not needed and is no longer used during system cooldown. Keeping the system in place poses a number of potential safety and economic disadvantages. Each time the reactor vessel head is removed (e.g., during refueling), the array of piping and valves has to be disassembled and removed and then reinstalled after the head is replaced. Since the piping contains \"stagnant\" primary coolant at system temperature and pressure, there exists the potential for intergranular stress corrosion cracking of the many welds in the system, increasing the potential for leakage. Consequently, these welds are subject to the augmented inspection requirements of NUREG-0313. The piping constitutes one more potential source for a high energy line break and for pipe whip. Since all of the BWR-4s have demonstrated that there is no need for the RHR head spray and since removing the piping inside containment enhances plant safety, the NRC has approved removal of this system in most BWR-4s. Limerick Unit 1 is one of the minority that has so far retained the RHR head spray system. The proposed application requests NRC approval for removal of the RHR head spray piping and associatedvalves, and for blanking off the associated primary containment penetration and the existing reactor head spray piping stubout used for the head spray. At present, there is a seismic monitor (XR-VA-151) located on the head spray piping. The licensee proposes to relocate this monitor to place it directly on the reactor head at the nozzle presently used for the head spray piping penetration. This seismic monitor has to be removed (and subsequently replaced) each time the vessel head is removed. The present TSs require that whenever the seismic monitor is inoperable -and disconnecting the monitor renders it inoperable -a special report has to be submitted to the Commission. The proposed changes to the TSs would eliminate all references to the RHR head spray piping and isolation valves, instruments and controls. The changes would also eliminate the requirement for a special report to the Commission when the seismic monitor XR-VA-151 is inoperable because it had to be disconnected to remove the reactor vessel head. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee's analysis contained in their September 29, 1988 letter states the following in response to the three NRC criteria referenced above with respect to the changes to the TSs to delete the isolation valves and instrumentation associated with permanent removal of the RHR head spray piping: (1) Operation of the plant under the proposed Technical Specifications after removal of the RHR Head Spray piping and associated valves along with blanking the associated primary containment penetration, would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Three areas were previously evaluated in the FSAR regarding the reactor bead spray piping: * Primary Containment Isolation -FSAR Section 6.2 * Seismic Analysis -FSAR Section 3.7.4\" Pipe Whip Analysis -FSAR Section 3.6__ III I46150 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices The Reactor Head Spray piping removal modification was reviewed and found to be acceptable in the above referenced FSAR areas. * The primary containment isolation will be maintained after removal of the Reactor Head Spray piping by welding a closure on the outboard containment side of penetration 17. The penetration is included in the nservice Inspection (ISI) program and the integrity of the welded closure will be verified by periodic testing. * Seismic Category I piping, hangers and snubbers on the RHR Head Spray would be removed by the proposed modification. Stress calculations have been reviewed and appropriately revised to assure that any remaining components are not impacted. * Any potential pipe whip problems would be eliminated by removal of the pipe and pipe supports, as proposed. Further, Licensee has reviewed the potential effects of the proposed removal in previous evaluations in the areas of Fire Protection, Electrical Separation, Environmental Qualification, Inservice Inspection, and Piping Stresses. Evaluations in these areas did not uncover any areas of safety significance. Based on these reviews, the Licensee concludes that the RHR Head Spray modifications do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) Operation of the plant under the proposed Technical Specifications after removal of the Reactor Head Spray System along with blanking the primary containment penetration would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Removal of the RHR Head Spray piping and blanking the primary containment penetration eliminates the piping from being a potential pipe whip problem and removes the containment penetration as a potential leakage source. No credit has been taken for the RHR Head Spray in the mitigation or prevention of an accident, therefore, the modification does not create the possibility of new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) Operation of the plant under the proposed Technical Specifications after removal of the RHR Head Spray and associated talves along with blanking the primary containment penetration, would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The integrity of the reactor pressure boundary after removal of the RHR Head Spray would be maintained by a blank flange installed over the Reactor Head Spray nozzle. The reactor pressure boundary would then become part of the Inservice Inspection (ISI) program and would be hydrostatically tested each time the reactor head is reinstalled on the reactor vessel. The primary containment penetration will be welded closed on the outboard side of the containment penetration and will be periodically tested for integrity during scheduled integrated leak rate testing. The seismic category I piping, hangers and snubbers and containment isolation valves on the Head Spray piping would be removed by the proposed modification. Therefore, the RHR Head Spray modification would not involve a reduction ina margin of safety. Based on the three standards discussed above, operation of the facility subsequent to removal of the RHR Head Spray along with the associated primary containment isolation valves, involves No Significant Hazard Considerations. The licensee separately evaluated the deletion from the TSs of the special report when seismic monitor XR-VA-151 is inopeiable solely because it has to be disconnected to remove the reactor vessel head. With respect to the three NRC criteria in 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee stated: (1) Operation of the plant under the proposed Technical Specifications in regard to changing the operability reporting requirements for seismic monitor XR-VA-151 whenever the reactor head has been removed, would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Seismic monitor would continue to function under the proposed amendment whenever the reactor head is installed on the reactor vessel. When the reactor head has been removed from the reactor vessel, the seismic monitor will become inoperable by necessity and presently is reportable after 30 days under the existing Technical Specifications. The purpose of the existing requirement is to report unexpected seismic monitor malfunctions during periods when monitors are required to be operable. Eliminating the requirement for submission of a special report when only one seismic monitor becomes inoperable for more than 30 days, during the course of normal activities taking place with the reactor head removal, will not affect the reporting requirements for the monitor under any other operating conditions. Following the reinstallation of the reactor head, the seismic monitor will be reconnected and its operability re- established. The reporting requirements for other seismic monitors would not be affected by this proposed change. The intent of the specification for reporting seismic monitor malfunction would continue under the proposed amendment. Lack of a report whenever the reactor head is removed, does not affect the intent of the specification which is to accrue data on unexpected seismic monitor malfunctions and on the reliability of the monitors, rather than on intentional disconnections of a monitor. Therefore, deletion of the reportability requirement under these expected conditions would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) Operation of the plant under the proposed Technical Specifications in regard to changing the operability reporting requirements for Seismic Monitor XR-VA-151 whenever the reactor head has been removed would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of an accident from any accident previously evaluated. After completion of the proposed Head Spray removal modification, a blanking flange on the reactor nozzle would maintain the reactor pressure boundary. Seismicmonitor XKR-VA-151 would be remounted at the time to the new blanking flange on top of the reactor vessel head. No other changes are being proposed for seismic monitor XR-VA- 151. Also, the reportability requirements would not be changed for any other monitor except XR-VA-151 under the proposed amendment. Changing the reportability requirements for seismic monitor XR;VA-151 when the reactor head has been removed does not affect any plant safe shutdown capabilities, Therefore, elimination of the reportability requirements without making changes to the location or to the normal operability status of the seismic monitor would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) Operation of the plant under the proposed Technical Specification in regard to changing the operability reporting requirements for Seismic Monitor XR-VA-151 whenever the reactor head has been removed would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Seismic Monitoring System provides information to the operators after a seismic event and does not perform any direct plant shutdown function or affect plant operation. When monitor XR.VA-151 becomes inoperable during times the RPV head is removed, it does not provide any information following a seismic event occurring during that period. Other monitors in the plant remain operable and would provide this information. The lack of post-seismic data from seismic monitor XR-VA-151 would remain the same whether or not a special report was submitted to the Commission. Elimination of the Special Report when seismic monitor XR-VA-151 is inoperable during times when the RPV head is removed, does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The lack of seismic information from seismic monitor XR-VA-151 after any seismic event when the reactor head is removed, would not affect the safety of the plant. Seismic monitors provide information to reinforce and verify previous seismic calculations. Other monitors in the plant would provide this information when XR-VA-151 is not operable. Based on the three standards discussed above, operation of the facility after changing the seismic monitor reportability requirements in the Technical Specifications, involves No Significant Hazards Considerations. The staff has reviewed the licensee's analyses and agrees with it. Therefore, we conclude that the amendment satisfies the three criteria listed in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Based on that conclusion, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Butler Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego, New York Date of amendment request: April 14, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specification (TS) Section 4.6.G.1 to resolve a conflict with the corresponding Bases section. Section 4.6.G.1 specifies surveillance requirements to verify jet pump performance. The revision would reduce the maximum permissible recirculation loop flow imbalance between recirculation loops from 15 percent to 10 percent when the recirculation pumps are operated at the same speed, which would then agree with the limits stated in the TS Bases section. The 10 percent value is consistent with the TS Bases, NRC staff and industry guidance. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a. significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated; or (3] Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has determined, that the proposed TS change will not involve a significant hazards consideration. The proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in that the effect is to bring the TS section into agreement with the actual practice and the TS Bases section. The proposed change is administrative in nature and as such does not involve hardware or procedural changes to the facility. The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident since it does not involve an actual change to present operating criteria and as stated previously does not involve any facility hardware or procedural changes. The proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety because the changeis administrative in nature. In fact, the proposed change increases the probability that a jet pump failure will be promptly identified by the operators since the effect is to reduce the jet pump performance surveillance acceptance limit. The 10 percent figure complies with the General Electric Company's Service Information Letter No. 330, which verifies that the 10 percent value is the proper limit. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle, New York- New York 10019. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra, Director Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego, New York Dote of amendment request: September 13, 1988 Description of amendment request: The licensee provided, in part, the following description: The application for amendment proposes changes to page 4, Table 3.1-1 and Table 3.2-1 of the Technical Specifications (TS]. The change to page 4 would delete the reactor protection scram bypass from the definition of Startup/Hot Standby. The change to Table 3.1-1 would delete the requirement for a reactor scram on main steam isolation valve (MSIV) closure in the refuel and the startup modes. Also note 3 to this Table, which established 1005 psig as the reactor pressure below which the scram is bypassed, will be deleted. The change to Table 3.2-1 involves adding a reference to note 7 for the low condenser vacuum trip of the MSIVs to indicate that the trip is functional only in the run mode. Note 8 to Table 3.2-1, which already refers to the low condenser vaccum trip of the MSIVs, would be changed to read, \"Bypassed when mode switch is not in run mode and turbine stop valves are closed.\" This would remove the requirement that reactor pressure be less than 1005 psig before the bypass occurs. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether asignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences-of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standards in 10 CFR 50.92 and the licensees' findings are summarized below: 1. The proposed change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Pressure switches set at 1005 psig were installed a few years ago after instability was observed in an early European Boiling Water Reactor during its startup. However, a series of recent reactivity and pressue perturbation tests conducted as part of the startup test program at Browns Ferry (a typical BWR 4 design of the FitzPatrick type] showed that following the initial disturbance, all parameters returned to steady state values and the reactor stabilized. In addition, since the switches are set to bypass up to the normal reactor operating pressure of 1005 psig, the pressureswhich would allow the scram on MSIV closure and main steam line isolation on low condenser vacuum when the turbine stop valves are closed are outside the range of pressures for the refuel and startup modes. Thus, scram and isolation functions are bypassed and the pressure switches are not necessary. The consequences of inadvertent MSIV closure in the refuel or startup modes at or below 1005 psig will remain unchanged with the removal of the switches. In the startup mode, the reactor power is between approximately 0-15% of full power and the peak reactor pressure and the critical power ratio responses are significantly below the limits established for transients during full power operation. In startup mode, the Intermediate Range Monitor (IRM) subsystem and the Average Power Range Monitor (APRM) subsystem provide signals to the Reactor Protection System (RPS) to shutdown the reactor. If MSIV closure occurs while the reactor is in the startup mode, the reactor will scram on high neutron flux or high reactor pressure. The overpressure protection analysis, for the limiting event of MSIV closure at46152 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices 100% power terminated by the high neutron flux scram, provides the bounding analysis for the pressure transient. If a loss of condenser vacuum event occurs during refuel or startup modes, the turbine bypass valves would close to isolate the condenser, and operator action can be taken to manually close the MSIVs if necessary. Therefore, removal of pressure switches and deletion of scram and isolation functions does not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident. 2. The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The purpose for which the pressure switches were installed does not exist (as discussed above). With the switches set for bypass at 1005 psig (which is above the full range of reactor pressures for refuel and startup modes), scram on MSIV closure and isolation on low condenser vacuum during refuel and startup modes of operation are bypassed. Therefore, the pressure switches are not used for any safety function and no new or different kind of accident can be created by the removal of these switches and deletion of the scram and isolation functions. 3. The proposed amendment will not ,involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The current setpoint for the pressure switches bypass the scram and isolation functions for the full range of reactor pressures in the refuel and startup modes. Furthermore, the operating limits of the plant are not determined by the setpoint of these switches. The limiting plant transients are still those initiated from full power operation and not from operation in the refuel or startup modes with the scram and isolation bypass. Therefore, the operating limits and the limiting safety system settings remain unchanged and the margin of safety is not reduced. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Capra, DirectorPower Authority of The State of New York, Docket No. 0-286, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3, Westchester County, New York Date of amendment request: August 16, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to streamline the Monthly Operating Report to conform to that of the Standard Technical Specifications. Redundancy within the current Monthly Operating Report will be eliminated, and the reporting of safety and relief valve challenges will be provided on a more frequent basis by including this information within the monthly rather than the annual report. The Monthly Operating Report will continue to provide the information outlined in Regulatory Guide 1.16. Basis forproposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility in accordance with a proposed amendment would not. (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of an accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee made the following analysis of these changes: (1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? Response The proposed changes described and evaluated above do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Revising the wording of the section on Monthly Operating Reports does not alter any system or subsystem and will not change the conclusions of either the FSAR or SER accident analysis. (2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated? Response These changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve any changes to the hardware, operability, surveillance, or record-keeping requirements of the facility. In addition, safety and relief valve challenges will subsequently be reported on a more frequent basis. (3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? Response.The proposed changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety since they do not in any way affect the availability, operability, or surveillance requirements of any equipment within the facility. The changes revise the wording of the IPN Technical Specifications section concerning monthly reporting requirements to conform to that of the Standard Technical Specifications. Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

The proposed amendment will revise the Technical Specifications by deleting the snubber listing (Table 3.13-1) while maintaining operability, surveillance, and record- keeping requirements. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility in accordance with a proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee made the following analysis of these changes: 1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? Response The proposed changes described and evaluated above do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not alter any system or subsystem and will not change them ....... ...... I r46153 Feeral Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices conclusions of either the FSAR or the SER accident analysis. 2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? Response These changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The changes do not involve hardware or procedural changes to the facility. Deletion of the snubber listing from the Technical Specifications does not affect safety-related snubber operability, surveillance or record- keeping requirements, and thus cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. A listing of all the safety-related snubbers is maintained as part of the surveillance performance test procedures, which is a controlled document. 3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? Response The proposed changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety since they do not in any way reduce the availability of the snubbers that are provided to ensure that the structural integrity of the reactor coolant and all other safety-related systems are maintained during and following a seismic or other event that induces dynamic loads. Based on the above discussion, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.

Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle, New York, New York 10019. NRC Project Director: Robert A. Capra, Director Public Service Company of Colorado, Docket No. 50267, Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station, Weld County, Colorado Date of amendment request: September 23, 1988 Description of amendment request: This amendment request results from the licensee's need to have a 500 curie source of cesium-137 on site to perform calibration of a high range detection instrumentation. Amendment 41 to the Fort St. Vrain Technical Specifications directed Public Service Company of Colorado to, at a future time, replace the listing of specific isotopes with a statement similar to that now requested in 2.c.(4). The current Radiological Control Program maintains adequate control of the use and storage of calibration sources. This will serve to place the Fort St. Vrain License in a format more similar to the recently issued Licenses. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of aInew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee provided an analysis that addressed the above three standards in the amendment application as follows: The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of FSV in accordance with this change would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The use of sources for calibration purposes does not effect the design or function of any plant system/ component. The updating of this license condition to not specify individual isotopes will allow more flexibility, and is being done based on an NRC recommendation. (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The calibration of detection instrumentation does not create the possibility of any accident different from those already analyzed. Non-specific designation of the calibration sources will not create any new failure modes. (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There is no margin of safety associated with calibration source strength. Further, reformatting the license does not alter the requirements expressed in the License. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve significant hazards considerations. Local Public Document Room location: Greeley Public Library, City Complex Building, Greeley, Colorado Attorney for licensee: James K. Tarpey, Public Service Company Building, Room 900, 550 15th Street, Denver, Colorado 80202 NRC Project Director: Jose A. Calvo Public Service Company of Colorado, Docket No. 50-267, Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station, Weld County, Colorado Date of amendment request: October 13, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed Amendment would modify Technical Specification SectionLCO 4.4.1, which provides a listing of the Plant Protective System (PPS) instrumentation parameters and the associated bases. The PPS is the reactor protective circuitry and the circuitry oriented towards protecting various plant components from major damage. The Technical Specification LCO 4.4.1 has been modified to clarify the time permitted to reset trip setpoints per the detector decalibration curve, Figure 3.3- 1, for the linear channel -high neutron flux channels following a power reduction. If the linear channel high neutron flux channels are outside their Allowable Values, they must be considered inoperable and the appropriate actions apply. The linear channel -high neutron flux RWP and scram will be available but may not be set properly. The Technical Specifications currently requires a plant shutdown within 12 hours. There are various plant situations where power level is automatically reduced and the applicable Trip Setpoints for the linear channel -high neutron flux channels change. To avoid unnecessary shutdown requirements after control rod runback or power reduction events, the licensee proposes that an action be added to the Technical Specifications that allows 12 hours after a power reduction to regain compliance with Figure 3.3-1 for linear channel -high neutron flux. This added action provides a reasonable period of time to regain compliance, either by adjusting the Trip Setpoints or by changing power level. During this time, the linear channel -high neutron flux RWP and scram, (which may improperly set), and the reheat steam temperature- high scram provide protection against an unexpected increase in power level. The likelihood of a rod withdrawal accident (for which these scram parameters provide protection) is small. The 24 hour orderly shutdown requirement reduces rapid transients on plant components and is consistent with actions included in the Technical Specification Upgrade Program. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of40154 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) 'involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee provided an analysis that addressed the above three standards in the amendment application as follows: The proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station in accordance with this change would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The linear channel -high neutron flux parameters are part of the Plant Protective System (PPS). The primary function of the linear channel -high neutron flux parameters is to provide a scram prior to reactor power exceeding 140% of rated power. Additional protection is provided by a rod withdrawal prohibit prior to reactor power exceeding 120% of rated power. These high neutron flux scram and RWP actions are backed up by the PPS reheat steam temperature -high scram. Section 14.2.2 of the FSAR analyzes accident scenarios that would produce reactor power levels of 140% of rated power. The condition that is most likely to cause an increase in power level of this nature is a rod withdrawal accident. Section 14.2.2.6 analyzes maximum worth control rod pair withdrawal at full power. Included are scenarios where the reactor is scrammed 88 seconds and 105 seconds after accident initiation by the reheat steam temperature -high scram. These accident analyses are not modified by this amendment. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. FSAR Section 14.2.2 contains the analysis of core reactivity accidents. Permitting a reasonable amount of time to regain compliance with Figure 3.3-1 for the linear channel -high neutron flux channels and a reasonable amount of time to shut down the reactor in an orderly manner does not change that analysis. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety against an increase in reactivity accident is provided by five protective actions identified in FSAR Section 14.2.2.1. This amendment clarifies the time that is available to regain compliance with Figure 3.3-1 for two of these protective actions following a power reduction that changes the applicable trip setpionts for the linear channels. Any reduction of safety during this time is not significant in that all five protective actions are available. (The RWP and scram for the linear channels may be improperly set on an interim bases.) The effectiveness of the other three protective actions is analyzed in FSAR Section 14.2.2.6. The other protective actions include reheat steam temperature -high scram, manual scram, and manual actuation of the reserve shutdown system. In this requested revision to LCO 4.4.1 for the power reduction situation, 12 hours would be permitted to ensure proper trip setpoints for the linear channel -high neutron fluxchannels. This could include either adjusting the trip setpoints for the lower power level, or increasing reactor power, if appropriate, Also, 24 hours would be permitted to effect an orderly shutdown of the reactor in the unlikely event that compliance with Figure 3.3-1 could not be regained. Interim Technical Specification LCO 3.1.5 permits 4 hours to restore the control rods to an acceptable configuration following a control rod runback. The resetting of the trip setpoints must be done after the control rods are restored to an acceptable configuration. The twelve hours includes time to position the control rods to conform to the requirements of interim Technical Specification LCO 3.1.5. PSC considers this change to LCO 4A.1 justified because adequate protective actions remain in place and a rod withdrawal accident is a-low probability event. During the interval in which the high neutron flux scram trip setpoint may not be in compliance with Figure 3.3-1, the reheat steam temperature -high scram would be available to protect against an unexpected increase in reactor power. The RWP and scram due to high neutron flux would be available but mat not actuate by the 120% or 140% analyzed values. The manual scram is also available in addition to the automatic scram and RWP actions. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerations determination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards determination.

The changes include deletion of the organizational charts from the Technical Specifications as per Generic Letter 88-06 dated March 22, 1988. AC 7.1.1 is reformatted to better conform with the Standard Technical Specifications (based on Westinghouse plants). AC 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2 have changes made to position titles reflecting a recent reorganization at Fort St. Vrain. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has providedstandards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee provided an analysis that addressed the above three standards in the amendment application as follows: A. Specification AC'7.1.1 is revised as follows: Section 1, \"RESPONSIBILITY,\" was added delegating control room command responsibility and corporate responsibility for overallnuclear plant safety. This section directly correlates to Section 6.1 of the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications (STS), NUREG-0452. Section 2.a, \"Onsite and Offsite Organization,\" was added to provide a directive for the establishment and definition of lines of authority, responsibility, and communication for onsite and offsite organizations. This section directly correlates to Section 6.2.1 of the STS, as amended by Generic Letter 88-06 for deletion of the organization charts from the Technical Specifications (Tech. Specs.). Section 2.b(1) designates on-duty shift minimum shift crew composition per Table 7.1-1. This section follows the guidelines of Generic Letter 68-06, and incorporates the requirements of Generic Letter 88-06, and incorporates the requirements of current Section 2.a. Section 2.b(2,3,4) discuss licensed operator on-shift requirements. These sections are added to conform to the formatting effort of this amendment; and include part of the current clarification text following Table 7.1-1 and the requirements of current Section 2.b. Sections 2.b(5,6,7,8,9) are reformatting and editorial corrections, which incorporate the requirements of current Sections 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.i, and the position titles of the Fort St. Vrain (FSV) reorganization, Section 2.b(10) was added to delineate those requiring a Senior Reactor Operator's (SRO) license and those requiring a Reactor Operator's (R) license; and follows the guidelines of Generic Letter 88-08. Section 2.b(11) discusses shift crew composition and incorporates the requirements of the current final clarification paragraph following Table 7.1-1, which were not included in proposed Sections 2.b(2,3A). Section 2.b(12) was added to delineate control room command responsibility in the absence of the Shift Supervisor, and further expounds on proposed Section 1.b.Table 7.1-1 was relocated within Specification AC 7.1.1. The table retains the same requirements as the current Table 7.1-1.I46155I 46155 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices However, the page is reformatted to include the applicable notes. Section 3, \"TECHNICAL ADVISORS,\" is a reformatting addition. This section incorporates the requirements of current Section 1.c and 2.f, with position titles per the FSV reorganization. Section 4, \"UNIT STAFF QUALIFICATIONS,\" is a reformatting addition and incorporates the requirements of current Sections 2.g and 2.h. \"upon commencement of commercial operation\" is deleted since this stipulation is not necessary. Section 5, \"TRAINING,\" reformats and incorporates the requirements of current Section 3. \"Compliance with Section 5.5 of ANSI 18.1-1971 shall be achieved no later than 6 months following commencement of commercial operation\" is deleted since this stipulation is not necessary. B. Specification AC 7.1.2 is revised as follows: Section 1, Plant Operations Review Committee (PORC) Membership, is revised to incorporate position titles of the FSV reorganization. No expertise is deleted from the PORC. and the positions meet the description of ANSI N18.1. Sections 5.a, 5.3, 6.d and 7 contain a position title change only. Responsibility and expertise remain the same. Sections 3,4,9, and 10 contain position title change only. Responsibility and expertise remain the same. Section 5.k, relative to PORC review of every unplanned onsite release of radioactive material to the environs, is deleted. This requirement is considered' to be adequately covered in Sections 5.a through 5.g. Also, several recent plant Technical Specifications have been found not to include this requirement: River Bend 1, Grand Gulf 1. Nine Mile Point 2, and Palo Verde 1. Deletion of Section 5.k is also consistent with the Tech. Spec. Upgrade Program draft. C. Specification AC 7.1.3 is revised as follows: Section I contains only formatting changes. Section 2 contains revisions to the Nuclear Facility Safety Committee (NFSC) Membership relative to position titles per the FSV reorganization. The actual membership and areas of responsibility/ expertise remain the same. Sections 3, 4, and 9 contain a position title change only. Responsibility and expertise remain the same. Section 10.a is revised to delete the requirement that each NFSC meeting's minutes be approved within 30 days following each meeting. Section 10.b was added to direct the preliminary approval of the NFSC meeting minutes by the Senior Vice President, Nuclear Operations. It also directs the distribution of the minutes to the NFSC members, and approval of the minutes at the next NFSC meeting. These revisions will ensure that the entire NFSC membership will be given the opportunity to vote on the approval of the minutes of the last NFSC meeting. D. Pages 7.1-20, 7.1-21, 7.1-22 and Pages 7.1-20 and contain Table 7.1-1 and its associated notes and clarificationinformation. All this information is included elsewhere in the proposed amendment. Pages 7.1-22 and 7.1-23 contain the organization charts (Figures 7.1-1 and 7.1-2). These charts are deleted from the Tech. Specs., based on the recommendation of Generic Letter 88-06. E. Specification AC 7.2 is revised as follows: Sections b. and d. contain a position title change only. Responsibility and expertise remain the same. Except as otherwise noted above, this proposed amendment reformats current Administrative Controls Specification 7.1.1 requirements to better conform to STS formatting; deletes organization charts per the guidelines of Generic Letter 88-06; and retitles certain positions in AC 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2 to conform to the FSV reorganization begun May 12,1988. Based on the above, this proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of FSV in accordance with this change would not: involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards consideration determination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

SR 5.2.1, Prestressed Concrete Reactor Vessel (PCRV) and PCRV Penetration Overpressure Surveillance and its basis would be modified. The modifications would require testing of the overpressure protection assembly in accordance with Subsection IGV or IWV of Section XI of the ASME Code. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided guidance for the application of criteria for no significant hazards consideration determination by providing examples of amendments that are considered notlikely to involve a significant hazards consideration (51 FR 7751). These examples include \"Cii) A change that constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the technical specifications, e.g., a more stringent surveillance requirement.\" The proposed change would require the licensee to test the PCRV overpiessure assembly in accordance with the widely accepted ASME code. This constitutes an additional and more stringent restriction that is not currently included in the Technical Specifications and is therefore within the scope of the example cited above. Since the application for amehdment involves proposed changes that are encompassed by an example for which no significant hazards consideration exists, the staff has made a proposed determination that the application involves no significant hazards consideration.

Denver, Colorado 80202 NRC Project Director: lose A. Calvo Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket No. 50-354, Hope Creek Generating Station, Salem County, New Jersey Date of amendment request: September 28, 1988 Description of amendment request:\" This amendment would revise Technical Specification Tables 2.2.1-1, 3.3.2-1, and 3.3.2-2 to replace the footnote created with the issuance of Amendment 8 (restrictions associated with the hydrogen injection test) with the necessary requirements associated with the installation of a permanent Hydrogen Water Chemistry (HWC) System. These changes would permit the operation of an HWC system by creating two separate main steam line background radiation levels and associated trip setpoints while restricting operation to power levels greater than 20% of Rated Thermal Power. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed46156 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 the licensee has reviewed the proposed changes and has concluded as follows that they do not involve a significant hazards consideration: Significant Hazards Analysis Consideration The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications: 1. Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The only accident scenario which takes credit for the MSL high radiation scram and isolation setpoint is the Control Rod Drop Accident (CRDA) as described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 15.4.9. Specifically, the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) are assumed to receive an automatic closure signal at 0.5 seconds after detection of high radiation in the main steam lines and to be fully closed at 5 seconds from the receipt of the closure signal. The MSL radiation monitors are provided to detect a gross failure of the fuel cladding. When high radiation is detected, a trip is initiated to reduce the continued failure of fuel cladding. At the same time, the MSIVs are closed to limit the release of fission products. The trip setting is high enough above background radiation levels to prevent spurious trips yet low enough to promptly detect gross failures in the fuel cladding. NEDO-10527, Supplement 1, \"General Electric Rod Drop Accident Analysis for Large Boiling Water Reactors\" dated July 1972 concluded that the consequences of the CRDA are most severe under Hot Standby conditions. Furthermore, the consequences of the CRDA are increasingly less severe above 10 percent power due to a faster Doppler response and a lower rodworth. Finally and most importantly, this report concluded that above 20 percent power the consequences of the CRDA are minimal. Therefore, the Guidelines (Section 8.2.1 and Table 2-1) indicate that the hydrogen injection system should not be operated below the limiting low power setpoint for the CRDA as discussed in the UFSAR. HCGS UFSAR Section 15.4.9 does not actually specify this low power limit; however. Sections 7.7.1.1.5.4 and 7.7.1.1.5.4.1 do-20% of Rated Thermal Power. This limit is known as the Low Power Setpoint (LPSP) and is contained in Technical Specifications 3/4.1.4.1 (Rod Worth Minimizer) and 3/4.1.4.2.(Rod Sequence Control System). As a result, the MSL radiation monitor setpoint will only be adjusted upward when the hydrogen water chemistry system is operated. HWC system operation is restricted to power levels greater than 20 percent of Rated Thermal Power. This power level differs from the 22 percent of Rated Thermal Power level contained in Amendment 8 forthe hydrogen injection test for two main reasons. First, the hydrogen injection test was only a test, the permanent system is a complete, long-term system with the necessary instrumentation, controls and trips to more accurately control hydrogen injection. Since the HWC system is designed in accordance with the Guidelines and utilizes the experience gained during the hydrogen injection test and from systems installed at other utilities, system operation is. closely and accurately controlled and monitored. Second, the Guidelines specify that injection should occur at the LPSP and does not require an additional margin. The hydrogen injection test added an additional 2% power margin simply to assure that the system was not operated below the LPSP. The permanent HWC system will contain sufficient controls to assure operation above the LPSP. Therefore, operating the HWC system at HCGS with such a setpoint (i.e. 20% of Rated Thermal Power) provides adequate assurance that the consequences of a CRDA are negligible when the system is in operation. Furthermore, in order to assure that the setpoint adjustment process itself does not have any impact on the plant, if a power reduction event occurs so that the reactor power is below 20% of Rated Thermal Power without the required setpoint change, control rod motion will be suspended (except for scrams or other emergency conditions) until the necessary setpoints adjustment is adjusted. This restriction further assures that the possibility of a CRDA occurring while the setpoints are being adjusted is precluded. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not affect the design of any safety related systems and as such do not affect the performance of any safety related functions. The proposed changes do permit the operation of the station with a new system, namely a hydrogen water chemistry system. However, this system has been extensively analyzed by EPRI. approved for use by the NRC (reference the Guidelines and the associated NRC SER on them cited in Item III above), and is in operation at a variety of utilities including the Dresden-2, FitzPatrick and Duane Arnold stations. Attachment 4 [of the licensee's submittal) contains a graphical comparison of the operation of HWC systems at these and other utilities which have utilized the services of General Electric in the design and operation of the hydrogen injection test and hydrogen water chemistry system. The decision to seek a permanent change to the HCGS Technical Specifications is plant specific since a change is necessary only if the increase in the MSL radiation levels does not provide an acceptable margin to the MSL radiation monitor setpoint established without operation of a HWC system. Although the operation of a HWC system introduces hydrogen in the recirculation system, this condition has already beenanalyzed in UFSAR Sections 6.2.5 (Combustible Gas Control System), 10.4.2 (Main Condenser Evacuation System), and 11.3.2.1 (Offgas System). In addition, the level of hydrogen in the offgas system is controlled and monitored in accordance with Technical Specifications 3/4.3.7.11 and 3/4.11.2.6, respectively. PSE&G is evaluating the impact of slightly increased radiation levels in the plant against the equipment qualification criteria for systems and components located in the affected areas. Any changes in qualified life or service will be accounted for in the design/installation of the HWC system and reflected in (on] the plant prior to HWC system operation. With regard to the presence of hydrogen and oxygen in the yard, the two mediums meet the requirements of NPFA 50 and 50A for separation from the facility as discussed in Item 111.3 above [of the licensee's submittal]. UFSAR Section 9.5.1.1.11 has analyzed the presence and storage of combustible materialsin the yard and the HWC hydrogen and oxygen storage facilities do not affect the conclusions reached (other than the incorporation of the storage information in Table 9.5-3). Finally, in following the EPRI Guidelines and addressing the NRC staff requirements in Item III aboe,e, PSE&G concludes that the probability for an explosion, flammable vapor cloud or fire is minimized. Even if such an accident were to occur, there would be no impact of the station due to the separation distance to the storage vessels from safety related structures. Thus the information contained in UFSAR Section 2.2.3.1 is not affected due to the presence of a HWC system. Finally, extensive safety features for the HWC system have been established which provide assurance that the operation of the system at HCGS will not create an unacceptable situation nor adversely impact the operation of any other system. Therefore, since the changes to the Technical Specifications themselves do not affect existing system function nor create a situation which has not been previously analyzed and appropriately designed for, the changes do not create any new or different kinds of accidents than previously evaluated. 3. Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications contain specific requirements regarding their applicability: -Operation of the HWC system is only permitted above 20 percent of Rated Thermal Power. -When the HWC system is in operation the MSL radiation monitor setpoints can be adjusted upward, to levels previously determined during the hydrogen injection test, to account for the increase in the background MSL radiation levels. -Prior to decreasing reactor power to below 20% of Rated Thermal Power, the setpoints must be readjusted to their pre- HWC system operation levels. -If the power level falls below 20% without the setpoint change, control rod motion is suspended (except for scrams or other46157 46158 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices emergency situations) until the setpoint adjustment is made. These requirements will assure that the HWC system is operated safely and with sufficient margin such that spurious MSL isolations are precluded while still assuring that any gross failures in the fuel cladding remain detectable. As discussed in Item IV.1 above [of the licensee's submittal], the CRDA is the only accident which takes credit for the MSL isolation trip function; however, above 20 percent power, the consequences of the CRDA are so minimal that they mny be considered negligible (reference the above cited NEDO report.) Therefore, the change in the Technical Specification setpoint has no significant effect on the margins of safety for this accident scenerio and the restriction regarding suspending control rod motion further assures that during setpoint adjustments, a CRDA is minimized. Finally as discussed in Item 111.8 above [of the licensee's submittal], the increase in background radiation levels has been analyzed and PSE&G has concluded that neither plant personnel nor the health and safety of the public are at risk when operating with the HWC system. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The staff reviewed the licensee's determination that the proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration and agrees with the licensee's analyses. Accordingly, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Conner, Jr., Esquire, Conner and Wetterhahn, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20006 NRC Project Director: Walter R. Butler Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket No. 50-354, Hope Creek Generating Station, Salem County, New Jersey Date of amendment request\" September 28,1988 Description of amendment request. This amendment would revise Technical Specification Table 3.3.7.5-1 to permit actions consistent with Technical Specification 3.6.3 regarding allowable out-of-service times for inoperable primary containment isolation valves and their associated position indication instrumentation. The change would avert the currently required plant shutdown in the event that position indication instrumentation for a primary containment isolation valve in an otherwise isolated penetration is declared inoperable.Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 the licensee has reviewed the proposed changes and has concluded as follows that they do not involve a significant hazards consideration. The proposed change to the HCGS Technical Specifications: (1) Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, As required by Action (a) of Technical Specification 3.6.3, should a primary containment isolation valve be declared inoperable the affected penetration must be isolated. This isolation can be accomplished by either deactivating at least one automatic valve, closing at least one manual valve or installing a blind flange in the affected penetration. Furthermore, the system for which the inoperable valve provides containment isolation must also be declared inoperable and the appropriate Action statements for that system performed. Assuming that the plant can continue to operate under these conditions, the concern which must be addressed as a result of this proposed change is whether or not the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are significantly increased when the-position indication instrumentation for an otherwise inoperable containment isolation valve is permitted to remain inoperable longer than the currently imposed 30 or 7 days, per Action 82(a) and 82(b) of Technical Specification Table 3.3.7.5- 1, respectively. The requirement to isolate the affected penetration due to an inoperable valve establishes containment isolation for that penetration. This action establishes a safe configuration for continued operation assuming of course that the affected system is not required to remain Operable. For those systems which can be isolated without jeopardizing continued safe operation, the need for monitoring containment isolation is no longer necessary as isolation has already been achieved. Therefore, it can be concluded that if the provisions of Technical Specification 3.6.3, Action a.2 or a.3 are in effect: (i) the penetration is in a safe configuration with regards to the provisions for containment isolation -closed, (ii) spurious movement of the valve is precluded by either the lack of power, theneed for local manual operation, or the presence of an installed blind flange, and (iii) administrative controls and surveillance requirements exist to assure continued containment isolation. The current requirements of ACTION 82 of Technical Specification Table 3.3.7.5-1 regarding AOT for primary containment Isolation valve position indication instrumentation serve no purpose with regard to assurance of containment integrity if and only if the associated penetration is isolated pursuant to Technical Specification 3.6.3, Action a.2 or a.3. This function is adequately controlled under the auspices of Technical Specifications 4.6.1.1 and the administrative controls already in place. Consequently, extending the AOT for inoperable position indication in penetrations isolated as described above does not represent an increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident since containment isolation (the accident function of concern) is already achieved and assured. (2) Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not negate the requirement for containment integrity or isolation but simply makes use of the existing Technical Specifications which require such. By (sic) extending the provisions for isolated penetrations to the required actions for associated inoperable position indication simply takes advantage of the physical constraints and administrative controls already imposed. Furthermore, the proposed change does not require any plant modification nor (sic) design change but merely permits a specific case of inoperability to exist while plant operation continues. This condition is well bounded in terms of the extent to which inoperability is permitted. Additionally, the flexibility provided by this proposed change will not result in a change to the operational characteristic of any system or process. The inoperability of primary containment isolation valve position indication instrumentation is already permitted for the currently identified AOT. This change simply extends the AOT as long as other compensating measures are in effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The increase in AOT for an inoperable primary containment isolation valve position indication instrument from either 7 or 30 days to an unlimited time does not decrease the margin of safety since a more restrictive compensating measure is in effect, namely the subject penetration is in the safe configuration with regard to containment isolation provisions -closed. Therefore, the margin of safety remains the same as that permitted by Technical Specification 3.6.3, Action a.2 or a.3. With the penetration in an isolated position and the assurances available that such a position will be maintained, the maximum margin of safety Federal Register./ Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices has been achieved, i.e. the penetration has been placed in the post accident configuration. The length of time that either or both position indication instrumentation channels for either or both containment isolation valves remain inoperable has no bearing on the position of the valves in the subject penetration. Realizing that the information provided by the position indication instrumentation is simply indication only, i.e. no automatic isolation or actuation function results from loss of or change in position indication, further substantiates the proposed change. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The staff reviewed the licensee's determination that the proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration and agrees with the licensee's analyses. Accordingly, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Butler Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Docket No. 50-312, Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, Sacramento County, California Date of amendment request: September 19,1988 as supplemented November 4, 1988. Description of amendment request: The proposed changes would delete the requirement to perform local leak rate tests (LLRT) on containment penetration pipes associated with two systems, high pressure injection and decay heat removal systems. The licensee contends that the penetrations being removed from the LLRT requirements would be filled with water and pressurized to a pressure greater than the maximum containment pressure associated with accident conditions. As a result, these penetrations would not provide a pathway for radioactive contaminants in the containment atmosphere to escape to the environment. The proposed change would also increase the interval between LLRT's from 18 months to a maximum of 24 months. Basis for proposed no significant hazards considLration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsas stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibility of new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment does not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because based on the licensee's evaluation, the containment penetrations being deleted from the LLRT program are not potential release pathways for airborne activity during accident conditions and therefore will not change accident consequences; increasing the LLRT interval from 18 months to 24 months is in accordance with regulatory guidance and is not a significant change in terms of accident consequences; (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because containment penetrations and LLRTs are an integral part of accident evaluations, and the proposed changes do not create new or different accident concerns; (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The -proposed changes are relatively minor changes to the LLRT program. The penetrations being deleted from the LLRT requirements are a small fraction of all containment penetrations and even under worst conditions, radioactive releases through these penetrations would constitute a small fraction of releases from all pathways. Based on the above discussion, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Kaplan, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, 6201 S Street, P. O. Box 15830, Sacramento, California 95813. NRC Project Director. George W. Knighton Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket No. 50-338, North Anna Power Station, Unit No. 1, Louisa County, VirgLnia Date of amendment request: October 19, 1988Description of amendment request: The proposed change involves an amendment in the form of a license condition, to Operating License No. NPF-4 for NA-1. Specifically, the proposed license condition allows a one-time extension of the surveillance test intervals for certain surveillance tests as specified in the NA-I Technical Specifications (TS) for the seventh cycle of operation. NA-1 completed applicable Mode 4, 5 and 6 surveillance tests during the sixth refueling outage which ended on June 29, 1987. It was not considered reasonable to repeat these surveillance tests during the time frame that Unit i was shutdown for steam generator repairs which occurred from July 15, 1987 to October 13, 1987. However, this unplanned outage did serve to impact the surveillance test intervals between the sixth and the forthcoming seventh refueling outages. This delay, together with additional time allowed for an optimum fuel burn-up before the next refueling, has resulted in a deferral of the next refueling outage for NA-1 until April 1989. Currently, NA-1 TS require the performance of certain surveillance tests at 18, 36, and 60 month intervals to coincide with normal 18-month refueling cycles. The proposed change would extend these surveillance test intervals for the NA-1 seventh cycle by 6 months to compensate for several unanticipated outages including the steam generator tube rupture event and to permit optimum fuel burn-up prior to refueling. Use of the allowable extension of the surveillance intervals in accordance with Specification 4.0.2 of the TS would require an extension corresponding to the 3-month unplanned outage. Rather than use the extension allowed by Specification 4.0.2 and request an additional extension, a 6-month extension for the affected surveillance test intervals is requested for the seventh cycle only to preserve the extension allowed by Specification 4.0.2 for future refueling cycles. One-time changes to the surveillance test intervals associated with a plant shutdown or refueling outage as specified in the TS for License Number NPF-4 are requested as follows: (1) The 18-month surveillance test cycle requirement as specified in the following TS sections would be changed to 24 months for the seventh cycle of unit operation only:461546159 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices 4.1.2.2.c 4.9.3.1.b 4.61.3.c 4A3.1.2 4.7.8.1.d 4..1A.b 4.&2..2.f (2) The 18/36-month test cycle requirement as specified in the following TS sections would be changed to 24/49 months for the seventh cycle of unit operation only: 4.3.1.1.3 4.3.2.1.3 (3) The 60-month surveillance test interval requirement as specified in the following TS section would be changed to 66 months for the seventh cycle of unit operation only: 4.8.1.1.3.d (4) Table 1.2 of Section 1.0, Definitions, which defines \"R\" as \"At least once per 18 nonths\" as it applies to the following TS sections and related tables, and the 18-month requirement in the note in the tables indicated below, would be changed to 24 months for the seventh cycle of unit operation only: Section 4.3.1.1.1 4.3.2.1.1 4.3.3.1 4,3.3.3.1 4.3.3.5 4.3.3.6 Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)).

Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Extending the interval for the performance of specific surveillance tests does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. Periodic surveillance tests have been performed since the sixth outage to monitor system and component performance and to detect degradation. Surveillance tests will continue to be performed during the extension interval. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Extending the interval for these specific surveillance tests for the [seventh] cycle of [NA-1] does not significantly degrade the margin of safety. Surveillance tests will continue to be performed during the extension interval.

The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's analyses of the proposed change and agrees with the licensee's conclusion that the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) are met. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Berkow Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia Date of amendment request: July 20, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed change would clarify the current NA-1&2 Technical Specifications (TS) regarding reactor coolant system leakage detection systems. Specifically, the change would clarify the NA-1&2 TS 3.4.6.1 regarding reactor coolant system leakage detection systems and bring the present TS into closer agreement with Regulatory Guide 1A5 and Revision 4 of the Westinghouse Standard TS which Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) is difficult to understand and can be interpreted to require two leakage detection systems to be operable, whereas the associated action statement can be interpreted to require three separate and independent methods to be operable. Regulatory Guide 1.45 requires three separate detection methods of which two of the methods should be: (1) the containment particulate radioactivity monitoring system and (2) the containment sump level and discharge flow measurement system. Regulatory Guide 1.45 also requires a third method which is satisfied by the containment gaseous radioactivity monitoring system. The proposed change would clarify the TS such that the containment particulate and gaseous monitoring system are considered as two separate detection'methods but are not considered as two independent systems. Specifically, the monitors share a common piping system, power supply and piping arrangement that do not make them truly independent. Therefore, the action statement would be modified to achieve consistency with the LCO. Specifically, if either of the two required leakage monitoring systems are inoperable, a compensatory leakage measurement using the RCS water inventory balance method would be specified instead of obtaining grab samples. The current TS does not require a compensatory leakage measurement if the containment sump discharge measurement system is inoperable whereas the revised TS does. This compensatory leakage measurement along with a fully operable leakage detection system is the basis for extending the action statement from 6 hours to 30 days when one leakage detection system is inoperable. The surveillance requirements have also been rewritten to require a periodic calibration of the containment sump level monitor. The proposed TS changes are consistent with the regulatory position of Regulatory Guide 1.45, \"Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary Leakage Detection Systems\" and NUREG-0452, \"Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications.\" Specifically, three separate detection methods are46160 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 /Wednesday;- November 16, 1988 / Notices provided but they are grouped as two separate and redundant detection systems. The loss of a single system would not result in the loss of detection capability. Therefore, regulatory position 9 of Regulatory Guide 1.45 is fully met. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the change request against the standards provided above and has determined that the proposed changes would not: (a) result in a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated, i.e., a loss of coolant accident, because the specification continues to require two redundant and diverse means of continuously monitoring for reactor coolant system leakage. In addition, an operability requirement for the containment sump level monitor has been added to the LCO, and a requirement to implement a compensatory leakage measurement (i.e., inventory mass balance) if either or both of the sump leakage monitors are inoperable has been added to the Action Statement. Finally, the requirement to obtain and analyze appropriate containment grab samples if one of the radioactivity monitors is inoperable has been replaced with a requirement to perform a compensatory leakage measurement using the mass balance method. This method is considered equivalent to the grab sample method in terms of leakage detection sensitivity and therefore will provide the same level of protection as previously provided. (b) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. The additional required reactor coolant system leakage monitor (i.e., sump level) is already required by the related [TSJ 3/4.4.6.2 regarding reactor coolant system leakage limits (see [ITS] 4.4.6.7.lb) and therefore does not introduce any new or unique accident precursors. Similarly, the additional required compensatory leakage measurement (i.e., inventory mass balance) is a test that is routinely performed in accordance with [TS] 4.4.6.2.1d and existing station period test procedures, and therefore does not create any new or unique accident precursors. (c) result in a significant reduction in the margins of safety as defined in the bases for any [TS] because the proposed [TS continue to require two redundant and diverse meansof leakage monitoring as well as a compensatory leakage measurement every 24 hours if either of the two required leakage monitoring systems is inoperable, and therefore the [TS] Bases and the recommendations of Regulatory Guide 1.45 (regulatory position 9 regarding [TS]) continue to be satisfied. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's analyses of the proposed change and agrees with the licensee's conclusion that the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) are met. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Berkow Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North Anna Power Station, Units No. I and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia Date of amendment request. September 30, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed change would support full power operation for NA-1&2 at steam generator (SG) tube plugging levels of up to 18%. The results of the analysis supporting the increase in SG tube plugging limits also support a new maximum core peaking factor (FQ) of 2.19. To support the proposed change a reanalysis of the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) performance for the postulated large-break loss-of- coolant accident (LOCA) has been performed in compliance with Appendix K to 10 CFR Part 50. The results of the reanalysis are presented in compliance with 10 CFR 50.46, \"Acceptance Criteria for Emergency Core Cooling Systems for Light Water Reactors.\" The analysis was performed with the NRC-approved 1981 model with BART version of the Westinghouse LOCA-ECCS evaluation model. The analysis includes the evaluation model revisions described in WCAP-9561-P, Addendum 3, Revision 1. \"Addendum to BART-Al: A Computer Code for the Best Estimate Analysis of Reload Transients,\" dated July 1986 and approved by NRC letter dated August 25, 1986. The analytical techniques used are in full compliance with 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix K. As required by Appendix K of 10 CFR Part 50, certain conservative assumptions were made for the LOCA- ECCS analysis. The assumptions pertain to the conditions of the NA-1&2 reactorsand associated safety system equipment at the time that the LOCA is assumed to occur. These assumptions include such items as the core peaking factors, the containment pressure, and the performance of the ECCS. All assumptions and initial operating conditions used in this reanalysis were the same as those used in previous LOCA-ECCS analyses, with two exceptions. The steam generator plugging level was increased to 18% (from 7% and 15%) and the maximum core peaking factor, FQ, was increased from 2.15 to 2.19. With these changes incorporated into the analysis, it was found that the LOCA analysis results continue to meet the 10 CFR 50.46 acceptance criteria. The large-break LOCA transient is divided, for analytical purposes, into three phases: blowdown, refill, and reflood. There are three distinct transients analyzed in each phase, including the thermal-hydraulic transient in the reactor coolant system, the pressure and temperature transient within the containment and the fuel clad temperature transient of the hottest fuel rod in the core. Based on these considerations, a system of interrelated computer codes were used for the analysis. The description of the various aspects of the LOCA analysis methodology is provided in WCAP-8339, \"Westinghouse ECCS Evaluation Model-Summary,\" dated July 1974. This document describes the major phenomena modeled, the interfaces among the computer codes, and the features of codes that ensure compliance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix K. The SATAN- VI, COCO, WREFLOOD, BART, and LOCTA-IV codes, which are used in the LOCA analysis, are described in detail in WCAP-8306, WCAP-8326, WCAP- 8171, WCAP-9695, WCAP-10062 and WCAP-8305, respectively. These codes assess whether sufficient heat transfer geometry and core amenability to cooling are preserved during the time spans applicable to the blowdcwn, refill, and reflood phases of the LOCA. The SATAN-VI computer code analyzes the thermal-hydraulic transient in the reactor coolant system (RCS) during blowdown, and the COCO computer code calculates the containment pressure transient during all three phases of the LOCA analysis. The thermal-hydraulic response of the RCS during refill and reflood is calculated by the WREFLOOD computer code. A mechanistic estimate of the heat transfer coefficient in the core during reflood is provided by the BART computer code. For the three phases of the LOCA, the46161 Federal Register / Val. 53, No. 221 /Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices LOCTA-IV computer code is used to compute the thermal transient of the hottest fuel rod. SATAN-VI is used to determine the RCS pressure, enthalpy, and density, as well as the mass and energy flow rates in the RCS and steam-generator secondary side, as a function of time during the blowdown phase of the LOCA. SATAN-VI also calculates the accumulator mass and pressure and the pipe break mass and energy flow rates that are assumed to be vented to the containment during blowdown. At the end of the blowdown, the mass and energy release rates during blowdown are transferred to the COCO code for use in the determination of the containment pressure response during the first phase of the LOCA. Additional SATAN-VI output data from the end of the blowdown, including the core inlet flowrate and enthalpy, the core pressure, and the core power decay transient, are input to the LOCTA-IV code. With input from the SATAN-VI code, WREFLOOD uses a system thermal- hydraulic model to determine the core flooding rate (i.e., the rate at which coolant enters the bottom of the core), the coolant pressure and temperature, and the quench front height during the refill and reflood phases of the LOCA. WREFLOOD also calculates the mass and energy flow rates that are assumed to be vented to the containment. Since the mass flowrate to the containment depends upon the core pressure, which is a function of the containment backpressure, the WREFLOOD and COCO codes are interactively linked. With the input and boundary conditions from WREFLOOD, the mechanistic core heat transfer model in BART calculates the fluid and heat transfer conditions in the core during reflood. LOCTA-IV is used throughout the analysis of the LOCA transient to calculate the fuel and clad temperatures of the hottest rod in the core. The input to LOCTA-IV consists of appropriate thermal-hydraulic outputs from SATAN- VI, WREFLOOD and BART, and conservatively selected initial RCS operating conditions. The COCO code, which is also used throughout the LOCA analysis, calculates the containment pressure. Input to COCO is obtained from the mass and energy flowrates assumed to be vented to the containment, as calculated by the SATAN-VI and WREFLOOD codes. In addition, conservatively chosen initial containment conditions and an assumed mode of operation for the containment cooling system are input to COCO.The NA-1&2 LOCA-ECCS reanalysis has evaluated plant operation at SG tube plugging levels of up to 18% based on the acceptance criteria delineated in 10 CFR 50.46. The evaluation concluded that reanalysis of non-LOCA accidents is not required to support this increased tube plugging level provided the measured RCS flow rate remains above the thermal design flow rate assumed for the safety analyses. SG tube plugging in sufficient quantity can potentially affect non-LOCA safety analysis due to reduced primary system flow, more severe pump coastdown characteristics, and the reduction of the reactor primary coolant system volume. Primary flowrate becomes a key parameter in the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) limited events (e.g., uncontrolled RCCA bank withdrawal at power) when it falls below the thermal design flowrate. Pump coastdown characteristics impact analysis results when they become more severe than the conservative values used in the loss-of- flow related analyses. The reduced primary coolant system volume affects dilution times in uncontrolled boron dilution events. A conservative estimate of the NA- 1&2 RCS flow versus tube plugging is based on past flow measurements taken at NA-1&2 for several levels of steam generator tube plugging. More recent NA-1 measurements at greater tube plugging levels validate the conservatism of RCS flow versus tube plugging curve. A re-evaluation of the projection indicates that the conservatively estimated flow rate at the proposed 18% plugging level is approximately equal to the North Anna thermal design flow. Therefore, while measured flow exceeds the thermal design flow, the current docketed licensing analyses remain valid for those events in which flow rate is an important concern. The impact of 18% tube plugging on dilution times in the uncontrolled boron dilution events was also evaluated. Relative to the boron dilution events, the evaluation indicated: (1) for uncontrolled dilution during startup, time to criticality is 37 minutes. This is more than adequate time for the operator to recognize the high count rate signal and terminate the dilution flow, and (2) for uncontrolled dilution at power, the operator has ample time (greater than 15 minutes) after the over- temperature delta T alarm or trip to determine the cause of dilution, isolate the water source, and initiate reboration before total shutdown margin is lost due to dilution.Tube plugging levels exhibit no influence on dilution times for the refueling mode of operation, since the SC volumes are not a part of the active system. The evaluation shows that for SG tube plugging levels of up to 18 percent, no reanalysis of the DNBR related non-LOCA safety events is necessary and that the currently licensed analyses remain valid. In the case of the uncontrolled boron dilution events, the available operator response times for the startup and at power evaluations are reduced but remain well above the minimum acceptance values. Based on the large break LOCA analysis, a double-ended cold-leg guillotine break with a discharge coefficient (CD) of 0.4 was found to be the limiting break size and location. The analysis resulted in a limiting peak clad temperature of 2165.2\u00b0 F for the C0 = 0.4 case, a maximum local cladding oxidation level of 5.77%, and a total core metal-water reaction of less than 0.3%. For breaks up to and including the double-ended rupture of a reactor coolant pipe, the ECCS will meet the acceptance criteria as presented in 10 CFR 50.46, as follows: (1) the calculated peak fuel rod clad temperature is below the requirement of 2200* F, (2) the amount of fuel element cladding that reacts chemically with water or steam does not exceed 1% of the total amount of Zircaloy in the reactor, (3) .the clad temperature transient is terminated at a time when the core geometry is still amenable to cooling. The localized cladding oxidation limits of 17% are not exceeded during or after quenching, (4) the core remains amenable to cooling during and after the break, and (5) the core temperature is reduced and the long-term decay heat is removed for an extended period of time. The effects of increasing the allowable steam generator tube plugging to 18% has been assessed for existing non-LOCA event analyses. This evaluation has concluded: (1) current analyses for which RCS flow is an important concern remain valid as long as measured flow is greater than the thermal design flow assumed in safety analyses, (2) the existing loss-of-flow related analyses assume a conservative reactor coolant pump flow coastdown characteristic which accommodates the effect of increased tube plugging on loop flow resistance, and (3) boron dilution analyses assuming the reduced RCS volume associated with tube plugging result in dilution times which remain adequate for the required operator actions to be performed. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination,46162 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the change request against the standards provided above and has determined that: 1. Since the proposed changes involve parameters which are not accident initiators, they will not increase the probability of occurrence of any malfunction or accident previously addressed. The reanalyzed large break LOCA analysis verifies that operation under the revised specifications would also not result in any increase in accident consequences over those in previously accepted analyses. 2. No new accident types or equipment malfunction scenarios will be introduced as a result of operating in accordance with the revised specifications. The change which potentially affects physical components in the plant systems (steam generator tube plugging) was explicitly included in the analysis and shown not to produce any new or unique accident precursors. a. The margin of safety, as defined in the basis for the plant Technical Specifications, is not reduced. The revised ECCS analysis meets the acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.48. Additionally, since evaluation of non-LOCA accidents concluded that acceptance criteria are met when considering the proposed changes, the current margin of safety is maintained for LOCA and non-LOCA accidents. Based on the above evaluation, the licensee has determined that the proposed change involves no significant hazards considerations. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's analyses of the proposed change and agrees with the licensee's conclusion that the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) are met. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Maupin, Esq., Hunton and P.O. Box Richmond, Virginia 23212. NRC Project Director: Herbert N. BerkowVirginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North Anna Power Station, Units No. I and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia Dote of amendment request: September 30,1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed change would increase the allowable enrichment of fuel assemblies irradiated-at NA-1&2 to 4.3 weight percent (w/o) U-235. An increase in the current NA-1&2 Technical Specifications (TS) limit of 4.1 w/o U- 235 to 4.3 w/o U-235 would allow an increase in batch average discharge burnup to levels approaching the currently licensed limit of 45,000 Mega- Watt Days per Metric Ton Uranium (MWD/MTU). The enrichments currently used limit the batch average bumup to a value from 38,000 MWD/ MTU to 42,000 MWD/MTU depending on the number of fuel assemblies loaded each cycle. An increase in the enrichment limit would result in significant fuel cycle cost savings and enhance fuel management plans to increase batch average discharge burnups. The safety impact for operation of NA-1&2 with high burnup fuel was previously addressed by the licensee in letters to the NRC dated December 4, 1980, March 6 and 26, 1981 and July 24, 1981. By letter dated April 9,1984, the NRC approved operation of NA-1&2 to a batch of discharge of 45,000 MWD/ MTU. A generic impact of extended burnup on the design and operation of Westinghouse fuel was addressed in WCAP-10125-P-A, \"Extended Burnup Evaluation of Westinghouse Fuel,\" dated December 1985. In addition, the NRC made an independent assessment of the environmental and economic impacts of the use of extended burnup fuel in light water power reactors. This assessment was dated February 1988 and entitled \"Assessment of the Use of Extended Burnup Fuel in Light Water Power Reactors,\" Pacific Northwest Laboratory, NUREG/CR-3009. The overall findings of NUREG/CR-3009 were that no significant adverse effects would be generated by increasing the present batch-average burnup level to values of 50,000 MWD/MTU or above, as long as the maximum rod average burnup of any rod is no greater than 60,000 MWD/MTU. Since the findings of these evaluations provided in NUREG/ CR-3009 concerning the impact of extended burnup fuel are valid for an enrichment of 4.3 w/o U-235, and since the NA-1&2 spent fuel storage facility is currently licensed to 4.3 w/o U-235, the license's submittal addresses only the impact of increased enrichment on therequirements for the currently approved new fuel storage racks at NA-1&2. The specific 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix A General Design Criteria for new fuel storage facilities are listed in Section 9.1.1 of the Standard Review Plan (NUREG-0800). Since no physical modifications are being made to the current NA-1&2 new fuel racks, the licensee's analysis only addresses the impact of the increased enrichment on the requirement of subcriticality under normal and postulated abnormal rack conditions (General Design Criterion 62). The highest K-effective allowable by Section 9.1.1 of NUREG-0800 for all conditions is 0.98. The computer modeling of the storage racks was performed in three- dimensions (3-D) to minimize unnecessary conservatism and uncertainty. All K-effective calculations were performed with the Monte-Carlo program KENO V.a and contained within the modular code system SCALE. KENO V.a is addressed in ORNL- NUREG-CSD-2-VI-R2 entitled \"KENO V.a, An Improved Monte Carlo Criticality Program with Supergrouping,\" dated December 1984. SCALE is addressed in ORNL-NUREG-CSD-2-VI- R3, \"SCALE: A Modular Code System for Performing Standardized Computer Analysis for Licensing Evaluation,\" dated December 1984. The SCALE package automatically processes cross sections to create a set of resonance self shielded cross sections for use by KENO. Because all calculations for this analysis were made using a discrete pin representation, no spatial self shielding was performed prior to the KENO execution. The cross section set chosen was the 27 group ENDF/B-IV data contained in the SCALE package. Sufficient neutron histories were run for each case to limit the statistical uncertainties in the K-effective to less than 0.4% delta K/K. The results of the licensee's analysis indicate that for a fuel enrichment of 4.3 w/o U-235, the NA-1&2 fuel storage area meets the criticality limit of K-effective less than 0.98 and is safe under the criticality specifications set forth in the NRC Standard Review Plan (NUREG- 0800). Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining Whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a46163 Federal Register / Vol. 53; No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of NA-1&2 in accordance with the proposed change would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated. The only accident scenarios for which the probability of occurrence are potentially affected by fuel enrichments involve criticality events during fuel handling and storage. The criticality safety analyses demonstrates that K-effective during fuel handling and storage of new fuel is low enough to ensure subcriticality during postulated accident conditions. The probability of occurrence of criticality during fuel handling or storage is therefore not increased. Since subcriticality is maintained, no releases would result from the fuel handling and storage accident scenarios. In addition, since the burnup limit will not be increased beyond that already approved in NRC letter dated April 9,1984, the radiological consequences of the accidents discussed in WCAP-10125-P-A and NUREG/CR-3009 will not be increased. 2. The proposed amendments do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The only potential impact of increased enrichment upon fuel storage and handling involves the potential for criticality and the licensee's analyses that has determined that subcriticality will be maintained. 3. The proposed amendments do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The criticality analysis demonstrates that there is adequate margin to ensure subcriticality of the fuel during storage and handling of new fuel. The NRC safety analysis provided in a letter dated December 21, 1984, provides the same assurance for spent fuel. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, based on the above considerations, it has been determined that these changes do not constitute a significant safety .hazards consideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the proposed change and concludes that the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) are met. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration.Local Public Document Room location: The Alderman Library, Manuscripts Department, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22901. Attorney for licensee: Michael W. Maupin, Esq., Hunton and P.O. Box Richmond, Virginia 23212. NRC Project Director: Herbert N. Berkow Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia Date of amendment request: September 30, 1988 Description of amendment request: The proposed change would allow the direct reactor trip on turbine trip to be blocked below 30% of the rated thermal power. Currently, Permissive Setpoint P- 7 is used to block the reactor trip on turbine trip below 10% of rated thermal power. The proposed modification would rewire the Solid State Protection System so that Permissive Setpoint P-8 is used to block the reactor trip on turbine trip below 30% power. A licensee review of historical trip data shows that the most commonly occurring reactor trip on turbine trip events are well below 30% of rated thermal power. Thus, it was concluded that the use of the existing P-8 bistable to block the direct reactor trip on turbine trip would be an effective means of reducing unneeded trips at low power. Direct reactor trip on turbine trip would be available above 30% power. The plant's designed load rejection capability is 50% of full load. At present, for all power levels above 10% (the P-7 permissive setpoint) of Rated Thermal Power (RTP), the NA-1&2 nuclear reactors are tripped directly on turbine trip from a signal derived from the turbine autostop oil pressure or' turbine stop valve position. A direct reactor/turbine trip at low power is unnecessary and unduly stresses plant * systems. Thus, the licensee is proposing a change which would allow for a block of the direct reactor trip on turbine trip below 30% of rated thermal power. The proposed modification would rewire the Solid State Protection System so that Permissive P-8 is also used to block the reactor trip on turbine trip instead of Permissive P-7. It was concluded that the use of the existing P- 8 bistable to block the direct reactor trip on turbine trip would be an effective means of eliminating unneeded low power transient reactor trips. Direct reactor trip on turbine trip would still be available above 30% power. Three items were considered in the licensee's safety analysis and were addressed in the licensee's submittal.(1) The results of the worst-case analyses show that a total loss of external electrical load without a direct or immediate reactor trip below 30% of RTP presents no hazards to the integrity of the reactor coolant system or the main steam system. Pressure-relieving devices incorporated in the two systems are adequate to keep the maximum pressure within the design limits. The licensee concluded that the results of this analysis demonstrates that plant parameters are maintained within the design limits previously analyzed for the loss-of-load accident from full power described in Section 15.2.7 of the NA- 1&2 Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). (2) An analysis was also performed for a complete loss of forced reactor coolant flow initiated from the most adverse preconditions of a turbine trip, and demonstrated that the integrity of the core is maintained by operation of the reactor protection system, i.e., the DNBR will be maintained above the design limit value. Thus, there will be no cladding damage and no release of fission products to the reactor coolant system. The licensee concluded that plant parameters are maintained within design limits and that this analysis is bounded by the results of a complete loss of flow from full power as described in Section 15.3.4 of the UFSAR. (3) Finally, an analysis was conducted to verify that the applicable NUREG- 0737 requirements were met. NUREG- 0737 required that the frequency of a small break loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA) caused by a stuck-open pressurizer power operated relief valve (PORV) be reduced and that it be demonstrated not to be a significant contributor to the probability of a small break LOCA. Both the loss-of-load and the loss-of-flow accidents have the potential of causing the PORV to open. The licensee has conducted an analysis which demonstrates that -the PORVs are not normally challenged during this event and thus the NUREG-0737 requirements are met. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment to an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of on accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from.. .....III .. .. .. .... ... . 46164 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 ] Notices any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the change request against the standards provided above and has determined that:1. No significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident analyzed in the UFSAR will result from elimination of reactor trip on turbine trip below 30% of Rated Thermal Power (RTP). The analyses results show that the DNBR does not decrease below the design limit at any time. The analysis also shows that, except under [most] conservative assumptions, the pressurizer PORVs are not challenged during the transient. Pressure- relieving devices incorporated in the primary and the secondary systems are adequate to keep the maximum pressure within the design limit. Since the predicted results are within the range of existing safety analysis values, it is concluded that operation with the proposed Technical Specification changes will neither significantly increase the probability of occurrence nor the consequences of initiating events for any known accident.2. No new or different accident type not previously considered in the UFSAR is created by this proposed change. The complete loss of unit load without a direct reactor trip on turbine trip is a design event and is addressed in Section 15.2.7 of the UFSAR. The results for a loss of flow due to fast bus transfer failure after a turbine trip are bounded by the results for a complete loss of flow from full power, which is discussed in Section 15.3.4 of the UFSAR. Thus, the results of all the relevant accident analyses show that operation with this modification does not create a new or different accident type than any evaluated previously in the UFSAR. 13. The margin of safety is not reduced. The proposed Technical Specification changes have been incorporated in the safety analyses. These analyses have demonstrated that calculated results meet all design acceptance criteria as stated in the UFSAR. Based on the above evaluation, the licensee has determined that the proposed change involves no significant hazards considerations. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's analyses of the proposed change and agrees with the licensee's conclusion that the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) are met. Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendments do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

BerkowWisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-266 and 50-301, Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. land 2, Town of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin Date of amendments request: January 0, 1987 as supplemented April 14 and May 15, 1987. Description of amendments request: The licensee proposes to change Technical Specification Table 15.4.1-1, \"Minimum Frequencies for Checks, Calibrations and Tests of Instrument Channels,\" to increase the period of the logic channel test of the reactor trip on low reactor coolant flow in both loops from monthly to each (annual) refueling outage. Basis for proposed no significint hazards consideration determination: The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a no significant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In 51 FR 7751, the Commission cited examples of amendments that are considered not likely to involve significant hazards considerations. Example (vi) involves a change which may either result in some increase to the probability or consequences of a previously-analyzed accident or may reduce in some way a safety margin, but where the results of the change are clearly within all acceptable criteria with respect to the system or component specified in the Standard Review Plan. The amendment proposed by the licensee would increase the logic testing period on the two-loop reactor coolant loss of flow reactor trip from monthly to every refueling outage (currently annually). However, the surveillance frequency for the logic channel test of the relays/contacts which initiate the reactor trip on low reactor Coolant flow in either loop will remain monthly. Since all bistables and relay coils will still be tested monthly, the net effect of the proposed amendment would be'to \" slightly increase the risk of failing to get a reactor trip upon simultaneous detection of low reactor coolant flow in both loops, due to failure of both of the specific relay contacts which initiate the trip during the increased period betweensurveillances. Although a numerical quantification of the increase in risk has not been performed, the staff believes that it would be quite small since the event of concern would require two contact failures (one in each loop) between refueling outages and a loss of flow condition occurring while the reactor is between 10% and 50% power. Section 7.2 of the Standard Review Plan discusses various aspects of the Reactor Trip System. Section 7.2 references Regulatory Guide 1.22, \"Periodic Testing of Protection System Actuation Functions.\" Regulatory Guide 1.22 provides for acceptable methods of testing protection systems during reactor operation. In its May 15, 1987 letter, the licensee states that all actuation devices and all actuated devices which are part of the reactor trip logic for loss of flow in both loops are tested in accordance with the guidance contained in Safety Guide 1.22 (Safety Guide 1.22 and Regulatory Guide 1.22 are identical). Therefore, the proposed change is in conformance with guidance endorsed by the Standard Review Plan. Local Public Document Room location: Joseph P.

NOTICE OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATING LICENSE AND FINAL DETERMINATION OF NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING (EXIGENT OR EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES) During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter 1, which are set forth in the license amendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a Federal Register notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, using its best efforts to make46170 ' Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices 4 available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee has been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 LStreet, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director, Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendments. By December 16, 1988, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's \"Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings\" in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitionershall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contention set forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-0700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the following message addressed to (Project Director): petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the46171 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)- (v) and 2.714(d).

Boger, Director, Division of Reactor Projects-l/l, Office of NuclearReactor Regulation 88-26331 [Docket No. 50-1551 Consumers Power Co.; Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 93 to Facility Operating License No. DPR-6, issued to Consumers Power Company (the licensee), which revised the Technical Specifications (TSs) for operation of the Big Rock Point Plant (the facility), located in Charlevoix County, Michigan. The amendment became effective on October 14, 1988.This amendment modifies the TSs by replacing the requirements to partial- stroke test the Reactor Depressurization System depressurizing valves quarterly with a requirement to full-stroke test all four depressurizing valves each refueling outage. The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings, as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter 1, which are set forth in the license amendment. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the Federal Register on August 23, 1988 (53 FR 32123). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice. Also in connection with this action, the Commission issued an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact.

The license authorizes the licensee to operate the Crystal River facility in accordance with the conditions specified therein. II An NRC inspection of the licensee's activities under the license was conducted on November 30-December 4, 1987. The results of this inspection indicated that the licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was served upon the licensee by letter dated May 4, 1988. The Notice stated that nature of the violation, the provision of the NRC's requirements that the licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violation. The licensee responded to the Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty by letter dated June 2,1988. In its response, the licensee admits the violation and does not take issue with the Severity Level, but requests mitigation of the civil penalty on the basis that the mitigation factors in 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, Section V.B. were not appropriately applied in assessing the penalty. After consideration of the licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanations, and argument for mitigation contained therein, the Deputy Executive Director for Regional Operations has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the original penalty proposed for the violation designated in the Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty should be mitigated by 50 percent. IV In view of the foregoing and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2282, Pub. L 96-295) and 10 CFR 2.205, it is hereby ordered that: The licensee pay a civil penalty in the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) within 30 days of the date of this Order, by check, draft, or money order, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555.46172 Federal.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of the hearing. If the licensee fails to request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order, the provisions to this Order shall be effective without further proceedings. If payment has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for collection. In the event the licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be: Whether on the basis of the violations set forth in the Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty referenced in Section II above, which the licensee has admitted, this Order should be sustained. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James M. Taylor, Deputy Executive Director for Operations. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 31st day of October 1988. Appendix-Evaluation and conclusion On May 4, 1988 a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for violations identified during an NRC inspection. Florida Power Corporation responded to the Notice on June 2,1988. The licensee admits the violation, but requests mitigation of the civil penalty. Restatement of Violation 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Cirterion XVI, requires measures be established to assure that conditions adverse to quality, such as failures, malfunctions, deficiencies, deviations, defective materials and equipment. and non-conformances are promptly identified and corrected. Contrary to the above, from May 1980 until October 1987, the licensee failed to assure that a condition adverse to quality, namely, a potentially overloaded emergency diesel generator (EDG), was promptly identified and corrected. Specifically: (a) The load on EDG/ A, for certain design basis events, would have been approximately 3545 kw which is above the manufacturer's published 30- minute rating of 3300 kw; (b) on several occasions, the licensee performed the 18- month surveillance testing of both A and B diesel generators with loads above the 3000 kw rating, and the licensee failed to identify and perform, after each such run, themanufacturer's recommended inspection of certain critical components; and (c) the licensee had not identified that surveillance testing was performed at a maximum of 3100 kw even though the worst case design basis accident load given in the Final Safety Analysis Report is 3180 kw. Summary of Licensee's Response Florida Power Corporation (FPC) admits that the violation occurred and does not take issue with its Severity Level. However, FPC requests mitigation of the civil penalty on the basis that the mitigation factors in 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, Section V.B., were not appropriately applied in assessing the penalty. Its arguments in support of mitigation are that its corrective actions were timely and aggressive, that it identified the ,violation, and that proper credit was not given for its Configuration Management Program. NRC Evaluation Under the NRC's Enforcement Policy, in effect at the time of the violation was identified, reductions of up to 50% of the base civil penalty may be given when a licensee identifies the violation and promptly reports it to the NRC. In weighing this factor, consideration will be given to, among other things, the length of time the violation existed prior to discovery, the opportunity available to discover the violation, the ease of discovery and the promptness and completeness of any required report. In addition, the staff gives credit for effective comprehensive licensee programs for detection of problems that may constitute, or lead to violation of regulatory requirements. With respect to the problem as described in the NOV, the staff credits the licensee with identifying the problem. The staff recognizes that the problem existed for approximately seven years as a result of a fundamental error that was incorporated at the time of a design modification (January 1980), but notes that there was not a reasonable opportunity to discover the problem prior to the time when the licensee began a detailed review of the EDG loading in June 1987. The staff has reconsidered the complexity of the problem as it related to the length of time that it took the licensee to fully realize and understand the extent of the problem, and the promptness and completeness with which the licensee submitted the required reports, While the licensee argues that mitigation for identification is appropriate based on their comprehensive Configuration Management Program (CMP), the NRC notes that in the case of this violation, the problem was not discovered from the CMP, but rather while determining the setting for an emergency diesel generator directional power relay which was being added to correct problems disclosed during an event described in LER 84-003-00. Nevertheless, the staff has concluded to mitigate the original civil penalty by 50% for this factor. Mitigation of 50% may also be given for corrective actions which are unusually prompt and extensive. On the other hand, the civil penalty may be increased by as much as 50% if initiation of corrective action is not prompt or if the corrective action is onlyminimally acceptable. In weighing this factor, consideration will be given to, among other things, the timeliness of the corrective action, degree of licensee initiative, and the comprehensiveness of the corrective action- such as whether the action Is focused narrowly to the specific violation or broadly to the general area of concern. Although the special testing which was conducted to empirically confirm the loading calculations was an important part of the licensee's corrective action, the performance of these tests was only done at the insistence of the NRC to support the licensee's request for an exemption from the requirements of GDC-17, Furthermore, which the'licensee is complying with the terms of the exemption, the licensee has not yet implemented the long-term solution to bring the facility into compliance with GDC-17. As noted in the staff's NOV, the CMP represents a positive commitment to programmatic configuration enhancement; however, weaknesses still exist and need to be remedied in your planned efforts to improve the effectiveness of the CMP for prompt corrective action in the resolution of design problems. Therefore, based on a review of the above considerations for the factor of corrective actions, the base amount was not mitigated or escalated. NRC Conclusion For reasons set forth herein, the NRC Staff has concluded that the licensee has provided an adequate basis for mitigation of the civil penalty by 50%. Consequently, the civil penalty in the amount of $25,000 should be imposed.

Relating to Amendments to Sections 712 and 713 of the Amex Company Guide To Modify the Circumstances Under Which Shareholder Approval Is Required as a Condition to Exchange Approval and Listing of Additional Stock issuances Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Act\"), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on October 24, 1988, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (\"Amex\" or \"Exchange\") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit146173 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The American Stock Exchange, Inc. is proposing to amend Sections 712 and 713 of the Amex Company Guide to modify the circumstances under which shareholder approval is required as a condition to Exchange approval and listing of additional stock issuances. The text of he proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission. If. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change (1) Purpose Under current Amex rules, shareholder approval is required pursuant to Section 712 of the Amex Company Guide as a condition to listing additonal shares of common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) where such shares are to be used: (1) as the sole or partial consideration in acquiring the stock or assets of another company, if: (a) the number of shares to be issued could increase the company's outstanding stock by 20% or more, or (b) any single officer, director or substantial stockholder of the listed company has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest) in the company or assets to be acquired or in the consideration to be paid in the transaction and the issuance could result in an increase in outstanding common shares of 50% or more; or (2) pursuant to Section 713 of the Amex Company Guide for any other purpose, if: (a) the sale or issuance by the company of common stock is to be effected at a price less than the greater of book or market value, and such sale, together with the sale of securities by officers, directors, or principal stockholders, equals 20% or more of the presently outstanding common stock, or(b) if 20% or more of the company's outstanding common stock is to be sold for less than the greater of book or market value. Representatives of the business and legal communities have from time to time commented that these requirements, and similar New York Stock Exchange requirements, are unnecessarily arbitrary and restrictive. 1 The Exchange is now proposing to change its requirements. While the revision will result in fewer transactions being submitted for shareholder approval, other rules and policies, some of which were not fully developed when these requirements were first adopted, provide significant protection for investors. In this regard, it is noted that today's investors benefit from significantly enhanced corporate disclosure which is more comprehensive and timely than in the past. This is reflected in mandatory Commission filings, issuer press releases (which the Amex requires for every material event) and the rapid and independent dissemination of information by the various news services. Further, the great majority of Amex companies now have audit or comparable committees of disinterested directors which, under Amex rules, are required to approve transactions raising potential conflicts of interest.2 For these reasons, the Exchange believes that it would be appropriate to limit the extent to which its requirements intrude on corporate decision-making, and, therefore, proposes an increase of the present 20% threshold to 25%. Similarly, it would also be appropriate to increase the triggering threshold for shareholder approval of acquisitions in which officers and directors have a financial interest from 5% individually (10% collectively to 10% individually (20% collectively. A new subsection is proposed to acknowledge the long-standing policy of the Exchange not to require strict application of the requirements to a transaction undertaken by a financially distressed company, where time is of the essence. Where a company ask for an exception based upon financial need, it would be required to (a) publicly acknowledge its financial difficulty at least ten days prior to the closing of the proposed transaction; and (b) obtain approval of the transaction either by its I See e.g.. SEC File No. SR-NYSE-88-19 where the New York Stock Exchange cited such criticism in connection with an analogous proposal to revise its threshold for requiring sharehold approval from 16V% to 25%. 2 See Section 12 of the Amex Company Guide, and Form SD-1 Listing Agreement.audit committee or by a similar committee of disinterested directors. Finally, in the interest of simplicity and greater readability, we are proposing to combine Sections 712 and 713 into a single section. (2) Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it promotes just and equitable principles of trade, facilities transactions in securities and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. Ill. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Annex consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

Self-Regulatory Organizations;, Proposed Rule Change by The Pacific Stock Exchange Inc. Relating to e Policy for Allocating Booth Space on the PSE Options Trading Floor Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)[1), notice is hereby given that on October 11, 1988, the Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (\"PSE\" or the \"Exchange\") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the proposed rule change as described in Items 1, 11 and Ill below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (\"PSE\" or the \"Exchange\"), pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the Act\"), is submitting this rule filing for the purpose of adopting the following policy for the allocation of booth space on the options trading floor. Options Floor Booth Allocation Policy Formula The Booth Allocation Formula is comprised of three components: (1) Monthly trades; [2) monthly contracts; and (3) number of employees. The .three components are averaged to obtain a percentage for each member firm (e.g., If a particular firm executed 17.53% of the Exchange's monthly contracts, 16.16% of the trades and employed 9.45% of the floor personnel, the average would be 14.38% of all-three components (17.53 + 16.16 + 9.45 / 3 = 14.38%)).The booth figures for both clearing firms and retail/stock execution firms are compiled on a monthly as well as quarterly basis. A rolling six-month evaluation is used for purposes of determining the allocation of booth space. The quarterly figures constitute the primary data used for the evaluation of a booth space, which is done using the Booth Utilization Guidelines, Booth space for clearing firms and retail/stock execution firms is then allocated as follows: Clearing Firms-The clearing firms' percentages are separated and adjusted to reflect the average number of booths allocated to the clearing firms. For example, a clearing firm entitled to an allocation of 30% of Zoo booths available on the options floor (60 booths) would only be allocated 63.3% of the 60 booths (38 booths, or 19% of the 200 booths), based on the current booth space it is allocated. A particular clearing firm that has an overall average of 5% of the Booth Allocation Formula's three components is therefore entitled to 63.3% of the 5% or 6 booths. Assuming there is a 15% residual of the total 200 booths from the clearing firms, this 15% residual (30 booths) would be divided among the retail/stock execution firms according to the percentage within the group. Retail/Stock Execution Firms-The same Booth Allocation Formula used for clearing firms is applied to retail/stock execution firms. In addition, the residual of the clearing firms' percentages is allocated among the retail/stock execution firms. For example, the clearing firm residual of 15% (30 booths] would be divided among the retail/stock execution firms based upon the percentages within the group. If a given retail/stock firm's three components have an average of 11%, the allocation is 11% of the residual 15% or 1.65%. The additional percentage would then - provide the retail/stock firm with a 12.65% allocation. The retail/stock firm would be entitled to hold, based upon the formula, 25 booths (200 x 12.65%). Booth Utilization Guidelines The evaluation of booth utilization involves several factors applied only to the member firm leasing the booth space. First, effective use of the booth requires that it be occupied at least 50% of the trading day by the staff of the member firm that is leasing the booth. Second, a booth must have at a minimum an operational phone. Further consideration is given to support equipment located in the booth space, such as Quotron, Bridge, inhouse systems and order support facilities Each booth should have a minimum ofbetween three to five working voice lines, not including any second party lines, as allowed under Subordinate Issues/Subleasing. The evaluation of booth space utilization does not include a firm's use of the space for trade matching or any other type of trading support operation that may effectively be carried out elsewhere. The aforementioned criteria are listed below in order of priority. They are: 1. Effective utilization of booth by personnel (50% occupancy). 2. Operational phone. 3. Member firm supported equipment (i.e., order machines). 4. Interrogation devices. 5. Three to five operating voice lines. Booths which are not sufficiently utilized using the objective criteria listed above are subject to forfeiture and reassignment, notwithstanding any entitlement pursuant to the Booth Allocation Formula. Subordinate issues Subleasing-The subleasing of booth space by one member to another member firm is prohibited. The Exchange has established direct leasing agreements with all firms qualifying for booth space. This prohibits any arrangements with regard to booth rental occupancy, or use other than with a direct written agreement with the Exchange. A member firm may allow another member firm to install either a single phone or drop line in its booth space. Prior to installation of a single phone or drop line, the member firm wishing to install the telephone or drop line must seek written approval from the Exchange. Exchange approve phones or drop lines will not be considered in evaluating booth utilization of the member firm allocated the booth space Phone or drop lines may not be staffed by the member firm that installed the phone or drop line. Booth alterations-Booth alterations are made at the expense of the member firm leasing the booth, and the member firm, at its expense, is required to return the booth to its original condition upon vacating the space. Physical alteration of a booth requires the Exchange's prior approval. Meiyer--Booth space occupied by a member firm that merges with another member firm will revert back to the Exchange. Any reallocation will be at the discretion of the Exchange. The surviving member firm will be considered for possible reallocation of booth space pursuant to the Booth Allocation Formula. The surviving46175 617Federal' egister / Vol. 53, No. 21 I /Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices member firm will be given a higher degree of consideration for the reallocation of booth space. Vacated booth space-Booth space that is vacated for any reason will automatically revert back to the Exchange for reallocation. Booth space that is vacated must be returned to its original condition by the vacating member firm before booth space fees are terminated. Anticipated volume-A member firm may request additional booth space based upon the anticipation of increased volume (e.g., the merger of two firms, increased operational needs). A member firm's request for additional booth space will be evaluated by the Exchange. Any additional booth space that is allocated will be done so on a provisional basis. After a period not to exceed six months, the Exchange will conduct an evaluation of the member firm's booth space to determine if the additional booth space is being utilized pursuant to the booth utilization factors. Stock firms-Booth space allocated to stock execution firms or to other firms that will be utilizing the booth space for stock execution will be at the discretion of the Exchange. Allocated booth space may not be contiguous. Exchange allocation of space-The Exchange reserves the right to reallocate to member firms as needed 5% of the total booth space presently allocated to member firms. In reallocating booth space the Exchange will evaluate the utilization of a member firm's booth space. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the policy is to provide a fair and equitable procedure for allocating '&pproximately 200 booth spaces to member firms on the PSE options trading floor. A majority of these booths are presently leased to member firms.There have been increasing requests by member firms for additional booth space on the Exchange's options floor. The requests substantially outnumber the booth space that is now available. Many of the presently vacant booths are located in non-prime areas (prime area is defined as a booth either near a trading crowd, near posts that are' active, or near a central passageway). There are also a number of booth spaces which are not being effectively utilized by member firms. In some cases, member firms are unwilling to vacate underutilized booth space for real- location to other member firms that have shown a substantial business need for more booth space. Consequently, staff has found it necessary to formulate a policy that would allocate the booth space on the Exchange's options floor based on a member firm's utilization of such booth space. The Booth Allocation Formula was devised to allocate booth space to member firms by taking into consideration historical trading data (number of trades and contracts) and the number of employees used to support each operation. The formula also takes into consideration the differing space requirements of the market maker clearing firms and the retail/stock execution firms. The formula is to be used in conjunction with Booth Utilization and Subordinate Issues. The Booth Utilization Guidelines were devised to define effective use of booth space by specifying requirements such as the support equipment (e.g., Quotron), the number of operational phone lines, and the occupancy levels in each booth. Additional issues are addressed in the Subordinate Issues section. The practice of one firm subleasing to another is prohibited in this section. Subleasing is considered ineffective utilization of booth space by the primary firm renting the space. However, a firm may place a telephone or drop line in another firm's booth space. The Exchange will control the placement of a member firm's equipment in a booth space it is not leasing, as well as charge an installation fee. The Booth Alteration section allows the Exchange to control any alterations a lessee member firm may wish to make to its allocated booth space. It also requires that a member firm pay for booth space alterations and restore the booths to their original conditions when vacated. If any member firms merge, the booth space of the member firm merging into the surviving firm, either operationallyor otherwise, will revert back to the Exchange for reallocation as the Exchange deems appropriate. Member firms may request booth space under the Anticipated Volume section when they are not entitled to it based upon the Booth Allocation Formula or the Booth Utilization Guidelines. The Exchange will determine if the reason for the request is warranted (i.e., new accounts, projected business growth, etc.). Any booth space allocation is subject to review by the Exchange at a later date. The requirements of firms who primarily provide equity stock execution services to the market makers are lower than the retail or market maker clearing firms and must therefore be controlled so as to avoid the allocation of contiguous booth space whenever possible. In addition to regular reviews of each member firm's order flow (trades, contracts), the Exchange expressly reserves the right to maintain or recall 5% of the total booth space available in order to satisfy any new or additional requests for booth space on the options floor. However, the Exchange will evaluate any recall of booth space based on the Utilization Guidelines. Any booth space vacated by a member firm will revert back to the Exchange for allocation. The proposed Booth Allocation Policy is consistent with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the Act\") and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange in that it will provide for an equitable allocation of booth space among its members utilizing the facilities of the PSE. The PSE believes that this booth space alocation policy is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which provides, in pertinent part, that the rules of the Exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes a burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.46176 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices Ill Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Tuming for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of the publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding; or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change; or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

[FR Doc. 88-26477 Filed 11-15-88; 8:45 aml BILLING CODE 4910-14\"U Maritime Administration (Docket S-8381 international Shipholding Corp.; Application for Permission To Acquire Waterman Marine Corp. and Waterman Industries Corp. In connection with its planned acquisition of Waterman Marine Corporation and Waterman Industries Corporation, including certain of its subsidiaries (Waterman), International Shipholding Corporation and its subsidiaries (ISC) by letter dated November 4, 1988, requested all consents, waivers, and permissions required pursuant to sections 608, 804, and 805(a) of the Act. ISC further requested all other administrative approvals or waivers that the Maritime Administration (MARAD) may require pursuant to the Act or any provisions contained in the operating-differential subsidy (ODS) contracts held by Waterman Steamship Corporation, the vessel operating subsidiary of Waterman. ISC is a publicly-held Delaware Corporation with its headquarters located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Through its subsidiaries, ISC also maintains principal offices in New York and Rotterdam, plus a network of agents in other major cities around the world. ISC states that it is a citizen of the United States as defined by section 905(c) of the Act for Title VI purposes. ISC was formed in 1978 as a holding company and its only significant assets consist of the capital stock of its corporate subsidiaries. ISC's principal operating subsidiaries are Central Gulf Lines, Inc. (Cential Gulf), a DelawareCorporation, and LCI Shipholdings, Inc. (LCI), a Liberian Corporation. Central Gulf owns and operates eight U.S.-flag ocean-going vessels, including three LASH vessels and a full complement of U.S.-flag LASH barges, two pure car carriers, two breakbulk vessels and one RO/RO vessel. The two car carriers are under contract to carry Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor Corporation vehicles from Japan to the United States. One of the Central Gulf LASH vessels is on charter to Waterman Steamship Corporation for operation on Trade Route (TR) 18/17, pending MARAD approval. Central Gulf's other five U.S.-flag ocean-going vessels are presently on charter to the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Central Gulf also owns three and charters-in 147 river barges, plus 14 U.S.- flag towboats. LCI owns and operates a fleet of ten Liberian-flag ocean-going vessels, including three LASH vessels and a full complement of LASH barges, two pure car carriers, one breakbulk vessel, three LASH feeder vessels, and one self- propelled LASH feeder vessel. LCI's vessels generally operate around the ,world under medium to long-term contracts. ICS, through its subsidiaries New Combo, Inc. and Second Probo, Inc. also owns a 50 percent interest in two foreign corporations that will own and charter- out three specialized product/bulk/ore vessels scheduled for delivery during the next four months. These vessels will be under long-term charter to a European marketing pool that primarily deals in foreign-to-foreign markets. ISC claims it will have no involvement in the operating or marketing of these vessels. ISC also owns a minority (one-third) investment in A/S Havtor (Havtor), a Norwegian company that in turn owns minority interests, through Norwegian limited partnerships, in highly- specialized ships that carry liquid petroleum gas, ethylene, and ammonia, plus several dry bulk ships. All of the Havtor ships are under long-term charter to European marketing pools. ISC has several subsidiaries that provide chartering, brokerage, fleeting, loading, and husbanding services to their ISC affiliates, and a subsidiary that provides brokerage services to exporters. ISC also owns a minority equity interest in two management firms offering ship services in Norway, the Netherlands, and Singapore. ISC claims that these companies do not materially contribute to ISC's profits or revenues, but they facilitate vessel operations by avoiding reliance on unaffiliated third parties for services.Through its subsidiary, Waterman Steamship Corporation, Waterman currently operates three U.S.-flag LASH vessels (two of which it charters under capitalized leases) and one C5-S-75a cargo vessel chartered from American President Lines, Ltd. on TR 18/17 between U.S. Atlantic and Gulf ports and ports in the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia. Under long-term agreements with unaffiliated vessel owners, Waterman also operates three U.S.-flag RO/RO vessels that are time chartered to the MSC under the TAKX Program. Waterman's TR 18/17 service is operated pursuant to a Waterman Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement (ODSA), Contract MA/MSB- 115, which expires on June 3,1991. Waterman also is a party to two other existing ODSAs with MARAD, Contracts MA/MSB-378 and MA/MSB- 450 which continue in effect until 1996 and 1998, respectively. ISC states that following the proposed acquisition, Waterman will be separately operated, with separate accounting, under its own name, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ISC. The membership of the Board of Directors of Waterman will be revised, but senior Waterman executives will retain their positions pursuant to the terms of 13 employment contracts for periods ranging from three to five years. Absent unforeseen changes in the ODS program or the TAKX programs, ISC has no current plans to alter significantly the operations of Waterman. However, ISC's subsidiaries have extensive experience operating vessels identical or similar to the vessels operated by Waterman, and ISC believes that its acquisition of Waterman will lead to long-term improvement in waterman's financial performance and stability. ISC believes that this, in turn, will serve to strength the overall standing and performance of the U.S. merchant marine. Any person, firm, or corporation having any interest in the application for sections 608, 804, and 805(a) permission and desiring to submit comments concerning the application must file written comments in triplicate, to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7300, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, by the close of business 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December 7, 1988. If such comments deal with section 805(a) issues, they should be accompanied by a petition for leave to intervene. The petition should state clearly and concisely the grounds of interest and the alleged facts relied on for relief.46178 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices If no petitions for leave to intervene on section 805(a) issues are received within the specified time, or if it is determined that petitions filed do not demonstrate sufficient interest to warrant a hearing, the Maritime Administration will take such action as may be deemed appropriate. In the event petitions regarding the relevant section 805(a) issues are received from parties with standing to be heard, a hearing will be held, the purpose of which will be to receive evidence under section 805(a) relative to whether the proposed operations: (a) Could result in unfair competition to any person, firm, or corporation operating exclusively in the coastwise or international service, or (b) would be prejudicial to the objects and policy of the Act relative to domestic trade operations.

This rule became effective July 20,1988. Section 249.9 of the rule requires that the American insurance market be given an opportunity to compete for the placement of marine hull insurance on each vessel. This section requires that owners or insurance brokers certify to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) in certain situations that American markets have been offered the business. When more than 50 percent of the placement is foreign, the broker mustnow certify that at least 50 percent of the American market (measured in terms of capacity) was offered the risk. If more than 75 percent is placed foreign, the broker must certify that 75 percent of the American market was offered the risk. This procedure requires MARAD to identify all qualified American underwriters and their respective capacities, and to make such information available to vessels owners and brokers. On August 2, 1988, a notice was published in the Federal Register for the purpose of soliciting this information from American underwriters. Shown below is a list of American market underwriters which MARAD has compiled from the responses received. The list indicates the separate capacities for Blue Water.

ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice amends the Conforming Products List of instruments which have been found to conform to the Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices (49 FR 48854). EFFECTIVE DATE: November 18,1988. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Robin Mayer, Office of Alcohol and State Programs, NTS-21, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590; Telephone: (202) 368-9825. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 5, 1973, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published the Standards for Devices to Measure Breath Alcohol (38 FR 30459). A Qualified Products List of Evidential Breath Measurement Devices comprised of instruments that met this standard was first issued on November 21,1974 (39 FR 41399). On December 14,1984 (49 FR 48854), NHTSA converted this standard to Model Specifications for Evidential Breath Testing Devices, and published in Appendix D to that notice (49 FR 48864), a conformig products list (CPL) of instruments that were found to conform to the Model Specifications. Amendments to the CPL have beenpublished in the Federal Register since that time. Since the last publication of the CPL, a number of devices have been tested in accordance with the Model Specifications. These tests indicate that four (4) evidential breath testing instruments, not previously on the CPL, conform to the Model Specifications. These instruments include: CMI, Inc.'s Intoxilyzer PAC 1200, (VA); and Intoximeters, Inc.'s Intoximeter 3000 (rev B). Further, since the manufacturer of the BAC Datamaster has changed from Verax Systems, Inc., to National Patent Analytical Systems, Inc., the agency has retested the instrument. This device remains in conformance With the Model Specifications, and the CPL has been revised to include both the previous and current manufacturer. In addition, several typographical errors found in prior Conforming Products Lists have been corrected. The Conforming Products list is therefore amended as follows: CONFORMING PRODUCTS LIST OF EVIDEN- TIAL BREATH MEASUREMENT DEVICES Manufacturer and model Mobile Noi- Alcohol Countermeasures System, Inc.

ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY:. The Department of the Treasury has revised the schedule of fees that will be used in 1989 for assessing charges on the transfer of book-entry Treasury securities between accounts of depository institutions maintained at Federal Reserve Banks and Branches. The revised fee schedule is based on an anticipated increase in the cost of providing the Treasury book- entry securities transfer service. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 3,1989. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:. Carl M. Locken, Jr., Assistant Commissioner (Financing), Bureau of the Public Debt, Room 534, E Street Building, Washington, DC 20239-0001, (202) 376- 4350. Kerry Lanham, Government Securities Specialist, Bureau of the Public Debt, Room 534, E Street Building, Washington, DC 20239-0001, (202) -376- 4350. William A. Saunders, Government Securities Specialist, Bureau of the Public Debt, Room 534, E Street Building, Washington, DC 20239-0001, (202) 370- 4350. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 1, 1985, the Department of the Treasury established a fee schedule for the transfer of Treasury book-entry securities between accounts of depository. institutions maintained at Federal Reserve Banks and Branches. The fees, which have-remained unchanged since 1985, apply to on-line Treasury transfers originated, off-line Treasury transfers originated, and off- line Treasury transfers received. Treasury transfer reversals are not currently assessed fees. Based on a recent review of book- entry costs and volumes, the Treasury determined that the cost of providing the Treasury book-entry transfer service in 1989 will increase, even though the volume of Treasury book-entry transfers processed between accounts is expected to remain virtually unchanged. To the extent possible, Treasury attempts to establish fees that will recover the cost of processing book-entry transfers. Consequently, effective January 3, 1989, the Treasury will: (1) Increase the fee for on-line Treasury transfers originated from $1.50 to $1.65 per46181 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices transfer; (2) increase the fee for off-line Treasury transfers originated and off- line Treasury transfers received from $6.25 to $6.40 per transfer; and (3) charge a fee to receivers of on-line and off-line Treasury transfer reversals ($1.65 per on-line Treasury transfer reversal received and $6.40 per off-line Treasury transfer reversal received). No fees are currently proposed for: (1) On- and off-line reversals originated or (2) transfers to and from collateral accounts supporting borrowings from the Federal Reserve or Treasury deposits (i.e., transfers to and from Discount, Treasury Tax & Loan, and Circular 176 accounts). The determination to charge fees for Treasury transfer reversals received is based on the premise that the purpose of transfer reversals is to enable the receiver (the original sender) to correct original transfers that were sent in error, and that the original sender should absorb the cost of processing the transfer reversal. Because the processing and associated costs of transfer reversals are identical to thoseof regular securities transfers, the Treasury intends to charge the same fee for transfer reversals received that it currently charges for regular securities transfers. The cumulative effect of these developments is expected to be a net increase in total Treasury transfer fees for 1989 commensurate with the anticipated increase in the cost of providing the Treasury transfer service. The Treasury expects that the new fees will result in the full recovery of the costs associated therewith. The fees described in this notice apply only to the transfer of Treasury book- entry securities. The Federal Reserve System assesses fees to recover the costs associated with the processing of the funds component of Treasury book- entry transfer messages, and the costs associated with providing book-entry services for Government agencies. The Federal Reserve fees for these services are set out in a separate notice published November 4, 1988, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.While Treasury book-entry tranfer fees will increase, Federal Reserve fees for the funds component of Treasury book-entry tranfers will decrease, leaving the combined fees for Treasury book-entry tranfers unchanged for 1989. The following is the Treasury fee schedule that will be effective January 3, 1989, for the Treasury book-entry transfer service: 1989 Fee Schedule On-line transfers reversal transfers received $6.40 per Gerald Murphy, Fiscal Assistant Secretary. Date: November 9,1988.

BILUNG CODE 1505.01-D Wednesday November 16, 1988 Part II Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 331 Antacid Drug Products for Over-the- Counter Human Use; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 46190 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR PART 331 [Docket No. SN-00031 Antacid Drug Products for Over-the- Counter Human Use; Proposed Amendment to the Monograph AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the final monograph for over-the-counter (OTC) antacid drug products to revise the conditions for marketing combination antacid/analgesic drug products, to add a section on the labeling of permitted combinations of active ingredients, and to redesignate the professional labeling section to conform to the format of other OTC drug final monographs. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking after considering the report and recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products and public comments on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products that was based on those recommendations. The agency's proposal concerning OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. These proposals are part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA. DATE: Written comments or objections by March 16, 1989. ADDRESS: Written comments or objections to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Room 4-62,5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:. William E. Gilbertson, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-210), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301- 295-8000. SUPPLEMENTARY Federal Register of June 4,1974 (39 FR 19862), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC antacid drug products (21 CFR Part 331). Section 331.15(b) (21 CFR 331.15(b)) of the monograph provides for the combination of an antacid and any generally recognized as safe and effective analgesic ingredient(s) if the combination is indicated for use solelyfor concurrent symptoms, e.g., headache and acid indigestion, and is marketed in a form intended for ingestion as a solution. These combinations were limited to administration in solution because all the evidence of safety submitted for review under the rulemaking for OTC antacid drug products was derived from studies and experience with products administered as solutions (39 FR 19889). Subsequent to the publication of the final rule for OTC antacid drug products, the Advisory Review Panel for OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products (Internal Analgesic Panel) reviewed data on OTC antacid/analgesic combinations and recommended conditions for their safe and effective use in its report on OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products (July 8, 1977; 42 FR 35346). This Panel recommended that acetaminophen could be combined with a Category I antacid ingredient provided the product was labeled for the concurrent symptoms involved, e.g., \"For the temporary relief of occasional minor aches, pains, and headache, * * *, and for acid indigestion.\" The Panel did not specify any specific dosage form. The Panel also recommended as Category I an antacid/ aspirin combination, labeled only for analgesic-antipyretic indications. However, in this case the combination was limited to marketing as a highly buffered aspirin for use as a solution (42 FR 35370). In the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, FDA states for the first time Its position on the establishment of a monograph for these drug products. In formulating its proposals on conditions for marketing combinations of antacid and analgesic ingredients in the internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products tentative final monograph, the agency considered the recommendations of both the Antacid Panel and the Internal Analgesic Panel as well as all currently-available data on such combinations. As discussed in comments 47, 76, 94, 95, and 98 of the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, the agency has determined that (1) acetaminophen may be combined with any antacid ingredient(s) and may be labeled only for concurrent symptoms, (2) aspirin may be combined with any antacid ingredient(s) when marketed in a form intended for ingestion as a solution and may be labeled for concurrent symptoms as well as analgesicindications alone, and (3) combinations of other proposed generally recognized as safe and effective internal analgesic- antipyretic ingredients (i.e., carbaspirin calcium, choline salicylate, magnesium salicylate, and sodium salicylate) and antacid ingredients have not existed previously in the marketplace and lack supporting data. Based on these findings, the agency has determined that the antacid final monograph should be updated to be consistent with the proposals being made in Part 343 (the internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic tentative final monograph), published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. Therefore, the agency is proposing to revise J 331.15(b) of the antacid monograph to read as follows: (1) Antacid and acetaminophen combinations. See \u00a7 343.20(b)(1) of this chapter. (2) Antacid and aspirin combinations. See \u00a7 343.20(b)(3) of this chapter. In addition, the agency is proposing the addition of new \u00a7 331.60 to the antacid final monograph in order to provide for the labeling of permitted combinations of active ingredients and is redesignating the professional labeling section from \u00a7 331.31 to \u00a7 331.80 in accordance with the format of other recently published tentative final and final monographs for OTC drug products. Further, the agency is revising the Scope section (21 CFR 331.1) of the antacid final monograph in accordance with the format of other recently published monographs. Because of the interrelationship of this amendment to the antacid final monograph and the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, the agency does not intend to finalize this amendment until the comments to the internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic tentative final monograph have been fully evaluated. The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking in conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the Federal Register of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5808), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts. The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludes that no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC antacid drug products, is a major rule. Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules 46191 mw mw The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug review was not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemaking for OTC antacid drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC antacid drug products. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC antacid drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Interested persons may, on or before March 16, 1989, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, written comments or objections. Three copies of all comments or objections are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments and objections are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or'brief. Comments and objections may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p:m., Monday through Friday. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 331 Antacid drug products, Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, it is proposed that Subchapter D of Chapter I of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended in Part 331 as follows:PART 331-ANTACID PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) HUMAN USE - 1. The authority citation for Part 331 is revised to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 201(p), 502, 505, 701, 52 Stat. 1041-1042 as amended, 1050-1053 as amended, 1055-1058 as amended by 70 Stat. 919 and 72 Stat. 948 (21 U.S.C. 321(p), 352, 355, 371); 5 U.S.C. 553; 21 CFR 5.10 and 5.11. 2. 331.1 is revised to read as follows: \u00a7 331.1 Scope. (a) An over-the-counter antacid drug product in a form suitable for oral administration is generally recognized as safe and effective and is not misbranded if it meets each condition in this part and each general condition established in \u00a7 330.1 of this chapter.(b) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of Federal Regulations are to Chapter I of Title 21 unless otherwise noted. 3. Section 331.15 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: \u00a7 331.15 Combination with nonantacid combinations. See \u00a7 343.20(b)(1) of this chapter. (2) Antacid and aspirin combinations. See \u00a7 343.20(b)(3) of this chapter. 4. Section 331.60 is added to Subpart D to read as follows: \u00a7 331.60 Labeling of permitted combinations of active ingredients. Statements of identity, indications, warnings, and directions for use, respectively, applicable to each ingredient in the product may be combined to eliminate duplicative words or phrases so that the resulting information is clear and understandable. (a) Statement of identity. For a combination drug product that has an established name, the labeling of the product states the established name of the combination drug product, followed by the statement of identity for each ingredient in the combination, as established in the statement of identity sections of the applicable OTC drug monographs. For a combination drug product that does not have an established name, the labeling of the product states the statement of identity for each ingredient in the combination,as established in the statement of identity sections of the applicable OTC' drug monographs. (b) Indications. The labeling of the product states, under the heading \"Indications,\" the indication(s) for each ingredient in the combination, as established in the indications sections of the applicable OTC drug monographs, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph (b). Other truthful and nonmisleading statements, describing only the indications for use that have been established and listed in this paragraph may also be used, as provided in \u00a7 330.1(c)(2) of this chapter, subject to the provisions of section 502 of the act relating to misbranding and the prohibition in section 301(d) of the act against the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the act. (1) For permitted combinations identified in \u00a7 331.15(b)(1). The indications in \u00a7 343.60(b)(2) of this chapter should be used. (2) For permitted combinations identified in \u00a7 331.15(b)(2). The indications in \u00a7 343.60(b)(4) of this chapter should be used. (c) Warnings. The labeling of the product states, under the heading \"Warnings,\" the warning(s) for each ingredient in the combination, as established in the warnings sections of the applicable OTC drug monographs. (d) Directions. The labeling of the product states, under the heading \"Directions,\" directions that conform to the directions established for each ingredient in the directions sections of the applicable OTC drug monographs, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph (d).

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of a tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which over- the-counter (OTC) orally administered menstrual drug products (drugs taken internally to relieve symptoms relating to a woman's menstrual period) are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking after considering the report and recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products and public comments on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that was based on those recommendations. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA. DATES: Written comments, objections, or requests for oral hearing on the proposed regulation before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs by March 16, 1989. Because this document is being published concurrently with the notice of proposed rulemaking on OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the agency is allowing a period of 120 days for comments and objections instead of the normal 60 days. New data by November 16, 1989. Comments on the new data by January 16, 1990. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination by March 16, 1989. ADDRESS: Written comments, objections, new data, or requests for oral hearing to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:. William E. Gilbertson, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-210), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301- 295-8000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 7, 1982 (47 FR 55076), FDA published, under \u00a7 330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice of proposed rulemakingto establish a monograph for OTC orally administered menstrual drug products, together with the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products (Miscellaneous Internal Panel), which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by March 7,1983. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by April 6, 1983. In accordance with \u00a7 330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration (address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, five drug manufacturers, two consulting firms, and the Panel chairman submitted comments. Copies of the comments received are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch. In order to conform to terminology used in the OTC drug review regulations (21 CFR 330.10), the present document is designated as a \"tentative final monograph.\" Its legal status, however, is that of a proposed rule. In this tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish Subpart K of Part 357 (21 CFR Part 357), FDA states for the first time its position on the establishment of a monograph for OTC orally administered menstrual drug products. Final agency action on this matter will occur with the publication at a future date of a final monograph, which will be a final rule establishing a monograph for OTC orally administered menstrual drug products. This proposal constitutes FDA's tentative adoption of the Panel's conclusions and recommendations on OTC orally administered menstrual drug products as modified on the basis of the comments received and the agency's independent evaluation of the Panel's report. Modifications have been made for clarity and regulatory accuracy and to reflect new information. Such new information has been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). These modifications are reflected in the following summary of the comments and FDA's responses to them. After reviewing and evaluating the Panel's recommendations regarding the use of OTC internal analgesic ingredients during the premenstrual and menstrual periods, the agency hasdecided to include premenstrual and menstrual claims for these ingredients as part of the rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic drug products rather than to retain them as part of the rulemaking for OTC menstrual drug products. In this way, the various conditions for which an OTC internal analgesic drug product is effective will be listed in one monograph. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the agency is proposing in the tentative final monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products to include premenstrual and menstrual claims. Final agency action on OTC internal analgesic ingredients for premenstrual and menstrual use will occur with publication of the final rule establishing a monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products. Comments relevant to OTC internal analgesics are discussed in that document. Although this tentative final monograph contains indications for antihistamine and smooth-muscle relaxant active ingredients, no ingredients from either of these pharmacologic groups are included in Category I at this time. In the event that no new data are submitted to the agency during the allotted 12-month new data period or if submitted data are not sufficient to establish \"monograph conditions\" for these classes of ingredients, those classes will not be included in the final monograph. Should new data be sufficient to establish\"monograph conditions\" for these classes of ingredients, appropriate warnings and directions will be included in the final monograph. The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330,10) now provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph. Accordingly, FDA will no longer use the terms \"Category I\" (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded), \"Category II\" (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and \"Category 111\" (available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage, but will use instead the terms .\"monograph conditions\" (old Category I) and\"nonmonograph conditions\" (old Categories I and III). This document retains the concepts of Categories I, II, Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules and III at the tentative final monograph stage. The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products that are subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12 months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the Federal Register. On or after that date, no OTC drug product that is subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition, i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognized as safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved application. Further, any OTC drug product subject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date. If the agency determines that any labeling for a condition included in the final monograph should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effective date, a shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety problem is identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a shorter deadline may be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products. All \"OTC Volumes\" cited throughout this document refer to the submissions made by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notices published in the Federal Register of November 16, 1973 (38 FR 31696) and August 27, 1975 (40 FR 38179) or to additional information that has come to the agency's attention since publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments A. Comments on Orally Administered Menstrual Active Ingredients 1. One comment stated that, although the pharmacologic literature contains anecdotal evidence of the diuretic activity of ammonium chloride, the Panel did not consider or have available any quantitative data on ammonium chloride at the dosage of I gram (g) three times a day that it recommended as Category I.The agency has reviewed the available data and information and believes that there is sufficient support for general recognition of ammonium chloride's effectiveness at the Panel's recommended dosage. The scientific literature contains severalpublished clinical studies demonstrating ammonium chloride's mechanism of action as a diuretic (Refs. 1 through 5). Greenhill and Freed (Ref. 6) also reported that ammonium chloride is effective in relieving premenstrual and menstrual symptoms. In this study, ammonium chloride administered in doses of I g three times a day produced relief in 34 of 40 patients. Those patients who usually showed visible edema did not do so after therapy. Similar results have also been reported by Tecoz (Ref. 7) and Provenzano (Ref. 8). In addition; several pharmacology textbooks state that a dosage of I g of ammonium chloride three times a day is useful in treating premenstrual and menstrual symptoms (Refs. 9 through 12). Based on the above, the agency believes that ammonium chloride can be generally recognized as safe and effective for use as a diuretic in OTC menstrual drug products. References (I) Lyons, R.H., S.D.

One comment stated that although the pharmacologic literature includes anecdotal evidence of the diuretic activity of caffeine, the Panel did not consider or have available any quantitative data for caffeine at the dose of 100 to 200 milligrams (mg) that it recommended as Category 1. The comment noted that the results of the one study cited by the Panel to support its conclusions (Ref. 1) did show a significant increase in sodium output, but did not.show a significant increase in urine volume following a 300-mg dose of caffeine. Another comment also noted an absence of data demonstrating caffeine's effectiveness in relieving subjective symptoms of the menstrual period. The agency has reviewed the data and information cited by the Panel (Refs. 1 through 5), as well as other data and information in the scientific literature (Refs. 6, 7, andS8) and tentatively concludes that the data are adequate to support the effectiveness of the Panel's recommended dose of caffeine (100 to 200 mg) for use in OTC menstrual drug products. The rationale for the use of diuretics during the premenstrual and menstrual periods was discussed by the Panel at 47 FR 55086. Although the Panel did not specifically discuss clinical studies that would support the recommended diuretic dose, the agency finds that caffeine's diuretic activity is well known and generally recognized (Refs. 2 through 5). Studies reported in the literature also support the Panel's conclusion regarding caffeine's diuretic action (Refs. 6, 7, and 8). In a double- blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study conducted by Robertson et al. (Ref. 6), 250 mng caffeine was found to produce a greater volume of urine in all patients as compared with placebo, with a mean increase of 29 percent. Eddy and Downs (Ref. 7) reported the minimum effective diuretic dose of caffeine to be 0.48 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) in persons who were not coffee drinkers and 1.12 mg/kg in persons who were coffee drinkers (equivalent to 33 mg and 76 mg, respectively, in a 150-pound person). Victor, Lubetsky, and Greden (Ref. 8) reported that of 124 patients studied, 60 percent reported diuresis when461L95 46196 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules consuming less than 249 mg of caffeine per day. As discussed in comment 3 below, in addition to caffeine's diuretic activity, its stimulant effect can provide additional benefit to persons suffering from fatigue during the premenstrual and menstrual periods. Based on the above, the agency concurs with the Panel's recommendations and Is including caffeine as an active ingredient in the tentative final monograph for OTC menstrual drug products.

One comment requested that the agency resolve certain inconsistencies relating to caffeine between the proposed rulemaking for OTC stimulant drug products and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC menstrual drug products. The comment noted that the stimulant tentative final monograph stated that caffeine could be expected to increase nervousness associated with premenstrual tension (43 FR 25561) and that the proposed labeling for caffeine included a warning advising that the use of caffeine may be associated with increased nervousness, anxiety, irritability, and other side effects (43 FR 25602). The comment pointed out that these same symptoms occur in the menstrual syndrome, a condition for which caffeine is being indicated for use as a diuretic. The comment implied that it is inappropriate to use a drug for a condition that includes symptoms that the drug itself caused as side effects.The agency does not believe that the proposed rulemaking for OTC stimulant drug products and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC menstrual drug products are inconsistent with respect to caffeine. The agency notes that the proposed warning for caffeine in the tentative final monograph on OTC stimulant drug products (43 FR 25544) advises against excessive intake of caffeine, informs consumers to use caution when taking caffeine-containing drug products with other caffeine- containing products such as coffee or cola, and states that certain side effects such as anxiety, nervousness, and irritability may occur if the recommended dose is exceeded. The amount of caffeine that causes the side effects varies greatly among individuals, and the side effects are not expected to occur in most people from the usual stimulant or diuretic therapeutic dose of caffeine (100 to 200 mg). As the Miscellaneous Internal Panel acknowledged in its report, caffeine can serve two purposes in OTC menstrual drug products (47 FR 55087). First, through its mild diuretic action, caffeine can relieve the symptoms of bloating, swelling, and water-weight gain during the premenstrual and menstrual periods. Second, the Panel acknowledged that fatigue is also a symptom of the premenstrual period, and caffeine's stimulant effect could relieve the fatigue. Although the premenstrual and menstrual syndrome may include the symptoms of nervousness, anxiety, and irritability, these symptoms do not necessarily occur in every individual (47 FR 55080). Even in those who are experiencing these symptoms, caffeine's diuretic effect may still provide a therapeuric benefit for the water-' retention symptoms. Therefore, the agency does not believe it is inappropriate to use caffeine during the premenstrual and menstrual periods. However, to provide fully informative labeling to the consumer, the agency is proposing the following warning for OTC menstrual drug products containing caffeine: \"The recommended dose of this product contains about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. Limit the use of caffeine-containing medications, foods, or beverages while taking this product because too much caffeine may cause nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, and, occasionally, rapid heart rate.\" The agency believes this warning is more appropriate for OTC menstrual drug products than the warnings recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 357.1054(c)(2) and is consistent with the warning in the final monograph for OTC stimulant drug products publishedin the Federal Register of February 29, 1988 (53 FR 6100). 4. Although phenyltoloxamine citrate was not reviewed by the Miscellaneous Internal Panel, one comment requested that products containing this ingredient in combination with acetaminophen or with acetaminophen and caffeine, which have been marketed for many years, be placed in Category IlI for relief of menstrual pain, The comment stated that the recommendations of the Miscellaneous Internal Panel concerning pyrilamine are equally applicable to other antihistamines and specifically to phenyltoloxamine because of their similarity in action. The comment pointed out that these products were reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products (Internal Analgesic Panel) and that clinical studies submitted to that Panel support this use of phenyltoloxamine. A reply comment stated that, whether or not other antihistamines share the effectiveness demonstrated by pyrilamine in relieving menstrual symptoms, all antihistamines should be subject to clinical investigations on an individual basis. The agency has reviewed the administrative record of the rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products and determined that products containing phenyltoloxamine in combination with acetaminophen or acetaminophen and caffeine have been marketed OTC for relief of menstrual pain. Therefore. the agency agrees with the comment that it is reasonable to include phenyltoloxamine citrate in Category III in the review of OTC menstrual drug products. However, the data are insufficient to demonstrate that phenyltoloxamine citrate in combination with acetaminophen or acetaminophen and caffeine provides any contribution to the product's effectiveness. The agency is placing phenyltoloxamine in Category III, and additional data will be necessary to establish the effectiveness of this ingredient for use in OTC menstrual drug products. (For a discussion of pyrilamine in OTC menstrual drug products, see comment 5 below.) 5. Two comments responded to the agency's concern that the Panel's conclusions on the use of pyrilamine maleate in OTC menstrual drug products may be inconsistent with the final order for OTC daytime sedative drug products. The comments contended that the agency's conclusions with respect to antihistamines in the daytime sedative final order (44 FR 36378) were not Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules relevant to the use of pyrilamine maleate in products for premenstrual syndrome because the pharmacological basis for pyrilamine's use in the premenstrual and menstrual syndrome relates to its effects as an H, histamine antagonist and possibly to its ability to reduce prolactin levels, with consequent reduction in prostaglandin synthesis, but not to its drowsiness side effect. The comments also argued that although a target population that could benefit from the drowsiness effect for use as a daytime sedative had not been demonstrated, the target population that can benefit from an effective menstrual drug product is well defined. The comments added that the results of two studies submitted to the Panel provide the necessary evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of pyrilamine maleate alone or in combination with pamabrom in relieving symptoms of the premenstrual and menstrual periods (Refs. I and 2). The agency has reviewed all of the available data and acknowledges that the conclusions regarding antihistamines in the daytime sedative final rule may not be relevant to the use of pyrilamine maleate in products used for the premenstrual and menstrual syndrome. However, the agency does not believe the data are sufficient to establish the effectiveness of pyrilamine maleate alone or in combination for use in relieving symptoms of the premenstrual and menstrual syndromes. Therefore, the agency is classifying pyrilamine maleate (and its combinations) in Category III in this document. Two studies were cited by the Panel in support of the effectiveness of pyrilamine maleate. The Boston study, a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, was conducted to compare the effectiveness of pyrilamine maleate vs placebo in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome (Ref. 1). Although several parameters were analyzed, the sponsor indicated that water retention, negative affects (anxiety, irritability, depression, and tension), and pain were of primary concern. However, because the sponsor's statistical analysis of the study results (Ref. 3) did not take into consideration the crossover design of the study, the results cannot be relied upon as proof of effectiveness. In addition, patients should not have been excluded from the efficacy population for failing to receive each treatment for the same length of time. The Wisconsin study, also a placebo- controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover study, was conducted toassess the effects of pamabrom and pyrilamine maleate alone and in a fixed combination in the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome (Ref. 2). As in the Boston study, the statistical analysis did not take into consideration the crossover design of the study (Ref. 4). Consequently, the results cannot be relied upon. Although both of these studies appeared to be well-controlled clinical trials, the lack of sufficient data precluded a proper analysis of the studies. For example, in the Wisconsin study, although the raw data were submitted, the protocol was not included. In addition, the fact that the treatment order was based on whether the patient's study number was odd or even indicated that a proper randomization procedure was not employed. In the Boston study, individual patient data were not provided. The agency's detailed comments and evaluations of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) (Refs. 5 and 6). For the reasons above, the agency concludes that the studies are inadequate to establish effectiveness for pyrilamine maleate alone or in combination with pamabrom. Therefore, the agency is reclassifying pyrilamine maleate alone or in combination with pamabrom in Category II at this time. In the preamble to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC menstrual drug products (47 FR 55076), the agency stated that It was not aware of any product on the OTC market containing pyrilamine maleate as the only ingredient and Indicated for menstrual or premenstrual symptoms. The agency concluded that, because of its concerns regarding pyrilamine maleate, products containing pyrilamine maleate as a single ingredient and indicated for any menstrual or premenstrual symptoms should not be marketed at that time. The agency reaffirms in this document that products containing pyrilamine maleate as the sole ingredient and indicated for any menstrual or premenstrual symptoms should not be marketed as OTC menstrual drug products until the agency considers the ingredient to be generally recognized as safe and effective (Category 1) for such use.

Comments on Labeling of Orally Administered Menstrual Drug Products\"8. One comment noted that the Panel's recommended labeling for OTC menstrual drug products would provide for a distinction between products for use in the premenstrual and menstrual periods. The comment stated that because the Panel itself recognized that there was not a clear distinction, between the symptoms occurring during these two periods, it would be simpler and less confusing to label all products in this category for relief of symptoms associated with \"menstruation\" or \"the menstrual period,\" without attempting to distinguish between \"premenstrual\" and\"menstrual\" products. The agency does not agree that the products should be indicated for \"menstruation\" only. Although the premenstrual and menstrual periods are two distinct syndromes, the symptoms that occur during these periods overlap significantly, and the ingredients used to relieve these symptoms would be the same whether the symptoms occurred during the menstrual or the premenstrual periods. Therefore, the agency does not believe it would be beneficial to the consumer to distinguish between these two periods in the indications. In this tentative final monograph, the agency is proposing that the products be indicated for the particular symptoms of the\"premenstrual and menstrual periods\" rather than distinguishing between the two periods. However, this would not preclude the selective use of these terms as part of the product name or as part of other promotional labeling statements, e.g., \"premenstrual pain relief formula,\"\"menstrual pain relief,\" etc. Such terms would be considered descriptive terms advising consumers of the product's benefits. While not included in the monograph, these terms are subject to the provisions of section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or misleading and will be evaluated by the agency in conjunction with normal enforcement activities relating to that section of the act. In reviewing the labeling claims recommended by the Panel, the agency also notes that the Panel placed the term \"dysmenorrhea\" in Category I. The agency does not believe that\"dysmenorrhea\", when used alone, is a46197 46198 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules word that is commonly understood by consumers, nor was this word used in any of the OTC drug product labeling submitted to the Panel. Therefore, the agency has not provided for its use as a sole indication but has provided for its optional use parenthetically with other terms, e.g., \"For the relief of painful premenstrual and menstrual cramps\" [which may be followed by: \"(dysmenorrhea).\"I 7. The Miscellaneous Internal Panel Chairman commented that the Panel's Category III classification of \"skin- disorder\" claims for antihistamine- containing ingredients (47 FR 55086) was an apparent oversight. He explained that although the classification accurately reflected the Panel's deliberations during the October 16-17, 1981 meeting, it was his personal opinion that such claims should be Category IL He was concerned that such claims would invite teenage girls to use these menstrual products to treat acne. The agency has reviewed the administrative record for this rulemaking and has found no data to substantiate \"skin disorder\" claims for OTC menstrual drug products. Therefore, the agency concurs with the Panel Chairman. Skin disorder claims for OTC menstrual drug products are considered Category I. C. Comments on Combinations 8. Two comments stated that the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC menstrual drug products did not properly reflect all of the Panel's conclusions. The comments pointed out that at its October 16-17,1981 meeting, the Panel classified the combination of a Category I analgesic and pyrilamine maleate in Category I, but the published document did not reflect this determination. The agency has reviewed the transcripts of the meeting and concludes that the comments are correct in stating that the Panel classified the combination of a Category I analgesic and pyrilamine maleate as a Category I menstrual drug product. However, due to an editorial omission, the advance notice of proposed rulemaking did not reflect this conclusion. Nonetheless, as discussed in comnent 5 above, the agency disagrees with the Panel's recommendation to include such a combination in Category I and has placed this combination in Category Ill. Therefore, the combination is not included in this tentative final monograph. Criteria for establishing combinations as Category I are provided in the General Guidelines for OTC Drug Combination Products (Ref. 1). Paragraph 0 of these guidelines states,\"In those cases -where the data are sufficient to support a finding by the agency that several ingredients in a therapeutic category can be considered interchangeable for purposes of formulating combinations, the monograph will so state and list those ingredients. This is the preferred approach and will be done whenever supported by data and the opinion of experts.\" Therefore, the agency agrees with the Panel's concept of listing combination drug products by pharmacological class, but does not agree that sufficient data have been provided to allow for all of the ingredients in the various pharmacologic classes to be interchanged for the purpose of forming combinations. Therefore, only those combinations for which the agency has determined that adequate data exist have been included in the tentative final monograph. Data are necessary to establish the safety and effectiveness of other specific combinations or to demonstrate that the specific ingredients in a pharmacological class are chemically and pharmacologically interchangeable. References (1) Food and Drug Administration, \"General Guidelines for OTC Drug Combination Products, September 1978,\" Docket No. 78D-0322, Dockets Management Branch. 9. One comment requested that the combination of acetaminophen, pyrilamine maleate, ammonium chloride, caffeine, and iron be classified as a Category I combination for the relief of menstrual discomfort. The comment contended that this would be a reasonable combination because it is a merger of two Category I combinations recommended by the Panel, with the addition of iron. The comment added that the iron is included In the combination because of the \"known menstrual iron losses\" that were identified in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC vitamin and mineral drug products. (See'the Federal Register of March 16, 1979; 44 FR 16183.) One reply comment questioned whether this product would be Intended for use even in the absence of symptoms, in order to provide iron supplementation, or whether the inclusion of iron in the formula has a symptom-specific role. The comment did not provide any data, and the agency is unaware of any evidence, demonstrating that a suitable target population exists that could benefit from the short-term use of OTC menstrual drug products containing the four proposed ingredients plus iron. TheAdvisory Review Panel on OTC Vitamin and Mineral Drug Products stated in its report (44 FR 16183) that a daily extradietary iron supplement to supplement the dietary stores and to preserve iron stores seems reasonable because of the prevalance of iron deficiency in menstruating females. Menstrual drug products, however, are not taken daily for long-term dietary supplementation, but are intended for occasional short-term use to alleviate symptoms associated with the premenstrual and menstrual periods. Therefore, the addition of iron as a concurrent therapy in OTC menstrual drug products does not appear warranted. In addition, pyrilamine maleate and the combinations containing pyrilamine maleate have been reclassified as Category II because of the lack of evidence of effectiveness. [See comment 5 above.) Therefore, the combination requested by the comment would also be considered a nonmonograph combination. II. The Agency's Tentative Adoption of the Panel's Report A. Summary of Ingredient Categories and Testing of Category 11 and Category III Conditions 1. Summary of ingredient categories. The agency has reviewed all claimed active ingredients submitted to the Panel, as well as other data and information available at this time, and is proposing one change in the categorization of orally administered menstrual active ingredients recommended by the Panel. The agency has also reviewed the ingredient phenyltoloxamine citrate, which was not submitted to the Panel, and is proposing Category III status for this ingredient. (See comment 4 above.) As a convenience to the reader, the following list is included as a summary of the categorization of orally administered menstrual active ingredients recommended by the Panel and the proposed categorization by the agency.

Testing of Category II and Category III conditions. Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submission of data and information to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness, of any orally administered menstrual active ingredient or condition included in the review by following the procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the Federal Register of September 29,1981 (46 FR 47740) and clarified April 1,1983 (48 FR 14050).'That policy statement includes procedures for the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings with industry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submitted test data and other information. B. Summary of the Agency's Changes in the Panel's Recommendations FDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and concludes that it will tentatively adopt the Panel's report and recommended monograph with the changes describedin FDA's responses to the comments above and with other changes described in the summary below. A summary of the changes made by the agency follows. 1. Because of the changes summarized below, many of the section and paragraph numbers have been redesignated in this tentative final monograph. 2. The agency's conclusions regarding the use of internal analgesic active ingredients for menstrual and premenstrual symptoms are presented elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. 3. The word \"precaution\" has been deleted from the recommended warning for ammonium chloride in \u00a7 357.1052(c)(1)(ii). The agency considers the word \"warning\" alone to be the simplest, clearest signal to alert consumers and has routinely used the word \"warning\" in the labeling sections of other OTC drug tentative final and final monographs. 4. The recommended warnings relevant to the use of caffeine as an OTC menstrual drug have been revised. (See comment 3 above.) 5. Phenyltoloxamine citrate has been added to the menstrual rulemaking as a Category III ingredient. (See comment 4 above.) 6. Pyrilamine maleate as an individual ingredient and in combination has been * reclassified from Category I to Category III. (See comments 5 and 8 above.) 7. The agency has-modified the indications for OTC menstrual drug products to eliminate the distinction between the premenstrual and menstrual periods. (See comment 6 above.) 8. Skin disorder claims for OTC menstrual drug products have been reclassified from Category III to Category I. (See comment 7 above.) 9. The Panel recommended that the combination of ammonium chloride (650 mg) and caffeine (200 mg) given three times a day be classified in Category L The Panel concluded this to be a rational combination because the diuretic mechanisms of action are different and adjunctive (47 FR 55095). The agency agrees that the combining of ingredients from the same therapeutic category with different mechanisms of action is rational and is provided for in the agency's general guidelines for OTC drug combination products (Ref. 1) which state that \"* * * ingredients from the same therapeutic category that have different mechanisms of action may be combined to treat the same symptoms or condition if the combination meets the OTC combination policy in all respectsand the combination is on a benefit-risk basis equal to or better than each of the active ingredients used alone at its therapeutic dose.\" However, the study cited by the Panel to support the combination of ammonium chloride (650 mg) and caffeine (200 &g) (Ref. 2) was not designed to assess the individual contribution of each ingredient to the combination. Such data are necessary to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 330.10(a}(4)(iv), i.e., that each active ingredient must make a contribution to the claimed effect of the product, particularly in light of the fact that the product contains 200 mg caffeine, which has been shown to be effective alone at this dose. The contribution of ammonium chloride in a subtherapeutic dose to a product already containing an effective ingredient at an effective dose level needs to be demonstrated. This is particularly important in this case because, as discussed in comment 1 above, the agency is unaware of any evidence of the effectiveness of ammonium chloride at doses less than the recommended dose of 1 g. Likewise, .the agency is unaware of any evidence to establish that the addition of subtherapeutic amounts of ammonium chloride to caffeine would provide any effect above the caffeine alone. Therefore, the agency is classifying the combination of ammonium chloride (650 mg) and caffeine (200 mg) in Category III, However, because the agency considers ammonium chloride in combination with caffeine to be rational for use as an OTC menstrual drug product, the agency has no objections to a drug product that would contain each of these ingredients at their therapeutic dose. Therefore, provisions for ammonium chloride and caffeine in combination at their therapeutic dose have been included in the monograph.

(2) Hoffman, J.J. \"A Double-Blind Crossover Clinical Trial of an OTC Diuretic in the Treatment of Premenstrual Tension and Weight Gain.\" Current Therapeutic Research, 2:57-S80,1979. 10. The agency has expanded the combination section of the monograph to provide for allowable combinations of analgesics (as identified in \u00a7 343.20[a)) to be combined with a diuretic. 11. The agency has not included several of the Panel's recommended indications statements for OTC menstrual diuretic drug products (\u00a7 357.1054(b)(2) through (5)) in this46199 46200 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules tentative final monograph because they duplicate information already contained in the statement of identity and the primary indications statement. 12. The Panel's recommended directions for OTC menstrual diuretic drug products containing pamabrom have been clarified to include a time interval as follows: Adult oral dosage is 50 milligrams four times a day, not to exceed 200 milligrams per day. 13. The Panel provided indications and directions for two specific combination products in \u00a7 357.1058 (a)(1) and (2) and (b)(1) of its proposed monograph. However, it did not provide labeling information for all of the combinations it recommended as Category I. Therefore, the agency is replacing the Panel's recommended \u00a7 357.1058 with a new general section (renumbered \u00a7 357.1060 in this tentative final monograph) for labeling of permitted combinations of active ingredients that conforms with the format of other recently published tentative final monographs. This combination labeling section contains provisions for combining duplicative words or phrases in the indications, warnings, and directions for each active ingredient in the combination, and contains a paragraph covering \"Statement of identity,\" \"Indications,\" \"Warnings,\" and \"Directions.\" The information recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 357.1058(a) is not being included in this tentative final monograph because pyrilamine has been reclassified from Category I to Category III. (See comments 5 and 8 above.) In the Federal Register of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency published a final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications for use of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labeling of OTC drug products are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuous location, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use established under an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated \"APPROVED USES\"; (2) other wording describing such indications for use that meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling, which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated \"APPROVED USES\"; or (3) the approved monograph language on indications, which may appear within a boxed area designated \"APPROVED USES,\" plus alternative language describing indications for use that is not false or misleading, which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug labeling required by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement ofidentity, warnings, and directions) must appear in the specific wording established under the OTC drug monograph where exact language has been established and identified by quotation marks in an applicable monograph or other regulation, e.g., 21 CFR 201,63 or 330.1(g). The proposed rule In this document is subject to the labeling provisions in \u00a7 330.1(c)(2). The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking in conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the Federal Register of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts. The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludes that no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC orally administered menstrual drug products, is a major rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug review was not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemaking for OTC orally administered menstrual drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency invited public comment in the advance nptice of proposed rulemaking regarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC orally administered menstrual drug products. No comments on economic impacts were received. Any comments on the agency's initial determination of the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking should be submitted by March 16, 1989. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore,neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Interested persons may, on or before November 16, 1989, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, written comments, objections, or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. A request for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and time requested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted on or before March 16, 1989. Three copies of all comments, objections, and requests, are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief, Comments, objections, and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced in the Federal Register. Interested persons, on or before March 16, 1989, may also submit in writing new data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditions not classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submitted on or before January 16, 1990. These dates are consistent with the time periods specified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural regulations for reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the Federal Register of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copies of all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Data and comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305) (address above]. Receive4 data and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consider only data submitted prior to the closing of the administrative record on January 16, 1990. Data submitted after the closing of the administrative record will be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is published in the Federal Register, unless the Commissioner finds good cause has been shown that warrants earlier consideration.

IV Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 310, 343, and 369 Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic Drug Products for Over- the-Counter Human Use; Tentative Final Monograph; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking=II 46204 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 21 CFR Parts 310, 343, and 369 [Docket No. 77N-0094] Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic Over- the-Counter Human Use; Tentative Final Monograph AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of a tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which over- the-counter (OTC) internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking after considering the reports and recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products and the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products and the public comments on the advance notices of proposed rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products and OTC menstrual drug products that were based on the Panels' respective recommendations. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA. DATES: Written comments, objections, or requests for oral hearing on the proposed regulation before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs by May 16, 1989. Because of the length and complexity of this proposed regulation, the agency is allowing a period of 180 days for comments and objections instead of the normal 60 days. New data by November 16, 1989. Comments on the new data by January 16, 1990. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination by May 16, 1989. ADDRESS: Written comments, objections, new data, or requests for oral hearing to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT., William E. Gilbertson, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-210), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301- 295-8000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of July 8, 1977 (42 FR 35346), FDA published, under \u00a7 330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, together with the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products (Internal Analgesic Panel), which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients in these drug classes. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by December 5, 1977. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by February 6, 1978. In a notice published in the Federal Register of March 21, 1980 (45 FR 18401), the agency advised that it had reopened the administrative record for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products to allow for consideration of data and information that had been filed in the Dockets Management Branch after the date the administrative record previously had officially closed. The agency concluded that any new data and information filed prior to March 21, 1980 should be available to the agency in developing a proposed regulation in the form of a tentative final monograph. In the Federal Register of December 7, 1982 (47 FR 55076), FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC orally administered menstrual drug products, together with the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products (Miscellaneous Internal Panel), which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by March 7,1983. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial comment period could be submitted by April 6, 1983. In accordance with \u00a7 330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panels were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and Drug Administration (address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. Data and information received after the administrative record for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products was reopened have also been put on display in the Dockets Management Branch. In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, two trade associations, several drug manufacturers, manyhealth professionals, several consumers, a drug-standard-setting association, two health professional associations, a health foundation, and one consumer group submitted comments. Copies of the comments received are also on public display in the Dockets Management Branch. In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC menstrual drug products, the agency received two comments from drug manufacturers relevant to OTC internal analgesic drug products. After reviewing and evaluating the Miscellaneous Internal Panel's recommendations regarding the use of OTC internal analgesic ingredients during the premenstrual and menstrual periods, the agency has determined that it is appropriate to include premenstrual and menstrual claims for these ingredients as part of the rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic drug products rather than to retain them as part of the rulemaking for OTC menstrual drug products and has transferred the comments relevant to those claims to this rulemaking. In this way, the various conditions for which an OTC internal analqesic drug product is safe and effective will be listed in one monograph. The agency's proposed regulation in the form of a tentative final monograph for OTC orally administered menstrual drug products is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. In order to conform to terminology used in the OTC drug review regulations (21 CFR 330.10), the present document is designated as a \"tentative final monograph.\" Its legal status, however, is that of a proposed rule. In this tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish Part 343 (21 CFR Part 343) FDA states for the first time its position on the establishment of a monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products and the use of these products for premenstrual and menstrual symptoms. Final agency action on this matter will occur with the publication at a future date of a final monograph, which will be a final rule establishing a monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products. This proposal constitutes FDA's tentative adoption of the Internal Analgesic Panel's condlusions and recommendations on OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products and the Miscellaneous Internal Panel's conclusions and recommendations on the use of OTC internal analgesic drug products for premenstrual and menstrual symptoms, Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 /'Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules as modified on the basis of the comments received and the agency's independent evaluation of the Panels' reports. Modifications have been made for clarity and regulatory accuracy and to reflect any new information that has come to the agency's attention. Such new information has been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). These modifications are reflected in the following summary of the comments and FDA's responses to them. The Panel's conclusions and recommendations on the ingredient phenacetin are not addressed in this document. OTC drug products containing phenacetin are subject to the notice that FDA published on phenacetin in the Federal Register of October 5, 1983 (48 FR 45466], which requires removal of phenacetin from all prescription and OTC drug products (except for one prescription product on which a hearing request is pending]. The agency published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the reported association of the use of salicylates with Reye syndrome in the Federal Register of December 28,1982 (47 FR 57886). Reye syndrome is a rare, acute, life-threatening condition, which primarily occurs in children or teenagers during the course of or while recovering from a mild respiratory tract infection, flu, chicken pox, or other viral illness. In the Federal Register of December 17, 1985 (50 FR 51400], the agency published a proposed rule to require the labeling of oral OTC aspirin and aspirin-containing drug products to bear a warning that such products should not be used to treat chicken pox or flu symptoms in children and teenagers before consulting a doctor about Reye syndrome. In addition to the warning statement, the agency proposed to prohibit OTC salicylate-containing drug products labeled solely for use by children (pediatric products) from recommending that the products be used in treating flu or chicken pox. The final rule was published in the Federal Register of March 7, 1986 (51 FR 8180). The final rule requires the labeling of orally or rectally administered OTC aspirin- containing drug products to prominently bear the following warning: \"WARNING: Children and teenagers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness.\" In addition, the regulation states that OTC drug products covered by the rule and labeled solely for use by children (pediatric products shall not recommend the product for use intreating flu or chicken pox. This required warning statement and restriction on use of the drug were scheduled to expire June 6,1988 unless extended by the agency through publication for notice and comment in the Federal Register. In the Federal Register of January 22, 1988 (53 FR 1796) the agency published a proposal to make the labeling provision permanent. A final rule was published in the Federal Register of June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21633), which expanded the required warning sratement to make clear that aspirin use in children and teenagers has been reported to be associated with Reye syndrome and made the labeling provision permanent. Therefore, the agency will incorporate the Reye syndrome warning into the final monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products. The agency notes that one provision of the Reye syndrome labeling regulation, i.e., 21 CFR 201.314(h)(3) states that OTC drug products subject to the regulation and labeled solely for use by children (pediatric products) shall not recommend the product for use in treating flu or chicken pox. Because the Reye syndrome warning in \u00a7 201.314(h)(1) applies to both children and teenagers, and teenagers may use other than pediatric products, the agency is not proposing to include flu in the labeling indication for any oral OTC aspirin and aspirin-containing drug products. In addition, FDA noted in the final rule (53 FR 21635) that scentific research to date focuses on the association between Reye syndrome and aspirin, rather than on the broader category of drug products containing nonaspirin salicylates. FDA stated that it will consider extending the warning to nonaspirin salicylates if warranted by further research. Therefore, at this time the agency is not proposing to include flu in the labeling indication for any salicylate preparation. However, the agency is including \"flu\" in the indications allowed for products containing acetaminophen. The agency is also aware of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference on analgesic-associated kidney disease held February 27 to 29, 1984. The NIH Conference issued a statement concluding that considerable evidence indicates that combinations of antipyretic analgesics, taken in large doses over a long period of time, cause a specific form of kidney disease and chronic renal failure. Persons so exposed may be more susceptible to the subsequent development of uroepithelial tumors. The Conference also concluded that, in contrast, there is little evidencethat preparations containing a single analgesic ingredient have been similarly abused and similarly harmful. The Conference recommended that serious consideration should be given to limiting OTC drug products to those containing a single antipyretic-analgesic agent. The agency advises that the final Conference report is being included in this administrative record (see OTC volume O3BTFM), which has now been reopened with publication of this tentative final monograph. The agency invites specific comment on this issue and will address the Conference's recommendations in the final rule. The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10 now provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph. Accordingly, FDA will no longer use the terms \"Category I\" (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded), \"Category II\" (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded, and \"Category III\" (available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage, but will use instead the terms \"monograph conditions\" (old Category I) and\"nonmonograph conditions\" (old Categories II and III). This document retains the concepts of Categories I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph stage. The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products that are subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded (monograph conditions will be effective 12 months after the date of publication of the finalmonograph in the Federal Register. On or after that date, no OTC drug product that is subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition, i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognized as safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved application. Further, any OTC drug product subject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate46205 46206 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules commerce. Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date. In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products (published in the Federal Register of Jy 8, 1977 (42 FR 35348)), the agency suggested that the conditions included in the monograph (Category I) be effective 30 days after the date of publication of the final monograph in the Federal Register and that the conditions excluded from the monograph (Category II) be eliminated from OTC drug products effective 6 months after the date of publication of the final monograph, regardless of whether further testing was undertaken to justify their future use. Experience has shown that relabeling of products covered by the monograph is necessary in order for manufacturers to comply with the monograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have to be written, ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturing process. The agency has determined that it is impractical to expect new labeling to be in effect 30 days after the date of publication of the final monograph. Experience has shown also that if the deadline for relabeling is too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and related paperwork. In addition, some products will have to be reformulated to comply with the monograph. Reformulation often involves the need to do stability testing on the new product. An accelerated aging process may be used to test a new formulation; however, if the stability testing is not successful, and if further reformulation is required, there could be a further delay in having a new product available for manufacture. The agency wishes to establish a reasonable period of time for relabeling and reformulation in order to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the marketplace that could not only result in economic loss, but also interfere with consumers' access to safe and effective drug products. Therefore, the agency is proposing that the final monograph be effective 12 months after the date of its publication in the Federal Register. The agency believes that within 12 months after the date of publication most manufacturers can order new labeling and reformulate their products and have them in compliance in the marketplace. If the agency determines that any labeling for a condition included in the final monograph should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effective date, a shorter deadline may be established.Similarly, if a safety problem is identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a shorter deadline may be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products. All \"OTC Volumes\" cited throughout this document refer to the submissions made by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notice published in the Federal Register of July 21, 1972 (37 FR 14633) or to additional information that has come to the agency's attention since publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above]. I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments and Reply Comments A. General Comments 1. Several comments contended that OTC drug monographs are interpretative, as opposed to substantive, regulations. The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preamble to the procedures for classification of OTC drug products, published in the Federal Register of May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464), and in paragraph 3 of the preamble to the tentative final monograph for antacid drug products, published in the Federal Register of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260]. FDA reaffirms the conclusions stated there. Subsequent court decisions have confirmed the agency's authority to issue substantive regulations by rulemaking. See, e.g., Notional Nutritional Foods Association v. Weinberger, 512 F.2d 688, 698-98 (2d Cir. 1975) and National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers v. FDA, 487 F. Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), affd, 637 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1981). 2. One comment stated that FDA should provide better physician education on the treatment of drug toxicity, as well as on the potential toxicity of medications currently on the market. Other comments suggested that an educational program should be jointly initiated by FDA, the pharmaceutical industry, and the medical and pharmacy professions to better educate consumers on the appropriate use of analgesic products, e.g., the use of aspirin during pregnancy. The agency supports and is actively engaged in educational programs for consumers, physicians, and health professionals. One way in which FDA provides information on drug interactions, toxicities, and other pertinent topics is through the \"FDA Drug Bulletin.\" This publication is routinely mailed to physicians and other health professionals. One issue, forexample, was devoted to alcohol-drug interactions, including possible interactions of alcohol with aspirin, other salicylates, and acetaminophen (Ref. 1). Another issue, which discussed the use of aspirin in patients with a previous myocardial infarction or unstable anginapectoris, included a discussion of adverse reactions that occurred from the doses of aspirin used in the studies (Ref. 2). FDA also has consumer education programs on human drugs. Each program is implemented by FDA consumer affairs officers who provide health-related information, through talks, films, or slides, to diverse groups of people, such as health professionals, parents, teachers, and others. These groups, in turn, often help to disseminate the information further. The consumer education programs on human drugs consist of subprograms such as \"Drugs and Pregnancy\" and \"Safe and Effective Use of Drugs,\" which include publications that provide information on the use of OTC internal analgesic drug products among others. Additional agency publications are also available to consumers. For example, \"FDA Consumer\" and \"FDA Consumer Memo\" have contained articles on drugs and pregnancy and the uses and dangers of OTC drugs that relieve pain (Refs. 3 through 6). As new information becomes available, FDA updates these programs to assure continuing education of both consumers and health professionals. In addition, the agency participates in cooperative private-public programs through such organizations as the National Council on Patient Information and Education, which involves industry, health professionals, and consumers in a variety of education and information programs.

One comment urged that future OTC drug monograph documents of more than 10 pages include a table of contents, an index, and boldface headings throughout the text for ease of Federal Register / Vol. 53, No 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules reading and locating information in the text. In publishing documents in the Federal Register, FDA follows guidelines established by the National Archives and the Office of the Federal Register in an effort to make all government documents consistent in format and style. Since the comment was written, Federal Register format has changed. The new format now includes headings in bold and italic type which make it easier to read and locate information in OTC Panel reports, tentative final monographs, and final monographs. However, no provision has been made for including either tables of contents or indexes in documents published in the Federal Register. 4. Two comments stated that neither a gastroenterologist nor a hematologist served on the Panel and that the expertise of such specialists was essential to the development of the Panel's report. Several other comments questioned the scientific validity of the Panel's report. These comments argued that the Panel frequently misinterpreted information and data to support its conclusions, reached conclusions contrary to the data submitted or testimony presented to it, and relied too heavily on references that are secondary, out-of-date, and unavailable to the scientific community (i.e., not published in scientific journals). The agency points out that, although the Internal Analgesic Panel did not include a gastroenterologist or a hematologist, experts in the fields of gastroenterology and hematology appeared before the Panel to express their views and present data for the Panel's consideration. Thus, the Panel was not denied expertise in these areas in developing its report. In evaluating the scientific validity of the Panel's report, the agency has considered the views expressed in the comments, reviewed current scientific literature, and consulted experts outside the agency when necessary. All data on which the Panel based its conclusions, including published and unpublished references, are available to interested persons, including the scientific community, through the Dockets Management Branch (address above). 5. Two comments believed that the Panel recommended changing the marketing status of aspirin products from OTC to prescription only. The comments opposed such a change and expressed concern that making aspirin products available by prescription only would limit consumers' access to these products and would greatly increase their cost. A third comment assertedthat aspirin should be available only by prescription, but gave no reasons. The Panel found aspirin to be safe and effective for OTC use as an analgesic and antipyretic and did not recommend making aspirin products available only by prescription. The agency agrees with this conclusion and emphasizes that aspirin products will continue to be available OTC. 6. One comment stated that the Panel should have deferred caffeine, as it deferred other ingredients in its report (42 FR 35350), to the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Sedative, Sleep-Aid, and Tranquilizer Drug Products (Sleep-Aid Panel) \"for uses other than an analgesic adjuvant.\" The Internal Analgesic Panel reviewed submissions for caffeine- containing analgesic products that were labeled as analgesics or as analgesic- stimulants. The Panel reviewed caffeine for its safety and effectiveness as an analgesic and as an analgesic adjuvant, but not as a stimulant because stimulant use was reviewed by the Sleep-Aid Panel in its report published in the Federal Register of December 8, 1975 (40 FR 57292). The agency presented its tentative conclusions on caffeine in the OTC nighttime sleep-aid and stimulant products notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register of June 13, 1978 (43 FR 25544). In the Federal Register of February 29, 1988 (53 FR 6100), the agency published a final monograph for OTC stimulant drug products. Any OTC analgesic product containing caffeine for use in restoring alertness or wakefulness will have to follow the dosage and labeling requirements for caffeine established by the agency in that final monograph. 7. One comment from a pharmaceutical firm noted that the firm's name was not included in the list of submissions by firms (42 FR 35348 and 35349). The comment stated that, although this firm did not formally submit data, it presented oral evidence regarding OTC analgesics and , underwrote the cost of statistical evaluation of several papers and editorials. To ensure that FDA is aware of the oral evidence that was presented, the comment provided copies of the transcripts of the sessions at which this company presented testimony. The agency is aware that certain individuals appeared before the Panel to present testimony on behalf of this firm. Their names are included in the list of persons who presented their views to the Panel (42 FR 35347). Because this firm did not submit written data and information in response to the Panel's call-for-data and did not formally submit any data during the course of the Panel'sdeliberations, it is not included in the list of submissions by firms. 8. One comment, supporting the inclusion of \"minor aches and pains of arthritis\" in OTC drug analgesic labeling, argued that the Panel decided at an early stage of its review to limit the indications of antirheumatic products to \"minor aches and pains\" and remove all mention of the minor aches and pains of arthritis. The comment also stated that during the remainder of its review the Panel did not seriously consider any submission or presentation that was not in accord with the Panel's original decision. The Panel considered the arthritis labeling issue several times during its review, including its April 1976 meeting. The Panel gave reasons for its recommendations on arthritis labeling under its general discussion of the labeling of OTC analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products and also in the discussion of antirheumatic agents (42 FR 35354 and 35453). However, because the agency has decided to allow the phrase \"minor pain from arthritis\" as an example in the monograph indication for OTC analgesic drug products, the comment's point is moot. (See comment 17 below.) 9. Two comments from the same source requested that the administrative record for the internal analgesic proposed monograph be kept open so that the transcripts or tapes of the closed meetings of the Panel could be reviewed and commented on. The comments stated that these transcripts and tapes were not released by FDA until after the comment period closed. .The original comment's request was dated December 1977. In response to a Freedom of Information [FOI) request (FOI file number F77-15,747), the. transcripts and tapes of the Internal Analgesic Panel's closed meetings were made available to the comment source on May 17,1978, after being reviewed by FDA for deletion of trade secrets, patient names, and other nondisclosable information. Since then the agency has not received from the comment source any new data or information relating to the transcripts or any petition to reopen the administrative record. Transcripts of panel meetings are not included in the administrative record. See 21 CFR 330.10(a)(10). The reasons for this are stated in the preamble to the \"Proposal to Designate the Contents and the Time of Closing of the Administrative Record,\" published in the Federal Register of June 4, 1974 (39 FR 19878), and published as a final rule in the Federal Register of November 8,1974 (39 FR 39556).46207 46208 Federal Register / Vol 53, No 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules Because of the length of time since the FOI request was granted, the agency sees no reason at this point to consider having the record \"kept open.\" All interested persons may submit written comments for a period of 180 days after the publication of this tentative final monograph. Any comments relating to the transcripts of the panel meetings should state the reasons that would warrant the agency's consideration of the transcripts, notwithstanding the reasons given by the agency for not .ordinarily considering them. .B. Comments on InternalAnalgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic Labeling 10. Several comments contended that there is no statutory authority for the codification of exact words to be used in describing the modes of action and the symptoms to be relieved by an OTC drug. The comments stated that existing statutory provisions (15 U.S.C. 1453(a), 21 CFR 201.61, and sections 508 and 502(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (hereafter referred to as the act) (21 U.S.C. 358 and 352(e)) do not show a congressional intent to authorize FDA to legislate'the exact wording of OTC drug claims to the exclusion of other equally accurate and truthful claims for these products, and that section 502(c) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 352(c)) demonstrates a congressional intent to the contrary. The comments argued that any language fulfilling the statutory requirement should be satisfactory, and recommended that FDA provide for more flexibility of wording in OTC drug product labeling by adding the following statement to each list of approved indications: \"or similar indication statements which are in keeping with the Panel's Report.\" In the Federal Register of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258). the agency published a final rule changing its labeling policy forstating the indications for use of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labeling of OTC drug products are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuous location, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use established under an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated \"APPROVED USES\"; (2) other wording describing such indications for use that meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling, which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated \"APPROVED USES\"; or (3) the approved monograph language on indications, which may appear within a boxed area designated \"APPROVED USES,\" plus alternative language describing indications for use that is notfalse or misleading, which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug labeling required by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity, warnings, and directions) must appear in the specific wording established under the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where exact language has been established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., 21 CFR 201.63 or 330.1(g). The proposed rule in this document is subject to the labeling provisions in \u00a7 330.1(c)(2). 11. One comment argued that the labeling proposed by the Panel contains extensive and complicated wording and may well be contrary to the intention of section 502(c) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(c)), which states that OTC drug labeling is to be written in terms that consumers can easily understand. In all of its decisions on labeling, the agency seriously considers the consumer's comprehension of the intended message in the labeling. The agency has thoroughly reviewed the Panel's recommended labeling and has modified it where necessary to make it clearer to consumers. Specific comment is invited on the labeling in this tentative final monograph, including comments on consumer understanding of the wording. 12. Two comments objected to the Panel's recommendation that all inactive ingredients be listed in the labeling of OTC analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products. The comments argued that a list of inactive ingredients in the labeling would be meaningless, confusing, and misleading to most consumers. The comments noted that the act does not require that inactive ingredients of drug products be included on a label and argued that listing these ingredients would crowd out information that is more meaningful to consumers. The agency agrees that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not require the identification of all inactive ingredients in the labeling of OTC drug products. Section 502(e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(e)) does require disclosure of active ingredients and of certain ingredients, whether included as active or inactive components in a product. Although the act does not require the disclosure of all inactive ingredients in the labeling of OTC drug products, the agency agrees with the Panel that listing of inactive ingredients in OTC drug product labeling would be useful information for some consumers. Consumers with known allergies or intolerances to certain ingredients would then be able to identify substances that they may wish to avoid.The Proprietary Association, the trade association that represents approximately 85 OTC drug manufacturers who reportedly market between 90 and 95 percent of the volume of all OTC drug products sold in the United States, has established guidelines (Ref. 1)for its member companies to list voluntarily inactive ingredients in the labeling of OTC drug products. Under another voluntary program begun in 1974, the member companies of The Proprietary Association have been including the quantities of active ingredients on OTC drug labels. The agency is not at this time proposing to require the listing of inactive ingredients in OTC drug product labeling. However, the agency commends these voluntary efforts and urges all other OTC drug manufacturers to similarly label their products. References (1) \"Guidelines for Disclosure of Inactive Ingredients in OTC Medicines,\" The Proprietary Association, Washington, July 12, 1984, in OTC Volume 03BTFM. 13. One comment supported, while others objected to, the 10-day limitation on aspirin use recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(i): \"Do not take this product for more than 10 days.\" The supporting comment stated that this recommended warning is consistent with the current medical knowledge of aspirin. Other comments objected to the warning on the grounds that it implies to consumers that aspirin products are unsafe or toxic if taken for more than 10 days; that there is no scientific, medical, or legal justification for the recommendation that chronic arthritis patients see a physician every 10 days; and that a delay of much longer than 10 days is needed before consulting a physician because early examination to rule out serious rheumatoid disease is expensive and does not yield results. The opposing comments also argued that many physicians recommend the use of aspirin beyond 10 days and that the consumer, after reading the 10-day warning, might be reluctant to follow the physician's advice. The following alternative wording was suggested, with the explanation that this warning directs that self-medication should not exceed 10 days: \"If pain persists for more than 10 days... consult a physician immediately.\" The agency points out that the 10-day warning was not intended to apply only to arthritic patients, as one comment appears to have interpreted it. As another comment stated,\" * * self- medication (with analgesic drug products) should not continue for more Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 I Proposed Rules than 10 days at one time.\" The intent of the 10-day warning is to inform all consumers, including arthritic patients, that analgesic drug products should not be taken for more than 10 days \"unless directed by a doctor,\" so that serious conditions do not go undiagnosed and untreated. (See 42 FR 35351.) To reflect this intent, the agency is adding the words \"unless directed by a doctor\" to the warning for adults in I 343.50(c)(1)(i) and the corresponding warning for children in \u00a7 343.50(c)(2)(i). The agency does not believe that these warnings will imply to consumers that analgesic products are unsafe or toxic if taken for more than 10 days (or 5 days for children). 14. One comment supported, and others opposed, that portion of the recommended warning for analgesic and antipyretic products in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(i) that advises the consumer to consult a physician if symptoms persist or new . ones occur. The comment that favored the warning stated that it is consistent with the state of medical knowledge concerning aspirin. One comment, opposing the warning argued that informing the consumer to consult a physician if new symptoms occur may unduly alarm the consumer and could burden doctors with additional inquiries from consumers. Another comment stated that new but not unusual symptoms that respond to self-treatment may be expected during the normal course of a self-limited disease, e.g., the fever that develops during a stage of the common cold. The comments suggested the following alternative wording for \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(i) and (ii): \"If symptoms persist or get worse, consult your physician\"; or \"If symptoms persist, or new unexpected ones occur, consult your physician.\" The agency agrees that worsening symptoms should be mentioned in the. warning because this alerts the consumer to consult a doctor when one is needed, e.g., upon the development of secondary infection, rather than only after a 10-day (adults) or 5-day (children) maximum limit for self- treatment. The warning has been amended accordingly. The agency does not believe that informing the consumer to consult a doctor if new symptoms occur would unduly frighten consumers or further burden doctors. For clarity and precision, the agency is revising this portion of the warning to read, \"if pain or fever persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur .* *,\" in proposed \u00a7 343.50(c) (1)(i) and (2)(i). (See comment 18 below for further revision in the warnings.)15. Two comments agreed with, and many comments objected to, the Panel's recommended Category I labeling Indication for internal analgesic active ingredients in \u00a7 343.50(a)(1), \"For the temporary relief of occasional minor aches, pains, and headache.\" The comments supporting this limited indication argued that indications that describe specific types of pain mislead the consumer because they imply a treatment of these conditions and encourage inappropriate self-diagnosis and self-treatment. The comments also argued~that such labeling suggests to consumers that one product offers unique advantages over another for the specific indications stated on the label. Some comments objected to the terms$$occasional,\" \"minor,\" or \"temporary\" because they are unnecessary, indefinite, or meaningless to consumers. Many comments that opposed the recommended indication supported more specific indications that currently appear on many OTC internal analgesic drug products, e.g., \"for low back pain,\" the relief of minor sore throat pain,\" and \"for pains caused by colds.\" A consumer survey was submithed to show the need for expanding the recommended indication (Ref. 1). The comments argued that expanding the labeling would not imply treatment of these conditions, but would aid the consumer in selecting OTC internal analgesic drug products, thereby avoiding the expense of unnecessary visits to a physician and overburdening the health care system. The comments asserted that it is inconsistent for the Internal Analgesic Panel to prohibit the indication 'Tor cold symptoms,\" while the Advisory Raview Panel on OTC Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Products (Cough- Cold Panel) allows this indication for Category I combination products containing internal analgesics. Two comments contended that the use and effectiveness of analgesic ingredients in relieving the pain of sore throat is generally recognized and submitted excerpts of several references to support their statement (Ref. 2). The Panel recommended a limited indication for OTC internal analgesic- antipyretic drug products in the belief that it was preferable to listing all of the various types of minor pain that these products couldbe used for. The Panel found that the various claims on the labels it reviewed were often vague and lacked clarity. The Panel was concerned .that a plethora of claims would be -confusing and misleading to the consumer (42 FR 35355). However, the agency does not believe that a statement describing one or more specific types of pain on an analgesic- antipyretic drug product properly labeled with the active ingredient and with the statement of identity (e.g.,\"pain reliever-fever reducer\") would mislead consumers. Such labeling would be helpful to consumers to provide them with examples 'of the general types of pain for which OTC internal analgesic drug products are useful. Therefore, the agency is providing manufacturers the option of providing a limited or an expanded indications statement. For the reasons described below, the agency is proposing the following indications for OTC internal analgesic drug products: \"For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains\" (which may be followed by one or more of the following: (\"associated with\" (select one or by: \"(dysmenorrhea)\"), or\"premenstrual and menstrual cramps\" (which may be followed by: \"(dysmenorrhea)\"))), (\"and for the minor pain from arthritis.\")] (This statement is further expanded in comment 16 below to include fever labeling.) The types of pain described above are the only ones now being proposed to be allowed in the labeling of OTC internal analgesic drug products. A similar expanded indication is being proposed for products labeled for pediatric use. Minor pain from arthritis is not included as an example in the labeling for pediatric products because when this type of pain occurs in children, it should be treated by a doctor. For the same reason,' minor pain associated with backache or muscular aches is not included in the labeling; the underlying cause of these kinds of pain in children should be determined by a doctor. Because the agency does not consider indications concerning premenstrual and menstrual pain appropriate for pediatric analgesic products, these claims are also not being included in the proposed labeling for products for pediatric use. The terms \"muscular aches\" and \"backache\" adequately represent most musculoskeletal aches and pains and are preferable to listing all the specific areas of the body that could be involved. The Panel classified \"low back pain\" as Category II because it believed that the indication implied to consumers that OTC analgesic drug products could be used to treat arthritic conditions (4246209 46210 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules FR 35454 and 35467). However, the agency recognizes that low back pain is not necessarily due to arthritis but may be due to causes amenable to OTC treatment such as minor strains or overexertion. The agency believes that low back pain amenable to treatment with OTC analgesic drug products is appropriately described by the terms..muscle aches\" and \"backache\" in the proposed indication and therefore is not including the claim \"low back pain\" in the proposed monograph. Because the agency believes that consumers are familiar with the words \"low back pain\" and proposes to require labeling that would warn consumers against the use of OTC analgesic drug products for more than 10 days and to consult a doctor if symptoms persist or get worse or if new symptoms occur (in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(i)), the agency would not object to the use of the claim \"low back pain\" elsewhere on the label provided it is not intermixed with labeling established by the monograph. Similarly, the agency is not proposing to include the claim \"pain of sinusitis\" in the proposed monograph because it believes that this type of pain is adequately described by the term \"headache\" in the proposed indication, However, the agency also would not object to the use of this claim provided it is not intermixed with labeling established by the monograph. Claims relating to sinusitis are addressed in the tentative final monograph for OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and antiasthmatic combination drug products, published in the Federal Register of August 12, 1988 (53 FR 30522). (For a discussion of the agency's decision to include \"minor pain from arthritis\" in the statement of indications, see comment 17 below.) Claims relating to menstrual pain were classified in Category II by the Panel (42 FR 35434). However, these claims were also reviewed by the Miscellaneous Internal Panel. The agency has reviewed that Panel's recommendations regarding OTC internal analgesic active ingredients for use during the premenstrual and menstrual periods and concurs with the Panel that any Category I OTC internal analgesic ingredient is safe and effective for the relief of pain associated with the premenstrual and menstrual periods and/or with premenstrual or menstrual cramps. In reviewing the various menstrual claims recommended by the Panel, the agency notes that the Panel placed in Category I a claim \"for the relief of pain of dysmenorrhea.\" However, the agency does not believe that \"dysmenorrhea,\" when used alone, is a word that is commonly understoodby consumers. In addition, this word was not used in any of the OTC drug product labeling submitted to the Panel. Therefore, the agency has not provided for its use as a sole indication, but has provided for its optional use parenthetically with other terms, e.g., \"* * * minor aches and pains * * * associated with the premenstrual and menstrual periods\" (which may be followed by: \"(dysmenorrhea}'). For the reasons discussed in comment 6 of the tentative final monograph for OTC menstrual drug products (published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register), the labeling being proposed for these products does not distinguish between the menstrual and premenstrual periods. The agency is including the claim\"sore throat\" in the proposed indication after reviewing the various panels' recommendations, and applicable current and proposed regulations. The agency notes that sore throat in most cases is due to a self-limiting condition that resolves itself without treatment. However, the agency is aware that sore throat, mild as it may seem, may be a symptom of a more serious condition that is not amenable to self-diagnosis or self-treatment, such as a streptococcal infection (\"strep throat\"), which if left untreated may progress to rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis (47 FR 22773). Because of the risk of serious illness if appropriate treatment of a sore throat is unduly delayed, the agency currently recommends that all OTC drug products indicated for the relief of sore throat display the following warning statement: \"Warning-severe or persistent sore throat or sore throat accompanied by high fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting may be serious. Consult physician promptly. Do not use for more than 2 days or administer to children under 3 years of age unless directed by physician,\" (21 CFR 369.20). Although the Internal Analgesic Panel did not specifically address this warning, the agency is proposing to include a modified version in \u00a7 343.50 (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(ii) of this tentative final monograph. The agency is proposing to revise the current warning to make it consistent in format with warnings proposed in other current OTC drug tentative final monographs and is proposing that any analgesic drug product labeled for the relief of minor sore throat pain include the following warning. \"If sore throat is severe, persists for more than 2 days, is accompanied or followed by fever, headache, rash, nausea, or vomiting, consult a doctor promptly.\"Because sore throat accompanied by rash could be indicative of several illnesses not amenable to OTC drug self- treatment, such as rheumatic fever or measles (Ref. 2), the agency believes that consumers should be warned against the use of aspirin when a rash is present. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include the word \"rash\" in the new proposed warning. The agency is not proposing to include the word \"high\" as descriptive of fever, as contained in the current warning in 21 CFR 369.20, because the agency believes that it is important for the consumer to recognize the presence of fever associated with sore throat regardless of whether the fever is high or low. The agency is also not proposing to include that portion of the current warning against administering the drug to children 3 years of age without consulting a physician. The Internal Analgesic Panel recommended labeling that provided for the use of analgesics in children 2 years of age. In the tentative final monograph for OTC oral health care drug products, the agency concluded that most Category I anesthetic/anaglesic ingredients, such as benzocaine and dyclonine hydrochloride, could be labeled for the temporary relief of minor sore throat in children 2 years of age or older (53 FR 2458). Therefore, the agency is proposing in this tentative final monograph for the labeling to provide for the use of analgesics for minor sore throat pain in children 2 years of age or older. The agency is retaining the term \"minor\" to describe the aches and pains that are amenable to OTC treatment, as opposed to more severe symptoms that should be treated by a doctor. The term \"temporary\" remains in the indications statement to indicate the type of relief given by OTC internal analgesic drug products. The term \"occasional\" is being deleted from the Panel's recommended labeling because the agency believes that the warnings included in the tentative final monograph are sufficient to warn consumers against the chronic use of OTC analgesics unless advised by a doctor.

(3) Berkow, R., editor, \"The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy,\" 14th Ed., Merck and Co., Rahway, NJ, pp. 81-87, 1976. 10. Several comments objected to the antipyretic active ingredient labeling recommended in \u00a7 343.50(a)(2), \"For the Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules reduction of fever,\" because it does not include the common cold and flu. The comments stated that fever associated with colds and flu is the most common type of fever for which self-medication is appropriate, and that eliminating the terms \"common cold\" and \"flu\" from the labeling would deny the consumer necessary information for safe and effective self-medication. The agency believes that manufacturers should be able to inform consumers of the relationship between the common cold and fever, and is providing a number of options for labeling analgesic-antipyretic drug products so that this can be done if the manufacturer desires. With regard to the term \"flu,\" the agency published a final rule on Reye syndrome and salicylate drug products entitled \"Labeling for Oral and Rectal Over-the-Counter Aspirin and Aspirin-Containing Drug Products; Reye Syndrome Warning\" in the Federal Register of June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21633). This rule provides that such products labeled solely for use by children (pediatric products) shall not recommend the product for use in treating flu or chicken pox. Because the warning required on all aspirin- containing products includes both children and teenagers (see discussion of final rule earlier in this document) and because of the possibility of teenagers using other than pediatric products, the agency has decided not to add \"flu\" to the label indications for any aspirin-containing product at this time. In addition, while FDA noted in the final rule (53 FR 21635) that scientific research to date focuses on the association between Reye syndrome and aspirin, concerns have been raised about the use of the broader category of drug products containing nonaspirin salicylates in children and teenagers with \"flu.\" Therefore, at this time the agency is not proposing to include flu in the labeling indication for any salicylate preparation. However, the labeling prohibition on this \"flu\" claim does not apply to the internal analgesic- antipyretic ingredient acetaminophen. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include the term \"flu\" in the indication for acetamindphen. Section 343.50(a) (2) and (3), as recommended by the Panel, are being deleted, and the Panel's recommended indication for any Category I analgesic/ antipyretic ingredient in \u00a7 revised as follows: the temporary relief of minor aches and pains\" [which may be followed by one or more of the following: (\"associated with\" (select one by: \"(dysmenorrhea)\"), or\"premenstrual and menstrual cramps\" (which may be followed by: \"(dysmenorrhea)\"))), (\"and for the minor pain from arthritis\"), and (\"and to reduce fever.\"] The labeling being proposed for products marketed exclusively for children is as follows: \"For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains\" [which may be followed by: (\"associated with\" to reduce fever\".)] The agency is also proposing that the term \"flu\" may be added to ,these revised indications for products containing acetaminophen. In addition, the agency is proposing that all OTC analgesic-antipyretic drug products bear a statement of identity as a \"pain reliever\" or \"analgesic (pain reliever).\" If the product is also labeled to include the indication \"to reduce fever,\" then the statement of identity is\"pain reliever-fever reducer\" or\"analgesic (pain reliever)-antipyretic (fever reducer).\" 17. One comment agreed with the Panel's recommendation that OTC analgesic drugs should not be labeled for the relief of pain from arthritis, adding that such labeling could be misleading to consumers. The comment stated that consumers may equate relief of pain with effective treatment of self- diagnosed \"arthritis,\" thus preventing or delaying the diagnosis and proper treatment of a rheumatic disease and that OTC dosages of aspirin \"rarely if ever\" have anti-inflammatory activity. Other comments disagreed with the Panel's recommendation and urged that labeling of OTC antirheumatic products include their use for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains from arthritis and rheumatism for the following reasons: (1) Consumers should not be denied such information, and to do so would plac& increasing demands on doctors and economic burdens on consumers and the health care system; (2) aspirin has an anti-inflammatory effect at OTC dosages, but the Panel's recommended labeling may lead some consumers to believe that aspirin products are unsuitable for relieving arthritis pain, and they may turn to undesirable treatment alternatives, such as diet fads or copper jewelr'y;(3) minor arthritic syndromes can be managed by self-medication with OTC internal analgesics without leading to serious medical consequences from delays intreatment of progressive diseases such as rheumatoid or gonococcal arthritis. The agency agrees that arthritis cannot be self-diagnosed, but recognizes that OTC analgesics are effective in relieving \"minor pain\" associated with arthritic conditions. Descriptive labeling of this nature is now widely used in the labeling of OTC analgesic drug products, e.g., \"for the temporary relief of minor arthritic pain.\" The agency does not believe that such labeling is misleading to consumers. As discussed in comment 15 above, the agency is proposing to expand the indications for OTC analgesic drug products to include examples of pain amenable to self- with the premenstrual or menstrual periods,\" or \"minor pain from arthritis.\" Although the terms \"arthritis\" and \"rheumatism\" are used interchangeably by some consumers, the agency believes that \"arthritis\" is more accurate, more precise, and more readily understood by the majority of consumers. Instead of denying consumers information on the use of OTC analgesics for relieving the minor pain from arthritis, the agency believes it would be more appropriate to provide such labeling. Consumers are warned against use for more than 10 days and to consult a doctor if pain persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present. These warnings should be sufficient to encourage consumers with persistent pain or inflammation who believe they have arthritis to consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. (See comments 18 and 19 below.) 18. One comment recommended a warning for OTC analgesic drug products that would alert consumers with symptoms of arthritis to consult a doctor if pain persists for more than 5 days or if redness is present. Because the agency is expanding the indications labeling for analgesic ingredients to include minor pain from arthritis, the warnings recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1) (i) and (ii) are being revised to alert consumers to symptoms of inflammation (redness or swelling), which may appear in conditions such as arthritis and which signal the need to consult a doctor. Because the indications for pain and fever may be combined, the warnings are also being combined to inform 'consumers to consult a doctor if pain or, fever persists or worsens and to include the 3-day limit for fever. The comment submitted no data to support its request462.11 I 46212 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules to shorten the limit of OTC analgesic use for symptoms of arthritis to 5 days. In the absence of such data, the agency proposes to retain the 10day limit for self-medicating for pain. Recognizing that certain OTC analgesic drug products may be labeled for use in adults and children, for use in children only, or for use in adults only, the agency is proposing the following warnings in the tentative final monograph to replace those recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343,50(c)(1) and (2): (1) For products labeled for adults-i) For products containing any ingredient in \u00a7 343.10. \"Do not take this product for pain for more than 10 days or for fever for more than 3 days unless directed by a doctor. If pain or fever persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present, consult a doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition. (2) Farproducts labeled for children 2 years to under 12 years of age-(i) For products containing any ingredient in \u00a7 343.10. \"Do not give this product for pain for more than 5 days or for fever for more than 3 days unless directed by a doctor. If pain or fever persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present, consult a doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition:' (3) Forproducts labeled both for adults and for children 2 years to under 12 years of age * * *. \"Do not take this product for pain for more than 10 days (for adults) or 5 days (for children), and do not take for fever for more than 3 days unless directed by a doctor. If pain or fever persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present, consult a doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition. Do not give this product to children for the pain of arthritis unless directed by a doctor.\" 19. Several comments disagreed with the arthritis warning for OTC aspirin drug products recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(i): \"Take this product for the treatment of arthritis only under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" The comments also disagreed with the warning for acetaminophen products recommended in \u00a7 343.50(c)[5)(iij: \"Do not take this product for the treatment of arthritis except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" One comment .questioned why the warnings were different and recommended that the warning for aspirin in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(i) also be used for acetaminophen because both drugs are commonly recommended by physicians for the pain from arthritis.Other comments opposed identical warnings for aspirin and acetaminophen, but also opposed the warnings recommended by the Panel for both drugs (i.e., \u00a7 343.50(c) (3)(i) and (5)(ii)), arguing that these warnings are so similar that consumers probably would not perceive their intended difference. These comments added that the Panel's recommended arthritis warning for acetaminophen may lead consumers to believe that iacetaminophen is effective in treating arthritis. Emphasizing that acetaminophen, unlike aspirin, has no anti-inflammatory effect and cannot be used to treat arthritis, one comment suggested that the recommended warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(5)(ii) be replaced with the following: \"Do not take this product for the treatment of arthritis.\" As an alternative to this warning, a comment suggested the following warning: \"Do not take this product for the relief of arthritis symptoms except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" Another comment suggested that, because aspirin can be used to treat arthritis, the following statement be incorporated with the dosage schedule of OTC aspirin drug products in place of the recommended warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(i): \"Dosage for arthritis and rheumatic conditions should be only under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" The agency agrees that it may be difficult for consumers to distinguish between the warnings recommended by the Panel for aspirin and acetaminophen. Although aspirin is an anti-inflammatory agent, acetaminophen is not. Consumers might incorrectly interpret the Panel's acetaminophen warning (\u00a7 343.50(c}{5)(ii]] to mean that acetaminophen is effective in the treatment of arthritis. To avoid misinterpretation and confusion, the agency is not including this warning in the monograph. Similarly, the agency does not believe that acetaminophen products should bear the warning recommended by the Panel for aspirin products in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(i), because consumers could also misinterpret this warning to mean that acetaminophen can be used to treat arthritis. An indication for the relief of \"minor pain from arthritis\" is being proposed for the labeling of both aspirin and acetaminophen products. However, an indication for the treatment of the arthritis itself is not being proposed for any OTC internal analgesic drug product because such treatment should be conducted only under the supervision of a doctor. Different labeling statements on aspirin and acetaminophen drug products regarding arthritis, assuggested by some of the comments, might encourage self-diagnosis and self- treatment of arthritis. The warning being proposed in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(i) of this document for all Category I ingredients should lead consumers with arthritis symptoms to consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment of the condition. (See comments 17 and 18 above.) For these reasons, the, agency proposes not to adopt the comments' suggestions and is not including either the Panel's recommended \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(i) or \u00a7 343.50(c)5)(ii) in the tentative final monograph. 20. Two comments maintained that the agency should permit the names of OTC analgesic drug products to reflect the uses of the products. The comments specifically requested permission to include the term \"arthritis\" in certain product names. One comment disagreed, arguing that product names which specifically refer to \"arthritis,\" such as\"arthritis strength,\" \"arthritis pain formula,\" or \"rheumatism preparation,\" imply that these products are uniquely effective for arthritis and will encourage improper self-diagnosis and inappropriate and potentially hazardous therapy. The agency agrees that product names can be informative and that they should not be misleading. Medically descriptive product names, e.g., \"arthritis pain formula,\" are not required and are not included in the monograph. These names are considered to be outside the scope of the OTC drug review, but are subject to the provisions in section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or-misleading. Such terms will be evaluated by the agency in conjunction with normal enforcement activities relating to that section of the act. 21. One comment stated that the labels of OTC analgesic and antipyretic drug products should include a warning that these products suppress the body's defense mechanisms. The comment explained that, although the antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin cause a temporary relief of unpleasant symptoms, the disease process is disguised; valuable defense mechanisms such as inflammation and increased body temperature are impaired; and the illness is thereby prolonged. The comment submitted no evidence to support the statement that analgesic and antipyretic drug products suppress the body's defense mechanisms and thereby prolong illness, and the agency is aware of none. Therefore, the agency is not proposing to include a warning in the monograph as suggested by the comment. The agency considers the Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 ] Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules revised 10-day and 5-day warnings for analgesic drug products in \u00a7 343.50(c](1)(i), (2)(i), and (3) in this tentative final monograph adequate to warn consumers to obtain professional help if symptoms persist or get worse or if new symptoms occur. 22. Two comments objected to the 5- day limitation of use of analgesic and antipyretic drug products by children under 12 years of age in the Panel's recommended warning statement in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(ii). The comments agreed with the Panel that the period of OTC use of analgesic and antipyretic drugs in children under 12 years of age should be limited, but disagreed over the length of time. Suggested alternatives were 2 or 3 days. One comment argued that this warning implies that OTC analgesic drug products are unsafe or toxic if used longer than 5 days. The agency is proposing the following revised warning for children 2 years to under 12 years of age in \u00a7 343.50(c)(2)(i}: \"Do not give this product for pain for more than 5 days or for fever for more than 3 days unless directed by a doctor. If pain or fever persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present, consult a doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition,\" (see comment 18 above). The comments submitted no data to support their suggestions for shorter time limitations. The Internal Analgesic Panel based its recommendation of a 5- day limitation for children on reports from poison control center data and on computer simulations that demonstrated that the plasma salicylate level could exceed 20 milligrams per 100 milliliters (mg/mL} (a toxic level) \"among some smaller children of a particular age category following the recommended dosage schedule after 5 days\" (42 FR 35368). The agency believes these data provide sufficient reason to propose the Panel's recommended 5-day use limitation for children. 23. Several comments opposed the number and length of warning statements the Panel recommended for OTC analgesic and antipyretic drug products. One comment expressed concern that an extensive list of warnings for products containing aspirin, compared to a shorter list for acetaminophen drug products, will lead consumers to conclude that aspirin drug products are more toxic and less useful than acetaminophen drug products. Other comments urged FDA to limit warning statements to those that are scientifically documented, clinically significant, and important to the appropriate use of the products by the average consumer. These commentsfurther urged that the statements be combined and condensed for ease of consumer understanding and to avoid label clutter that may cause consumers to ignore cautions and warnings in the labeling. One comment suggested the use of supplementary circulars, etc. FDA agrees that the warning statements for OTC drug products should be limited to those that are scientifically documented, clinically significant, and important for the safe and effective use of the products by consumers. The agency is requiring warning statements for each ingredient on this basis, not on the basis of a comparable number of warnings for each ingredient. Warning statements are also being combined and condensed whenever possible for ease of consumer understanding. In addition, manufacturers are free to design ways of incorporating all required information in labeling, e.g., using flap labels, redesigning packages, or using a package insert. 24. Many comments opposed warnings that cite organs of the body as possible sites of damage by internal analgesic drug products, with some comments referring specifically to the Panel's recommended liver warning for acetaminophen in \u00a7 343.50(c)(5](i). These comments argued that naming an organ that may be injured from an acute overdose or from excessive use of an analgesic drug would place the responsibility of recognizing organ damage on the consumer, who would then be assuming the role of a physician. The comments further argued that this kind of label warning may be misunderstood and may either alarm or cause anxiety in consumers who use drugs rationally. On the other hand, the comments added, such labeling may provide information that may induce individuals to harm themselves. The comments favored a single, more general warning for all OTC internal analgesic drug products, such as the following: \"Do not take this product for more than 10 days unless directed by a physician. Excessive use over a long period of time may cause permanent injury.\" One comment suggested that, if such a general warning is not adopted, all OTC drug products should bear labeling which fully discloses the conditions under which damage may occur. The agency is not proposing to include the general warning suggested by the comments in this tentative final monograph. FDA believes that the self- medicating consumer should be made aware of potential risks of a particular OTC drug product through label warnings. As discussed in comment 25below, the agency agrees that the warnings need not specify the toxic effects on particular organs of the body that can be caused by acute overdose of a drug, as in a suicide attempt, and is not proposing the Panel's recommended liver warning for acetaminophen in this tentative final monograph. However, the agency concludes that the warnings should include specific information on the known side effects or adverse reactions that may occur from use of the drug according to labeled directions, as well as potential dangers that may occur if the labeled directions are exceeded. The agency concludes that when medical evidence shows that toxicity is associated with the use of an OTC drug, either within its recommended dosage or when used beyond its recommended time limit or dosage (except for acute overdose), it is appropriate to warn consumers of the potential toxicity. In such cases it may be necessary to include organ-specific warnings as well as general labeling statements. 25. Many comments opposed the liver warning recommended by the Panel for acetaminophen drug products in \u00a7 343.50(c}(5}(i), \"Do'not exceed recommended dosage because severe liver damage may occur.\" Some comments argued that acetaminophen taken in recommended OTC dosage ranges shows no evidence of hepatotoxicity and that the labeling required in \u00a7 330.1(g), \"Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately,\" provides sufficient warning to consumers. The comments expressed concern that the liver warning recommended by the Panel may discourage consumers from ever using acetaminophen and that this warning may also encourage suicidal persons to abuse acetaminophen drug products. The comments also argued that the liver warning is especially inappropriate for children's acetaminophen drug products because there is a lack of documented fatalities and serious liver damage in children from acute acetaminophen overdose. The comments stated there may be differences between the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen in children and adults that would cause children to be less vulnerable to acetaminophen toxicity. Other comments endorsed the recommended liver warning and pointed out that there are no unique signs of acetaminophen toxicity, such as ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and that symptoms of acetaminophen toxicity do not appear until a few days after the overdose.46213 46214 Federat Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules Noting that consumers are increasing their use of acetaminophen and that fatalities and liver damage have occurred in children, the comments argued that the recommended warning may discourage consumers from exceeding the recommended daily OTC dosage of acetaminopher and make consumers and doctors aware of the consequence of acetaminophen overdose. One comment, concerned about toxicity from the chronic use of acetaminophen in dosages of less than 4 grams (g) per day, suggested that the proposed liver warning be revised to place additional emphasis on the recommended limit of self-treatment with acetaminophen as follows: \"Do not exceed recommended dosage or take for more than 10 days, because severe liver damage may occur.\" Another comment suggested that the recommended warning be revised to state the dosage that will cause hepatotoxicity, for example, 40 or more, 325-mg tablets taken as a single dose. After evaluating the data and information submitted, the agency has tentatively decided not to adopt the liver warning recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c)(5)(i). The agency is aware that liver damage can occur from acetaminopher overdosage, as explained by the Panel (42 FR 35414). However, the agency believes that warnings need not include information on the specific toxic effects on organs of the body caused by acute overdose of a drug, as in. suicide. (See comment 24 above.} The agency also considers it* inadvisable to specify hepatotoxic dosage levels in consumer labeling, as one comment suggested, because such labeling could be suggestive to suicidal individuals. The agency has noted two reports of hepatotoxicity in children who overdosed on acetaminophen. Arena, Rourk, and Sibrack (Ref. 1) described a 3-year-old girl who ingested 35 tablets of acetaminophen 325 mg and suffered decreased consciousness, vomiting, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. At that time the serum ammonia level was 82 micrograms per deciliter (pg/dL). She was admitted to the hospital about 24 hours after ingestion. The serum acetaminophen level was 94 micrograms per milliliter (Ipg/mL) 24 hours after ingestion; 48 hours after ingestion it dropped to 26 l.g/mL. Seventy-two hours after the overdose, serum serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase of 13,303 LU. The patient was alert and ipgood spirits by the second day in the hospital and was discharged I week later. Seven weeks after discharge her liver enzymes were normal. Although this child weighed only 31 pounds and had ingested 11.375 g acetaminophen, resulting in phenomenal transaminase levels and a high plasma level of acetaminophen at 24 hours, she survived without any aftereffects. As one comment noted, this case suggests that a child's liver may be less vulnerable to the hepatotoxic effects of acetaminophen overdosage than an adult's. The agency points out, however, that before conclusions can be made on the potential toxicity of acetaminophen in children, more data are needed on the metabolism of acetaminophen and clinical observations in children (Ref. 2). Carloss (Ref. 3) reported the death of a 3V-year-old girl who had an upper respiratory infection and was being treated with acetaminophen. The child was given 120 mg of acetaminophen syrup every 4 hours for three doses. Her doctor later increased the dose to 720 mg every 3 hours. During the next 24 hours she took 5.04 g acetaminophen and was hospitalized for nausea and vomiting. Fourteen hours after the last dose, the acetaminophen level was 5.3 mg/dL (therapeutic range, I to 3 mg/dL), well in the range of hepatotoxicity. The child was discharged from the hospital the next morning, but was readmitted 16 hours later with a serum glutamic- oxaloacetic transaminase level of 22,000 LU. and subsequently died. The child described by Carloss (Ref. 3) was approximately the same age as the one described by Arena, Rourk, and Sibrack (Ref. 1). Neither child had been treated with an antidote for acetaminophen poisoning, such as N- acetylcysteine. It is difficult to explain why the child who had ingested 5.04 g acetaminophen died, and the child who had ingested 11.375 g acetaminophen survived. Regarding chronic use of acetaminophen within recommended OTC dosages, the agency at this time does not believe that the labeling suggested by the comment, \"Do not exceed recommended dosage or take for more than 10 days, because severe liver damage may occur,\" is needed. The warnings proposed in \u00a7 343,50(c) (1)(i) and (3) in this tentative final monograph already state a 10-day limitation for adults on OTC analgesic self- medication. Furthermore, the agency is aware of only one somewhat convincing case report of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity associated with chronic acetaminophen usage in a normal individual (Ref. 4). A second case hasbeen reported, but rechallenge results were inconsistent (Ref. 5). As discussed in detail in comment 27 below, Olsson (Ref. 4) described a 55-year-old male who was hospitalized for a flareup of hepatitis while taking a product containing acetaminophen and chlormezanone. He had no recent history of drug or alcohol use, but had a 1-year history of alcohol abuse 7 years before hospitalization. Because this individual developed hepatotoxicity on a low dose of acetaminophen, it is possible that some other problem was also present. (This patient was using a drug containing acetaminophen and chlormezanone, which could have induced the liver injury.) No similar report has appeared despite the wide use of acetaminophen. A case of chronic use of 325 mg acetaminophen (12 tablets daily for I year) was described in which the patient's serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase level was normal before acetaminophen use (Ref. 5). After 1 year of acetaminophen use, liver function tests showed an abnormal serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase level and enlargement of the liver and spleen. After the drug was discontinued, the patient's serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase level returned to normal. After being discharged from the hospital, the patient resumed using 12 tablets of 325 mg acetaminophen daily. Within 2 months he developed pain and was rehospitalized. A monitored rechallenge with one dose of 1,325 mg acetaminophen caused a rise in transaminase and serum glutamic-pyruvic to 18 hours. A liver biopsy revealed \"bridging necrosis, spanning two portal and two central areas.\" After discontinuing acetaminophen for 4 months, the individual developed abdominal pain and enlargement of the spleen and had to be treated with azathioprine and prednisone. One year later, when liver function tests were back to normal, the individual again was rechallenged with 1,325 mg acetaminophen without any development of symptoms or rise in liver enzyme levels. This raises the possibility that this patient might have been developing chronic active hepatitis exacerbated by acetaminophen. Rosenberg et al. (Ref. 6) described two individuals who had taken 3.6 g acetaminophen daily for 1 to 2 weeks. One person had a history of Gilbert's disease (characterized by mild jaundice). Both developed jaundice during a course of infectious mononucleosis. However, because Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules jaundice can occur in 5 to 10 percent of patients with infectious mononucleosis, the jaundice in these two patients could not definitely be attributed to acetaminophen. Johnson and Tolman (Ref. 7) described a patient who had been taking 3 g acetaminophen daily and complained of fatigue and loss of appetite. The patient had used no other drugs and was not exposed to toxins other than unidentified cleaning solvents used occasionally. On medical examination there was liver tenderness, and a liver function test showed abnormal results. A liver biopsy revealed evidence of chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis. The patient had a positive rechallenge, and the liver enzymes increased during the 2 weeks following the rechallenge, indicating that acetaminophen may have caused this elevation. It is possible that the patient had chronic active hepatitis and that acetaminophen exacerbated it. This case was also complicated by the concomitant occasional use of unidentified -cleaning solvents. The agency has noted instances where only a mild overdose of 5 to 7 g of acetaminophen may have produced hepatotoxicity. Ware et al. (Ref. 8) described a person who developed disorientation, jaundice, and fever after using acetaminophen and prescription drugs daily for headaches. Liver enzyme levels were elevated, and a liver biopsy showed centrilobular fibrosis and bridging necrosis with evidence of both an acute and a chronic process. The patient improved after 8 days of unspecified conservative treatment. This case does not prove acetaminophen hepatotoxicity because the other drugs the patient had been taking can cause hepatitis. Toxic hepatitis was reported in three persons who were regularly ingesting acetaminophen in higher amounts than the recommended OTC dosage (Ref. 9). One patient was an alcoholic who for years had used up to 10 300-mg tablets of acetaminophen daily. During the 4 days before admission to the hospital, this individual drank no alcohol, but used about 100 tablets of acetaminophen. On admission to the hospital, the patient's liver enzymes were elevated, but they fell rapidly over the next 2 to 3 days. The amount of acetaminophen ingested and the subsequent pattern of serum liver enzyme abnormality found in this patient were consistent with a substantial overdose of acetaminophen 2 to 3 days before admission. The second individual used as much as 5.2 g acetaminophen daily. This patient had disseminated bronchialcancer, with general ill health and malnutrition. This patient's liver enzymes were elevated while using acetaminophen. After the liver enzymes returned to normal, the patient was rechallenged. The rechallenge of 5.2 to 6.5 g acetaminophen daily produced elevated liver enzyme levels. The plasma acetaminophen level at 24 hours was 37/xg/mL, corresponding to an overdose of the drug. The third individual had reportedly used 5.2 to 6.5 g acetaminophen daily for 3 weeks before hospitalization. Forty hours after the last dose, the plasma acetaminophen concentration was 15 jug/mL, consistent with an overdose. Although it is not inconceivable that chronic use of acetaminophen within recommended OTC dosage ranges produces chronic active hepatitis in a very low percentage of people, and although it is possible that acetaminophen can exacerbate preexisting chronic active hepatitis, the agency concludes that the above data do not provide an adequate basis for requiring a labeling statement on liver damage from chronic use of acetaminophen, that is, within recommended daily OTC dosages for longer than 10 days. Although the liver warning recommended by the Panelin \u00a7 343.50(c)(5)(i) is being deleted, the agency shares the comments' concern that symptoms of acetaminophen toxicity do not appear until a few days after an overdose. Following acetaminophen overdosage, there is a 24- to 48-hour period of relative well- being, when symptoms of hepatotoxicity do not appeai despite the occurrence of liver damage. This \"silent period\" may create a false sense of security that could delay the use of an antidote, which must be administered promptly in order to be effective (Refs. 10 and 11). To alert consumers that prompt medical attention is essential to the proper management of acetaminophen overdose, the agency is proposing the following overdose warnings for' acetaminophen drug products: For products labeled for adults (\u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(iii)), \"Prompt medical attention is critical for adults as well as for children even if you do not notice any signs or symptoms,\" or for products labeled for children (\u00a7 343.50(c)(2)(iii)), \"Prompt medical attention is critical even if you do not notice any signs or symptoms.\" For products labeled both for adults and children, the warning for adults would apply, as described in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3). Both warnings would be required to follow the general overdose warnings in \u00a7 330.1(g) that are required for all J.M., M.H. Rourk, and 61M68-72, (2) Peterson, R.G., and B.1-[.

Several comments urged the adoption of a warning statement that advises consumers who have preexisting liver disease, such as hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis, or who may have Reye syndrome, against the use of acetaminophen unless directed by a doctor. The comments cited reports in the medical literature concerning acetaminophen toxicity in persons with liver disease (Refs. 1 through 13). Two comments asserted that there is no evidence to warrant a warning regarding acetaminophen and preexisting liver disease. One of these comments submitted two clinical studies (Refs. 14 and 15) and a report [Ref. 16) to support its position. In reviewing and evaluating the data and information submitted by the comments, the agency has concluded that there is insufficient evidence at present to propose a warning against the use of acetaminophen at recommended OTC dosages by individuals with preexisting liver disease. The data and information in Refs. 1 through 7, Refs. 9 through 13, and Ref. 16 presented no evidence to show that OTC dosages of acetaminophen cause,46215 46216 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules hepatotoxicity in persons with preexisting liver disease. Rosenberg et al. (Ref. 8) described two persons who developed jaundice during a course of infectious mononucleosis. As discussed in comment 25 above, the jaundice cannot be confidently ascribed to acetaminophen. One of the clinical studies (Ref. 14) presents an open study of six male adults with chronic liver disease who were given 1 g acetaminophen every 4 hours four times a day. After 5 days of acetaminophen administration, there were no significant changes in liver enzyme laboratory values. The mean half-life of acetaminophen in these six subjects was 3.42.2.5. Ten hours after an initial dose of 1 g acetaminophen was administered on the first day, the plasma acetaminophen level was 1.9\u00b11.5 14g/mL. There was no evidence of any significant accumulation of acetaminophen in the plasma of these individuals. The other clinical study (Ref. 15) presents a placebo-controlled, double- blind, crossover study In which placebo or 4 g acetaminophen (1 g every 4 hours for four doses per day) was administered daily to 20 adults with preexisting liver disease of various types, The individuals were treated for 13 days and crossed over to the alternate regimen without a washout period. In comparing liver enzyme levels of the individuals during acetaminophen administration with those during placebo administration, no statistically significant differences were found. Three patients were excluded from the final analysis, One had changes in liver enzymes which could be attributed to the erratic course of his chronic active hepatitis. Although it is difficult to distinguish enzyme changes because of the erratic course of chronic active hepatitis versus drug-induced changes, the resulting rise in transaminases after rechallenge with acetaminophen raises the question of whether acetamirophen exacerbated this individual's chronic active hepatitis. Additional data regarding the plasma half-life of acetaminophen in individuals with liver disease were presented at a meeting of FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (Ref. 17). These data appeared to document prolonged serum half-life for acetaminophen in patients with liver disease. Nonetheless, the results of the placebo-controlled crossover study (Ref. 15) gave no evidence that this prolongation results in hepatotoxic levels of the drug. It should be pointed out, however, that prolonged acetaminophen half-life in the patients in this study was notdocumented, and thus it is not certain that the patients were at risk for possible adverse effects related to such prolongation. Data pertaining to cytochrome P-450 enzyme levels in patients with liver disease may also be relevant to determining acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Available data attribute the production of the hepatotoxic metabolite of acetaminophen to the cytochrome P-450 system. A reduction in activity of the cytochrome P-450 system then might result in reduced risk of hepatotoxicity. The following data show decreased cytochrome P-450 levels in individuals with chronic liver disease. Farrell, Cooksley, and Powell (Ref. 18) showed that the cytochrome P-450 concentrations in patients taking enzyme-inducing drugs such bs phenobarbital, phenytoin, and glutethimide are no different in control subjects than in persons with mild-to- moderate hepatitis or inactive cirrhosis. The patients with severe hepatitis or active cirrhosis who were taking enzyme-inducing drugs did have decreased cytochrome P-450 concentrations and may have lost the ability to respond to inducing agents. Schoene et al. (Ref. 19) measured the cytochrome P-450 content in needle biopsies of the human liver and found that in individuals with severe hepatitis and cirrhosis, the cytochrome P-450 level was 50 percent of the control value. In individuals with either mild or moderate hepatitis, there was no change in the cytochrome P-450 level. Gabrielle et al. (Ref. 20) found no change in the cytochrome P-450 content in individuals with alcoholic steatosis and in those recovering from viral hepatitis compared with normal individuals. The cytochrome P-450 level in chronic persistent hepatitis was 10 percent of the level in the normal individuals. In chronic active hepatitis, the cytochrome P-450 level was 30 percent of that of a normal individual. Although these data suggest that the activity of the cytochrome P-450 system is reduced in individuals with severe liver disease, the relevance of this finding to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in such individuals is not clear, It is possible that low cytochrome P-450 levels would protect against acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, but the evidence is conflicting on whether acetaminophen exacerbates liver disease. In summary, the agency believes that at present there are insufficient data to support a warning against the use of acetaminophen by persons with preexisting liver disease such ashepatitis, liver function affected by infectious mononucleosis, or liver disease resulting from Reye syndrome.

Several comments cited data to express concern that certain drugs which induce microsomal enzyme activity (e.g., alcohol and barbiturates) may increase the potential for, acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (Refs. I through 14). The comments recommended that warnings such as the following be required on the labeling of all products containing acetaminophen: Do not take this product if you use alcohol or barbiturates unless directed by a physician. Caution: Do not take this product if you are presently taking a prescription drug for epilepsy, barbiturates, or ethacrynic acid except under the advice and supervision of a physician. A reply comment opposed the suggested warnings, stating that there is no evidence of any significant drug interaction of acetaminophen when used at recommended doses with drugs which induce microsomal enzyme activity. The agency is not adopting the suggestion that consumers be warned against the use of ethacrynic acid with acetaminophen. The comments submitted no data to support such a warning, and the agency is not aware of data that indicate a need to warn consumers against the use of ethacrynic acid with acetaminophen. After reviewing the data cited by the comments, the agency has determined that the.results are conflicting and that there is insufficient evidence at this time to warrant a label warning against the use of OTC dosages of acetaminophen products with alcohol, barbiturates, or prescription drugs used for epilepsy. One comment cited a commentary on acetaminophen which recommended that drugs such as phenobarbital and alcohol should not be used with acetaminophen because they appear to potentiate acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (Ref. 1). However, no firsthand data were presented to support this recommendation. A report by Wilson et al. (Ref. 2) concerned a 13- year-old epileptic who took an overdose of acetaminophen and phenobarbital, subsequently developed hepatic encephalopathy, and died. These authors emphasized the seriousness of dealing with acetaminophen overdose, complicated in this case by the role ofphenobarbital in potentiating the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. Wright and Prescott (Ref. 3) retrospectively analyzed data on 16 individuals with hepatic necrosis following acetaminophen overdose. Eight of these individuals showed evidence of ingestion of either alcohol or barbiturates used in the treatment of epilepsy. Three individuals were chronic alcoholics. Wright and Prescott stated that their findings suggest that acetaminophen causes more severe hepatic necrosis in patients who have previously taken drugs that may cause induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes, such as barbiturates and alcohol, However, they conceded that their results must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of individuals studied and because of uncontrollable factors such as age and nutritional state of the individuals, as well as the possibility of their ingesting other drugs, Mitchell et al. (Ref. 4) concluded, as a result of their studies in rats and mice, that pretreatment of these animals with phenobarbital potentiates both the incidence and the severity of acetaminophen-induced hepatic necrosis. However, Prescott (Ref. 5) conducted a study on acetaminophen metabolism in 12 healthy volunteers and 15 individuals who were .chronically using microsomal enzyme-inducing agents such as phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin, drugs used in treating epilepsy. Prescott concluded that the production of hepatotoxic metabolites of acetaminophen was not increased in those individuals who used hepatic enzyme-inducing agents. These studies have produced conflicting results which are difficult to reconcile and from which firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Scott and Stewart (Ref. 6) reported that most of the cases of acetaminophen overdose which they had seen were accompanied by some alcohol use and said that the time available for effective treatment of overdose may be \"much reduced\" in individuals with alcohol- damaged livers. Barker, de Carle, and Anuras (Ref, 7) observed severe liver damage in an alcoholic who had ingested \"moderately excessive\" amounts of acetaminophen (100 tablets of 300 mg acetaminophen 4 days before admission to the hospital). These investigators concluded that this individual's use of alcohol induced the formation of toxic acetaminophen metabolites, which made him more susceptible to liver injury from the \"moderately excessive\" dose of acetaminophen.Emby and Fraser (Ref. 8] reported on two cases of acetaminophen overdose in alcoholics and concluded that \".* * the enhanced hepatotoxity of paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the presence of enzyme-inducing agents * * * has perhaps not been adequately emphasized.\" McClain et al. (Ref. 9) conducted studies in mice and also observed the clinical course of three chronic alcoholics who ingested therapeutic, rather than excessive, dosages of acetaminophen. McClain et al. stated that their findings \"* * * suggest that alcohol enhances acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice and provides supportive evidence that these three alcoholic patients probably had a similar pathophysiological basis for their liver disease.\" Goldfinger et al. (Ref. 10) reported hepatic damage in an alcoholic who had ingested 9.75 g acetaminophen over a 2-day period prior to hospitalization. Vilstrup at al. (Ref. 11) reported on fulminant liver failure in a woman who was a known abuser of alcohol, diazepam, and barbiturates. The woman had taken a total of 5.4 g acetaminophen over a 2-day period for premenstrual pain and subsequently died. The agency points out that the amount of acetaminophen ingested by the woman described by Vilstrup at al. is subject to question. It is also difficult to determine the exact daily dosage of acetaminophen ingested by those individuals observed by McClain et al. (Ref. 9) and Goldfinger et al. (Ref. 10). However, it appears that the individuals reported on by McClain et al. and Goldfinger at al. had ingested more than 4 g acetaminophen, which is the recommended maximum daily OTC dosage. In addition, the individual observed by Goldfinger at al. was using meprobamate, another hepatic microsomal enzyme inducer, in addition to alcohol and acetaminophen. Olsson (Ref. 12) described an individual who had a 1-year history of alcohol abuse (occurring 7 years before hospitalization) and who was hospitalized with jaundice, hepatic cholestasis, and hepatic steatosis. This individual was using a drug containing acetaminophen and chlormezanone. Olsson acknowledged that it was impossible to obtain a reliable drug history from the patient. The role of alcohol is unclear, and chlormezanone could have induced the liver injury seen in this individual. Furthermore, no plasma acetaminophen determination was performed on this individual. Thus it is difficult to implicate acetaminophen and alcohol use positively as the causative factors in this case.46217 46218 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules Shamszad et al. (Ref. 13) compiled data that suggest that the half-life of acetaminophen is significantly prolonged in patients with liver disease from alcohol use. However, these investigators noted that when alcohol is used simultaneously with acetaminophen the plasma disappearance curve of acetaminophen is unchanged. In considering the wide use of acetaminophen in the United States, and after evaluating the above data, the agency concludes that the evidence available to warrant a label warning against the use of OTC dosages of acetaminophen with barbiturates, prescription drugs for epilepsy, or alcohol is conflicting and insufficient. However, if additional data demonstrate the need for such warnings in the future, the agency will reconsider its present position.

Citing reports in the literature (Refs. 1 through 9) to substantiate their argument, several comments stated that acetaminophen has many adverse effects that should be included in label warnings for products containing this ingredient. These adverse effects include allergic reactions with clinical signs such as skin rashes, drug-induced fever, or asthma attacks associated with cross-sensitivity between aspirin and acetaminophen. Other adverse effects include blood dyscrasias, which are abnormal conditions of the blood. An example is thrombocytopenia, a decrease in the number of platelets. The comments attributed these adverse effects either to allergic reactions or idiosyncratic reactions, which are abnormal reactions peculiar to the individual. They also recommended a label warning to advise consumers who are allergic to acetaminophen not to use products containing that drug, and a label warning to advise consumers who have asthma or are sensitive or allergic to aspirin to consult their physician before using acetaminophen drug products. Two reply comments disagreed, arguing that clinical experience and the medical literature indicate that adverse effects from acetaminophen arerare and do not support the need for such warning statements. These comments also maintained that some of the references cited are single-case, anecdotal reports and that there is insufficient evidence in most of the cases to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen and the reported reactions. The agency believes that the warnings which the comments requested are not warranted at this time because there is insufficient evidence that these adverse effects are being caused by acetaminophen. However, if sufficient evidence is presented to warrant new warnings in the future, the agency will act accordingly. Two of the reports on adverse effects of acetaminophen cited by the comments had also been cited by the Panel and presented no new data for the agency's consideration (Refs. 3 and 4). Some of the reports cited by the comments were single-case reports of thrombocytopenia, which may have resulted from a number of factors, including idiosyncracy, or which may have been caused by agents other than acetaminophen (Refs. 1, 3, and 7). There were three single-case reports of skin rash following the use of acetaminophen(Refs. 4, 5, and 9), but no cases of drug- induced fever. Studies present conflicting data on the occurrence of cross-sensitivity between aspirin and acetaminophen (Refs. 2, 6, 8, 10, and 11). Fisherman and Cohen's study (Ref. 2) contained five cases of cross-sensitivity between aspirin and acetaminophen. These researchers calculated an \"intolerance index,\" which can be used to compare the tendency of various drugs to produce allergic reactions. The index is based on the usual therapeutic dose divided by the minimal dose needed to produce clinical symptoms of intolerance. This result is multiplied by the percent of patients showing intolerance. The calculated \"intolerance index\" of aspirin was 368 compared with 13.5 for acetaminophen; indicating that there is a low degree of cross-reactivity to acetaminophen in aspirin-sensitive patients. The Smith study (Ref. 8) also contained five cases of cross-sensitivity between aspirin and acetaminophen. A challenge dose of several common analgesics was given to five aspirin- sensitive patients, two of whom indicated they were sensitive to acetaminophen. Smith measured the change in forced expiratory volume, which is a measure of air flow and pulmonary function, and noted whether rhinitis was present. Three of the patients had statistically significant drops in forced expiratory volume, and four patients also developed rhinitis following acetaminophen administration. This study indicates a potential problem in a person who is highly sensitive to aspirin and who uses analgesic drugs, including acetaminophen, but it does not explain the clinical significance of changes in the forced expiratory volume. Other studies, not cited by the comments, found no sensitivity to acetaminophen among aspirin-sensitive patients (Refs. 10 and 11). Sampter and Beers (Ref. 10) tested acetaminophen in 182 aspirin-sensitive patients and found no adverse reactions. Other investigators tested 11 aspirin-sensitive patients with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen and found no. reaction to acetaminophen (Ref. 11). Because of the conflicting data on the incidence of cross-sensitivity between aspirin and acetaminophen, the agency is not proposing a warning about cross- sensitivity to other analgesics on the acetaminophen label. Although the potential for allergic reactions to acetaminophen does exist, the agency believes that the following statement in the warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c) (1)(i), (2)(i), Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules and (3) will adequately inform consumers to consult a doctor if an allergic reaction, such as a rash, should occur following the use of acetaminophen:\"* * * if new symptoms occur consult a doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition.\" References (1) Eisner, E.V., and N.T.

One comment suggested that the professional labeling recommended by the Panel (\u00a7 343.80) be revised to include the indications that the Panel did not place in Category I because of its concern about self-diagnosis. The comment argued that, although self- diagnosis is a valid concern for consumer-oriented labeling, this concern is irrelevant to professional labeling. Another comment suggested that the Panel's recommended warnings listed below be moved from consumer labeling to professional labeling because these statements refer to conditions that should be diagnosed and supervised by a physician. The comment concluded that these warnings are irrelevant to a consumer with an undiagnosed condition, and are not needed once thecondition is diagnosed because the consumer is then under the care of a physician who will recommend proper medication and advise against inappropriate medication. The warnings recommended by the comment for inclusion in professional labeling are as follows: Section 343.50fc)(3)(i): \"Take this product for the treatment of arthritis only under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" Section 343.50(c)(3)(iv): \"Caution: Do not take this product if you have stomach distress, ulcers, or bleeding problems except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" Section 343.50(c)(3)(v): \"Caution: Do not take this product if you are presently taking a prescription drug for anticoagulation (thinning the blood), diabetes, gout,.or arthritis except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" Section 343.50(c)(4)(i): \"This product contains aspirin. Do not take this product if you are allergic to aspirin or if you have asthma except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" Section 343.50(c)(4)(ii): \"Do not take this product during the last 3 months of pregnancy except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" Section 343.50(c)(4)(iii): \"Do not take this product for at least 7 days after tonsillectomy or oral surgery except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" The request made by the first comment did not specify the indications it was referring to; therefore, the agency cannot respond. The agency disagrees with the second comment's suggestion that the warnings listed above be moved to the professional labeling section of the monograph. These warnings are essential for the safe and effective use by consumers of the products to which they apply (with the exception of \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(i), which is being deleted for reasons stated in comment 19 above), and the agency proposes to require them in consumer labeling. 30. One comment stated that the following warnings recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c) should be eliminated from OTC analgesic and antipyretic drug products that are marketed in children's dosage units as children's products: \"Adults: Do not take this product for more than 10 days. If symptoms persist, or new ones occur, consult your physician.\" \"Adults: Drink a full glass of water with each dose.\" \"Do not take this product during the last 3 months of pregnancy except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\"The comment contended that these statements, clearly intended for adults, are unnecessary and inappropriate for analgesic and antipyretic drug products labeled for children. The comment added that requiring these warnings on small containers (e.g., the 38-tablet size limitation for pediatric aspirin products) will result in smaller print that will make the labeling message less conspicuous, less legible, and less likely to be read and understood by the consumer. The comment also stated that the words \"Children under 12 years\" should be eliminated from the recommended warnings in \u00a7 343.50 (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3)(iii)(b), for the reasons given above as well as the reason that the statement is superfluous because pediatric products are defined by the Panel in \u00a7 343.3(e) as products for children under 12 years. The pregnancy warning recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c)(4)(ii) is obviously not needed in products intended only for use in children. In addition, the pregnancy-nursing warning required for all OTC drugs intended for systemic absorption specifically provides for an exemption for drugs that are labeled exclusively for pediatric use. (See 21 CFR 201.63(c)(2).) The agency agrees that the warnings for adults limiting use to not more than 10 days and directing them to drink a full glass of water with each dose (\u00a7 343.50(c](1)(i) and (c)(3)(iii)(a)) are unnecessary in the labeling of products intended only for use in children, as the warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3)(iii)(b) provide the necessary information for children under 12 years of age. The warnings recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c(1)()i and fc}{1)(ii) are being revised and expanded into three warnings appearing in the tentative final monograph under the following sections: \u00a7 343.50(c{1)(i), for products labeled for adults; \u00a7 343.50(c)(2)(i), for products labeled for children 2 years to under 12 years of age; and \u00a7 343.50(c)(3), for products labeled both for adults and for children 2 years to under 12 years of age. (See comment 18 above.) The agency agrees that products that are clearly identified for use in children, e.g., infant drops, children's aspirin or acetaminophen tablets, do not have to be labeled with a statement in the warnings or in the directions specifying that they are for children under 12 years, as had been recommended by the Panel. Because the directions for use for such products do not include dosages for people over 12 years of age or under 2 years of age, further labeling specifying46219 46220 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 J Proposed Rules that these products are intended for use by children from 2 to 12 years of ageappears to be unnecessary. Accordingly, new \u00a7 343.50(b)(4) is being proposed in the tentative final monograph as follows: (4) Other required statements-i) For products labeled only for children 2 to under 12 years of age containing anyingredient identified in \u00a7 343.10. (A) The labeling of the product contains, on the principal display panel, either of the following: (1) \"Children's (trade name of product or generic name of ingredient(s)).\"(2) \"( Trade name of product or generic name of ingredient(s) for Children.\" (8) The labeling for adults in J 343.50(d) and the statement \"Children 2 to under 12 years of age\" in \u00a7 343.50(d)(3)(ii) are not required. 31. One comment supported and two comments opposed the part of the warning recommended by the Panel foraspirin drug products in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iv) which states, \"* * * Do not take this product if you have stomach distress * * * \"The supporting comment stated that aspirin drug products causegastrointestinal distress at therapeutic doses and that their labeling should bear a warning to this effect. The opposing comments recommended deleting the term \"stomach distress,\" contending that it has little meaning toconsumers. The term is so all-inclusive, the comment maintained, it may discourage consumers from using aspirin for symptoms for which it is indicated. The comments explained that \"stomach distress\" often accompanies symptoms such as headache or fever, as with the common cold or flu, and that the warning may discourage consumers from using aspirin for these concurrent symptoms. One comment suggested that, as alternative labeling,'consuners bewarned against the use of aspirin \"in cases of stomach ulcer and related symptoms.\" Because the agency shares the comments' concern that the general term \"stomach distress\" can be applied to various symptoms and may have little meaning to consumers, the agency is proposing to delete this term from the warning recommended by the Panel inI 343.50(c)(3)(iv). Although the agency believes that alternative labeling is warranted, it is not adopting the alternative labeling suggested by one of the comments because the term \"related symptoms\" is vague and probably has little meaning to consumers. As the Panel pointed out, plain aspirin products can cause stomach discomfort or \"stomach problems,\" such as heartburn, upsetstomach, or stomach pain, in certain individuals (42 FR 35387). Plain aspirin can also exert adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., mucosal erosion, ulceration, minor occult bleeding, etc.) which may exacerbate stomach problems associated with underlying gastrointestinal disease. These effects can also be produced by salicylates other than aspirin (42 FR 35417 to 35421). Regarding buffered aspirin products, the Panel stated that \"* ** evidence seems to indicate that buffered aspirin produces a lower incidence of gastric intolerance in some patients but not in all patients who exhibit gastric intolerance with regular (plain) aspirin products\" (42 FR 35470). However, the agency notes that the Panel also stated that this evidence is conflicting. In addition, the investigators of another study on the incidence of gastric lesions in rheumatic patients using plain, buffered, or enteric-coated aspirin concluded that buffered aspirin with an acid-neutralizing capacity of 1.9 milliequivalents (mEqo per 325 mg aspirin did not appear to prevent aspirin-induced gastric damage (Ref. 1). However, these investigators stated that more definitive studies are needed which compare various aspirin preparations before any final conclusions are reached. Another study showed that OTC doses of buffered aspirin tablets containing 6.4 mEq of antacid, which exceeds the amount of buffering present in most currently marketed buffered aspirin products, produced gastric mucosal injury. The investigators of this study concluded that such products offer little protection to the gastric and duodenal mucosa (Ref. 2). Furthermore, the Panel stated that there is evidence that highly buffered aspirin for solution will reduce, but not eliminate, the acute gastric erosions and occult blood loss produced by the local effects of aspirin in animals and humans with no predisposing gastrointestinal disease (42 FR 35471). For these reasons, the agency tentatively concludes that it is necessary to advise consumers who have persistent or recurring stomach problems (such as heartburn, upset stomach, or stomach pain), which may be symptoms of an underlying gastrointestinal disorder, against using products containing aspirin (plain or buffered) or other salicylates unless directed by a doctor. Accordingly, the Panel's recommended warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iv) (redesignated \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(v)(BJ) is being revised as follows: \"Do not take this product if you have stomach problems (such asheartburn, upset stomach, or stomach pain) that persist or recur, or if you have ulcers or bleeding problems, unless directed by a doctor.\" This warning is also being revised in \u00a7 343.50(c)(2)(v)(B) for products labeled for children 2 years to under 12 years of age.

One comment asserted that warning statements for aspirin drug, products should be stated separately. The comment stated that the following warning is the most important warning to the consumer and should be displayed alone on the label so that its effect is not diminished: \"Warning: Keep this and all medicines out of children's reach. In case of accidental overdose, contact a physician immediately.\" The comment stated that all other cautions on the use of aspirin drug products should be under a section designated \"Cautions.\" The agency agrees that the general warnings quoted above are among the most important provided for all OTC drugs to consumers. These warnings are required for OTC drug products in \u00a7 330.1(g) (21 CFR 330.1(g)). The agency agrees that manufacturers should consider displaying these warnings separately from other label warnings or highlighting them to attract consumers' attention. Concerning the use of the terms .\"warning\" and \"caution,\" section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2)) states, in part, that any drug marketed OTC must bear in labeling-* * * such adequate warnings * * * as are necessary for the protection of users * * *.\" Section 330.10(a)(4)(v) of the OTC drug regulations provides that labeling of OTC drug products should include..* * warnings against unsafe use, side effects, and adverse reactions * * *.\" The agency notes that historically there has not been consistent usage of the signal words \"warning\" and\"caution\" in OTC drug labeling. For example, in it 369.20 and 369.21 (21 CFR 369.20 and 369.21), which list \"warning\" and \"caution\" statements for drugs, the signal words \"warning\" and \"caution\" are both used. In some instances either Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules of these signal words is used to convey the same or similar precautionary information. FDA has considered which of these signal words would be most likely to attract consumers' attention to that information describing conditions under which the drug product should not be used or its use should be discontinued. The agency concludes that the signal word \"warning\" is more likely to flag potential dangers so that consumers will read the information being conveyed. Therefore, FDA has determined that the signal word \"warning,\" rather than the word \"caution,\" will be used routinely in OTC drug labeling that is intended to alert consumers to potential safety problems. Accordingly, the signal word\"caution\" is being deleted from the Panel's recommended warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3) (iv) and (v), redesignated \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(v) (B) and (C) in this proposed monograph. 33. One comment stated that the first sentence of the aspirin hypersensitivity warning recommended in I 343.50(c](4)(i), \"This product contains aspirin,\" is redundant for products that display the word \"aspirin\" in the product name or are clearly labeled as containing \"aspirin.\" The comment stated that part of the next sentence in the warning, \"Do not take this product if you are allergic to aspirin * * i,\" is adequate to warn consumers and that the first sentence should be deleted. The agency agrees with the comment. Because section 502(e)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(e)(1)) requires that the established name of the active ingredients contained in a product be included in the label, the statement. \"This product contains aspirin,\" would be redundant. Therefore, in the tentative final monograph this statement is being deleted from the warning. 34. Two comments urged that all children's aspirin products be labeled to include a warning that salicylate intoxication can occur from a therapeutic overdose when \"aspirin is repetitively administered to infants and young children at commonly recommended doses and time intervals.\" The comments argued that parents have been inadequately alerted to the hazards associated with the cumulative effects of salicylate in infants and young children and that parents frequently ignore recommended dosage schedules for aspirin because they think this drug can be administered with relative impunity. The comments further argued that parents will often continue to give aspirin to relieve a child's fever when the fever actually may be due to aspirin toxicit One comment noted that ringing in the ears(tinnitus) has no value as a warning of toxicity in the pediatric age group because it is subjective, and infants and young children cannot alert the parent to its occurrence. For these reasons the following warning was suggested for all aspirin drug products for children: \"Do not exceed recommended doses unless directed by your physician. More than six consecutive doses at four-hour intervals can lead to serious complications in a feverish dehydrated infant or young child.\" Two reply comments disagreed with these comments. One argued that the Panel's pediatric dosage schedule and its recommended warnings in \u00a7 343.50 (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2) contain instructions that. when heeded by parents, are adequate to prevent overdosage. These comments also stated that overdoses may occur with any drug and that parents must be alerted not to exceed the recommended dosages of aspirin as well as other drugs. The comments agreed that tinnitus has no value as a warning symptom because it cannot be adequately described by infants and children. However, the comments pointed out that there are observable symptoms of aspirin toxicity, such as hyperpnea, which can be described in labeling as \"deep and rapid breathing.\" The reply comments also stated that dehydration should not be included in the labeling because parents cannot diagnose this condition, which is rare and should be diagnosed by a doctor. The comments also maintained that such labeling would confuse the consumer and obscure other necessary information on the label. The agency does not believe that children's aspirin drug products should be labeled with a warning stating that salicylate intoxication can occur when aspirin is taken in doses within the recommended dosage schedule (therapeutic overdose). The reports of overdose of salicylates cited by the comments showed that poisoning from accidental ingestion occurs more commonly in children over 2 years of age and that therapeutic overdose is more likely to affect children under 2 years of age (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). The label directions recommended by the Panel for aspirin state, \"For children under 2 years of age, there is no recommended dosage except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" Thus, parents are alerted to consult a physician before giving aspirin to children under 2 years of age. The physician is responsible for giving parents specific dosage instructions for aspirin given to children under 2 years of age and for warning parents of thepotential dangers of exceeding the recommended dose. For children Z years of age and older, the Panel developed a new dosage schedule to help prevent therapeutic salicylate overdose. This dosage schedule not only is based upon a maximal dose that provides effective plasma levels for analgesic and antipyretic effects, but also has a safety margin in case of an inadvertent 50- percent increase in dosage. The agency believes that this children's dosage schedule, which has been slightly revised (see comment 58 below), and the revised warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c) (2)(i) and (3) provide adequate guidance to parents to prevent overdosage. As for the additional labeling suggested by the comments, the agency believes that terms such as \"dehydrated\" and \"deep and rapid breathing\" have little meaning to consumers and are not appropriate for consumer labeling of aspirin drug products, although they may be used by doctors in diagnosing conditions due to toxicity. The information in the suggested labeling, \"Do not exceed recommended doses unless directed by your physician,\" is provided in the directions for use by the phrase \"or as directed by a doctor\" or \"unless directed by a doctor\" after the usual recommended OTC dosage of the product.

One comment contended that the warning not to take aspirin if taking a prescription drug for arthritis should not be included in the Panel's recommended warning in \u00a7 343.50(c}{3)(v). The comment further contended that the major responsibility of warning the consumer of drug interactions should rest with the prescribing physician and that the following statement by the Panel (42 FR 35372) should apply:.* * physicians always carefully control the patient's use of all other medications, thereby negating the need for a warning.\" The agency believes that many consumers who take prescription drugs will also use OTC analgesics and antipyretics, such as salicylates, without a physician's advice. These consumers may be unaware of possible interactions between the salicylates and prescription46221 46222 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules drugs and need to be alerted to this possibility in the labeling. Based upon the Panel's discussion of the increased potential for gastric ulceration if aspirin is taken along with another anti- inflammatory agent (42 FR 35409). the agency tentatively concludes that the warning on the concurrent use of salicylates with prescription drugs for arthritis is needed and therefore should be retained. The warning is not intended to prohibit such concurrent use, but to alert consumers to consult a doctor first. 36. Two comments objected to the Panel's recommended warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(v) that advises against the use of salicylates concurrently with prescription drugs for the treatment of gout. The comments asserted that the warning should be modified to apply only to the use of salicylates and uricosuric drugs, which are drugs that promote the excretion of uric acid hi the urine. The comments argued that allopurinol, commonly prescribed for gout, is a nonuricosuric drug and is compatible with salicylates. The agency endorses the labeling recommended in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(v) to alert consumers to consult a physician before using OTC salicylates with several types of prescription drugs, including those used in the treatment of gout. The agency concludes that differentiating between uricosuric and nonuricosuric drugs in the warnings for OTC salicylate drug products would be meaningless and confusing to consumers. Because the agency believes that it is important for consumers to understand the reason for this warning, it is proposing in the tentative final monograph that the information in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(v) (redesignated \u00a7 343.50[c)(1)(v)(C) in this monograph) be identified as a drug interaction precaution and appear as follows: \"Drug Interaction Precaution. Do not take this product if you are taking a prescription drug for anticoagulation (thinning the blood), diabetes, gout, or arthritis unless directed by a doctor.\" This precaution has been modified in \u00a7 343.50(c)(2)(v)(C) for products labeled for children 2 years to under 12 years of age. For products labeled both for adults and children, the precaution for adults will apply. (See I 343.50(c)(3).) 37. One comment objected to the warning recommended by the Panel for aspirin and salicylate products in J 343.50c)(3)(v), asserting that the potential for drug interaction is greater than that expressed in this labeling. The comment explained that because the information on drug interactions is increasing, the consumer who is using prescription medication should consult aphysician before using any pain reliever. The comment suggested the following alternative labeling, explaining that it is broader and more inclusive than the Panel's labeling and will provide safer coverage to the consumer: \"If you are taking any prescription medication, consult your physician before using any pain reliever.\" Another comment suggested the general drug interaction warning, \"If you are taking any prescription medications, consult your physician before taking this medication.\" The agency believes the labeling suggested by the comments is too general, and consumers might completely ignore its message. In addition, the suggested warnings would not alert consumers to the specific types of drugs that may interact with OTC analgesics. As discussed in comment 35 above, the agency will propose specific drug interaction warnings to consumers when necessary for the safe use of an OTC drug product. 38. Some comments opposed and others favored the Panel's recommended warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(4)(i) against the use of aspirin drug products by consumers who have asthma. The opposing comments stated that the references the Panel cited to support the need for the warning were outdated and included no reports of fatal asthma attacks. The comments argued that the warning is unnecessary because only about 2 percent of asthmatics experience an adverse reaction to aspirin. Asthmatics are under a doctor's care, the comments stated, and the doctor should warn them of possible adverse reactions. A comment from a consumer, who suffers from asthma and had been unaware that aspirin could precipitate asthma attacks, supported the Panel's warning. The comment insisted that it is necessary to warn asthmatics who may also be unaware that an asthma attack may occur with the use of aspirin drug products. Another supporting comment suggested the following alternative warning to avoid creating consumer anxiety: \"If you have asthma * I * consult your physician before using any pain reliever.\" The agency is proposing the following warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(iv) for products containing aspirin or carbaspirin calcium: \"Do not take this product if you are allergic to aspirin or if you have asthma unless directed by a doctor.\" The Panel stated that aspirin has long been associated with allergic-type reactions, such as asthma in hypersensitive individuals. In certain instances these reactions can be life-threatening and even fatal (42 FR 35397). The consumer's comment reaffirmed the need to warn asthmatic consumers who may not always be alerted to this danger by a doctor. The agency is not proposing the warning suggested by one comment because it refers to \"any pain reliever\" and is thus too broad. The medical literature includes a few reports that certain pain relievers other than aspirin may precipitate asthmatic attacks in aspirin-sensitive patients. However, these reports do not agree on the analgesic drugs implicated and the mechanism of action involved (Refs. 1 through 7). The agency concludes that more data and information are needed to determine the need for an asthma warning for pain relievers other than aspirin drug products.

One comment disagreed with the wording in the Panel's recommended warning for aspirin and other salicylate products in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(ii), \"Stop taking this product if ringing in the ears or other symptoms occur.\" The comment argued that the consumer should not be advised to stop taking the product if tinnitus develops because many doctors use tinnitus as a guideline for adjusting a patient's dosage level of aspirin to a therapeutically effective and tinnitus- free level. The comment stated that the phrase \"or other symptoms occur\" should be deleted from the warning because it is vague and confusing to the consumer. The comment suggested the following alternative: \"If ringing in the Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules ears develops, consult your physician before taking any more medication.\" The agency agrees that it is more appropriate to direct consumers with tinnitus to consult a doctor before taking more medication than to \"stop taking\" the product. The warning is being revised accordingly in the tentative final monograph. In addition, the phrase \"or other symptoms occur\" is being deleted from the warning because this phrase is synonymous with the phrase \"if new symptoms occur,\" which has been included in the warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(i), (2)(i), and (3). The Panel noted that because aspirin or other salicylates produce a reversible ototoxicity manifested by deafness, it is important that patients who are regularly receiving salicylates at higher dosages be monitored by a physician for hearing loss as well as tinmitus. It is particularly important that patients with preexisting hearing loss be frequently monitored because they will not report tinnitus as plasma salicylate levels increase to toxic levels. An example of this was shown in a report from a consumer with a preexisting hearing loss who described a severe additional loss of hearing after using 50 grains (3,250 mg) of enteric-coated aspirin daily for a month (Ref. 1). In view of the above considerations, the agency proposes to revise the warning, \"Stop taking this product if ringing in the ears or other symptoms occur,\" to read as follows in \u00a7 343.50(c) (1)(v)(A) and (2)(v)(A): \"If ringing in the ears or a loss of hearing occurs, consult a doctor before taking (giving) any more of this product.\" Reference (1) Letter from a consumer, included in OTC Volume 03BTFM. 40. One comment suggested that the term \"bleeding problems\" in the Panel's recommended warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iv) be changed to \"blood clotting problem.\" The comment argued that the term \"blood clotting problem\" is more accurate medically and would be more useful to consumers than \"bleeding problems,\" which could be interpreted to include a minor cut that bleeds somewhat longer than usual. The comment provided three references to support its position (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). The references provided by the comment do not suggest that the term \"blood clotting problem\" has more meaning to consumers than the term \"bleeding problems.\" Two discuss bleeding time and other laboratory measurements (Refs. 1 and 2); the third discusses the side effect of gastrointestinal bleeding from aspirin use (Ref. 3).The agency believes that the term \"bleeding problems\" as used in the warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iv) (redesignated \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(v(B)) is accurate and useful to consumers. The Panel recommended the wording in this section to warn persons who have bleeding problems that they should not take aspirin except under the advice and supervision of a physician. Persons with bleeding problems such as hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease, thrombosthenia, or thrombocytopathia may react to aspirin drug products with a markedly prolonged bleeding time that might lead to a significant loss of blood in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere.

M., et al., \"Bleeding Time After Aspirin in Disorders of Intrinsic Clotting,\" New England Journal of Medicine, 281:1039-1042, 1969.(3) Sanfelippo, M. J., and C. V. Hussey, \"Thrombopathy- Identification and Distribution,\" American Journal of Clinical Pathology, 61.628--638, 1974. 41. One comment urged that the labeling of aspirin tablets direct consumers to take these products with food or milk. The comment personally attributed an incident of gastrointestinal bleeding to taking aspirin tablets with water rather than with milk or food, and maintained that food or milk would have coated the stomach and prevented the bleeding. The comment submitted no data to support its viewpoint. The Panel considered whether salicylates should be taken with food, but concluded that it was most important that solid, oral dosage forms containing salicylates be taken with water to lessen the chance of gastric irritation (42 FR 35356). In fact, the Panel recommended the following warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iii): (a) \"Adults: Drink a full glass of water with each dose,\" and (b) \"Children under 12 years: Drink water with each dose.\" The Panel specified a full glass of water for adults for each dose of salicylates. At gastric pH, 8 ounces or more of water is required to dissolve a dose of aspirin, the most commonly used salicylate. Undissolved salicylate in contact with the gastric mucosa is one cause of gastric irritation following salicylate ingestion. Although salicylate solution is less irritating than undissolved salicylate, the solution could also be irritating to the highly sensitive individual (42 FR 35387). Solid foods would delay the dissolution of salicylates, allowing the undissolved salicylate to remain in contact with thegastric mucosa longer, but liquid foods, such as juice or milk, dissolve salicylate. However, the agency is concerned that, because of their acidity, taking some juices with aspirin may cause more irritation to the stomach than taking aspirin with water. Also, the agency is unaware of any data showing that milk will lessen the gastric irritation caused by aspirin. Therefore, the agency concurs with the Panel that consumers should be advised to take solid, oral dosage forms of salicylates with water to lessen the chance of gastric irritation. The agency believes that these statements belong under the directions for use, rather than in the warnings. Consequently the warnings recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iii) (a) and (b) have been designated as directions in \u00a7 343.50(d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this tentative final monograph. 42. Two comments urged Category II status for the following labeling claims for buffered aspirin: \"Buffering agents to help make the pain reliever more gentle to the stomach,\" \"helps prevent the stomach upset often caused by plain aspirin,\" ..* * * provides ingredients that may prevent the stomach distress that plain aspirin occasionally causes but should not be taken by certain individuals with stomach disorders as cautioned elsewhere on the label,\" \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin,\" and claims implying more rapid analgesia as a result of an increased absorption rate. The comments pointed out that the Panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to substantiate the claims that buffered aspirin or highly buffered aspirin for solution (aspirin and antacid) can be safely used by persons who should not use plain aspirin. The comments stated that these claims may lead consumers to think that buffered aspirin products either give faster or greater pain relief than plain aspirin or cause less or no stomach distress. The comments expressed concern that reliance on claims relating to less stomach distress with buffered aspirin products could lead to a clinical danger in alcoholics and in persons who are prone to ulcers. Referring to claims such as \"gets to the bloodstream faster than plain aspirin,\" the comments argued that blood level studies do not constitute acceptable scientific evidence to show that buffered products of this type are therapeutically superior to plain aspirin. Other comments urged Category I status for the above labeling claims for buffered aspirin, stating that consumers should be informed of the purpose of buffering, and requested that the agency4622346223 46224 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules provide specific information on the. criteria for achieving Category I status for these Category III labeling claims. The comments noted that the Panel stated that the evidence, although conflicting, seems to show a lower incidence of stomach upset produced by buffered aspirin in some patients who exhibit gastric intolerance to plain aspirin (42 FR 35470). The comments also noted that such labeling claims are qualified or modified by the words\"may\" and \"occasionally\" and the phrase \" * * but should not be taken by certain individuals with stomach disorders as cautioned elsewhere on this label.\" The comments contended that the Panel classified stomach upset claims for buffered aspirin as Category III because the Panel believed that the benefits from the use of buffered aspirin in such instances affect only a few consumers, and not because such claims imply that buffered aspirin products have a therapeutic advantage over plain aspirin. The comments also contended that there is no proof of a lack of relationship between variations in bioavailability of aspirin products and their resultant clinical effect. The comments argued that if a buffered aspirin product is absorbed more rapidly than plain aspirin and provides the consumer with some therapeutic advantage, labeling claims regarding faster absorption, such as \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin,\" would not be misleading to consumers and should be allowed. The agency's response to these comments covers all buffered aspirin products, including aspirin with antacid products (such as highly buffered aspirin for solution), because the labeling claims apply to all such products. The Panelfound (1) \"Comparisons of the most commonly used plain and buffered aspirin show that salicylate blood levels are twice as high in the first 10 to 20 minutes for the buffered aspirin product compared to regular aspirin,\" (2) \"The basic problem is that there are no well-controlled clinical studies that unequivocally prove or disprove that these differences in absorption will result in clinically important differences in the onset, intensity or incidence of relief of pain or fever,\" and (3) Category III should be used to classify claims which cannot be fully evaluated with present data but have some reasonable basis and can probably be evaluated by further testing, perhaps involving more sensitive methodology.\" (See 42 FR 35480.) The Panel also expressed concerns that such claims could be confusing to the public. The agency concurs that the studies submitted to the Panel are inconclusiveto support a claim of more rapid action. The agency concludes that although there were apparent higher blood salicylate levels for buffered aspirin in some studies, there remains insufficient evidence on the basis of controlled clinical analgesic studies, that buffered aspirin products provide a more rapid onset, greater peak intensity, or a more prolonged duration of analgesia than unbuffered aspirin. Because no new data have been submitted to answer the Panel's concerns, claims such as \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin\" remain classified in Category III. Further, based upon the data submitted to the Panel, the agency concludes that there is not sufficient evidence to clearly demonstrate that buffered aspirin may help those individuals subject to stomach upset associated with aspirin ingestion.. The Panel noted that the results, of the clinical studies comparing buffered aspirin to plain aspirin in which the symptom of gastric intolerance was evaluated, appear to be conflicting, but that the data seemed to indicate that buffered aspirin produces a lower incidence of gastric intolerance in some sensitive individuals. (See 42 FR 35480.) Accordingly, the Panel classified the following label claim in Category III: \"Provides ingredients that may prevent the stomach distress that plain, aspirin causes but should not be taken by certain individuals with stomach disorders as cautioned elsewhere on the label.\" Citing the significant variation in dissolution rates among marketed formulations of buffered and unbuffered aspirin products, the Panel stated that the clinical evidence for a given buffered aspirin product could not necessarily be extrapolated to other buffered aspirin formulations. In addition, the Panel noted studies that suggest that an adequately buffered aspirin product may not have an advantage over a well formulated unbuffered product (42 FR 35375). The Panel recommended that specific standards be established for both buffered and unbuffered aspirin products (42 FR 35469). The Panel was uncertain about whether the observed decrease in gastric intolerance of buffered aspirin products was due to the buffering effect on the pH of the microenvironment surrounding the dissolving particles on the stomach lining, the increased dissolution rate, or both. Based on these uncertainties, the Panel stated its opinion that the Category III label claim could be used provided the minimum requirements for buffering capacity (1.9 mEq of acid neutralizing capacity per 325 mg aspirin) are met and the product had adissolution rate similar to the buffered aspirin used in most of the clinical studies reviewed by the Panel (42 FR 35469 and 35470). At this time, based upon the data that have been reviewed, the agency agrees that the clinical evidence is inconclusive to support a claim of better gastrointestinal tolerance for buffered aspirin products. However, industry has provided additional data in the form of three new clinical studies (Ref. 2). Detailed information on the disolution profiles and acid neutralizing capacity of the formulations used in these studies were also provided. These data are currently undergoing review by the agency, and will be discussed in the preamble to the final rule for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products. It should be further noted that after the Panel's report was published, standards for acid neutralization (which is the Panel's recommended standard for acid neutralization for buffered aspirin products) and dissolution rates of buffered aspirin tablets were added to the United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) (Ref. 1). As discussed in comment 98 below, the agency is proposing to incorporate these standards in the internal analgesic monograph. Products that meet these U.S.P standards are identified as \"Buffered Aspirin.\" Accordingly, for buffered aspirin products meeting these standards, the agency is providing for the optional statement \"contains buffering ingredients\" in this tentative final monograph. The agency agrees with the comment that consumers should be informed of the purpose of buffering. However, the clinical studies reviewed by the Panel and the Agency, are inconclusive. Until the new data (Ref. 2) are fully evaluated, claims regarding decreased gastric irritation are classified in Category III.

One comment requested that the claim \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin\" be allowed for powder dosage forms of aspirin. The comment noted that the Panel acknowledged the rapid absorption of powders by stating: \"They [powders] are rapidly absorbed however, often reaching peak blood levels more rapidly than the tablet dosage form\" (42 FR 35376). The comment stated that clinical studies Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules comparing the absorption of an aspirin powder with absorption of aspirin tablets were submitted to the Panel, but there is no indication in the monograph that the Panel considered these studies. The comment also provided a more recent clinical study to support its contention that aspirin in powder form is more quickly absorbed than plain aspirin tablets (Ref. 1). The studies to which the comment referred were reviewed by the Panel (Ref. 2). Based on these studies and other information, the Panel stated that powders, because of their large surface area, are rapidly absorbed and may often reach peak blood levels more rapidly than tablets. The additional study submitted by the comment compares the rate of absorption of five different oral aspirin formulations-three in tablet form and two in powder form (Ref. 1). Three minutes after dosing, blood concentrations were higher with the powdered formulations than the tablet formulations. Over a 15-minute period, the powdered aspirin formulations and one buffered aspirin tablet formulation provided the highest blood levels of aspirin. After considering the above data and information, the agency concurs with the Panel's statement that powders may often reach peak blood levels more rapidly than a tablet dosage form. However, the Panel also concluded that there was a lack of clinical studies that would prove or disprove that such differences in absorption will result in clinically important differences in the onset, intensity, or incidence of relief of pain or fever (42 FR 35480). As discussed in comment 42 above, the agency agrees, with the Panel. Because the comment provided no clinical data that demonstrate a relationship between faster absorption and faster or enhanced pain relief, the claim \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin\" is classified in Category III for powder dosage forms of aspirin. The agency has determined that for this claim to have clinical significance to consumers and to be included in the monograph, data are needed that establish that this effect makes a difference in the onset, intensity, or incidence of relief of pain or fever.

One comment requested that the following Category III labeling claims for buffered aspirin products be allowedfor carbaspirin calcium: \"Faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin\" and\"provides ingredients that may prevent the stomach distress that plain aspirin occasionally causes but should not be taken by certain individuals with stomach disorders as cautioned elsewhere on the label.\" To support its request, the comment pointed out that the Panel concluded that carbaspirin calcium (formerly calcium carbaspirin has a more rapid dissolution rate than aspirin and that slightly less gastrointestinal bleeding may result from its use (42 FR 35417). Although carbaspirin calcium may produce slightly less gastrointestinal bleeding than aspirin, the agency notes that the Panel found no evidence that gastric bleeding is related to gastric upset (see comment 46 below); therefore, decreased gastrointestinal bleeding is not sufficient evidence to prove that carbaspirin calcium may be indicated when aspirin cannot be tolerated. With regard to rate of dissolution, the Panel reported on a study by Levy and Hayes that showed that the dissolution half- time of calcium acetylsalicylate carbamide complex (carbaspirin calcium) is the same as that of aspirin buffered with aluminum glycinate and magnesium carbamide (Ref. 1). The authors stated that the incidence of local gastric irritation and the absorption rate of a drug is a function of its dissolution rate (in its particular dosage form). While the results of the study by Levy and Hayes (Ref. 1) are indicative of the rapid dissolution of the product used in the study, an in vitro dissolution test alone is not adequate to support the use of the stomach distress claim for this ingredient. Moreover, because dissolution rates can be significantly influenced by product formulation, the results cannot be extrapolated to other formulations containing carbaspirin calcium. In the absence of any supporting clinical data, the agency is not proposing to include the claim,\"provides ingredients that may prevent the stomach distress that plain aspirin occasionally causes but should not be taken by certain individuals with stomach disorders as cautioned elsewhere on the label\" for this ingredient in the tentative final monograph and classifies the claim in Category III. As discussed in comment 42 above, the agency agrees with the Panel that there is a lack of clinical studies to demonstrate that differences in absorption will result in clinically important differences in the onset, intensity, or incidence of the relief of pain or fever. Similarly, the agency concludes that the data are notsufficient to demonstrate that differences in dissolution will result in a clinically important difference in analgesia. Therefore, the agency classifies the claim \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin\" in Category III for this ingredient. The agency has determined that for this claim to have clinical significance to consumers and to be included in the monograph, data are needed that establish that this effect makes a difference in the onset, intensity, or incidence of relief of pain or fever.

One comment requested that the following claims for choline salicylate be permitted as Category I labeling: \"Acts five times faster than aspirin,\"\"reaches peak action twelve times faster than aspirin,\" \"does not cause the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the administration of aspirin and other salicylate compounds,\" \"causes less gastric irritation,\" and \"may be taken on an empty stomach and may prevent the stomach distress that aspirin occasionally causes but should not be taken by certain individuals with stomach disorders as cautioned elsewhere on the label.\" The comment pointed out that the Panel referred to studies showing that choline salicylate does not cause as much gastric bleeding as aspirin and that there is a lower incidence of gastrointestinal distress after choline salicylate administration than after aspirin administration (42 FR 35418. The comment noted 'that the claims \"acts five times faster than aspirin\" and \"reaches peak action twelve times faster than aspirin\" are included in the approved new application (NDA) labeling of choline salicylate. The OTC drug product referred to by the comment as being the subject of an NDA was approved in 1959. The product was further evaluated under the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) Program by the Panel on Neurological Drugs and the Panel on Drugs Used in Rheumatic Diseases. The agency published the Panels' findings in the Federal Register, of April 20, 1972 (37 FR 7820). The Panel on Neurological Drugs concluded that adequate studies showed that blood salicylate levels after choline salicylate administration were 5 times as high in 12 minutes and twice as high in 30 minutes but that there were no clinical studies to show that the onset of analgesic action was sooner, greater, or46225 46226 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules more prolonged than with aspirin (37 FR 7823). In the same Federal Register, the agency stated that any further action on the product was deferred pending completion of the OTC drug review (37 FR 7820). The Internal Analgesic Panel reported on several studies that indicated that choline salicylate is more rapidly absorbed than aspirin. However, the Panel reached the same conclusion as the DESI Panel on Neurological Drugs that there is a lack of clinical studies to demonstrate that more rapid absorption will result in a significant clinical effect (42 FR 35418). As discussed in comment 42 above, the agency concludes that the claim \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin\" is a Category III claim because of the lack of such clinical data. Similarly, the agency concludes that the data are not adequate to support the claims \"acts five times faster than aspirin\" and \"reaches peak action twelve times faster than aspirin.\" The agency notes that the Panel concluded that such claims should be classified in Category II. However, the Panel also concluded that Category III should be used to classify claims that have a reasonable basis and probably can be evaluated by further testing (42 FR 35435 and 35480). The agency concludes that such a reasonable basis exists and that such claims should be classified in Category III. The agency has determined that for this claim to have clinical significance to consumers and to be included in the monograph, data are needed that establish that this effect makes a difference in the onset, intensity, or incidence of relief of pain or fever. Regarding the claims concerning the effect of choline salicylate on the stomach, the Internal Analgesic Panel concluded that based on its review of the submitted data further testing was required to substantiate claims such as\"may be taken on an empty stomach and may prevent the stomach distress that aspirin occasionally causes\" and proposed a Category III classification for such statements (42 FR 35418). The Panel did note that choline salicylate like highly buffered aspirin is ingested as a solution and may have a performance action similar to highly buffered aspirin for that reason. In the absence of any new supporting clinical data, the agency is placing the above labeling statement and the related claim \"causes less gastric irritation\" in Category III. The agency is not proposing to include in the monograph the claim \"does not cause the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the administration ofaspirin and other salicylate compounds.\" This statement refers to occult bleeding. The agency believes that allowing this claim may confuse or unduly alarm consumers by implying that aspirin frequently or commonly causes overt bleeding (or hemorrhaging) from the gastrointestinal tract. The agency believes that this claim is not appropriate for use in the labeling of OTC internal analgesic drug products containing choline salicylate and therefore proposes that this claim be classified as Category II. 46. One comment requested that products containing magnesium salicylate be allowed to claim that this ingredient has less potential to cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract than aspirin. The comment contended that a submission to the Panel contained enough data to justify this claim (Ref. 1) and provided a letter from a physician stating that his clinical experience shows that patients tolerate magnesium salicylate better than aspirin. The comment also cited magnesium salicylate's physicochemical characteristics as additional support for the claim that it produces less gastrointestinal irritation than aspirin, explaining that magnesium salicylate goes into solution at a higher pH than aspirin and the magnesium ions may provide some buffering capacity. The data reviewed by the Panel and cited by the comment included a human study in which a gastrocamera showed that both magnesium salicylate and aspirin caused some irritation of the mucous membranes of the stomach. However, the Panel concluded that the results of the study showed no significant difference in the degree of irritation between the ingredients. From other human studies, using radioactive chromate labeling of red blood cells, the Panel concluded that magnesium salicylate might produce less gastrointestinal bleeding than aspirin (42 FR 35419). However, the Panel concluded that there is no evidence that gastric bleeding is related to gastric upset and that these studies are not sufficient to prove that magnesium salicylate may be indicated when aspirin cannot be tolerated. The agency agrees with the Panel's conclusions. Because no new information has been submitted, the agency is placing the claim that magnesium salicylate has less potential for causing gastrointestinal irritation than does aspirin in Category III. Adequate clinical studies are necessary to support such a claim. Reference (1) OTC Volume 030042.47. Several comments supported the Panel's recommendation against concurrent analgesic-antacid labeling claims for highly buffered aspirin for solution and urged adoption of the stomach distress warning recommended in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iv). The comments stated that highly. buffered aspirin for solution can cause gastrointestinal distress (stomach distress), peptic ulceration, and massive gastrointestinal bleeding and that the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding increases when this product is used with alcohol. The comments cited a \"personal communication\" and published studies (Refs. 1 through 5) to support this concern. Other comments opposed the Panel's recommendation and argued that highly buffered aspirin for solution can be safely used to relieve concurrent symptoms of headache and upset stomach. The comments stated that this drug product does not cause mucosal erosions, and does not cause massive gastrointestinal bleeding, with or without alcohol. The comments stated that the \"stomach distress\" warning would preclude the marketing of these products for concurrent symptoms of headache and upset stomach. One comment expressed concern that if a highly buffered aspirin for solution cannot be marketed for concurrent symptoms of headache and upset stomach, consumers will substitute less widely used and tested products containing acetaminophen and antacid. Highly buffered aspirin for solution contains a sufficient quantity of buffering ingredients to conform to the specifications for antacids established in the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products (21 CFR 331.10). Such products have been marketed for consumers with symptoms that require both an analgesic and an antacid, such as headache with heartburn or headache with \"upset stomach.\" In the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products published in the Federal Register of June 4,1974 (39 FR 19869), the agency concluded that there is a significant target population for which a combination product containing a salicylate and an antacid provides rational concurrent therapy. The agency further concluded that because the safety evidence for the use of analgesic- antacid combination products is derived from studies and experience with products intended for administration as a solution, the use of these combinations for concurrent symptoms should be limited to these types of products (39 FR 19869 and 19875). When the final monograph for OTC antacid drug Federal Register I Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules products was published, the agency had received no data to show that such a combination product would be unsafe to use for concurrent symptoms, nor have such data been received since publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic drug products. The agency has also not received any data showing that highly buffered aspirin for solution presents the risk of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage or that using these products with alcohol increases the risk of massive gastrointestinal bleeding in normal individuals. References 1 through 5, cited by one comment, discuss the association of alcohol and aspirin products with gastrointestinal bleeding, but do not provide sufficient evidence that the use of highly buffered aspirin and alcohol is associated with massive gastrointestinal bleeding. The agency could not assess the \"personal communication\" because the comment did not provide a copy. The agency concurs with the Internal Analgesic Panel's recommendation that aspirin products should not be used by consumers who have ulcers, bleeding problems, or recurring or persistent stomach problems. This recommendation is supported by the findings of a study on gastrointestinal hemorrhage in persons with stomach problems who used an aspirin-antacid for solution combination product (Ref. 6). However, the agency finds a lack of data to preclude the use of aspirin- antacid products as an analgesic- antacid for concurrent symptoms of headache and heartburn, etc., provided the product is intended for ingestion as a solution and provides at least 5 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity (as specified in \u00a7 331.10(a)]. Therefore, the agency is proposing that any highly buffered aspirin for solution or other aspirin- antacid product for solution be identified as a \"pain reliever-fever reducer\" (or the variation permitted in \u00a7 343.50(a)) (Products containing acetaminophen with antacid, identified in \u00a7 343.20(b)(1) in the tentative final monograph, are also being identified in the same manner.) However, the agency is not proposing to restrict acetaminophen-antacid products to dosage forms intended for ingestion as a solution because acetaminophen does not have the adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract that are associated with aspirin (see 42 FR 35413). The agency recognizes that in addition to a target population which uses highly buffered aspirin for solution and other aspirin with antacid products for concurrent symptoms of minor achesand pains and acid indigestion, there are consumers who also use such products just for analgesic-antipyretic use alone. The agency concludes that these products are safe and effective for both uses and that the labeling of these products should provide for use of the product for either concurrent symptoms or analgesic-antipyretic use alone. The agency notes that currently marketed products are labeled for both uses. Therefore, the agency is proposing the following statements of indications for products containing aspirin with antacid, based on the indications for analgesic-antipyretic ingredients in \u00a7 343.50(b)(1) and the indications for antacids \u00a7 331.30(b). New \u00a7 343.60(b)(4) for aspirin with antacid products (aspirin and antacid combinations) is being added to the tentative final monograph as follows: (4) For permitted combinations identified in \u00a7 343.20(b)(3). The indications are the following: \"For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains with\" (select one or more of the following: \"heartburn,\" \"and upset stomach associated with\" (select one of the as appropriate: \"this symptom\" or \"these symptoms\")] and \"Also may be used for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains alone\" [which may be followed by one or more of the following: (\"such as associated with\" (select one or by: \"(dysmenorrhea)\"), or \"premenstrual and menstrual cramps\" (which may be followed by: \"(dysmenorrhea)\")), (\"and for the minor pain from arthritis\"), and (\"and to reduce fever.\"]) Although the above indications apply to aspirin with antacid products, such products should not be used by persons who have persistent or recurring stomach problems, such as acid indigestion, or who have ulcers or bleeding problems, as stated in the warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c) (1)(v)(8) and (2)(v)(8). (See comment 31 above.) The agency is proposing that products containing acetaminophen with antacid be identified according to \u00a7 \u00a7 331.30 and 343.50 and bear labeling indications in accordance with \u00a7 343.60(b)(2). The agency believes that the proposed labeling for acetaminophen with antacid products and for aspirin with antacid products (including highly buffered aspirin for solution products) providesfor the safe and effective OTC use of both combinations. The agency is aware that the Antacid Panel recommended that any generally recognized as safe and effective analgesic ingredient could be combined with any antacid for concurrent symptoms (38 FR 8724) and that this recommendation is included in the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products (21 CFR 331.15(b)). However, this recommendation was based on data submitted for an aspirin-antacid combination product and an acetaminophen-antacid combination product both in forms intended for ingestion as a solution. No data were submitted to either the Antacid Panel or the Internal Analgesic Panel to support combinations of other Category I analgesics, especially non-aspirin salicylates, e.g., magnesium salicylate with an antacid. Because there are not sufficient data to support such combinations and because of a lack of evidence of the marketing of these combinations, the agency is not proposing to include combinations of non-aspirin salicylates (i.e., choline salicylate, magnesium salicylate, and sodium salicylate) and carbaspirin calcium with antacids in this tentative final monograph and is classifying such combinations in Category III. The final. monograph for OTC antacid drug products currently provides for antacid- analgesic combinations marketed in a form intended for ingestion as a solution only (21 CFR 331.15(b)). That monograph, which was developed many years ago, provides for an antacid to be combined with any generally recognized as safe and effective analgesic ingredient(s). However, as discussed above, certain possible combinations have never been marketed and lack supporting data. Therefore, elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the agency is proposing to amend the antacid final monograph so that it and the internal analgesic monograph will be consistent.

One comment asserted that the terms \"extra strength\" and \"extra pain relief\" should be allowed in describing products containing 500 ng acetaminophen. The comment contended that these terms are justified because 1,000 mg (two 500-mg tablets) acetaminophen provides greater pain relief than 650 mg acetaminophen (two 325-mg tablets). Other comments opposed the use of such labeling claims. One comment proposed that the labeling of products containing nonstandard dosage units contain a statement denying the therapeutic advantage of products labeled in this manner. The agency recognizes, as the Panel did, that the OTC drug market currently includes many different products containing analgesic-antipyretic drugs, either as single active ingredients or in combination with other active ingredients. Most of these products contain either aspirin or acetaminophen in varying amounts of active ingredients(s) per dosage unit. The Panel believed that the availability of products containing different amounts of aspirin per dosage unit is confusing to consumers and encouraged the current use of claims such as \"higher levels of pain reliever.\" To inform the consumer more fully of the contents and therapeutic capabilities of these products and to minimize confusion, the Panel recommended that products be clearly labeled as to the amount of active ingredient per dosage unit. The Panel further recommended the establishment of standard dosage units for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate (42 FR 35357). Based on these criteria, the Panel proposed that these ingredients and comparable analgesic drugs be labeled as containing either a \"standard\" or \"nonstandard\" dosage unit. As discussed in comment 53 below, the agency will not require the terms \"standard\" and \"nonstandard\" in labeling. The Panel did not specifically address the terms \"extra strength\" and \"extra pain relief,\" but did recommend a wide dosage range for which OTC analgesic- antipyretic drug products are safe and effective. The Panel recommended a 325-mg minimum effective dose, but also recognized 650 mg as the usual single dose. Furthermore, the Panel found that there may be circumstances when more than the usual single dose may be needed for an adequate effect, provided the daily dosage does not exceed 4,000 ng in a 24-hour period (42 FR 35360), and thus recommended OTC dosage ranges of 325 to 650 rmg every 4 hours,more than 325 mg to 500 mg every 3 hours, or 842 to 1,000 mg every 6 hours. In general, the agency concurs with the Panel's recommended dosage schedule, which is flexible and which provides for a wide dosage range per dosage unit. (See comment 53 below for further discussion.) Terms such as\"extra strength\" may be helpful to consumers by alerting them to the fact that products bearing such labeling may not necessarily contain the quantity of analgesic-antipyretic that is contained in other products they have purchased. However, the agency tentatively concludes that \"extra strength,\"\"maximum strength,\" \"extra pain relief,\" and similar terms that are only peripherally related to product safety and effectiveness are outside the scope of the OTC drug review. Therefore, these terms will not be included in labeling required by the monograph, but may be used elsewhere in labeling, but not intermixed with monograph labeling, subject to the provisions of section 502 of the act. The agency encourages drug manufacturers voluntarily to provide consumers with an explanation of terms such as \"extra strength\" and \"maximum strength\" when they are used in labeling. 49. One comment requested that the professional labeling recommended in \u00a7 343.80 be amended to include an indication for the use of aspirin for transient ischemic attacks. Another comment requested that buffered aspirin also be included in this indication. The comments presented data to support their requests (Ref. 1). A transient ischemic attack is a sudden onset of a focal neurologic dysfunction that may precede a stroke. It affects the brain or retina and clears after a period lasting from a few seconds up to 24 hours. The data submitted by the comments included two multicenter clinical studies as follows: a 37-month trial conducted by Fields et al. (Ref. 2) and a 55-month trial conducted by The Canadian Cooperative Study Group (Ref. 3). The study by Fields et al. was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing aspirin with placebo in 178 patients to determine the incidence of subsequent transient ischemic attack, death, cerebral infarction, or retinal infarction. Only persons with episodes of monocular blindness or hemispheric- type transient ischemic attacks were eligible for admission to the study. Persons with symptoms in the carotid area were included, and those with only vertebrobasilar symptoms were excluded. Another requirement was that the most recent transient ischemic attack had occurred not more than 3months prior to randomization. The absolute endpoints studied were mortality, retinal infarctions, and cerebral infarctions. The analysis of the absolute endpoints, i.e., death or cerebral or retinal infarction, failed to show a statistically significant differential between aspirin and placebo. However, because the primary objective of the study was to determine whether aspirin would result in a reduction of transient ischemic attacks, a second class of endpoints was used to evaluate the patients' experience during the first 6 months of follow-up (after randomization). Endpoints included not only infarctions (cerebral or retinal) but also the number of transient ischemic attacks reported. When the absolute endpoints were coupled with the occurrence of transient ischemic attack in the first 6 months of follow-up, there was a statistically significant differential (p 0.01) in favor of aspirin. When the patients were separately grouped according to whether they had a single carotid transient ischemic attack or multiple attacks before admission to the study, a life table analysis of absolute endpoints revealed a statistical significance in favor of aspirin within the group of patients with multiple attacks. When the occurrence of carotid transient ischemic attacks during the first B months of follow-up was also taken into consideration, analysis of patients who had single or multiple transient ischemic attacks revealed a statistically significant differential in favor of aspirin. The study conducted by the Canadian Cooperative Study Group was a randomized, four-treatment, double- blind trial to determine whether aspirin or sulfinpyrazone, singly or in combination, was superior to placebo in preventing transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death in patients afflicted with transient ischemic attacks or partial nonprogressing stroke in either carotid or vertebral territory (Ref. 3). Approximately 65 percent of the 585 subjects had symptoms suggesting brain ischemia in the area supplied by the carotid artery; 25 percent of the subjects were affected in the area supplied by the vertebrobasilar artery; and 10 percent of the subjects had both the vertebrobasilar and carotid arteries affected. Patients with heinodynamic (pertaining to the movements involved in the circulation of the blood) or cardiac causes were excluded from the study. The average period of followup was 26 months. The compliance rate was 92 percent. Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules Three endpoints were assessed in the study: Transient ischemic attack, stroke, and death. If any of these endpoints occurred by the end of the trial, or within 6 months of withdrawal where treatment had been terminated, they were counted against their randomly assigned treatment regimen. None of the 3 drug treatment groups was significantly different from the placebo treatment group for any endpoint, but when the 2 treatment groups taking aspirin (i.e., aspirin alone and aspirin with sulfinpyrazone} were compared with the two groups that were not taking aspirin (i.e., the groups taking sulfinpyrazone alone or placebo) for the combined endpoints of stroke and death, the reduction with aspirin was 31 percent (p <0.05). In subset analysis, the benefit from aspirin therapy was confined to males, with a 48-percent reduction in stroke and death (p <0.005). There was no significant benefit in females in either treatment category. Based upon the data described above, the agency's Peripheral and Central Nervous System (CNS) Drugs Advisory Committee concluded that there is evidence that aspirin is safe and effective for reducing the risk of recurrent transient ischemic attacks or stroke in men who have had transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli (Refs. 2, 3, and 4). In concluding that aspirin is safe and effective in reducing these risks in males, the Committee recommended a dosage of 1,300 mg aspirin per day in divided doses of 650 mg twice a day or 325 mg four times a day. Studies were submitted on the absorption characteristics of buffered aspirin and plain aspirin products (Refs. 5 and 6). Nayak et al. (Ref. 5) conducted three blinded studies (A, B, and C) on the effect of antacids on aspirin dissolution and bioavailability. The 12 normal adult subjects (8 male, 4 female) abstained from using any medication 1 week before and during the studies. Study A was conducted to determine the absorption characteristics of four aspirin formulations with different buffering capacity and in vitro dissolution profile. Each subject abstained from solid food and liquids, except water, from midnight of each study day. The subjects were randomly divided into four equal groups assigned to the rows of a selected 4 x 4 Latin square. On each of the test days, which were I week apart, a single dose (2 tablets) of each of the following formulations was given: 325 mg aspirin; 325 mg aspirin with 150 mg aluminum hydroxide gel and 150 mg magnesium hydroxide; 325 mg aspirin with 75 mgaluminum hydroxide gel and 75 mg magnesium hydroxide; and 325 mg aspirin with 50 mg aluminum glycinate and 100 mg magnesium carbonate. A pretest blood sample was collected, and each subject was given a single dose of the formulations with 200 mL water. Blood samples were collected at various intervals; the plasma was separated and frozen before being analyzed. Results were expressed as the total salicylate concentration in salicylic acid equivalents, and a pharmacokinetic analysis of data was performed. The results showed that the buffered formulations produced significantly higher peak concentrations of plasma salicylate than the unbuffered formulation. However, a comparison of the area-under-curve values showed no statistically significant difference among formulations. Study B was conducted to assess the effect that doubling the aspirin and antacid dose would have on the absorption of aspirin. The subjects and methods were identical to study A except that each subject was given a single dose of four tablets containing 325 mg aspirin, 150 mg aluminum hydroxide gel, and 150 mg magnesium hydroxide per tablet. A pharmacokinetic analysis of data was performed. In study C, 2 hours after a meal of 1 cup of dry cereal, 8 oz of whole milk, 6 oz of orange juice, sugar, and 1 cup of coffee or tea, three male subjects received four tablets of the same formulation used in study B (Ref. 5]. The subjects swallowed the tablets with 200 mL water. The blood sampling and analysis were the same as in study A, except that blood was collected without anticoagulant and processed for serum. The results of studies B and C showed that the concentration-time profile and the bioavailability were similar in both studies. Thus, there was no evidence of a lower or erratic absorption of aspirin due to the antacids used as compared with unbuffered aspirin. A study was conducted to determine whether the aspirin in a commercial buffered aspirin product containing 325 mg aspirin and 150 mg magnesium- aluminum hydroxide was as effective as 325 mg plain aspirin in inhibiting platelet aggregation in vitro (Ref. 6). The methodology was collagen-induced aggregation of guinea pig or human platelets (in vitro). Separate solutions of aspirin and the buffered aspirin product were prepared using sterile saline solution. Each solution contained 3.25 mg aspirin per mL, equivalent to a molar aspirin concentration of 1.8 X10\"'. Subsequent dilutions were used at a log concentration ratio of 1.5. Nonfastedmale guinea pigs weighing 300 to 500 g were used throughout the study. When human platelets were used, they were separated and handled in the same way as those collected from guinea pigs. Platelet aggregation assays were conducted, and the data were quantified by calculating area-under-curve values for each dilution. Aspirin and the buffered aspirin product were first compared in an experiment to find a dose range. The results showed that both the plain aspirin and the buffered aspirin product would produce dose-related inhibitory effects on the aggregation of guinea pig platelets in the range of 1.8X10.4 to 1.8 X 10'5 molar concentration. The concentration for 50 percent inhibition (ICso) was found to be 1.3 X 10\"4 molar for the aspirin in the plain aspirin product. In the buffered aspirin product the ICso was found to be 1.4X10\"* molar. The investigators concluded that the - similarity of the ICso values indicates there is no difference between the effect of plain aspirin and the effect of the buffered aspirin product on platelet aggregation. The ICo values for aspirin and the buffered aspirin product on human platelets (1.4 X104 and 1.3X104, respectively) were close to those found for guinea pig platelets. The slopes of the respective regression lines were similar, indicating no specific differences. The investigators concluded that plain aspirin and the buffered aspirin product are equally effective in inhibiting collagen-induced aggregation of both guinea pig and human platelets in vitro and that the buffered aspirin product would be as useful as plain aspirin in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks. Based upon the Peripheral and CNS Drugs Advisory Committee's recommendation on aspirin and transient ischemic attacks and the agency's review of the data submitted to show that buffered aspirin would be expected to have similar effects, the agency concludes that both aspirin and buffered aspirin can be used for reducing the risk of recurrent transient ischemic attacks or stroke in males. This use of aspirin and buffered aspirin is being proposed for incorporation into the professional labeling section of the tentative final monograph, with the recommended dosage of 1,300 mg aspirin per day in divided doses of 650 mg twice a day or 325 mg four times a day. The agency believes that sodium- containing buffered aspirin should not be used for this purpose because the chronic ingestion of sodium is ill- advised in this patient population.46229 46230 Federal Register / Vol. 53,'No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules The agency also points out that aspirin or buffered aspirin without sodium is not indicated in all forms of sudden onset of focal neurologic dysfunction simulating transient ischemic attacks. Also, the effects of concurrent administration of therapeutic amounts of antacids on the absorption and the elimination of aspirin must be considered, but the current literature contains minimal information on these effects. Levy et al. (Ref. 7) conducted a study on three children with rheumatic fever to determine whether serum salicylate concentrations are affected by an antacid containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide. Aspirin bioavailability (completeness of absorption) was estimated from the amount of total salicylate excreted in the children's urine over a 2-hour period, with urine specimens collected during the antacid and control periods. The investigators found that the estimated daily excretion was in reasonably good agreement with the daily dose and did not decrease during antacid administration. Levy et al. (Ref. 7) also investigated the effect of an antacid containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide on the bioavailability of aspirin in five healthy adult males. Each subject received two 325-mg tablets of aspirin 1 hour after a breakfast of 28 g corn flakes and 500 mL milk. The tablets were swallowed whole with 50 mL water. Two of the subjects first received only aspirin; the other three were given 20 mL aluminum and magnesium hydroxide suspension with 50 mL water immediately after the aspirin was ingested. No food or coffee was permitted for 4 hours, and each subject's urine was collected periodically for 48 hours. About I week later, crossover experiments compared the percentage of salicylate recovered in each subject's urine with aspirin given alone to the percentage recovered when the aspirin- antacid was given. Results (expressed as total salicylate recovered) showed that the antacid product containing aluminum and magnesium hydroxide had no apparent effect on aspirin absorption. In addition, while reviewing data on the use of aspirin for myocardial infarction, the agency identified certain information that it considers pertinent to the use of aspirin for the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (see comment 50 below). In the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS) (Ref. 8), the dosage of 1,000 mg per day of aspirin was associated with small increases in blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, andserum uric acid levels. This dosage was also associated with increased incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms including stomach pain, heartburn, nausea and/or vomiting, as well as gross gastrointestinal bleeding. Because the dosage of aspirin proposed for the prevention of transient ischemic attacks is 1,300 mg, the agency believes that-this information should be included in the proposed professional labeling for aspirin for transient ischemic attacks.

Based upon the above discussion, the agency is proposing in \u00a7 343.80(b) the following indications, precautions, and dosage in the professional labeling: For products containing aspirin identified in \u00a7 34310(b) or permitted combinations identified in \u00a7 343.20(b}(4) except those containing sodium. The labeling states, under the heading \"ASPIRIN FOR TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS,\" the following: Indication. For reducing the risk of recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA's) or stroke in men who have had transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli. There is inadequate evidence that aspirin or buffered aspirin is effective in reducing TIA's in women at the recommended dosage. There is no evidence that aspirin or buffered aspirin is of benefit in the treatment of completed strokes in men or women.Clinical Trials: The indication is supported by the results of a Canadian study I in which 585 patients with threatened stroke were followed in a randomized clinical trial for an average of 26 months to determine whether aspirin or sulfinpyrazone, singly or in combination, was superior to placebo in preventing transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death. The study showed that, although sulfinpyrazone had no statistically significant effect, aspirin reduced the risk of continuing transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death by 19 percent and reduced the risk of stroke or death by 31 percent. Another aspirin study carried out in the United States with 178 patients, showed a statistically significant number of \"favorable outcomes,\" including reduced transient ischemic attacks, stroke, and death. Precautions: Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of TIA's should have a complete medical and neurologic evaluation. Consideration should be given to other disorders that resemble TIA's. Attention should be given to risk factors: It is important to evaluate and treat, if appropriate, other diseases associated with TIA's and stroke, such as hypertension and diabetes. Concurrent administration of absorbable antacids at therapeutic doses may increase the clearance of salicylates in some individuals. The concurrent administration of nonabsorbable antacids may alter the rate of absorption of aspirin, thereby resulting in a decreased acetylsalicylic acid/salicylate ratio in plasma. The clinical significance of these decreases in available aspirin is unknown. Aspirin at dosages of 1,000 milligrams per day has been associated with small increases in blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, and serum uric acid levels. It is recommended that patients placed on long-term aspirin treatment be seen at regular intervals to assess changes in these measurements. Adverse Reactions: At dosages of 1,000 milligrams or higher of aspirin per day, gastrointestinal side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea and/or vomiting, as well as increased rates of gross gastrointestinal bleeding. (Other applicable warnings related to the use of aspirin as described in \u00a7 343.50(c) may also be included here.) Dosage and Administration: Adult oral dosage for men is 1,300 milligrams a day, in divided doses of O5 milligrams twice a day or 325 milligrams four times a day.

One comment submitted data (Ref. 1) and requested that the professional labeling recommended in \u00a7 343.80 be Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules expanded to include an indication for the use of aspirin in the prophylaxis of secondary myocardial infarction. Another comment submitted data (Ref. 2) and requested the agency to issue professional labeling guidelines that provide for the use of highly buffered aspirin in solution to prevent myocardial infarction in men with unstable angina. The agency has reviewed the submitted data and determined that aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of death and/or non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with a previous infarction or unstable angina pectoris. The agency evaluated six secondary prevention trials (Refs. 3 through 8) and one controlled clinical trial of unstable angina (Ref. 9). Although none of the six secondary prevention trials individually showed a significant aspirin effect on mortality, the pooled results did show a moderately impressive statistically significant reduction in the occurrence of death and/or non-fatalmyocardial infarction. Five of the six secondary prevention trials showed a favorable trend. Two of the individual studies showed a significant effect, and two others showed a near significant effect (p=0.06, p=0.08) on the combined endpoint of non-fatal infarction and/or death, as well as on non-fatal infarction alone. The pooled results showed a highly significant aspirin treatment effect on the combined or non-fatal infarction endpoint.-The post-infarction and unstable angina trials, while studies of different diseases, mutually support each other by showing effects on the same endpoint. The trials also provide pertinent dosing information. Five of the six secondary prevention trials used doses of 1,000 mg per day or more; one of these trials and the unstable angina trial used about 300 mg per day. The latter two trials, along with considerable pharmacologic evidence that platelet-induced thrombogenesis can be reduced by doses near 300 mg and the expectation that gastrointestinal bleeding would likely be less prominent at lower dosages, have led the agency to conclude that 300 mg (or a conventional 325 mg dose) of aspirin per day is effective for the prevention of , myocardial infarction in patients with a previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina.- - In the secondary prevention trials, aspirin treatment was started at intervals after the onset of acute myocardial infarction varying from less than three days to more than five years and continued for periods of from less than one year to four years. Treatment within a week of onset of myocardial infarction was not shown to bebeneficial in the cases presenting with acute infarction in the unstable angina trial. The data did show beneficial trends for stronger effects in the first six months after acute infarction and for the first two years after starting treatment. However, these trends were not well enough established to justify limiting treatment to these intervals. Due to this uncertainty, the labeling that the agency is proposing does not.include any specific recommendation regarding when to start or stop aspirin treatment. Most of the subjects in the secondary prevention trials and all of those in the unstable angina trials were male. Due to the small numbers of females in the studies, the use of aspirin for this indication in women cannot be supported by available data. However, the agency does not believe that use in women is necessarily unreasonable and the professional labeling that the agency is proposing does not discourage such use, but simply notes the limitation on the number of females in the clinical trials, In the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study (ANUS) (Ref. 3), the aspirin- treated group showed a small increase in blood pressure after adjustment for baseline pressure. Similar findings for other United States aspirin trials of secondary prevention were also found. While these blood pressure elevations were clinically small, the agency believes that this finding should be included in the labeling. The agency also believes that it should be kept in mind that only about 10 percent of the subjects were hypertensive at baseline and that the -blood pressure eligibility restrictions in these trials were such that severely hypertensive subjects were not entered fRefs. 4 and 5). Aspirin treated groups in both the AMIS trial and the United States aspirin studies showed small but definite increases in blood urea nitrogen and uric acid; thus, the agency concludes that during the course of long-term aspirin therapy users of this drug should be monitored regularly to assess changes in these measurements. Based on the data from the unstable angina trial of Lewis et aL. (Ref. 9), which used one 325 mg dose of aspirin in a highly buffered solution, the agency has concluded that highly buffered -aspirin for solution (aspirin/antacid combination (see comment 76 below)) as well as buffered aspirin in a solid dosage form is safe and effective to reduce the risk of death and/or non- fatal myocardial infarction in patients with a previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina. However, the agency believes that sodium intake should be considered in this patient populationand has included a statement concerning the amount of sodium in the aspirin/antacid combination in the Lewis trial [Ref 9) and how much this amount of sodium adds to the intake suggested as appropriate for the dietary treatment of essential hypertension in the \"1984 Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure\" (Ref. 10). In conclusion, the agency is proposing that the professional labeling section of the tentative final monograph (ie., information provided to health professionals only, and not to the general public) should include aspirin for the indication, \"to reduce the risk of death and/or non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with a previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris.\" The agency is proposing in \u00a7 343.80(c) the following professional labeling: For products containing aspirin identified in \u00a7 343.10[a) or permitted combinations identified in ff 343.20(b),(3) and [4). The labeling states, under the heading \"ASPIRIN FOR MYOCAIRDIAL INFARCTION,\" the following: Indication: Aspirin is indicated to reduce the risk of death and/or non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with a previous infarction or unstable angina pectoris. Clinical Trials: The indication is supported by the results of six large, randomized multicenter, placebo- controlled studies involving 10,818, predominantly male, post-myocardial (MI) patients and one randomized placebo-controlled study of 1,2a8 men with unstable angina 1.. Therapy with aspirin was begun at intervals after the onset of acute MI varying from less than 3 days to more than 5 years and continued for periods of from less than 1 year to 4 years. In the unstable angina study, treatment was started within I month after the onset of unstable angina and continued for 12 weeks, and patients with complicating conditions such as congestive heart failure were not included in the study. Aspirin therapy in MI patients was associated -with about a 20-percent reduction in the risk of subsequent death andfor non- fatal reinfarction, a median absolute decrease of 3 percent from the 12- to 22- percent event rates in the placebo groups. In aspirin-treated unstable angina patients the reduction in risk was about 50 percent, a reduction in the event rate of 5 percent from the 10-percent rate in the placebo group over the 12-weeks of the study. Daily dosage of aspirin in the post- myocardial infarction studies was 300 milligrams in one study and 900 to 1,500 milligrams in 5 studies A dose of 325 milligrams was used in the study of unstable, angina. Adverse Reactions: Gastrointestinal Reactions: Doses of 1,000 milligrams per day of aspirin caused gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding that in some cases were clinically46231 46232 Federal Register /.Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules significant. In the largest post-infarction study (the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS) with 4,500 people), the percentage incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms for the aspirin (1,000 milligrams of a standard, solid-tablet formulation) and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, were: stomach pain (14.5'percent; 4.4 percent); heartburn (11.9 percent; 4.8 percent); nausea and/or vomiting (7.0 percent; 2.1 percent); hospitalization for gastrointestinal disorder (4.8 percent; 3.5 percent). In the AMIS and other trials, aspirin-treated patients had increased rates of gross gastrointestinal bleeding. Symptoms and signs of gastrointestinal irritation were not significantly increased in subjects treated for unstable angina with buffered aspirin in solution. (Other applicable warnings related to the use of aspirin as described in \u00a7 343.50(c) may also be included here.)Cardiovascular and Biochemical In the AMIS trial, the dosage of 1,000 milligrams per day of aspirin was associated with small increases in systolic blood pressure (BP) (average 1.5 to 2.1 millimeters) and diastolic BP (0.5 to 0.6 millimeters), depending upon w(iether maximal or last available readings were used. Blood urea nitrogen and uric acid levels were also increased, but by less than 1.0 milligram percent. Subjects with marked hypertension or renal insufficiency had been excluded from the trial so that the clinical importance of these observations for such subjects or for any subjects treated over more prolonged periods is not known. It is recommended that patients placed on long-term aspirin treatment, even at doses of 300 milligrams per day. be seen at regular intervals to assess changes in these measurements. Sodium in Buffered Aspirin for Solution Formulations: One tablet daily of buffered aspirin in' solution adds 553 milligrams of sodium to that in the diet and may not be tolerated bypatients with active sodium-retaining states such as congestive heart or renal failure. This amount of sodium adds about 30 percent to the 70- to 90-millequivalents intake suggested as appropriate for dietary treatment of essential hypertension in the \"1984 Report of the joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure\".8 Dosage and Administration: Although most of the studies used dosages exceeding 300 milligrams, 2 trials used only 300 milligrams and pharmacologic data indicate that this dose inhibits platelet function fully. Therefore, 300 milligrams or a conventional 325 milligram aspirin dose is a reasonable, routine dose that would minimize gastrointestinal adverse reactions. This use of aspirin applies to both solid, oral dosage forms (buffered and plain aspirin) and buffered aspirin in solution.

Several comments suggested that changes be made in the quality and quantity of advertisements for OTC internal analgesic drug products to eliminate \"excessive claims for minor differences in drug properties\" and to reduce the likelihood of consumers being unduly persuaded or misled by such inappropriate statements. Another comment contended that consumers often do not realize from current OTC analgesic drug advertising that many of these products contain aspirin. An example of such advertising is as follows: \"Contains more of the pain killer which doctors prescribe most.\" The comment urged that FDA require manufacturers to state in their advertising that their products contain aspirin. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has the primary responsibility for regulating OTC drug advertising, and FDA has forwarded copies of the comments concerning internal analgesic advertising to the FTC for its consideration (Ref. 1). FDA does, however, have the authority to regulate OTC drug advertising that constitutes labeling under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. See, e.g., United States v. Article of Drug * * * B- Complex Cholinos Capsules, 362 F.2d 923 (3d Cir. 1966); V.E. Irons, Inc. v. United States, 244 F.2d 34 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 923 (1957). In addition, for an OTC drug to be generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded, the advertising for the drug must satisfy the FDA regulations in \u00a7 330.1(d) (21 CFR 330.1(d)), which state that the advertising may prescribe, recommend, or suggest the drug's use only under the conditions stated in the labeling. If advertising for an OTC internal analgesic drug product offers the drug product for conditions not included in Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules the final monograph labeling, the drug product may be subject to regulatory action by FDA. Reference 11) Letter from L Geismar, FDA, to W.B. Fisherow, FTC, June 18, 1981, included in OTC Volume 03BTFM. 52. Several comments asserted that the Panel extended its review beyond its charter by making statements concerning the advertising of the products under its review. The comments stated that FDA did not grant such authority in the procedures established for OTC drug advisory review panels. The comments further argued that the Paners statements on OTC drug advertising were not only inappropriate for inclusion In the report, but also were based on inadequate information because, according to FDA procedures, data and information pertaining to advertising were not submitted to the Panel.The OTC drug review procedures do not preclude a panel from expressing its concern about OTC drug advertising. The statements of opinion on advertising and the media Were included by the Panel in its report upon the recommendation of the Panel's consumer liaison representative (Ref. 1). These statements were partly based on a transcript of the proceedings of a conference sponsored by the Federal Communications Commission and the FTC and attended by representatives of consumer advocate groups, pharmaceutical associations and manufacturers, the broadcast media, and the academic community. The Panel discussed OTC drug advertising in its report in order to make its concerns known to the FTC,'as well as to FDA. Reference (1) Summary Minutes of the 20th Meeting of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products, June 25. 28, and 27, 1975, incorporated in OTC Volume 030173. D. Comments on Standard Dosage Unit and Analgesic Equivalence Value 53. Some comments supported the Panel's recommendation for standard dosage units and standard dosage schedules for all marketed OTC internal analgesic drug products containing aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate as single ingredients. The comments stated that adopting this recommendation would benefit consumers by reducing the confusion and misuse that result from the current availability of various dosage strengths and dosage schedules of these ingredients. The comments argued thatconsumers are used to taking \"two (325- mg) aspirin tablets\" for pain relief and could ingest toxic amounts of aspirin from using dosage units larger than 325 mg. The comments maintained that dosages greater than 650 mg (two 325- mg tablets) do not provide \"substantial benefit to a sufficient portion of the public\" to justify making dosage unit strengths greater than 325 mg generally available. Several comments opposed the standard and nonstandard labeling recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(d), arguing that such labeling implies differences in quality or therapeutic effect, would confuse consumers, and crowd information on the label. Several comments also opposed the concept of standard dosage units and standard dosage schedules, arguing that adopting them would deprive consumers of products with which they have been satisfied and would result in dosage changes in the labeling that may be overlooked by consumers. Some comments also argued that the concept of standard dosage unit is unsupported because various dosage levels of aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate are safe and effective and show increasing effectiveness with increased dosages. To resolve \"inconsistencies\" in the dosage units and schedules, one comment recommended that the adult dosage unit for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate be 325 mg (standard) and 500 mng or 650 ing (nonstandard). The comment also recommended a maximum single dose of 1,000 mg for each of these ingredients with a 4-hour dosage interval and a maximum daily dose of 4,000 mg. The agency agrees with the comments in opposition to the Panel's recommendation on standard and nonstandard labeling. The agency does not believe that use of the terms\"standard\" and \"nonstandard\" would simplify the comparison of various products containing different quantities of active ingredients or would aid consumers in selecting an OTC analgesic-antipyretic drug product. In addition, the agency is not aware that the existing manner of labeling these products has caused consumer confusion or resulted in misuse of these products. Therefore, the Panel's recommendation on standard and nonstandard labeling is not being included in this tentative final monograph. The Panel was aware that degrees of pain and analgesic responses vary and thus provided for safe and effective OTC adult analgesic dosage ranges for aspirin and sodium salicylate of 325 to650 mg every 4 hours, more than 325 to 500 mg every 3 hours, or 842 to 1,000 mg, every B hours. (See the Panel's recommended \u00a7 343.10 (a) and (f).) For acetaminophen, the Panel's recommended dosage ranges were 325 to 650 mg every 4 hours, 500 mg every 3 hours, or 1,000 mg every 6 hours. (See the Panel's recommended \u00a7 343.10(b).) As stated in comment 63 below, the agency believes that it is reasonable for acetaminophen to have the same dosage and frequency of administration as aspirin. The agency is revising the dosage schedule for acetaminophen to conform to that of aspirin. In addition, the dosage of \"more than\" 325 mg to 500 mg every 3 hours is being restated as 325 mg to 500 mg every 3 hours to include the 3Z5-mg minimal effective dose. Likewise, in consideration of the various analgesic dosage unit strengths currently being marketed, the agency is proposing that the dosage of 842 to 1,000 mg every B hours be revised to 650 to 1,000 mng every 6 hours to include the maximum recommended dose to be taken every 4 hours (i.e., 650 mg) as a minimum dose taken every 6 hours. The agency invites specific comment on this proposal. Based upon the above conclusions and dosage recommendations, the dosage schedules for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate- recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.10 (a), (b),-and (f) are being revised to eliminate the concepts of \"standard\" and \"nonstandard\" schedules and are being'combined under \u00a7 343.50(d)(2). The Panel's definitions of standard dosage units for these ingredients in 1 343.3 (c), (in), and (p) are not being proposed in this tentative final monograph. The agency notes that the Panel discussed a maximum initial single dose of 975 ng (15 grains (gr)) (three dosage units of 325 mg each) in a 4-hour dosing regimen (43 FR 35361) and recommended this loading dose for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate (\u00a7 343.12 (a)(ii), (b)(ii), and ((ii)). The agency is not proposing a loading dose for these ingredients -because it believes that such a provision may confuse consumers and lead to repeated dosing of 975 mg every 4 hours instead of 325 mg to 650 mg every 4 hours. For reasons stated in comments 62 and 63 below, the agency is not proposing an OTC dose of 975 mg (15 gr) or 1,000 mg every 4 hours. 54. Two comments objected to the standard dosage unit concept because it is not applicable to liquid products or a product containing aspirin in a gum base. One comment argued that it is inappropriate to use the standard46233 46234 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules dosage unit concept for certain liquids that contain combinations of analgesic ingredients and cough/cold ingredients, The other comment, noting that the advance notice of proposed rulemaking did not provide for a nonstandard dosage unit of 227.5 mg (3.5 gr) aspirin, requested that \u00a7 \u00a7 343.10(a) and 343.12(a) be expanded to include this nonstandard dosage unit, which is identical to that of the gum base product. As stated in comment 53 above, the agency is not adopting the Panel's recommendation for a standard dosage unit of 325 mg for OTC analgesic drug products. However, the dosage schedules of all OTC internal analgesic drug products, including liquid and gum base dosage forms, will have to comply with the final monograph when it is ' published. (See comments 53 above and 58 below.) 55. One comment stated that in establishing standard and usual doses the agency should not limit manufacturers to the exact metric equivalent of 10 gr, or its approximation, 650 mg. The comment pointed out that because the \"United States Pharmacopeia\" (U.S.P) (Ref. 1) recognizes 600 mg as the approximate metric equivalent of 10 gr, products containing either 600 or 650 mg (or the exact equivalent of 648 mg) should be allowed to use the term \"usual dose.\" Although the U.S.P recognizes 600 mg as an approximate equivalent to 10 gr (Ref. 2), the agency is not including the comment's suggestion that quantities other than 650 mg be equivalent to 10 gr because it agrees with the Panel's recommendation that the system of weight measurement for OTC internal analgesic drug products should be based on I gr being equivalent to 65 mg (42 FR 35357.) The \"usual dose\" of OTC analgesic- antipyretic drugs is any of the doses that conform with the dosages specified in this tentative final monograph in the section on directions. However, the agency is not allowing use of the term\"usual dose\" as a descriptive term for the same reasons that it did not adopt the use of the terms \"standard\" and\"nonstandard.\" (See comment 53 above.)

Several comments opposed the adoption of the Panel's recommended labeling statement in \u00a7 343.50(e) on analgesic equivalence value for calcium carbaspirin, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate. The comments contended that such labeling would crowd the required information on the label, confuse consumers, and imply that one product is more, or less, effective than another when in fact all products included in the monograph are safe and effective. Other comments, although not opposed to analgesic equivalence labeling, stated that such labeling is confusing and suggested alrernative labeling statements. The agency agrees with the comments that such statements could be misleading to consumers. All products that meet the specifications of the monograph are safe and effective. Therefore, the agency is not adopting the analgesic equivalence value labeling statements recommended by the Panel, and \u00a7 343.50(e), statement on analgesic equivalence value, and \u00a7 343.3 (a), (i), and (o), definitions of acetaminophen, aspirin, and sodium salicylate equivalence values, are not being included in this tentative final monograph. 57. One comment argued that the 325- mg (5 gr) unit dose restriction recommended by the Panel was not appropriate for analgesic powders. The comment contended that analgesic powders represent a dosage form in which the dosage and dosage unit are equivalent. For example, one powder envelope usually contains the equivalent of two tablets of \"standard\" aspirin. Because the Panel allowed an initial maximum dosage of 1,000 mg and also a 1,000-mg dosage every 6 hours, the comment requested that the agency, permit a dosage of 1,000 mg or less in one powder envelope, provided the Panel's dosage schedule is followed and the total daily dose does not exceed 4,000 mg. As discussed in comment 53 above, the agency is proposing not to adopt the Panel's recommendation for a specific adult dosage unit strength. Thus, OTC analgesic-antipyretic powders may be formulated with a 1,000-mg dosage unit strength per powder envelope. However, the dosage schedules of analgesic- antipyretic powders must be in conformance with the final monograph. E. Comments on Recommended Dosage Schedules 58. One comment urged that the Panel's recommendation in \u00a7\u00a7 343.10(a)(2) and 343.12(a)(2) be revised by increasing the children's dosage unit for aspirin products from 80mg (1.23 gr) to 81 mg (1.25 gr) and revising the children's dosage schedule accordingly. The comment contended that the 80-mg dosage unit is unavailable in aspirin products and that conversion to an 80-mg dosage unit would invalidate all currently available stability data for children's aspirin products. The comment argued that the availability of the 81-mg (I1V gr) dosage unit is recognized in \u00a7 \u00a7 201.314(c) (1) and (2) (21 CFR 201.314(c) (1) and (2)) and in the USP (Ref. 1). The comment concluded that a dosage schedule based on the 81-mg dosage unit is consistent with the dosage schedules for aspirin in \u00a7\u00a7 343.10(a)(1)(i) and 343.12(a)(1)(i) because 325 mg is a more accurate multiple of 81 mg than of 80 mg. The agency acknowledges that there has been longstanding acceptance of the 81-mg (1 gr) children's dosage unit for aspirin and agrees with the comment that it should be retained. Children's acetaminophen products are marketed in an 80-mg dosage unit strength, but the difference between 80-mg and 81-mg dosage unit strengths is of no therapeutic consequence. Thus, the agency believes that the children's dosage unit for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate should be either 80 mg or 81 mg, and the dosage schedule for children's products is being revised accordingly. In addition, the agency notes that the recommended dose of aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate for children 6 to 9 years of age is 325 mg (or 320 mg when four 80-mg dosage units are used and 324 mg when four 81-mg dosage units are used). Because this dose (i.e., 325 mg) is also the minimal effective dose for adults, the agency sees no reason to exclude it from the children's dosage schedule as the minimal effective dose for children over 9 years of age. The agency has no data to show that a minimal effective dose for children over 9 years of age poses a danger of therapeutic failure and subsequent overdose with resultant toxicity, as is the case with younger age groups. In view of the above discussion, the children's dosage schedule for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate that is based upon the children's dosage unit of 80 mg or 81 mg is as follows: Number of 80- Age (years) mg or 81-mg Dosage (mg) dosage units g Under 2 .................. 2 to under 4 .......... 2 4 to under 6 .......... 3 6 to under 9 .......... 4Consult a doctor. 160 or 162 240 or 243 320 or 324 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules Number of 80- Age (years) mg or 81-mg Dosage (mg)1 dosage units 9 to under I I.. 4t3S 320 to 405 11 to under 12.... 4to6 320 to 486 1 Dose may be repeated every -4 hours while symptoms persist, up to five times a day or as drrected by a doctor.

Consult a doctor. 2 to under 4 .......... 112 162,5 4 to under 6 .......... 3/4 243.8 6 to under 9 .......... 1 325 9 to under 11 .1 to 1% 325 to 406.3 11 to under 12 .1 tol % 325 to 487.5 Dose may be repeated every 4 hours while s'mptoms persist, up to five times a day or asdireced by a doctor. In \u00a7 343.50(d)(1) in the tentative final monograph, the agency is converting the dosage information in the schedules above to directions that provide concise instructions for the consumer. The agency proposes that adult dosage unit strengths exceeding 325 mg, particularly in solid dosage forms, are not suitable for use in children, because of the difficulty in dividing such dosage units to obtain an accurate children's dose. Children's dosage units comparable to the 80-mg and 81-mg units discussed above are being proposed for carbaspirin calcium, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate in \u00a7 343.50(d) (4), (5), and (6) in this tentative final monograph. Reference (1) \"United States Pharmacopeia XIX,\" United States Pharmacopelal Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD, p. 39,1975. 59. Two comments objected to the Panel's recommendation that dosage schedules for children should be based on age, asserting that they should be based on weight instead. The comments argued that dosages based on age are inaccurate because any group of children of the same age will vary in size and weight, and that the dosage schedules of virtually all other drugs are based on weight rather than age. A comment also stated that the recommended children's dosages, with relatively slight differences between adjacent age groups, are unduly complex and unwarranted. The Panel, in reaching its recommendation on a children's dosage schedule, considered extensive data andinformation on pediatric dosage regimens, including toxicity potential, dosage calculation based on weight versus body surface area, and adequacy of product labeling (42 FR 35366). The agency agrees with the Panel that a children's dosage schedule based on age is acceptable because it correlates closely with dosages calculated on the basis of surface area, and because the average consumer will more readily understand such a schedule, as people usually know the child's age but do not always know the child's weight. In addition, the agency has published, a notice of intent requesting. comments concerning pediatric dosing information for all OTC drug products. (See the Federal Register of June 20,1988; 53 FR 23180.) This notice invites public comment on how pediatric dosing information can best be presented in OTC drug product labeling. This notice mentions that comments made in response to several OTC cough-cold tentative final monographs requested that pediatric dosages for cough-cold drug products provide a greater subdivision of age ranges that more closely approximate weight-based dosages and that are similar to the age ranges recommended by the Internal Analgesic Panel for OTC internal analgesic-antipyretic drug products for children. The notice also discusses requests that the use of weight ranges be allowed, on an optional basis, in OTC drug pediatric labeling in addition to age range labeling (53 FR 23183). The agency has not proposed any regulatory changes in this notice, but will consider all aspects for pediatric dosing information, including the use of weight ranges, for all OTC drug products in a future Federal Register publication. 60. One comment suggested that children aged 2 to 3 years be excluded from the children's dosage schedule for OTC aspirin drug products because they cannot communicate symptoms of disease, and these symptoms are often difficult for parents to recognize. The comment suggested that the directions for children aged 2 to 3 years should be\"as directed by a physician\" because illness can develop rapidly within this age group. The agency agrees with the Panel's recommendation that the minimum age for OTC use of analgesic-antipyretic drugs is 2 years. Aspirin is used in children 2 to 3 years of age primarily to reduce fever and relieve the aches and pains that often accompany it- symptoms that children can communicate to parents or that parents can readily recognize. Based upon pharmacokinetic considerations and clinical data, the Panel recommended asafe and effective dosage schedule that could be followed by parents in treating children over 2 years of age. The agency concurs with this dosage schedule. However, the agency emphasizes that if the fever persists, the underlying cause of the fever should be determined and treated by a physician. The warnings in \u00a7 343.50(c) (2)(i) and (3) for analgesic- antipyretic drug products, limiting use for fever in children to 3 days unless directed by a doctor and advising physician consultation for persistent or worsening fever or new symptoms, are guides to parents in the safe and effective use of these products in children, as are the directions for use in \u00a7 343.50(d). 61. One comment suggested that the children's dosage schedule be more clearly displayed and that duplicate words and phrases be eliminated. Another comment stated that the dosage schedule recommended by the Panel is confusing and complex because dosage regimens are provided for ingredients as analgesics and as antipyretics, with doses listed in exact figures (such as 7.38 gr and 59.68 gr) rather than rounded figures. The children's dosage schedule is intended to indicate clearly to drug manufacturers the specific dose of particular ingredients for specific age groups. However, these dosage schedules are not intended to appear on the label in the format they appear in the monograph. Rather, the label directions should use dosage form units (tablets, capsules, measure of liquid) and should specify, based on the monograph, the quantity of drug in each children's dosage unit and the dosage intervals. In addition, information contained in the monograph labeling directions may be condensed on the label to provide concise dosage instructions for the consumer. Duplicated words and phrases may be eliminated. The children's dosage schedules for 80-mg, 81-mg, and 325-mg dosage units have been converted to directions that provide concise instructions for the consumer. (See \u00a7 343.50(d)(1).) 62. One comment requested that the agency allow a dosage schedule of 15 gr (975 mg) aspirin every 4 hours up to four doses (4 g) per day. The comment provided data to support its view that such a dosage regimen does not present a serious threat of toxicity (Ref. 1). The comment also maintained that this dosage schedule, rather than a 6-hour schedule, would offer consumers the convenience of undisrupted sleep. A reply comment stated that the dosage schedule recommended by the46235 46236 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules Panel should be followed and that no deviations from this schedule should be allowed. The reply comment expressed concern that the 975-mg dose of aspirin might be used beyond the daily maximum of four doses and present a toxicity problem. The agency disagrees with the comment's request for an aspirin dosage regimen of 15 gr (975 mg) aspirin every 4 hours, not to exceed four doses per day. The agency concurs with the Panel's statement that this dosage regimen would not provide any significant improvement in analgesic or antipyretic effectiveness (42 FR 35361). Furthermore, although the total daily dosage of this regimen does not exceed the maximum aspirin daily dosage of 4 g (60 gr), the agency is concerned that a four-hour dosage interval for a 975 mg dose may result in consumers ignoring the daily maximum limit of four doses with continued use possibly leading to salicylate toxicity. (See also comment 63 below.) Reference (1) Comment No. C00060, Docket No. 77N- 0094, Dockets Management Branch. 63. Two comments objected to the Panel's recommendation that following an initial dose of 1,000 mg acetaminophen (two dosage units of 500 mg each), subsequent doses should be restricted to 500 mg every 3 hours or 1,000 mg every 6 hours. Stating that this recommendation was based upon the dosage recommended for aspirin, the comments contended that, given the linear pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen, it is irrational to base acetaminophen's dosage and frequency of administration on the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of aspirin. One comment urged that the dosage for acetaminophen be 1,000 mg every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 4 g in 24 hours. The agency is not adopting the comment's recommendation of an acetaminophen dosage regimen of 1,000 mg every 4 hours for the same reason it is not adopting the regimen of 975 mg aspirin every 4 hours. (See comment 62 above.) The agency believes at this time that it is reasonable for acetaminophen and aspirin to have the same dosage and frequency of administration because, based upon the data submitted to the Panel, the safe and effective OTC dosage ranges for acetaminophen and aspirin are the same-325 mg to 650 mg every 4 hours, not to exceed 4 g in 24 hours. Also, aspirin and acetaminophen are indicated for the same OTC uses, have been extensively promoted as comparable OTC analgesics (withdifferent side effects), and are widely and interchangeably used by consumers. The agency concurs with the Panel's recommended acetaminophen dosage regimens of 500 mg every 3 hours and 1;ooo mg every 6 hours because these dosages are in accord with the safe and effective dosage range for acetaminophen, i.e., 325 mg to 650 mg every four hours (not to exceed 4 g in 24 hours). Based on computer simulations (Ref. 1), pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the literature (Refs. 2 through 5), and bioavailability data comparing a 650-mg dose with a 1,000- mg dose of acetaminophen (Ref. 6), the agency has determined that a 1,000-mg dose of acetaminophen every 6 hours yields a pharmacokinetic profile equivalent to that of a 650-mg dose of acetaminophen every 4 hours. A 500-mg dose of acetaminophen every 3 hours yields a blood level profile that also is similar to that of a 650-mg dose of acetaminophen every 4 hours. Therefore, the agency is proposing alternative dosage regimens for acetaminophen of 500 mg every 3 hours and 1,000 mg every 6 hours as part of the dosage schedule in \u00a7 343.50(d)(2) of the tentative final monograph. As discussed in comment 53 above, the agency is proposing the following dosages for acetaminophen, aspirin, and sodium salicylate: 325 to 650 mg every 4 hours, 325 to 500 mg every 3 hours, or 650 to 1,000 mg every 6 hours.

One comment requested that the Panel's recommended monograph berevised to state that 377 mg magnesium salicylate is equivalent to 325 mg sodium salicylate rather than the 325-mg quantity of magnesium salicylate specified by the Panel (42 FR 35420). The comment explained that commercial sodium salicylate is substantially anhydrous (Refs. 1 and 2), but that magnesium salicylate is commercially available as the tetrahydrate, which contains the equivalent of about 74.5 percent salicylic acid. Assuming that the salicylic acid content is the active moiety of analgesic salicylates and because sodium salicylate contains 86.3 percent salicylic acid, the comment calculated that about 1.16 times more magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate, or 377 mg (325 mg x 1.16], is needed to be equivalent to 325 mg sodium salicylate. The comment also pointed out that the Panel's recommended monograph does not state the molecular composition of magnesium salicylate and requested that it be clarified to state that 377 mg magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate is equivalent to 325 mg sodium salicylate. The comment concluded that, as stated in the Panels monograph, one could assume that the difference in the salicylic acid content between 325-mg doses of magnesium salicylate and sodium salicylate could affect the therapeutic response, especially in a multidose regimen. The agency agrees that 377 mg magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate is equivalent to 325 mg sodium salicylate. The Panel's recommendation of 325 to 650 mg magnesium salicylate every 4 hours for analgesic effect was based on data submitted on a product containing 325 mg of the tetrahydrate form of magnesium salicylate (Ref. 3). However, for adult dosage schedules for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate, the Panel recommended a minimum effective dosage of 325 mg for each of these ingredients (42 FR 35358), with which the agency concurs. Based upon a minimum effective dosage of 325 mg sodium salicylate, the minimum effective dosage of magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate that would contain an equivalent amount of salicylic acid is 377 rag. Therefore, the maximum dosage for magnesium salicylate should be 754 mg instead of 650 mg, and the dosages for magnesium salicylate are being revised accordingly in this tentative final monograph, which now also specifies that the dosages are based on the tetrahydrate form of magnesium salicylate (\u00a7 343.50[d)(6)).

One comment objected to the Panel's recommendation in \u00a7 343.20 for combining 325 mg each of aspirin and acetaminophen in a single dosage unit for OTC use. The comment contended that because of the complex pharmacokinetics of aspirin, any combination of aspirin and acetaminophen should be subject to the requirements of a new drug application (NDA). Referring to a study by Cotty et al. (Ref. 1), the comment'stated that using acetaminophen and aspirin together results in higher blood levels of aspirin than when the same quantity of aspirin is administered alone. Other comments supported the recommended provision for combining aspirin and acetaminophen. These comments stated that such a combination should not be precluded and may be useful by sparing the side effects of each ingredient. One comment also referred to the srudy by Cotty et al. (Ref. 1) and argued that concomitant use of aspirin and acetaminophen resulted in higher blood levels of unhydrolyzed aspirin, and not total salicylate, and that except for \"very specific side effects\" this should not be associated with an increase in overall toxicity. The study by Cotty et al. (Ref. 1) indicates that acetaminophen administered with aspirin appeared to increase blood concentrations of unhydrolyzed aspirin. These investigators expected no increase in toxicity because the toxicities of salicylic acid and aspirin are similar. They concluded that the increase in aspirin blood concentration and duration would be expected \"to produce a net increase in pharmacologic activity over the sum of the activities of the individual drugs administered alone\" because aspirin is a more potent analgesicthan salicylic acid. However, this conclusion is not supported by the results of a study by Wallenstein (Ref. 2). This study demonstrated that a subtherapeutic combination of 210 mg aspirin and 150 mg acetaminophen (a 360-mg total) was essentially equivalent in analgesic effect to 360 mg of either ingredient alone and that 420 mg aspirin combined with 300 mg acetaminophen was essentially equivalent in analgesiceffect to 720 mg of either ingredient alone. After evaluating the studies discussed above, the agency concludes that the combination containing 325 mg each of aspirin and acetaminophen does not increase the overall toxicity of either ingredient in adults. (For a discussion of the use of OTC internal analgesic- antipyretic combination drug products in children, see comment 66 below.) The data provided do not support the comment's contention that because of the \"complex pharmacokinetics of aspirin,\" combinations of aspirin and acetaminophen should be subject to the requirements of an NDA. Therefore the Panel's provision for a combination containing a 325-mg minimal effective dose each of aspirin and acetaminophen is being proposed in this monograph. However, unlike the Panel's recommendation in \u00a7 343.20(a) (1) and (2), the tentative final monograph does not require that 325 mg of each ingredient be contained in a single dosage unit. (See comment 72 below.)

(2) Wallenstein, S.L., \"Analgesic Studies of, Aspirin in Cancer Patients,\" Proceedings of the Aspirin Symposium, The Aspirin Foundation, London, pp. 5-10, 1975. 66. Two comments urged that dosage schedules for children under 12 years of age be provided in \u00a7 343.20 (b) and (c) for the permitted OTC internal analgesic combination drug products recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.20(a). The comments asserted that the Panel's recommendations unnecessarily restrict product use by specifying only adult dosages for analgesic or antipyretic combinations and that this position contradicts other sections of the recommended monograph in which children's dosages are specified by age groups for single ingredient products, e.g., \u00a7 343.10(a) (1)(i) and (2]. The agency is concerned about the risks' that may be associated with the use of analgesic-antipyretic combinations in children. For example, Bickers and Roberts observed a case of intoxication in a 51/-year-old child after a combined regimen of 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg acetaminophen, alternating every 2 hours for fever (Ref. 1). (Each drug was given individually every 4 hours.) The authors pointed out that, although many of the findings in the patient were characteristic of \"simple\"'poisoning with either drug alone, this particular case presented difficulties in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategy. Although this patient's medication history involved more than the combined regimen of aspirin and acetaminophen, the agency shares the authors' concerns about intoxication from a combined regimen of aspirin and acetaminophen in children and notes their contention that the basis for prescribing such a regimen is wholly inadequate. In addition, the only combinations provided for in this tentative final monograph contain acetaminophen with aspirin or other salicylates. Because the agency is not aware of any data supporting the safe use of such analgesic combinations in children or any such combinations marketed for children, combinations of analgesic-antipyretic ingredients in \u00a7 343.20(a) are not being proposed for use by children under 12 years of age in the tentative final monograph. Internal analgesic combinations containing nonanalgesic ingredients in \u00a7 343.20(b) in this tentative final monograph and the pediatric (or children's) dosages of such products will have to comply with the children's analgesic dosages included in the final monograph for OTC internal analgesic drug products. (See comment 67 below for further discussion of combination drug products containing analgesic and cough/cold ingredients.) Reference (1) Bickers, R.G., and Intoxication,\" journal of Pediatrics, 94:1001- 1003, 1979. 67. One comment objected to the Panel's recommendation that combination products be labeled to reflect all of the approved pharmacological activities of the active ingredients (42 FR 35370]. The comment maintained that such labeling on a combination product containing active ingredients intended to relieve different symptoms, such as those of the common cold, would be confusing and misleading to consumers because they might think the product should be used only when all the symptoms are present. The comment stated that a combination product containing an analgesic- antipyretic ingredient should not be avoided because a single symptom of only pain or fever is present rather than both symptoms. The comment recommended that the phrase in \u00a7 343.20(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4) that states \".* * the product is labeled for the concurrent symptoms involved, * * \"46237 46238 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules be replaced by the following statement: \"The product must be labeled to reflect all of the proven pharmacological activities of the active ingredient(s) consistent with the recommended use of the product.\" The agency agrees that a combination product containing an analgesic- antipyretic ingredient should not be avoided just because an individual has a single symptom of pain or fever, rather than both symptoms. As discussed in comment 16 above, the indications statement for analgesic-antipyretic ingredients in \u00a7 343.50(a)(1) is being revised to allow manufacturers flexibility in stating the uses for these ingredients. The agency recognizes that combination products may be intended for use by a specific target population, such as consumers who are suffering from the common cold with minor pain or fever. The agency believes that the labeling for such combinations should reflect the principal intended use(s) of the product (e.g., pain reliever-fever reducer and nasal decongestant). Such labeling should be consistent with the approved indications for the active ingredients, but would not be required to contain all of the indications. The agency believes that labeling specific to analgesic/cough-cold combinations need only appear in one monograph, which should be the one most pertinent to the intended target population of the combination product. Therefore, the agency has determined that the labeling for analgesic/cough- cold combination products should be included in the combinations segment of the cough-cold tentative final monograph, which was published in the Federal Register of August 12,1988 (53 FR 30522). Accordingly, the Panel's specific recommendations in \u00a7 343.20(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of its monograph are not being addressed in this tentative final monograph. However, the agency has included a statement in the combinations section (\u00a7 343.60(b)) of this tentative final monograph stating basically what the comment requested, i.e., that the labeling of the product states the indications for each ingredient in the combination, as established in the indications section of the applicable OTC drug monographs. Further, the agency has stated in \u00a7 343.60(b)(3) that for analgesic-antipyretic/cough-cold combinations, the indications stated in the cough-cold monograph should be used. 68. One comment objected to the word\"essential\" in the following statement in the Panel's report (42 FR 35370):\".* * that marketed products containonly those ingredients essential to the product.\" The comment argued that the word \"essential\" is too restrictive for OTC drug products. The comment maintained that some consumers might consider inactive ingredients nonessential, but other consumers consider these ingredients, such as a color or a flavor, essential to their acceptance of the product and their compliance with the directions for use. The comment recommended that excipients that contribute to patient acceptance of a product be permitted, along with those excipients necessary to prepare the final dosage form and provide stability and availability. The phrase regarding essential ingredients was actually part of a recommendation by the Cough-Cold Panel, with which the Internal Analgesic Panel concurred (43 FR 35370). The Internal Analgesic Panel stated that it was aware of the inclusion of inactive ingredients in marketed drug products as \"fillers, coatings, colorants, vehicles, aromatics, binders, sweeteners, flavoring agents, etc.\" and that \"Such inactive ingredients are acceptable for marketing purposes provided they are pharmacologically inert and do not adversely affect the bioavailability of the active ingredients * (.\" (See 43 FR 35370.) The OTC drug review is an active, not an inactive, ingredient review. The OTC panels occasionally made recommendations with respect to inactive ingredients; however, these recommendations were made for public awareness and comment and were not intended to be included in the OTC drug monographs. Although not included in OTC drug monographs, inactive ingredients must meet the requirements of \u00a7 330.1(e) that they be ingredients that are safe and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the product or with tests to be performed on the product. 69. One comment stated that \u00a7 \u00a7 343.10(a)(2) and 343.12(a)(2) of the Panel's \u00a7 341.20(e) of the Panel's recommended monograph. The comment requested that \u00a7 341.20(e) be revised to allow children's dosages for combination products containing phenylpropanolamine, a nasal decongestant, and analgesic-antipyretic active ingredients. The comment suggested a revision in the phenylpropanolamine dosage to be consistent with the children's dosage of analgesic-antipyretic active ingredients. This comment was submitted to both the OTC internal analgesic and the OTC cough-cold rulemakings. Adjustment of the dosage of phenylpropanolamine willbe addressed in a future issue of the Federal Register in an amendment to the nasal decongestant portion of the cough- cold tentative final monograph. The comment was also addressed in the cough-cold combination drug products tentative final monograph (see comment 60 at 53 FR 30550). 70. Citing sections 201(p). 502(f), and act (21 U.S.C. 321(p), 352(f), and 355(b)), one comment contended that the safety and effectiveness of a combination drug product as a whole should be the criteria by which it is judged, rather than the safety and effectiveness of its individual active ingredients. The comment stated that clinical testing of ihe contribution of each ingredient in a combination drug product would cause unnecessary expense for the manufacturer of the product. The comment suggested an alternative combination policy that would allow any number of ingredients to be included in a combination drug product in any quantity up to their maximum OTC dosage level as single ingredients, provided that the ingredients would not add a significant risk of harm from use or neutralize the effectiveness of other ingredients in the product. Based upon this suggestion, the comment requested Category I status for a combination drug product containing aspirin, acetaminophen, salicylamide, and caffeine, noting that the Panel classified as Category III both salicylamide and caffeine as analgesic adjuvants (42 FR 35483 and 35486). The OTC drug review regulation for OTC combination drug products in \u00a7 330.10(a)(4)(iv) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(4](iy)), which implements provisions of the act, states that: An OTC drug may combine two or more safe and effective active ingredients and may be generally recognized as safe and effective when each active ingredient makes a contribution to the claimed effect(s); when combining of the active ingredients does not decrease the safety or effectiveness of any of the individual active ingredients; and when the combination, when used under adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use, provides rational concurrent therapy for a significant proportion of the target population. The requirements for OTC combination drug products have been further delineated in the agency's \"General Guidelines for OTC Drug Combination Products\" (Ref. 1). Item 4 under these guidelines states: An ingredient claimed to be a pharmacological adjuvant (i.e., to enhance or otherwise alter the effect of another active ingredient) will be considered an active ingredient. Such an ingredient may be included in addition to one or more principal Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules active ingredients only if it meets the combination policy in all respects. Item 5 under the OTC combination drug product guidelines states: In some cases an Ingredient maybe appropriate for use only in a specific combination ordata may be available ordy to support the use of the ingredient in combination but not as a single Ingredient. In such cases the ingredient will be placed in Category I for use only in permissible combinations and not as a single ingredient. Both salicy~lamide and caffeine are being classified as Category III ingredients in this tentative final monograph (see comments 91 and 93 below). However, if data were submitted to show that either or both of these ingredients contributed to the claimed effect of the combination, the ingredient(s) could be included in the combination in accordance with the guidelines. Reference (1) Food and Drug Administration. \"General Guidelines for OTC Drug Combination Products,\" September17 Docket No. 78D-W2Z Dockets Management Branch. 71. One comment argued that although the Panel placed aspirin, acetaminophen, and 'several other analgesics in Category I, none of the combinations that are commonly used for headache has been classified as Category L The comment urged that such combinations be kept on the OTC market because they have been commonly used and have met individual needs where single-ingredient products did not. Ihe comment did uot name any specific products.) Because the comment did not name any specific combination drug products or provide data on them, the agency is unable to consider the comment's arguments at this time. As previously mentioned, the regulations for OTC combination drug products have been supplemented by \"General Guidelines for OTC Drug Combination Products\" (see comment 70 above). The status of OTC analgesic combinations will be determined according to the regulations and these supplementary 'guidelines. 72. Several comments disagreed with the Panel's recommendations in \u00a7\u00a7 343.20 (a), (b), and (c) that would permit combinations of two Category I internal analgesic-antipyretic ingredients only at the dosage limits specified and in a single large dosage unit. One comment contended that each analgesic ingredient in a combination should be permitted in lower than effective doses when such a combination can achieve a therapeutic effect similar to the higher quantity of asingle ingredient. Other comments objected to combining the ingredients into a single large dosage unit. These comments requested that pharmaceutical manufacturers be allowed to divide the dosage between two smaller dosage units, with labeling directing consumers to take two dosage units per dose. The comments contended that one large dosage unit would be difficult to swallow and may lead to overdosage by consumers who are used to taking two tablets per dose. The comments also argued that such a requirement would burden pharmaceutical manufacturers and consumers with Increased costs associated with retooling machinery used to make the larger dosage unit, redesigning packaging, etc. The Panel recommended that only combinations containing the minimal effective adult dose of each analgesic- antipyTretic ingredient be permitted. In the absence of data demonstrating that amounts less than the minimum effective dose contribute to effectiveness, the agency concurs with this recommendation as it applies to dosage level. However, the agency does not believe it is necessary to place specific restrictions on the amounts of active ingredients to be contained in a single dosage unit, provided the product's recommended dosage meets monograph conditions. The agency agrees with the comment that pharmaceutical manufacturers should be allowed to divide the dose of a combination product into more than one dosage unit with compensating directions for use. For example, the dosage for a tablet containing 162.5 mg of aspirin and 162.5 mg of acetaminophen would be two tablets per dose, thus meeting 'the-minimum effective dosage requirements for each ingredient. Thus, the Panel's recommendation for a single dosage unit to contain the minimal effective dosage of each analgesic ingredient in \u00a7 343.20(a) is not being included in the tentative final monograph. In addition, the agency has expanded the allowable combinations recommended by the Panel by proposing in \u00a7 343.20(a) to permit a range of acceptable amounts of active ingredients beyond the minimum effective dose to be.contained in combination products. Based on the quantities of active ingredients in the products, the dosage schedules for analgesic-anipyretic combinations must comply with the .dosages provided in \u00a7 343.60(d)(1) (i) or (ii) under the directions for use. (See also comment 65 above.)With regard to the combinations of analgesic-antipyretic ingredients, the Panel based its recommendations on the review of single Category I ingredients as well as on data submitted on combination products. After the Panel's report was published in July 1977, the agency published \"General Guideline for for OTC Drug Combination Products\" (Ref. 1). The guidelines include a description of the criteria for the combination of Category I active ingredients from the same therapeutic category having the same or different mechanisms of action. The agency believes that the Panel's recommendations for Category I classification of.combining acetaminophen with aspirin or other Category I salicylates is in accordance with Item 2 of the OTC combination drug product guidelines, which states: Category I active ingredients from the same therapeutic category that have different mechanisms of action may be combined to treat the same symptoms or condition if the combination meets the OTC combination policy In all respects and the combination is on a benefit.risk basis, equal to or better than each of the active ingredients used alone at its therapeutic dose. Such -combinations may utilize each active ingredient in full therapeutic dosage or sub-therapeutic dosage, as appropriate. Therefore, the agency proposes to include combinations of acetaminophen with aspirin or other Category I salicylates in this monograph under \u00a7 343.20(a). With regard to the Panel's recommendations of combining aspirin and other Category I salicylates with each other, the agency Finds no data referred to in' the Panel's report to support such combinations and further finds that such combinations are not in accordance with the guidelines as described in Item 3, which states: Category I active ingredient from the same therapeutic category that have the same mechanism of action .should not ordinarily be combined unless there is some advantage over the single ingredients in terms of enhanced effectiveness, safely, patient acceptance, or quality of formulation. They may be combined in selected circumstances to treat the same symptoms or conditions if the combination meets the OTC combination policy in all respect, the combination offers some advantage over the active Ingredients used alone, and the combination is. on the benefit-risk basis, equal to or better than each of the active ingredients used alone at this therapeutic dose. In addition, foUowing publication of the Panel's report the agency has received no data or information on such combinations, nor is aware of any such OTC drug products on the market.46239 46240 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules Therefore, the agency is proposing not to include analgesic-antipyretic combinations that contain only salicylates in this monograph. The agency invites comment on this position. Reference (1) Food and Drug Administration, \"General Guidelines for OTC Drug Combination Products,\" September 1978, Docket No. 78D-0322, Dockets Management Branch. 73. One comment noted that the Panel's recommendation in \u00a7 343.20 does not provide for combinations of analgesic-antipyretic ingredients with both nasal decongestants and antihistamines, although provision was made for combination drug products containing an analgesic-antipyretic ingredient with either a nasal decongestant or an antihistamine. The comment asserted that information regarding a combination drug product containing analgesic-antipyretic ingredients, a nasal decongestant, and an antihistamine was submitted to the Panel and that such a product is consistent with the Category I combination drug products allowed in \u00a7 341.40(c) of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking on OTC cough- cold drug products. The comment requested that such a combination be incorporated into \u00a7 343.20 of the recommended OTC internal analgesic monograph. The agency has determined that the categorization of combinations containing antihistamine and nasal decongestant ingredients properly falls within the scope of the OTC cough-cold drug product rulemaking. As mentioned in comment 67 above, the agency addressed combination drug products containing antihistamine, nasal decongestant, and analgesic-antipyretic active ingredients in the tentative final monograph for cough-cold combination drug products. (See comment 47 at 53 FR 30540.) 74. One comment opposed the 3-hour to 6-hour dosage interval recommended by the Panel for acetaminophen in \u00a7 343.10(b)(3) because it is incompatible with the 4-hour dosage interval for nasal decongestants and precludes the manufacture of a combination drug product containing acetaminophen and a nasal decongestant. The comment also argued that a 3-hour or a 6-hour dosage interval would be \"foreign\" to the habits of consumers, physicians, and pharmacists and would undesirably affect patient compliance. The tentative final monograph on OTC internal analgesic drug products contains dosage schedules of acetaminophen based on 4-hour as wellas 3-hour and B-hour intervals. Thus, dosage schedules for this ingredient that are compatible with those specified for Category I oral nasal decongestants can be achieved. The agency does not believe that a dosage interval of every 6 hours would be foreign to the habits of consumers or would have an undesirable effect on patient compliance because many drugs are taken at 6hour intervals. G. Comments on Definitions. 75. One comment proposed that the following definition be included in \u00a7 343.3: \"Powdered aspirin analgesic. A powdered form of aspirin packaged in individual unit doses.\" The agency notes that the definitions recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.3 are general in nature and applicable to all dosage forms; and thus there would have been no reason for the Panel to include a definition of powdered aspirin. The agency sees no need to include this definition, and, in order to conform with format and style of recently published monographs, the definition section is being revised in the tentative final monograph to contain only one definition: analgesic-antipyretic drug. 76. One comment requested that the definition of highly buffered aspirin for solution in recommended \u00a7 343.3(k) be amended from \" * * contains at least 20 mEq of acid neutralizing capacity per 325 mg of aspirin and results in a pH of 3.5 or greater at the level of the initial 10 minute period as measured by the method established in \u00a7 331.25 of this chapter * * *.\" to * * provides at least 15 mEq of acid neutralizing capacity as measured by the method established in \u00a7 331.26 of this chapter * * *.\" The comment also requested that recommended \u00a7 343.20(d)(6), which refers to the combination of aspirin with an antacid, be revised accordingly. The comment presented data to show that a currently marketed highly buffered aspirin for solution product has less than 20 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity per 325 mg aspirin and cited a submission to the Panel showing that the acid-neutralizing capacity of this product is 16.5 mEq when tested by the method in \u00a7 331.26 (Ref. 1).. After reviewing the submission to the Panel and testing the marketed product mentioned by the comment, the agency agrees that the product has less than 20 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity per 325 mg aspirin. The agency points out that an average of 5 mEq is the minimal acid-neutralizing capacity required for an antacid to combine with the residual gastric acid and to maintain an elevated pH for 15 minutes in a normal subject.(See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking on OTC antacid drug products published in the Federal Register of April 5, 1973 (38 FR 8717)) Thus, a finished product must have an acid-neutralizing capacity of at least 5 mEq (0 331.10) (21 CFR 331.10] to be labeled as an antacid. Highly buffered aspirin for solution exceeds this requirement. However, this is only one example of currently marketed drug products that contain aspirin with antacid ingredients (identified in \u00a7 331.11) in sufficient concentration to provide at least 5 mEq of acid- neutralizing capacity, thereby providing antacid activity in addition to analgesic activity. The agency is not including the Panel's definition in \u00a7 343.3(k) because this information is contained in \u00a7 343.20(b)(3) of this tentative final monograph and is being revised to include all products containing aspirin with antacids that are generally recognized as safe and effective (i.e., those products providing at least 5 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity) instead of highly buffered aspirin for solution only: \"Aspirin identified in \u00a7 343.10(b)(1) may be cqmbined with any antacid ingredient identified in \u00a7 331.11 or any combination of antacids permitted in accordance with \u00a7 331.10(a) provided that the finished product meets the requirements of \u00a7 331.10, is marketed in a form intended for ingestion as a solution, and bears labeling indications in accordance with \u00a7 343.60(b)(4).\" Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register the agency is proposing to amend \u00a7 331.15 of the final monograph on OTC antacid drug products so that the combinations of antacids with nonantacid active ingredients listed therein will be consistent with the combinations being proposed in this tentative final monograph. (See also comment 47 above.) The comment gave no reason for excluding the antacid test in \u00a7 331.25. This test should precede the test to determine the acid-neutralizing capacity of a product as specified in \u00a7 331.26. Both tests are required under \u00a7 331.10 for antacid products and have been retained here for aspirin with antacid products. Reference (1) OTC Volume 030104. 77. One comment recommended deleting the pH requirement from the definition of buffered aspirin in \u00a7 343.3(j), i.e.,\"*. ** results in a pH of 3.5 or greater at the level of the initial 10-minute period as measured by the method established in 1 331.25 of this chapter * * *.\" The comment argued that the requirement is unnecessarily Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules restrictive because it isnot crucial to the definition. Anothercomment stated itis unclear whether the I9 mEq in the definition is meant lo be measured or calculated, and whether it refers to 1.9 mEq of antacid* ingredients per 325 mg aspirin or to 1.9 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity above what is needed to neutralize the aspirin. This comment also stated that the pH requirement is an antacid requirement and is inappropriate for a buffered aspirin product because bulfered aspirin products currently on the market theoretically do not contain sufficient antacid to raise thepH of 10 mL of 0.5 Normal hydrochloric acid to 3.5. The comment suggested a revised definition of buffered aspirin to replace the one recommended in J 343.3j) and gave details for a testing procedure to replace the one in the Panel's report at 42 FR 35488, which is thesame as the procedure specified in 1 331.26. The comment stated that the test it suggested would eliminate poorly formulated or unstable products that contain an ineffective or partIally reactive antacid. The agency is proposing only one definition in the tentative inal monograph: Analgesic-antipyretic drug. Therefore the comment s request will not be discussed in the context of the monograph definitions. However, \u00a7 343.10(b)(2) of this tentative final monograph contains the same information as the Paners definition and specifies for buffered aspirin that \".*.. the finished product contains at least 1.9 millequivalents of acid- neutralizing capacity per 325rmg aspirin * * *.\" Because the-finished product is to be tested, there must be sufficient antacid ingredients added to the product so that the finished product provides the specified aid-neutralizing capacity. As to whether the acid-neutralizing capacity should be measured or calculated, it is apparent the Panel intended the acid-neutralizing capacity to be measured, i.e., experimentally determined, because it specified a test for measuring acid-neutralizing capacity (42 FR 35487 and 35488). Because the method of manufacture or other factors may affect the acid-neutralizing capacity, the theoretical acid- neutralizing capacity of a buffered aspirin product may be different from the experimentally determined capacity. Therefore, the acid-neutnalizing capacity is to be experimentally determined (measured). The requirements for initial pH determination in J 331.25 were devised for antacids, and not all buffered aspirin products contain'sufficient quantities of antacid ingredients so that the finished product provides antacid activity. Consequently, buffered aspirin-productsshould not be .required to meet all of the standards of the antacid monograph. To determine the acid-neutralizing capacity of the product, however, the procedure established in \u00a7 331.26 must be followed. The agency points out that data submitted to the Panel show that a well-formulated buffered aspirin product provides 1.9 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity when measured by the method established in .331.28 lRefs. I and 23. After testing buffered aspirin products according to \u00a7 331.26 and the comment's method, the agency has determined that the products provide .1.9 mEq of acid- neutralizing capacity when measured by either method. However, the method in \u00a7 331.26 is more disriminating The agency concludes that the comments have not presented sufficient reasons for replacing the established procedure in \u00a7 331.26 with the suggested procedure. Accordingly, the agency will retain the procedure in \u00a7 331.26. Based upon the above discussion and Panel's recommended \u00a7 343.20[d)(7) (redesignated \u00a7 343.10[b)(2) monograph) is being revised as follows: \"Buffered aspirin. Aspirin identified in paragraph Jb)(1) of this section may be buffered with any antacid ingredient(s) identified in .331.11 provided that the finished product contains at least 1.9 millequivalents of acid-neutralizing capacity per3 25milligrams of aspirin in accordance with \u00a7 331.\" References (1) OTC Volume 030136. (2) OTC Volume,030137. H. Comments on Effects of Product FormuYations on Drug Absorption and Pharmacologic Effectiveness 78. One comment argued that OTC aspirin rectal suppositories should be classified as Category L The comment maintained that their longlhilstory of use and administration to hospital patients who are unable to use oral dosage forms of aspirin have shown that they are effective analgesic-antipyretic drug products and have produced no evidence of rectal irritation. The comment submitted no data in support of its argument. The Panel noted that the rate of absorption of aspirin from suppositories was slow compared with its absorption from the oral tablet form 142 FR 35377). The Panel noted that because suppositories may have different melting or dissolution rates, therapeutic levels -of the active ingredients contained in these dosage forms can be unpredictably high or low, ranging potentiallyfrom therapeutically ineffectual results to toxicity. Thus, the Panel placed OTC analgesic rectalsuppositories in Category III, concluding that additional bioavailabillty data and evidence concerning possible rectal irritation are needed for each suppository formulation. The agency specifically invites comment and submission of data on OTC analgesic rectal suppositories, particularly data on bloavallability and possible rectal irritation, in accordance with the discussion on testing guidelines in part 4I. paragraph A2. below and with the feedback procedures published in the Federal Register of September 29, 1981( 46 FR 477403. In the absence of such data at this time, the agency is proposing that OTC analgesic rectal suppositories remain in Category IlL 79. One comment stated that a certain timed-release aspirin product with an approved NDA dating from 1965 should not be includedin an OTC drug monograph, but should be maintained as a new drug subject to an approved NDA. The agency agrees with the comment. The particular product in question contains 650 mg aspirin in a timed- release dosage unit, a safe amount for a single dose. However, the recommended dose of the product is two tablets. followed by one to two tablets every 8 hours. A 2-tablet dose 1,300 rg) represents a quantity of active ingredient which, if released from the tablets at one time, is not generally recognized as safe for a single dose in OTC drug products. (The safe maximum single OTC doses for aspirin, as discussed in comment 53 above, are 650 mg every 4 hours or 1,000 mg every 6 hours.) The agency concludes that this timed- release aspirin product is a new drug under 1 200.31 (21 CFR 200.31), and will remain the subject of an approved NDA and not be included in the monograph. Each NDA must contain, among other information, bloavailability data showing that the total dose of the active ingredient is released at a safe rate- that is, not too quickly or too slowly. L Comments on Aspirin 80. One comment stated that the amount of aspirin in an OTC internal analgesic drug product should be listed both in grains and milligrams, with grains shown first and milligrams shown parenthetically. Although manufacturers may voluntarily list quantities of active ingredients in eithergrains or metric units or both, the agency believes that it would be useful for manufacturers to list ingredients in metric units. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (80 Stat. 1007) was enacted to increase voluntarily the use of the metric system of weights and46241 46242 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules measures in the United States. In support of this policy, the agency has developed a Compliance Policy Guide (Ref. 1) to establish general and specific guidance for the voluntary use of metric units of quantity on the labeling of FDA- - regulated commodities. This guide states that a declaration of quantity of contents in units of weight is expressed in terms of the kilogram, gram, milligram, or microgram. While historically the amount of aspirin in an OTC internal analgesic drug product was listed in apothecary units (grains), based on the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, the agency is encouraging use of milligram units. This approach is consistent with current labeling policy for FDA-regulated commodities. Reference (1) \"Metric Declaration of Quantity of Contents on Products Labels,\" reprint of Food and Drug Administration Compliance Policy Guide 7150.17, 1987. 81. One comment stated that the number of tablets in an aspirin product container should be shown on the label. The agency points out that the declaration of net quantity of contents of an OTC drug package is already provided for in \u00a7 201.62(a) (21 CFR 201.62(a)), which states that the .* ** quantity of drugs in tablet, capsule, * * or other unit form * * * shall be expressed in terms of numerical count * * *.\" Thus the number of tablets in an aspirin product container is required to be shown on the label. 82. Several comments stated that menstrual blood flow might be increased by the ingestion of aspirin products. One comment stated that many women use products containing aspirin to relieve pain from menstrual cramps and that warnings for these products should indicate that aspirin might increase menstrual blood flow. Another comment stated that aspirin, which appears to be the most commonly used analgesic for menstrual cramps, is not a cause of massive uterine bleeding. Based on available information, aspirin does not appear to affect normal menstrual blood flow, and there are no data demonstrating that a warning to that effect is necessary. The agency is aware that the Miscellaneous Internal Panel reviewed the use of aspirin for the relief of pain of menstrual cramps and concluded that it is safe for such use. (See the Federal Register of December 7, 1982; 47 FR 55076.) Neither that Panel nor the Internal Analgesic Panel was aware of any evidence that aspirin increases menstrual blood flow. The direct irritant effects of aspirin upon the gastric mucosa and its effectsupon platelet aggregation have been well described in the medical literature, and the possible adverse effects of aspirin upon postoperative bleeding have been well discussed in the literature. It is recognized that doses of aspirin greater than the recommended therapeutic doses may reduce plasma prothrombin by interfering with the role of vitamin K in the production of prothrombin and decreasing platelet aggregation, thus prolonging the coagulation process (42 FR 35384). However, these effects seem to be unrelated to those involved in normal menstrual blood flow. 83. One comment stated that there was no mention in the Panel's recommended monograph of the \"unique safety\" of the powder dosage form of aspirin compared with other dosage forms. The comment attributed the safety of aspirin powders to their physical form and packaging and presented data to show that there have been only a few accidental ingestions of aspirin powders compared with a large number of accidental ingestions of other forms of aspirin. The comment also pointed out that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) exempted aspirin powders from the safety packaging requirements of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. No attempt has been made in the tentative final monograph to compare the safety of dosage forms; such a comparison is not the intent of the OTC drug review. The comment's discussion is not related to the Panel's or the agency's conclusions on the absorption and pharmacologic effectiveness of aspirin powders and therefore provides no basis for revising the Panel's recommended monograph. .Comment on Acetominophen 84. One comment disagreed with the Panel's recommendation that the standards for child-resistant safety closures for aspirin products, as set forth in regulations (16 CFR 1700.15 (a), (b), and (c)) established according to the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, should apply to acetaminophen products as well. This comment requested an exemption for liquid dosage forms of acetaminophen containing less than 1 g of acetaminophen per fluid ounce (oz). Several comments agreed with the Panel and noted that the CPSC proposed in the Federal Register of February 3, 1978 (43 FR 4632) to require child-resistant packaging for acetaminophen preparations containing more than I g of acetaminophen in a single package, CPSC, and not FDA, regulates child- resistant packaging. CPSC issued a finalrule in the Federal Register of August 31, 1979 (44 FR 51211), requiring child- resistant packaging for acetaminophen- containing preparations in oral dosage form containing more than I g of acetaminophen in a single package. This requirement became effective on February 27, 1980 for acetaminophen products packaged after that date, with the following exceptions: Effervescent acetaminophen preparations and acetaminophen preparations in powder form. The comment requesting an exemption for liquid acetaminophen products with less than I g of acetaminophen per fluid oz submitted the same request to CPSC, which, in turn, addressed this issue in its final rule and denied the comment's request for exemption (44 FR 51213). FDA concurs with that decision. K Comment on Antipyrine 85. One comment submitted data to upgrade the Category III status of antipyrine to Category I and to eliminate the Panel's recommendation of a single 975-mg dose of antipyrine per 24-hour period. The data consisted of three -papers on the metabolism, including the half-life, of antipyrine in animals and humans and addressed the metabolism of antipyrine in blacks (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). The comment stated that \"these studies provide assurance that a total daily dosage schedule of 3,000 mg or even 4,000 mg of antipyrine would not result in excessively high blood levels, in spite of the acknowledged extended half-life of the drug.\" The agency has reviewed the data cited by the comment and concludes that the data are insufficient to justify Category I status for antipyrine. None of the studies provided any significant data to show that antipyrine is safe after repeated doses or to justify changing the Panel's recommendation of one single 975-mg dose per 24 hours. The agency agrees with the Panel that more data are needed on the safety of antipyrine and is proposing that this ingredient remain classified as Category III. Because of its long half-life, studies on antipyrine should address the amount of this drug that can be safely given within 24 hours and determine an appropriate dosage interval to prevent a toxic amount of the drug from accumulating in the body. In addition, in order to determine sensitivity to antipyrine, epidemiological studies should be conducted that consider pharmacogenetic factors and include several racial groups. The agency's detailed comments and evaluations on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 4). 46243 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules References (1) Fraser, H.S., et al., \"Factors Affecting Antipyrine Metabolism in West African Villagers,\" Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 20:369-370, 1976.

Watson Company, coded LET015 to C00102, Docket No. 77N-0094, Dockets Management Branch. L. Comment on Quinine 86. One comment stated that despite the side effects (such as ringing in the ears, headache, nausea, and visual disturbances] of quinine in large doses (e.g., 2 g per day), it is effective at much lower doses for nocturnal leg cramps and should remain available OTC for this use. In support of its position, the comment cited \"The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,\" edited by Goodman and Gilman (Ref. 1), which states that the dose of quinine for nocturnal leg cramps is 200 to 300 mg before retiring. The agency is aware of the nocturnal leg cramp dosage for quinine given in the reference cited by the comment. The use of quinine for nocturnal leg cramps has been addressed by the Miscellaneous Internal Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking entitled, \"Quinine for the Treatment of Nocturnal Leg Muscle Cramps for Over- the-Counter Human Use,\" published in the Federal Register of October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43562]. The agency concurred in the Panel's classification of quinine for this use in Category III in the tentative final monograph published in the Federal Register of November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46588). The agency also agrees with the Internal Analgesic Panel's conclusions that the risk of toxic effects of quinine on the skin (e.g., rashes) and on the gastrointestinal, nervous, and cardiovascular systems outweighs its benefit in relieving pain or fever. In fact, the reference cited by the comment describes the toxicity of quinine and does not include analgesic, antipyretic, or antirheumatic actions as therapeutic uses for this drug (Ref. 1). The agency concurs with the Panel, and is proposini in this tentative final monograph that quinine is Category II when labeled for any OTC antipyretic or internal analgesic use other than the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.Reference (i) \"The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,\" 5th Ed., edited by L.S. Goodman, and A. Gilman, MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York, pp. 1062-1065, 1975. M. Comments on Solsolate 87, One comment requested clarification of the status of salsalate, stating that in the table of active ingredients (42 FR 35350) this ingredient is classified as Category III for analgesic effectiveness, but is classified in the active ingredients section as a Category III analgesic for both safety and effectiveness (42 FR 35443]. The table of active ingredients should have shown Category III status of salsalate as an antirheumatic, antipyretic, and analgesic for both safety and effectiveness. The Panel's classification of salsalate as an analgesic is correct (42 FR 35443), but it should have also been shown as Category III for both safety and effectiveness as an antipyretic and an antirheumatic (42 FR 35452 and 35468). The Panel's position on the categorization of salsalate can be clarified by reviewing the minutes of the Panel's 28th meeting. These minutes state that \"the Panel concluded that salsalate should remain in Category III on the basis of insufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness.\" Furthermore, the Panel's discussion on the safety of salsalate on pages 35452 and 35468 consists of reference to the safety discussion on page 35443, in which the Panel concluded that there were insufficient data to determine salsalate's safety as an OTC analgesic. Because FDA has received no further data on salsalate to warrant a change if its Category III classification, the agency concurs with the Panel that salsalate is a Category III OTC analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic ingredient. 88. One comment objected to the Panel's recommendation that additional toxicology data, such as teratogenicity studies and effects on various organs, may be needed on salsalate. The comment pointed out that because salsalate is an ester of two molecules of salicylic acid, there is no reason to consider it other than \"pharmacologically equivalent to salicylic acid\" or to expect metabolites other than those found with sodium I salicylate. The comment further argued that, as a salicylate analgesic, salsalate should be considered a \"salt or similar variant\" of a Category I analgesic and that the crossover bioavailability studies for evaluating analgesic effectiveness (42 FR 35445) should beadequate to establish its effectiveness.Because of the acknowledged difference in absorption rates between salsalate and other salicylates, the comment suggested that a crossover bioavailability study should measure the rates of hydrolysis or dissociation of aspirin, sodium salicylate, and salsalate, and determine the peak plasma levels, the times of peak levels, the fractions of doses absorbed, and the half-life during the recommended dosage period of 10 days for an OTC analgesic. As the Panel pointed out, data on the pharmacokinetics of salsalate are conflicting and incomplete. The study proposed in the comment should be conducted using analytical procedures that differentiate between parent drug (intact salsalate), salicylic acid, and other metabolites that may be formed. If. the study shows that any amount of salsalate is absorbed intact and is present in the blood, then salsalate cannot be considered equivalent to salicylic acid, or a \"salt or similar variant\" of salicylic acid, and a general toxicological profile will be needed. 89. One comment from a manufacturer inquired whether pharmacokinetic data alone can be used to establish the effectiveness of a Category III antirheumatic active ingredient (salsalate). The firm proposed to use a method that differentiates and quantitates levels of salsalate and salicylic acid in serum. The proposed study would compare the pharmacokinetics of salicylate derived from aspirin with the pharmacokinetics .of salicylate derived from salsalate after administration of a single dose each of aspirin and salsalate. The Panel recommended that effectiveness data on salsalate be required according to its guidelines for antirheumatic drugs, which state that antirheumatic studies should be designed to test the anti-inflammatory activity of an ingredient separate from any other action the ingredient may have and that the studies should be double-blind crossover in design, with aspirin as the standard drug (42 FR 35468). The agency concludes that pharmacokinetic data alone are inadequate to establish the effectiveness status of salsalate as an antirheumatic agent and that controlled clinical studies are needed (Ref. 1).

Schaefer, Jr., Fisons Corporation, July 18, 1978, included in OTC Volume 03BTFM. 46244 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules N. Comment on General Discussion of Antirheumatic Agents g0. One comment stated that, although there is extensive literature on fibrositis, the Panel devoted only one paragraph to this subject in its report and cited no references relating to fibrositis. The comment stated that it appeared that the Panel had deliberately ignored this subject because it would drastically weaken its argument that all inflammatory arthritis is malignant rheumatoid arthritis. The comment pointed out that fibrositis is self-limited and treatable by self-medication, and that much of what is initially diagnosed as probable rheumatoid arthritis is later found to be fibrositis. The agency notes that the Panel did not suggest that all inflammatory conditions are malignant (progressively degenerating) rheumatoid arthritis. Many of the rheumatic conditions listed in the Panel's report are not malignant conditions. Fibrositis was not discussed in the report because the Panel chose to discuss in detail only the more commonly occurring rheumatic diseases. The agency believes that including a discussion of fibrositis would not have affected the Panel's conclusions on OTC arthritis labeling. Fibrositis is not amenable to self-diagnosis because the presenting symptoms are similar to those of the more -serious rheumatic diseases. An indication for fibrositis is being included in the professional labeling section of this tentative final monograph (\u00a7 343.80(a)). The agency's proposals on consumer labeling claims concerning arthritis are discussed in comments 17, 18, and 19 above. 0. Comments on Adjuvants and Corrective Agents 91. Several comments urged that caffeine as an OTC analgesic adjuvant be reclassified from Category III to Category I. The comments cited several studies to support their contention that caffeine is an effective analgesic adjuvant, and also to dispute the Panel's concern that in humans caffeine may interfere with the effectiveness of the antipyretic component in combination drug products containing caffeine and an antipyretic ingredient. After reviewing the studies cited by the comments, the agency agrees with the Panel that there are insufficient data to reclassify caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant from Category II to Category I or to show that it does nor interfere with the antipyretic activity of analgesic- antipyretic ingredients. Of the studies cited, three presented new data and information (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). In a study by Cass and Frederik (Ref. 1), theinvestigators concluded that it could not be determined whether the addition of caffeine was a positive or negative factor in assessing analgesic effect. The agency concurs with the authors and concludes that the study fails to demonstrate the contribution of caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant. Thomas et al. (Ref. 2) studied the metabolism of phenacetin and acetaminophen as single ingredients as well as when each ingredient was combined with aspirin, caffeine, and codeine. This study did not address the effectiveness of caffeine as an analgesic or antipyretic adjuvant and cannot be used as evidence of effectiveness. Wojcicki et al. (Ref. 3) reported on a double-blind, crossover trial that compared the clinical relief of headache and postoperative pain in patients using three analgesic preparations. The authors concluded that the analgesic effectiveness demonstrated by the preparation containing 500 mg acetaminophen and 50 mg caffeine\"suggests that this medication is superior to the preparations that did not contain caffeine. This study is not a true crossover study because only patients who felt that they needed additional analgesics crossed over to the second treatment. The agency proposes that, in order to establish Category I status for caffeine's effectiveness as an analgesic adjuvant, it must be demonstrated that caffeine makes a positive contribution to the effectiveness of the combination product as an analgesic. If the product also makes antipyretic claims, it must be shown that caffeine does not decrease its antipyretic effectiveness. The agency's detailed comments and evaluations on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) (Refs. 4 to 7).1 References (1) Cass, L.J., and W.S.

One comment requested that the agency permit the use of caffeine as an adjuvant at dosage levels up to 150 mg per single adult dose, or 75 mg per dosage unit, instead of the Panel's recommended 65 mg per single dose. The comment stated that the Panel's single dose of caffeine (65 mg) in combination with analgesics was inconsistent with the Panel's allowable maximum daily dose of 600 mg caffeine. The comment also pointed out that a 65- mg single dose of caffeine seems inconsistent with the dosage of 100 mg to 200 mg recommended by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Sedative, Tranquilizer, and Sleep-Aid Drug Products. The Sleep-Aid Panel recommended dosages for caffeine's use as a stimulant, not as an analgesic-antipyretic adjuvant. The Internal Analgesic Panel, however, reviewed caffeine both as an analgesic- antipyretic active ingredient and as an analgesic-antipyretic adjuvant. Caffeine used alone as an OTC analgesic- antipyretic active ingredient was classified by the Panel as Category II. As an analgesic-antipyretic adjuvant, it was classified by the Panel as Category IIl. The agency agrees with the comment that the Panel's report is inconsistent with respect to caffeine dosages. The agency has no objection to a dosage level of 150 mg per single adult dose, which is within the dosage range recommended for restoring alertness or wakefulness by the Sleep-Aid Panel and included by the agency in the final monograph for OTC stimulant drug products which was published in the Federal Register of February 29,1988 (53 FR 6100). However, because data are still needed to demonstrate effectiveness of caffeine as an adjuvant in combination with analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic ingredients, the agency proposes to Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules classify it as Category III for this use. (See comment 91 above.) Reference (1) OTC Volume 030049. 93. One comment disagreed with the Panel's recommendation that salicylamide be placed in Category III for safety and effectiveness as an OTC analgesic adjuvant. The comment argued that the harmful effects of salicylamide cited by the Panel occur only at doses of 1,000 mg or more and not at the lower doses (650 mg or less) used as an OTC analgesic adjuvant. The comment also stated that the Panel failed to consider 35 submitted references substantiating the safety of salicylamide and that nothing in the Panel's report presents reasons for suspecting that the addition of salicylamide would either detract from the effectiveness of the combination or present any safety risk. The agency agrees with the Panel that there is insufficient information to determine the safety and effectiveness of salicylamide as an adjuvant or as a single ingredient in internal analgesic drug products. The comment submitted no new data or information to alter this decision. The Panel did consider the 35 submitted references along with all the other data available on salicylamide in concluding that salicylamide was Category Ill for safety and effectiveness as an adjuvant and as a single- ingredient internal analgesic (Refs. 1 and 2). Deficiencies in the data on salicylamide available to the Panel are discussed in the Panel's report (42 FR 35439 and 35486). To justify the inclusion ofan adjuvant, such as salicylamide, in a combination drug product, the adjuvant must make a positive contribution to the safety and effectiveness of the combination. (See comment 70 above for further discussion of this subject.) Salicylamide in high doses (600 mg or more) has been shown to inhibit salicylate and acetaminophen metabolism by competing for the glucuronidation pathway (Refs. 2, 3, and 4). This inhibition of the metabolism may result in a prolonged therapeutic effect, which is why salicylamide is claimed to be an adjuvant. Whether salicylamide in low doses (less than 600 mg) in combination with salicylate salts or acetaminophen also delays the metabolism of these analgesics and, if so. to what degree, is not known. Therefore, more data are needed on the pharmacokinetics of salicylamide to establish the safety and effectiveness of this ingredient as an internal analgesic adjuvant in such a formulation.References (1) OTC Volume 030069.

Yamada, \"Drug Biotransformation Interactions in Man. Ill. Acetaminophen and Salicylamide,\" Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 60:215-221,1971. P. Comments on Antacid or Buffering Ingredients 94. One comment questioned which antacid or buffering agents may be used as corrective agents with aspirin. The comment noted that the Panel gave a specific list of ingredients of buffering systems (42 FR 35469), but that the Panel's recommendations in \u00a7 343.3 (j) and (k) state that antacid active ingredients identified in \u00a7 331.11 may be added to aspirin. The comment urged that any of the antacid active ingredients listed in \u00a7 331.11 be permitted in combination with aspirin and that these ingredients not be restricted to those listed at 42 FR 35469. The agency wishes to clarify that the list of ingredients in the Panel's report (42 FR 35469) was not meant to exclude other ingredients identified in \u00a7 331.11 of the antacid final monograph as ingredients of buffering systems for use with aspirin as antacids or correctives. As recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.20(d) (6) and (7) and \u00a7 343.3 (j) and (k) and proposed by the agency in the tentative final monograph, the antacid or buffering agents permitted in buffered aspirin or highly buffered aspirin drug products include all of the ingredients identified in \u00a7 331.11 of the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products (21 CFR 331.11). 95. Comments expressed opposing views on whether the agency should reconsider the use of highly buffered aspirin for solution products for the concurrent symptoms of headache and acid indigestion as part of the internal analgesic rulemaking, in view of the agency's final decision to allow such a combination in the final monograph for OTC antacid drug products. The antacid final monograph states in \u00a7 331.15(b), \"An antacid may contain any generally recognized as safe and effective analgesic ingredient(s), if it is indicated for use solely for the concurrent , symptoms involved, e.g., headache and acid indigestion, and is marketed in a form intended for ingestion as a solution.\" The agency stated in the preamble to the final rule for OTC antacid drug products (39 FR 19862) that the InternalAnalgesic Panel was reviewing OTC internal analgesics for their safety, effectiveness, and appropriate labeling, and that the analgesic component of an antacid-analgesic combination drug product would remain under consideration and would be the subject of a further review and determination by the agency according to the procedures specified in \u00a7 330.10. Because a panel may also find it necessary to review the safety, effectiveness, and rationality of combination drug products within which the individual ingredients are contained, it is possible that a particular drug combination may be reviewed by more than one panel. In such instances, the' agency subsequently considers each panel's recommendations in determining whether the combination is appropriate for the relief of specific concurrent symptoms, is subject to the labeling requirements of more than one monograph, or whether special labeling is needed for the combination. The data submitted to the Internal Analgesic Panel for its evaluation of the analgesic component of highly buffered aspirin for solution, an analgesic-antacid combination drug product, included the same information that had been submitted to the Antacid Panel. The agency concludes that it was appropriate for the Internal Analgesic Panel to reconsider some of the issues that the Antacid Panel had considered. Furthermore, it is appropriate for the agency to consider recommendations from both Panels, as well as the comments and reply comments received in response to the Internal Analgesic Panel's recommended monograph. 96. Two comments stated that because most consumers do not know that a popular OTC highly buffered aspirin for solution product contains aspirin, they are unaware of the potential risks in using this product. The comments provided no evidence to support the statement that \"most consumers\" are unaware of the presence of aspirin in the product to which they referred. Section 502(e) (1] of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(e)) requires that the labeling of all OTC drugs contain the established name of each active ingredient in the product. In addition, consumers are alerted to the potential side effects of aspirin-containing products by the label warnings proposed for such products in this tentative final monograph. Section 502(c) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(c)) also provides that information required to appear on the labeling be placed thereon prominently and with such conspicuousness as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary46245 46246 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules conditions of purchase and use. The requirements for labeling ingredient information are spelled out more fully in the regulations at 21 CFR 201.10. The agency believes that products labeled in accord with existing regulations and the requirements being established by this monograph for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products will not present consumers with the potential problem described by the comments. Q. Comment on Antihistamine- Analgesic Combinations 97. One comment argued that a currently marketed OTC drug product containing acetaminophen and phenyltoloxamine dihydrogen citrate is effective in treating tension headache and relieving musculoskeletal pain associated with anxiety and is more effective than acetaminophen alone in relieving pain. The comment mentioned studies by de Sola Pool (Ref. 1) and Gilbert (Ref. 2) that were submitted to the Panel. In response to the Panel's criticism of de Sola Pool's study, the comment submitted Drummond's reanalysis of this study (Ref. 3) and an independent analysis of Wallenstein (Ref. 4). The comment also submitted the results of a new study conducted by Scheiner (Ref. 5). The comment concluded that these studies show that phenyltoloxamine dihydrogen citrate in combination with acetaminophen should be classified as a Category I adjuvant. The agency has reviewed the new data submitted and concludes that the data remain insufficient to support the effectiveness of phenyltoloxamine dihydrogen citrate as an analgesic adjuvant. The statistical reanalyses of the de Sola Pool study performed by Drummond (Ref. 3) and Wallenstein (Ref. 41 conclude that acetaminophen with phenyltoloxamine dihydrogen citrate is more effective than acetaminophen alone for the relief of headache. However, the study did not use a standardized scoring system to rate symptoms and the symptom complex being treated was not clearly defined. Therefore, the study is not acceptable as proof of the effectiveness of the ingredient as an analgesic adjuvant. Gilbert's study (Ref. 2) did not show that the combination of acetaminophen and phenyltoloxamine dihydrogen citrate enhanced pain relief over acelaminophen alone. Drug differences were not detected until 48 hours after treatment started, an unacceptably long delay in a pain study. In addition, many pain states will spontaneously resolve over this period of time, and this effect may bias the study. There were anumber of technical problems with the study, e.g., the patient population was too heterogeneous, and only I of 19 measures used for rating drug effects was concerned with pain. The agency's detailed comments and evaluations on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) (Ref. 6). The agency did not review the new study by Scheiner (Ref. 5) because the investigator was disqualified by FDA. The accuracy and reliability of the data from this study would need to be validated before the agency could accept this study in support of claims for the effectiveness of phenyltoloxamine dihydrogen citrate as an analgesic adjuvant. Therefore, the agency proposes to classify phenyltoloxamine dihydrogen citrate as a Category III internal analgesic adjuvant in this tentative final monograph. Regarding labeling, the agency proposes to classify as Category II any claims that represent or suggest relief of or treatment for tension or anxiety, including \"for the treatment of tension headache.\" The agency proposes to classify such labeling claims as Category II because these claims imply the treatment of tension and anxiety rather than the amelioration of the pain that may be associated with such symptoms. In the final monograph for OTC daytime sedative drug products, the agency concluded that based on the available data any products labeled, represented, or promoted for indications such as \"calmative,\" \"soothes away the tension,\" and \"calming down\" are regarded as new drugs for which approved new drug applications would be required for marketing (44 FR 36380]. The Internal Analgesic Panel classified the term \"nervous tension headache\" in Category If (42 FR 35435). In its discussion of headache, the Panel identified the psychogenic headache as a major type of headache and stated that these \"muscle contraction\" or \"tension headaches\" may account for up to 90 percent of the chronic headaches seen by the physician. The Panel further recommended that the cause of chronic and recurrent headaches requires diagnosis by a physician. However, the Panel also stated that the occasional headache may be due to a variety of causes, including tension, and concluded that analgesics are safe and effective for the symptomatic relief of the occasional headache (42 FR 35352). The agency concurs with the Panel that chronic and recurrent headaches require diagnosis by a physician. However, the agency also believes that consumers are familiar with headachesperceived to be due to tension. Because the warnings proposed in \u00a7 343.50(c) (1) and (2) of this tentative final monograph will adequately warn consumers against self-use of analgesics for pain that continues to persist, the agency has no objection to the use of the phrase \"pain of tension headache\" as acceptable additional information for the labeling of analgesic-containing products provided that additional words are not used that imply any treatment for tension or anxiety. Because the agency believes that the proposed indication \"For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains associated with * * * 'headache '* * *.\" is sufficiently broad to encompass headache from a variety of causes, the agency is not proposing to include the phrase \"pain of tension headache\" in its proposed indication for OTC internal analgesic drug products. This information may be included elsewhere in the labeling provided the phrase is not intermixed with labeling established by the monograph. In addition, the Panel placed the claim \"for the relief of musculoskeletal pain associated with anxiety\" in Category II (42 FR 35486]. The agency agrees with the Panel's classification because it believes that the term \"musculoskeletal pain\" is not readily understood by consumers. Furthermore, the agency is not aware of any OTC analgesic product labeled with such an indication. Therefore, the agency does not propose to include the claim \"for the relief of musculoskeletal pain\" in the monograph.

Several comments objected to the Panel's recommended aspirin tablet dissolution-testing procedure (42 FR 35488]. One comment questioned the applicability of the procedure for any use other than quality control because of the variable results that can be obtained. A few comments criticized the methodology, such as the dissolution medium and the apparatus, and noted the disparity between the Panel's recommended dissolution-testing procedure and that of the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USPC). Other comments stated that the procedure did not provide for combination drug products containing aspirin. The Panel concluded that \"significant variation in dissolution rate and absorption rate between aspirin products demonstrates the need for a standard dissolution test which can be used to detect preparations which will be so slowly absorbed as to potentially increase local adverse effects on the gastric mucosa or decrease therapeutic effects due to'decreased bioavailability\" (42 FR 35374). Therefore, the Panel recommended its testing procedure to elicit public comments for the development of a dissolution standard for aspirin tablets that would assure that these drug products are properly formulated. Since the Panel's report was -published, the agency and the USPC have worked to develop a dissolution standard for aspirin tablets and capsules. Dissolution tests for aspirin capsules, aspirin tablets, and buffered aspirin tablets have become official in the U.S.P. (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). The agency is proposing to require this dissolution testing in new \u00a7 343.90. Dissolution tests have also become official in the U.S.P. for acetaminophen and aspirin tablets (Ref. 4) and for combination drug products containing aspirin, alumina, and magnesia (Ref. 5). The agency is also proposing to require this testing in new \u00a7 343.90. Dissolution tests for other OTC aspirin combination drug products have not yet been formulated, and FDA is deferring to the USPC to develop compendial dissolution standards for such combinations. As appropriate tests are developed, FDA intends to propose to require them as part of this monograph or related monographs. Until appropriate dissolution standards are in place, other OTC aspirin combination products areclassified as Category III. Interested persons are invited to submit data in support of appropriate dissolution tests for any such combination products for potential inclusion in the final monograph.

Noting that the Panel's recommended monograph contains no guidelines for studies needed to reclassify enteric-coated aspirin from Category III to Category I, one comment submitted proposed guidelines for studies to demonstrate the bioavailability of aspirin in an enteric- coated dosage form. The guidelines referred to an in vitro dissolution methodology for enteric-coated tablets, which the comment stated will be published in the U.S.P., and included a general proposal for designing a clinical protocol to test the bioavailability of enteric-coated aspirin. Two comments also submitted clinical protocols for bioavailability studies for enteric-coated aspirin products and requested that the protocols be approved by FDA for reclassifying enteric-coated aspirin from Category III to Category I. The agency is aware that in vitro dissolution methodology for enteric- coated aspirin tablets and capsules has now been included in the U.S.P. (Ref. 1). However, the \"enteric-coated\" designation has been deleted in the U.S.P., and the products are now referred to as \"Aspirin Delayed-Release Tablets\" and \"Aspirin Delayed-Release Capsules.\" FDA believes that the newly adopted U.S.P. test is an appropriate standard to support the reclassification of enteric-coated aspirin products from Category III to I. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include this dissolution test in the internal analgesic tentative final monograph in new \u00a7 343.90(c). The agency had previously responded to the comments' clinical protocols for bioavailability studies (Refs. 2 and 3).Copies of these responses are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). The need for bioavailability studies is superseded by the methodology recently included in the U.S.P. The agency proposes that any other enteric-coated analgesics, e.g., sodium salicylate, remain in Category Ill until adequate specifications are established for these products.

One comment, noting that the Panel recommended a dissolution test for plain as well as buffered aspirin tablets (42 FR 35488), expressed concern that there is no provision for a comparable test method for aspirin powder dosage forms. The agency points out that the statement to which the comment referred is in the Panel's discussion of tablet dosage forms (42 FR 35374), in which the Panel expressed concern about significant variations in dissolution rate and absorption rate in buffered and unbuffered aspirin tablets. This concern prompted the Panel to recommend a dissolution test for aspirin tablets (buffered and unbuffered). The Panel did not recommend a dissolution test for powders because it concluded that they are rapidly absorbed and often reach peak blood levels more rapidly than the tablet dosage form (42 FR 35376). As stated in comment 98 above, the agency is proposing to include in new \u00a7 343.90 of the internal analgesic tentative final monograph all of the dissolution tests for aspirin products 'that are in the U.S.P. There are no official dissolution tests for aspirin powders. Based on the Panel's discussion of powders and the fact that the agency is unaware of any.p.roblems of absorption with aspirin powders, the agency concludes that dissolution testing is not needed for either buffered or unbuffered aspirin powders. 101. One comment observed that the Panel's recommended buffered aspirin acid-neutralizing testing procedure (42 FR 35487] did not provide for the removal of aspirin. The comment stated that because aspirin interferes with the46247 46248 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules assay, it should be removed before determining the buffering capacity. The agency disagrees with the comment's suggestion that aspirin be removed from buffered aspirin drug products before testing their acid- neutralizing capacity. As stated in \u00a7 343.10(b)(2) of this tentative final monograph, the finished product must provide 1.9 mEq of acid-neutralizing capacity, which exceeds the amount needed to neutralize the aspirin. Therefore, no provision for the removal of aspirin is needed in the testing procedure. 102. One comment pointed out that measurement of the acid-neutralizing capacity of combination drug products containing buffered aspirin and other active ingredients may require modifications in the standard method used for testing buffered aspirin products in \u00a7 331.25. The comment did not provide any specific examples of needed modifications. However, the agency has revised \u00a7 331.29 to establish a mechanism for requesting specific modifications in the test procedure. This revision was published as a final rule in the Federal Register of August 31, 1982 (47 FR 38480) and states that any proposed modification and the data to support it should be submitted as a petition according to \u00a7 10.30. The revision further provides for a redelegation of authority to grant or deny such petitions in order to facilitate prompt action. S. Comments on Additional Ingredients for Monograph 103. One comment requested that the lysine salt of aspirin, which has been marketed in a number of countries for several years, be included in the tentative final monograph with an indication for the temporary relief from occasional minor aches, pains, and headaches. The comment provided information on the chemical and physical properties, toxicity, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and gastrointestinal tolerance of a lysine aspirin product. The comment stated that lysine aspirin is a readily soluble salt of aspirin that dissociates in water into lysine and acetylsalicylic acid, that the product is intended for solution in water prior to administration, and that acetylsalicylic acid is the active moiety that exists in the gastrointestinal tract and is absorbed. The agency has determined that the lysine salt of aspirin is a \"new drug\" as defined in section 201(p)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(2)) as follows:Any drug (except a new animal drug or an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug) the composition of which is such that such drug, as a result of investigations to determine its safety and effectiveness for use under such conditions, has become so recognized, but which has not, otherwise than in such investigations, been used to a material extent or for a material time under such conditions. FDA interprets the terms \"material extent\" and \"material time\" to mean availability in the United States marketplace. The agency is unaware that lysine aspirin has ever been marketed as a drug in the United States. The comment provided no evidence to show otherwise. Thus, the agency regards this ingredient to be a new drug, requiring an approved application prior to OTC marketing. 104. One comment submitted information on calcium salicylate and requested that it be included as an analgesic ingredient in the tentative final monograph. The Panel did not review calcium salicylate because no data were submitted on this ingredient. The comment provided information on the historical use, physical properties, and chemical preparation of calcium salicylate, but supplied no evidence that it has been marketed in the United States and provided no substantive data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of this ingredient as an OTC analgesic-antipyretic. FDA is not aware that calcium salicylate has ever been marketed as an OTC analgesic- antipyretic in the United States. Thus, calcium salicylate falls within the definition of a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the act, as discussed in comment 103 above, and requires an approved application prior to marketing as an OTC analgesic- antipyretic drug. The agency's detailed comments and evaluations on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 1). Reference (1) Letter from W.E. Gilbertson, FDA, to C. Schreur, Schreur Investments Inc., coded LETO26 Docket No. 77N-0694, Dockets Management Branch. 105. One comment to the Miscellaneous Internal Panel requested that potassium salicylate be included as a Category I ingredient for use in OTC menstrual drug products. The comment argued that potassium salicylate is a naturally occurring substance and is equivalent to sodium salicylate and salicylic acid in terms of salicylate activity. The comment did not include any data on this ingredient nor were anysubmitted to the Miscellaneous Internal Panel or to the Internal Analgesic Panel. The agency is aware that potassium salicylate has been marketed in the United States as an ingredient in OTC and prescription analgesic drug products (Refs. 1 through 6). Until data on potassium salicylate are submitted for review, however, the agency has an insufficient basis to consider further the request to include this ingredient in an OTC drug monograph. Based on its marketing history, potassium salicylate is classified as Category III in this tentative final monograph.

The following table is included as a summary of the categorization of analgesic-antipyretic adjuvant ingredients. Analgesic-antiyretic Panel Agency adjuvants Aminobenzoic acid II III tll Sodium para-aminobenzoate.. II II The tables above do not address antirheumatic use, which appears only in professional labeling. The tables also do not address dosage forms, such as timed-release products, rectal suppositories, and enterio-coated aspirin. These dosage forms are discussed in comments,78, 79, and 99 above. 2. Testing of Category II and Category III conditions. The Panel recommended testing guidelines for analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products (42.FR.35444, 35453, 35468, and 35487). The agency is offering these guidelines as the Panel's recommendations .without adopting them or making any formal.comment on them unless.otherwise notedin this document. (See comments 85, 88,'89,'91, 93, 97, 98, and 101 above.)Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submission of data 'and information to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of any internal analgesic, an tipyretic, or antirheumatic ingredient or condition included in the review by following the procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the Federal Register of September 29,1981 (46 FR 47740 and clarified April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). This policy statement includes procedures for the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings with industry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submitted test data and other information. B. Summary of the Agency's Changes in the Panel's Recommendations FDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and concluaes that it will tentatively adopt the Panel's report and recommended monograph with the changes described in FDA's responses to the comments above and with other changes described in the summary below. A summary of the changes made by the agency follows. 1. The Panel recommended as a statement of indications for OTC analgesic drug products: \"For the temporary relief of occasional minor aches, pains and~headache,\" and as a statement of indications for OTC antipyretic drug products: \"For the reduction of fever.\" The agency is expanding and combining these statements to allow the inclusion of representative types of pain and causes of fever that are amenable to OTC treatment. (See comments 15, 16, and 17 above.) Accordingly, the statements in \u00a7 \u00a7 343.50(a) (2) and (3) are being deleted, and the labeling statement recommended in \u00a7 343.50(a)(1) is being changed to the following statement in this tentative final monograph (\u00a7 3.43.50(b)(1)): \"For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains\" [which may be followed by'one or more of the (select and menstrual cramps\" -(which may be for the minor pain from arthritis\"), and (\"and to reduce fever.\")] The agency is also proposing'toinclude \"flu\" as an indication for analgesic-antipyretic products containing acetaminophen. In .addition, the agencyis proposing that an OTC analgesic-antipyretic drug productmay be The agency is proposing combined analgesic-antipyretic labeling for analgesic-antipyretic drug products labeled only for use in children, e.g., children's acetaminophen. Based upon representative types of pain and causes of fever that are amenable to OTC treatment in children over 2 years of age, the indications statement for OTC children's analgesic-antipyretic drug products is being proposed as follows (\u00a7 343.50(b)(2)): \"For the temporary relief of minor aches and pains\" [which may be followed by: (\"associated with\" to reduce fever.\")] The agency is also proposing to include \"flu\" as an indication in the labeling of products that contain acetaminophen. (See comments 15 and 10 above.) 3. The agency is proposing in \u00a7 \u00a7 343.50 (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(ii) of this tentative final monograph that internal analgesic drug products labeled for the relief of sore throat pain bear a modified version of the warning statement currently recommended in 21 CFR 369.20 for \"throat preparations for temporary relief of minor sore throat: Lozenges, troches, washes, gargles, etc.\" (See comment 15 above.] In the tentative final monograph for OTC oral health care-drug products, the agency has proposed to remove the existing recommended warning statement in \u00a7 369.20 as well as the suggested warning for OTC drugs for minor sore throats in \u00a7 201.315. (See 53 FR 2456.) 4. The warnings recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 \u00a7 343.50(c)(1) (i) and (ii) are being revised and proposed as three warnings as follows in \u00a7 343.50(c): (1) For products labeled for adults-(i) For products containing any ingredient in \u00a7,343.10. \"Do not take this product for pain for more than 10 days or for fever for more than 3 days unless directed by a doctor. If pain or fever persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present, consult a doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition.\" (2) For productslabeled for children 2 years to under 12 years of oge-:(i) For products-containing any ingredient in \u00a7 343.10 \"Do not give this product for pain for more than5 days or faiiever for more than 3.daysunless-diredtedby a doctor. If pain or fever'persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or'if redness or swelling is present, consult a46249 46250 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 1 Proposed Rules doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition.\" (3) For products labeled both for adults and for children 2 years to under 12 years of age. * * * \"Do not take this product for pain for more than 10 days (for adults) or 5 days (for children), and do not take for fever for more than 3 days unless directed by a doctor. If pain or fever persists or gets worse, if new symptoms occur, or if redness or swelling is present, consult a doctor because these could be signs of a serious condition. Do not give this product to children for the pain of arthritis unless directed by a doctor.\" These warnings are being revised for clarity, to distinguish between products used by adults and/or children, and to alert consumers to appropriate time limitations on self-treatment with OTC analgesic-antipyretic drug products as well as to symptoms that require professional treatment. (See comments 13, 14, 18, and 30 above.) 5. Because the agency is combining the indications for pain and fever into a single statement and because dosage schedules are the same for analgesic and antipyretic ingredients, the agency is proposing a single dosage schedule in \u00a7 343.50(d) for each analgesic- antipyretic ingredient. (See comments 16 and 53 above.) Section \u00a7 343.10 is being revised to list all active ingredients, and \u00a7 \u00a7 343.12 and 343.14 are being deleted. 6. The agency is proposing deletion of the warning recommended in \u00a7 343.50(c)(5)(ii) because consumers might interpret it to mean that acetaminophen can be used to treat arthritis. The agency is also proposing deletion of the warning recommended for aspirin in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(i) because the agency is concerned that different labeling statements on acetaminophen and aspirin products concerning arthritis might encourage consumers to self- diagnose and self-treat arthritis. (See comment 19 above.) 7. The agency is proposing the following in \u00a7 343.50(b)(4](i) to provide for children's labeling: Forproducts labeled only for children 2 to under 12 years of age containing any ingredient identified in \u00a7 343.10. (A) The labeling of the product contains, on the principal display panel, either of the following: (1) \"Children's (trade name of product or generic name of ingredient(s).\" (2) \"(Trade name of product or generic name of ingredient(s)) for Children.\" (B) The labeling for adults in \u00a7 343.50(d) and the statement \"Children 2 to under 12 years of age\" in \u00a7 343.50(d)(3)(ii) are not required. (See comment 30 above.) 8. The following are agency-initiated changes in the Panel's recommended,monograph based on the format and style of recently published monographs: (a) The signal word \"warning\" has been used routinely in all labeling in OTC drug monographs instead of the signal word \"caution.\" Accordingly, the word \"caution\" is not being included in \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(v) (B) and (C) in this proposed monograph. (See comment 32 above.) (b) The definition section contains only one definition: analgesic- antipyretic drug. Other definitions appearing in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking are not considered necessary for this tentative final monograph. (c) The agency is redesignating proposed Subpart D of the monograph as Subpart C, placing the labeling sections under Subpart C. (d) In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency proposed in a number of tentative final monographs to substitute the word \"doctor\" for \"physician\" in OTC drug monographs on the basis that the word \"doctor\" is more commonly used and better understood by consumers. Based on comments received to these proposals, the agency has determined that final monographs and other applicable OTC drug regulations will give manufacturers the option of using either the word\"physician\" or the word \"doctor.\" This tentative final monograph proposes that option. 9. The agency is proposing to delete the first sentence of the aspirin hypersensitivity warning recommended aspirin.\" (See comment 33 above.) This sentence is unnecessary because section 502(e)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(e)(1)) requires all drug products to bear on the label the established name of the active ingredient or ingredients contained in the product. 10. The agency is proposing that the warning recommended in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(v) (redesignated \u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(v)(C)) be identified as a drug interaction precaution (see comment 36 above) as follows: \"Drug Interaction Precaution. Do not take this product if you are taking a prescription drug for anticoagulation (thinning the blood), diabetes, gout, or arthritis unless directed by a doctor.\" This precaution is being modified in \u00a7 343.50(c)[2){v)[C) for products labeled for children 2 years to under 12 years of age. For products labeled both for adults and children, the precaution for adults will apply. (See \u00a7 343.50(c)(3).) 11. The agency is revising the warning recommended 343.50(c}(3)(ii)(redesignated \u00a7 343.50(c) (1)(v)(A) and (2)(v)(A)) to read: \"If ringing in the ears or a loss of hearing occurs, consult a doctor before taking any more of this product.\" The agency believes this wording more clearly conveys the appropriate course of action to the consumer. (See comment 39 above.) 12. The statements recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iii) (a) and (b) are being moved to \u00a7 343.50(d)(3) (i) and (ii) in the tentative final monograph because they are directions for use, not warnings. (See comment 41 above.) 13. The agency is proposing deletion of the term \"stomach distress\" from \u00a7 343.50(c)(3)(iv) (redesignated the warning as follows: \"Do not take this product if you have stomach problems (such as heartburn, upset stomach, or stomach pain) that persist or recur, or if you have ulcers or bleeding problems, unless directed by a doctor.\" This warning is being further revised in \u00a7 343.50(c)(2)(vi)(B) for products labeled for children 2 years to under 12 years of age. For products labeled for both adults and children, the warning for adults will apply. (See \u00a7 343.50(c)(3). See also comment 31 above.) 14. The Panel classified the claims\"acts five times faster than aspirin\" and\"reaches peak action twelve times faster than aspirin\" in Category II for choline salicylate. However, the agency finds a reasonable basis to classify such claims in Category II. (See comment 45 above.) This classification is consistent with the Panel's treatment of similar claims for buffered aspirin, i.e., the data are not sufficient to support such claims as \"faster to the bloodstream than plain aspirin.\" 15. The agency finds that labeling claims such as \"extra-strength,\" \"extra pain relief,\" \"maximum strength,\" and\"arthritis strength\" are outside the scope of the OTC drug review. (See comment 48 above.) 16. The Panel recommended a children's dosage unit of 80 mg for aspirin and acetaminophen. The agency is proposing that the children's dosage unit for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate be 80 ng or 81 mng because both strengths are marketed, and the difference between these strengths is of no therapeutic consequence. In addition, a minimal effective dose for children over 9 years of age (i.e., 320 mg for the 80-mg dosage unit, 324 mg for the 81-mg dosage unit, or 325 mg for the 325-mg dosage unit) is being added to the children's dosage schedule. (See comment 58 above.) 17. Quantities of active ingredients are expressedin the tentative final I'odopa R oat, I Vol ..Nln. 22?1 I We~dnedav. November 16. 1988 I Proposed Rules461 monograph in metric units only. Manufacturers may voluntarily list quantities of active ingredients in both apothecary and metric units. (See comment 80 above.) 18. The agency is not adopting the analgesic equivalence value labeling statements recommended by the Panel in I 343.50(e) because they do not appear to serve their intended purpose and could be confusing to consumers. (See comment 56 above.) 19. The statements on dosage units recommended in \u00a7 343.50(d) are also being deleted in this tentative final monograph. The agency believes that the terms \"standard\" and\"nonstandard\" would not serve their intended purpose of simplifying comparisons among various products and may confuse consumers. (See comment 53 above.) -20. The dosage schedules for aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate recommended by the Panel in \u00a7 343.10 (a), (b), and (f) are being revised to eliminate the concepts of \"standard\" and \"nonstandard\" schedules and are being combined under \u00a7 343.50(d)(2). (See comment 53 above.) In accordance with the agency's changes discussed in this paragraph and in paragraph number 18 above, the Panel's recommended definitions in \u00a7 343.3 (c), (in), and (p) are not being included in this tentative final monograph. 21. The agency concurs with the Panel's recommendation on dosages of aspirin, acetaminophen, and sodium salicylate for adults and has incorporated this information in the directions section of the tentative final monograph (\u00a7 343.50(d)), except that the agency is not including in the tentative final monograph a maximum initial dose of 975 mg for these ingredients when given in a 4-hour dosage regimen. (See comments 53 and 63 above.) 22. The Panel recommended a dosage of 325 to 650 mg magnesium salicylate every 4 hours, based upon data submitted on a product containing 325 mg of the tetrahydrate form of magnesium salicylate. This is the same as the dosage range established for sodium salicylate. However, the agency has determined that 377 mg magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate, and not 325 mg, is equivalent to 325 mg sodium salicylate. Given a minimum effective dosage of 325 mg sodium salicylate, the dosage of magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate that would contain an equivalent amount of salicylic acid is 377 mg. Therefore, the agency concludes that the minimum effective dosage of magnesium salicylate should be 377 mg, and the maximum dosage for this ingredient should be 754 mg. Thedosages for magnesium salicylate are being revised accordingly, and this tentative final monograph specifies in \u00a7 343.50(d)(6) that the dosages are based on the tetrahydrate form of magnesium salicylate. (See comment 64 above.) 23. The agency is not including analgesic-antipyretic combinations that containonly salicylates in this monograph because such combinations are not in accordance with general OTC combination drug product guidelines. (See comment 72 above.) However, the agency has expanded the allowable combinations recommended by the Panel by providing a range of acceptable amounts of active ingredients that may be contained in a combination product. The agency discussed combination products containing analgesic and cough-cold ingredients in \u00a7 341.40 of the cough-cold combinations tentative final monograph 30522). Accordingly, the Panel's recommendations in \u00a7 343.20(d) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of its monograph are not being addressed in this tentative final monograph, and appropriate cross-references to Part 341 are being included. (See comment 67 above.) 24. Based on the recommendations of the Miscellaneous Internal Panel, the agency has expanded the combination section of the monograph to provide for allowable combinations of analgesic ingredients or combinations of analgesic ingredients with a diuretic when the product is labeled for \"menstrual\" claims. (See the tentative final monograph for OTC menstrual drug products published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.) 25. The agency notes that the Panel concluded that OTC acetaminophen products for children should be packaged in containers containing no more than 36 tablets (42 FR 35415). This recommendation was based on an existing regulation recommending a 36- tablet limitation of 1 gr children's aspirin tablets in \u00a7 201.314(c)(2) (21 CFR 201.314(c)(2)) and not on data pertaining to the toxicity of acetaminophen in children. No comments were submitted in response to the Panel's recommendation. The agency has evaluated currently marketed pediatric acetaminophen products (Ref. 1) and does not believe it necessary to include this packaging limitation in the tentative final monograph. The agency specifcally invites comments on the need for a regulation to limit the number of dosage units per container for pediatric dosage forms of acetaminophen in light of child proof closures and the degree of voluntary compliance in effect at this time among the manufacturers of these products. The agency also invitescomments on the need for a regulation requiring the 36-tablet limitation for pediatric aspirin products which is recommended in 21 CFR 201.314(c)(2).

The agency is changing the Panel's recommended single dose of 65 mg caffeine to 75 mg caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant, not to exceed a single adult dose of 150 mg or a maximum daily dose of 600 Mg. Caffeine remains in Category III as an analgesic adjuvant. However, industry has responded to FDA's concern and provided additional data which are currently under review by the agency. (See comment 92 above.) 27. The agency is proposing to include by reference the dissolution testing procedures for aspirin capsules, as contained in U.S.P. XXI at page 77, for aspirin tablets as contained in U.S.P. XXI Supplement 4 at page 2130, and for buffered aspirin tablets, as contained in U.S.P. XXI Supplement 4 at page 2131, as part of this tentative final monograph. (See comment 98 above.) Furthermore, the agency is also including by reference the dissolution standard for acetaminophen and aspirin tablets as contained in U.S.P. XXI at page 14, the dissolution standard for one aspirin combination product as contained in U.S.P. XXI Supplement 2 at pages 1812 and 1813, and the dissolution standard for enteric coated aspirin tablets (delayed-release tablets) as contained in U.S.P. XXI Supplement 3 at pages 1972 and 1973. (See comments 98 and 99 above.) 28. The agency is deleting the Panel's recommended definition for buffered aspirin in \u00a7 343.3(j) and is including the definition in the active ingredients section (\u00a7 343.10(b)(2)) of this tentative final monograph as a result of the establishment of a U.S.P. monograph for buffered aspirin tablets in U.S.P. XXI Supplement 4 at page 2131. The definition of buffered aspirin in \u00a7 343.10(b)(2) of this tentative final monograph is being proposed as follows: Buffered Aspirin \"Aspirin identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be buffered with any antacid ingredient(s) identified in \u00a7 331.11 provided that the finished product contains at least 1.9 milliequivalents of acid-neutralizing capacity per 325 milligrams in accordance with \u00a7 331.26.\" (See comments 42 and 77 above.] 29. The agency is deleting the Panel's recommended definition in \u00a7 343.3(k) because the same information isFederal go ister / Vol 1953 No 221 / Wednesday Nove ber 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules46251 46252 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules contained in \u00a7 343.20(d)(6) (see comment 76 above) which is being redesignated \u00a7 343.20(b)(3) in this tentative final monograph and is being revised to include all products containing aspirin with antacid as follows: \"Aspirin identified in \u00a7 343.10(b)(1) may be combined with any antacid ingredient identified in J 331.11 or any combination of antacids permitted in accordance with \u00a7 331.10(a) provided that the finished product meets the requirements of \u00a7 331.10, is marketed in a form intended for ingestion as a solution, and bears labeling indications in accordance with \u00a7 343.60(b)(4).\" In addition, the agency is proposing that such products be identified as follows: \"pain reliever/fever reducer\" (or the variation permitted in \u00a7 343.50(a)) and \"antacid.\" (See comments 42 and 76 above.) 30. The agency is proposing indications for products containing aspirin with antacid that are based upon the aspirin indications for pain and fever in \u00a7 343.50(b)(1) and the antacid indications in \u00a7 331.30(b). (See comment 47 above.) 31. The labeling for products containing acetaminophen with antacid (acetaminophen and antacid combinations), \u00a7 and redesignated \u00a7 343.20(b)(1) in this tentative final monograph, is being modified to include a statement of identity and the revised indications labeling in \u00a7 343.60. (See comment 47 above.) 32. The agency is including in \u00a7 343.80 proposed professional labeling on the use of aspirin, buffered aspirin, or aspirin in combination with an antacid in the prevention of myocardial infarction in patients with a previous infarction or unstable angina pectoris. The agency is also proposing to incorporate labeling on the use of aspirin and buffered aspirin without sodium for transient ischemic attacks. (See comments 49 and 50 above.) A number of other professional labeling indications also are being proposedin 1 343.80(a) of the tentative final monograph. The agency is aware that some manufacturers have included statements in the labeling of their internal analgesic-antipyretic drug products that advise consumers to see their doctor for other (or new) uses of aspirin (or name of product). Such information may be beneficial to consumers, and the -agency has no objection to a general statement of this type being included in the labeling of OTC internal analgesic-antipyretic drug products. The agency is also aware that information about these other uses ofthese products has appeared in newspapers and magazines and on television and radio. The agency is concerned that consumers may read or hear this information and self-medicate with an OTC drug product for one of these conditions without consulting with their doctor. Consumers should not self- medicate with an OTC analgesic- antipyretic drug product for any of these professional indications, and use for any of these conditions should be only under a doctor's supervision because serious side effects may occur. The agency believes that it is important that any information provided to consumers about other (professional) uses of these products be accompanied by a counterbalancing statement that the consumer should not use the product for more than 10 days (consistent with the allowable OTC labeling being proposed in this tentative final monograph) without consulting their doctor because serious adverse effects may occur, Examples include possible bleeding and stroke. Based upon these new uses of aspirin and recognizing the evolving nature of this issue, the agency is proposing the following optional statement in this tentative final monograph: \"See your doctor for other uses of [insert name of ingredient or trade name of product), but do not use for more than 10 days without consulting your doctor because serious side effects may occur.\" The agency believes that such information should be provided to consumers in the most effective manner and should be prominently displayed in labeling so that it may readily be seen and understood. At this time, the agency is proposing this as optional (allowable) labeling. The agency invites comment on this statement or other alternative labeling, appropriate placement in labeling, and whether the 10 day limitation on use should be an integral part of any such statement. The agency also invites comment on whether this information should be part of the required labeling for these products. 33. The agency is not adopting the liver warning in \u00a7 343.50(c)(5)(i), but is proposing that one of the following overdose warnings appear on all acetaminophen products to follow those general overdose warnings required in \u00a7 330.1(g) (21 CFR 330.1(g)): for products labeled for adults (\u00a7 343.50(c)(1)(iii)), \"Prompt medical attention is critical for adults as well as for children even if you do not notice any signs or symptoms\" or for products labeled for children (\u00a7 343150(c)(2)(iii)), \"Prompt medical attention is critical even if you do not notice any signs or symptoms.\" For products labeled for both adults andchildren, the warning for adults will apply, as described in \u00a7 343.50(c)(3). (See comment 25 above.) 34. The agency has reclassified methapyrilene fumarate from Category III to Category II as an OTC analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic adjuvant ingredient. A tentative final rule for nighttime sleep-aids, published in the Federal Register of June 13, 1978 (43 FR 25544), proposed to place methapyrilene in Category II because of preliminary studies implicating this drug as a carcinogen, or a carcinogen synergist with nitrates, in rats. However, at that time, the studies were too preliminary to support a definitive finding of carcinogenicity for methapyrilene that would necessitate its immediate removal from all products in the OTC drug market. On May 1, 1979, the agency received an interim report from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) regarding carcinogenicity studies performed with methapyrilene at the Frederick Cancer Research Center. The results of these studies have been published by Lijinsky, Reuber, and Blackwell (Ref. 1). The NCI interim report stated that methapyrilene is a potent carcinogen in rats and must be considered a potential carcinogen in man. FDA reviewed this report and concurred with its conclusions. In June 1979, the agency initiated a recall letter to all manufacturers holding an approved new drug application (NDA) for products containing methapyrilene. This voluntary recall has eliminated drug products containing methapyrilene from the marketplace. Products containing methapyrilene are now considered to be misbranded under section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 352) and\"new drugs\" under section 201(p) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)). The agency received no comments on methapyrilene fumarate, which was classified as Category III by the Panel as an analgesic adjuvant. Based on the studies discussed above, the agency has reclassified methapyrilene fumarate from Category III to Category II. Reference (1) Ujinsky, W., M.D. Reuber, and B.N. Blackwell, \"Liver Tumors Induced in Rats by Chronic Oral Administration of the Common 'Antihistamine Methapyrilene . Hydrochloride,\" Science, 209:817-819,1980. 35. The agency is expanding the Panel's recommended warning on salicylate allergy in \u00a7 343.50(c)(6) (redesignated t 343.50(c) (1)(v) and (2)(v)) to include aspirin in an effort to assure that consumers, most of whom are apt to be familiar with aspirin, will Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules understand that aspirin is also a salicylate and that the allergic reaction that they may associate with aspirin is a salicylate allergy and can be caused by any of the ingredients in this drug group. 36. The Panel was concerned with the effects of aspirin or carbaspirin calcium on increasing duration of labor, changing hemostatic mechanisms in the newborn and increasing maternal blood loss (42 FR 35404). The latter may be a hazard particularly in premature labor and thus at any time during the last 3 months of pregnancy. For these reasons, the Panel concluded that there is a potential hazard to the use of aspirin during pregnancy and recommended the following warning on all aspirin- containing products: \"Do not take this product during the last 3 months of pregnancy except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" The agency received no comments on this issue, but is expanding the Panel's labeling recommendation to inform consumers of the reason for the warning. In addition, in the Federal Register of December 3, 1982 (47 FR 54750), the agency published a final rule to amend the general drug labeling provisions in Part 201 by adding new \u00a7 201.63, which includes the following warning to pregnant and nursing women concerning the use of OTC drugs that are intended for systemic absorption: \"As with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby, seek the advice of a health professional before using this product.\" Because of this more recent general warning, the agency is proposing that the following revised warning follow the warning required in \u00a7 201.63(a): \"IMPORTANT: Do not take this product during the last 3 months of pregnancy unless directed by a doctor. Aspirin taken near time of delivery may cause bleeding problems in both mother and child.\" 37. After reviewing the conclusions stated in three Panel reports (Oral Cavity at 42 FR 22796, Internal Analgesic at 42 FR 35376, and Topical Analgesic, Antirheumatic, Otic, Burn, and Sunburn Prevention and Treatment at 44 FR 69845) concerning aspirin's ability to exert a topical effect as well as the available data, the agency concluded that there are not sufficient data available to permit final classification of aspirin as a topical analgesic/anesthetic in the tentative final monograph for OTC oral health care drug products, published in the Federal Register of January 27, 1988 (53 FR 2436). In that tentative final monograph, the agency deferred the systemic effectiveness of aspirin in a chewing gum dosage form for the relief of many kinds of pain including sorethroat to this rulemaking (53 FR 2442). Although the topical analgesic effect of aspirin is not being specifically addressed in this rulemaking, the agency tentatively accepts the conclusion of the majority of the Oral Cavity Panel and the Internal Analgesic Panel that aspirin in a chewing gum base is safe for the relief of sore throat pain when labeled with adequate directions and warnings against misuse. Although the Internal Analgesic Panel concluded that the topical effect of aspirin or any analgesic in a chewing gum dosage form has not been adequately tested for the treatment of sore throat pain, it found the marketing of an OTC analgesic in a chewing gum formulation acceptable for its systemic analgesic effect if the product provides the minimum effective dose (325 to 650 mg aspirin/dose) and is labeled according to the Panel's proposed monograph. The Panel also stated its concern about the possibility of oral mucosal damage and the effect of aspirin on blood clotting after oral surgery or tonsillectomy and recommended that the labeling of such product formulations include the warning, \"Do not take this product for at least 7 days after tonsillectomy or oral surgery except under the advice and supervision of a physician.\" The Panel further recommended that aspirin for a local topical effect be deferred to the Oral Cavity Panel for evaluation (42 FR 35376). The Oral Cavity Panel concluded that OTC anesthetic/analgesic ingredients are useful for the treatment of the symptoms of occasional minor sore throat and mouth but was divided in its conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of aspirin as an anesthetic/analgesic ingredient for topical use on the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat (47 FR 22769 and 22796). The majority of the Panel concluded that aspirin incorporated in a chewing gum base is safe and effective as an OTC anesthetic/analgesic ingredient for topical use on the mucuous membranes of the mouth and throat. However, the minority of the Panel concluded that there were insufficient data available to permit final classification of the safety and effectiveness of aspirin as an OTC anesthetic/analgesic ingredient. The minority of the Panel had reservations about the safety of topically applied aspirin used in the oral cavity and believed that aspirin has no known topical anesthetic or analgesic activity. It also believed that any analgesic effect from aspirin applied topically in the oral cavity is ultimately due to systemicabsorption and not to topical application. Both the majority and minority of the Panel concluded that aspirin should not be used following operative procedures of the mouth or throat. Because the agency is aware that aspirin increases bleeding time and inhibits platelet aggregation (42 FR 35384 and 47 FR aspirin-related hemorrhage after oral surgery and tonsillectomy is a well documented occurrence (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), the agency agrees with both the Internal Analgesic and Oral Cavity Panels that aspirin in a chewing gum form or chewable tablet form should not be used for at least 7 days after oral surgery or tonsillectomy (42 FR 35377 and 47 FR 22798 and 22801). The agency is therefore proposing the following warning for these dosage forms of aspirin: \"Do not take this product for at least 7 days after tonsillectomy or oral surgery unless directed by a doctor.\" References (1) Hersh, R.A., \"A Clinical Study Comparing the Incidence of Postoperative Bleeding in Patients Using Salicylate Containing Analgesics Versus Acetaminophen Analgesics,\" The Bulletin of the Ber8en County Dental Society, 40:6-8 and 16, 1974.

Section 201.314 (21 CFR 201.314) sets forth certain labeling requirements regarding warnings on OTC drug products containing salicylates and statements of policy on labeling such drugs. Several provisions of \u00a7201.314 may be superseded by the requirements established in several OTC drug final monographs (e.g., internal analgesic, external analgesic, and overindulgence in alcohol and food. When those monographs are finalized, the agency will revise the appropriate portions of \u00a7 201.314. In addition, the agency may incorporate some of the requirements of \u00a7 201.314 into the appropriate monographs. In addition, the agency is proposing to remove paragraph (a)(1) of \u00a7 310.201 and reserve paragraph (a)(1).for future use. The provisions of \u00a7 310.201(a)(1) will be superseded by the requirements of the internal analgesic final monograph. For the same reason, those portions of \u00a7 \u00a7 369.20 and 369.21 applicable to salicylates and acetaminophen are also proposed for removal.46253 ,46254 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking in conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the Federal Register of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts. The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12291. The apency therefore concludes that no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, is a major rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug review was not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L 96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemaking for.OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency invites public comment regarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with product testing, relabeling, repackaging, or reformulating. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. Because the agency has not previously invited specific comment on the economic impact of the OTC drug review on internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products, a period of 180 days from the date of publication of this proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register will be provided for comments on this subject to be developed and submitted. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.The agency has determined that under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) this action is of a type ,that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. Sections 343.50(c)(1)(viii)(A) and 343.50(c)(2)(viii)(A) of this proposed rule contain collection of information requirements. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA has submitted a copy of this proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or its review of these collection of information requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the collection of information requirements should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Shannah Koss. Interested persons may, on or before May 16, 1989, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. \"82, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, written comments, objections, or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. A request for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and time requested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted on or before May 16, 1989. Three copies of all comments, objections, and requests are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Comments, objections, and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced in the Federal Register. Interested persons, on or before November 10, 1989, may also submit in writing new data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditions not classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submitted on or before January 16, 1990. These dates are consistent with the time periods specified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural regulations for reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the Federal Register of September 29, 1981(46 FR 47730). Three copies of all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Data and comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305) (address above). Received data and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consider only data submitted prior to the closing of the administrative record on January 16, 1990. Data submitted after the closing of the administrative record will be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is published in the Federal Register unless the Commissioner finds good cause has been shown that warrants earlier consideration.

The labeling states, under the heading \"ASPIRIN FOR TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS,\" the following: \"Indication: For reducing the risk of recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA's) or stroke in men who have had transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli. There is inadequate evidence that aspirin or buffered aspirin is effective in reducing TIA's in women at the recommended dosage. There is Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules no evidence that aspirin or buffered aspirin is of benefit in the treatment of completed strokes in men or women. Clinical Trials: The indication is supported by the results of a Canadian study (1) in which 585 patients with threatened stroke were followed in a randomized clinical trial for an average of 26 months to determine whether aspirin or sulfinpyrazone, singly or in combination, was superior to placebo in preventing transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death. The study showed that, although sulfinpyrazone had no statistically significant effect, aspirin reduced the risk of continuing transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death by 19 percent and reduced the risk of stroke or death by 31 percent. Another aspirin study carried out in the United States with 178 patients, showed a statistically significant number of \"favorable outcomes,\" including reduced transient ischemic attacks, stroke, and death (2). Precautions: Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of TIA's should have a complete medical and neurologic evaluation. Consideration should be given to other disorders that resemble TIA's. Attention should be given to risk factors: it is important to evaluate and treat, if appropriate, other diseases associated with TIA's and stroke, such as hypertension and diabetes. Concurrent administration of absorbable antacids at therapeutic doses may increase the clearance of salicylates in some individuals. The concurrent administration of nonabsorbable antacids may alter the rate of absorption of aspirin, thereby resulting in a decreased acetylsalicylic acid/salicylate ratio in plasma. The clinical significance of these decreases in available aspirin is unknown. Aspirin at dosages of 1,000 milligrams per day has been associated with small increases in blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, and serum uric acid levels. It is recommended that patients placed on long-term aspirin treatment be seen at regular intervals to assess changes in these measurements. Adverse Reactions: At dosages of 1,000 milligrams or higher of aspirin per day, gastrointestinal side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea and/or vomiting, as well as increased rates of gross gastrointestinal bleeding.\" (Other applicable warnings related to the use of aspirin as described in \u00a7 343.50(c) may also be included here.) Dosage and Administration: Adult oral dosage for men is 1,300 milligrams a day, in divided doses of 650 milligrams twice a day or 325 milligrams four times a day.

The labeling states, under the heading \"ASPIRIN FOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.\" the following: \"Indication Aspirin is indicated to reduce the risk of death and/or non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients with a previous infarction or unstable angina pectoris. Clinical Trials The indication is supported by the results of six large, randomized multicenter, placebo- controlled studies involving 10,816, predominantly male, post-myocardial (MI) patients and one randomized placebo-controlled study of 1,260 men with unstable angina (1-7). Therapy with aspirin was begun at intervals after the onset of acute MI varying from less than 3 days to more than 5 years and continued for periods of from less than 1 year to 4 years. In the unstable angina study, treatment was started within I month after the onset of unstable angina and continued for 12 weeks, and patients with complicating conditions such as congestive heart failure were not included in the study. Aspirin therapy in MI patients was associated with about a 20-percent reduction in the risk of subsequent death and/or non- fatal reinfarction, a median absolute decrease of 3 percent from the 12- to 22- percent event rates in the placebo groups. In aspirin-treated unstable angina patients the reduction in risk was about 50 percent, a reduction in the event rate of 5 percent from the 10-percent rate in the placebo group over the 12-weeks of the study. Daily dosage of aspirin In the post- myocardial infarction studies was 300 milligrams in one study and 900 to 1,500 milligrams in 5 studies. A dose of 325 milligrams was used in the study of unstable angina. Adverse Reactions Castrointestinal Reactions Doses of 1,000 milligrams per day of aspirin caused gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding that in some cases were clinically significant. In the largest post-infarction study (the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS) with 4,500 people), the percentage incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms for the aspirin (1,000 milligrams of a standard, solid-tablet formulation) and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, were: stomach pain (14.5 percent; 4.4 percent); heartburn (11.9 percent; 4.8 percent); nausea and/or vomiting (7.6 percent; 2.1 percent); hospitalization for gastrointestinal disorder (4.8 percent; 3.5 percent). In the AMIS and other trials, aspirin-treated patients had increased rates of gross gastrointestinal bleeding. Symptoms and signs of gastrointestinal irritation were not significantly increased in subjects treated for unstable angina with buffered aspirin in solution.\" (Other applicable warnings related to the use of aspirin as described in \u00a7 343.50(c) may also be included here.)\"Cardiovascular and Biochemical In the AMIS trial, the dosage of 1,000 milligrams per day of aspirin was associated with small increases in systolic blood pressure (BP) (average 1.5 to 2.1 millimeters) and diastolic BP (0.5 to 0.6 millimeters), depending upon whether maximal or last available readings were used. Blood urea nitrogen and uric acid levels were also increased, but by less than 1.0 milligram percent. Subjects with marked hypertension or renal insufficiency had been excluded from the trial so that the clinical importance of these observations for such subjects or for any subjects treated over more prolonged periods is not known. It is recommended that patients placed on long-term aspirin treatment, even at doses of 300 milligrams per day, be seen at regular intervals to assess changes in these measurements. Sodium in Buffered Aspirin for Solution Formulations One tablet daily of buffered aspirin in solution adds 553 milligrams of sodium to that in the diet and may not be tolerated by patients with active sodium-retaining states such as congestive heart or renal failure. This amount of sodium adds about 30 percent to the 70- to 90-milliequivalents intake suggested as appropriate for dietary treatment of essential hypertension in the \"1984 Report of the Joint National Committee on Detection. Evaluation. and Treatment of High Blood Pressure\" (8). Dosage and Administration Although most of the studies used dosages exceeding 300 milligrams, 2 trials used only 300 milligrams and pharmacologic data indicate that this dose inhibits platelet function fully. Therefore, 300 milligrams or a conventional 325 milligram aspirin dose is a reasonable, routine dose that would minimize gastrointestinal adverse reactions. This use of aspirin applies to both solid, oral dosage forms (buffered and plain aspirin) and buffered aspirin in solution.

ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC), established under section 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), transmitted its Twenty-Thiird Report to the Administrator of EPA on November 1, 1988. This report, which revises and updates theCommittee's priority list of chemicals, adds six chemicals to the list for priority consideration by EPA in promulgation of test rules under section 4(a) of the Act. The Twenty-Third Report is included with this notice, The new chemicals are tris(2-chloroethyl)- phosphate (CAS No. 115-96-8), three tris(2-chloropropyl)-phosphate, (CAS 33125-86-9) and butyraldehyde (CAS No. 123-72-8). These chemicals are not designated for response within 12 months. Crotonaldehyde (CAS No. 4170-30-3), which was recommended with intent-to- designate by the ITC in its Twenty- Second Report (53 FR 18196; May 20, 1988), now is designated for response within 12 months. In response to ITC's designation, EPA will either initiate rulemaking under section 4(a) of TSCA. or publish a Federal Register notice explaining the reasons for not initiating such rulemaking within 12 months. EPA invites interested persons to submit written comments on the report, and to attend Focus Meetings to help narrow and focus the issues raised by the ITC's recommendations. Additionally, EPA is soliciting interest in public participation in the consent agreement process for tris(2- chloroethyl)-phosphate, three tris(2- chloropropyl)-phosphates, and tetrakis(2-chloroethyl)-ethylene diphosphate.

Stahl, Director, TSCA Assistance Office (TS-799}, Office of Toxic Substances, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 554-1404, TDD (202) 554--0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has received the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee's Report to the Administrator. I. Background TSCA (Pub. L. 94-469,90 Stat. 2003 et seq; 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) authorizes the Administrator of EPA to promulgate regulations under section 4(a) requiring testing of chemical substances and mixtures in order to develop data relevant to determining the risks that such chemical substances and mixtures may present to health and the environment. Section 4(e) of TSCA established an Interagency Testing Committee to make recommendations to the Administrator of EPA on chemical substances and mixtures to be given priority consideration in proposing test rules under section 4(a). Section 4(e) directs the ITC to revise its list of recommendations at least every 6 months as necessary. The ITC may \"designate\" up to 50 substances and mixtures at any one time for priority consideration by the Agency. .Crotonaldehyde is a designatedchemical. For such designations, the Agency must within 12 months either intitiate rulemaking or issue in the Federal Register its reasons for not doing so. The ITC's Twenty-Third Report was received by the Administrator on November 1,1988, and follows this Notice. The Report adds six substances to the TSCA section 4(e) priority list. IL Written and Oral Comments and Public Meetings EPA invites interested persons to submit detailed comments on the ITC's new recommendations. The Agency is interested in receiving information concerning additional or ongoing health and safety studies on the subject chemicals as well as information relating to the human and environmental exposure to these chemicals. A notice is published elsewhere in today's Federal Register adding the substances recommended in the ITC's Twenty-Third Report to the TSCA section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule (40 CFR Part 716), which requires the reporting of unpublished health and safety studies on the listed chemicals. These chemicals also will be added to the TSCA section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment Information Rule (40 CFR Part 712) published elsewhere in this issue. The section 8(a) rule requires the reporting of production volume, use, exposure, and release information on the listed chemicals. Focus Meetings will be held to discuss relevant issues pertaining to these chemicals and to narrow the range of issues/effects which will be the focus of the Agency's subsequent activities in responding to the ITC recommendations. The Focus Meetings will be held on December 13, 1988, as follows: 9:30 a.m. Tris(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate, three tris(chloroprophyl)-phosphates, and tetrakis(2-chloroethyl)-ethylene disphosphate 1:00 p.m. Butyraldehyde They will be held at EPA Headquarters, Rm. 103 NE Mall, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. These meetings are intended to supplement and expand upon written comments submitted in response to this notice. Persons wishing to attend these .meetings, or subsequent meetings on these chemicals, should call the TSCA Assistance Office at the telephone number listed above at least one week in advance. , This notice also serves to invite persons interested in participating in or monitoring negotiations for consent agreements for tris(2-chloroethyl)-4626246262 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices phosphate, three tris(chloropropyl)- phosphates, and tetrakis(2-chloroethyl)- ethylene diphosphate to notify EPA no later than December 16, 1988. The procedures for negotiations are described in 40 CFR 790.22. All written submissions should bear the identifying docket number (OPTS-41030). III. Status of List In addition to adding the six recommendations to the priority list, the ITC's Twenty-Third Report notes the removal of two chemicals from the list. Ethylbenzene has been removed from the list because the data gaps previously identified by the ITC have been satisfactorily resolved. Subsequent to ITC's preparation of its Twenty-Second Report, EPA responded to the ITC's recommendation for methyl ethyl ketoxime by publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register (53 FR 35838; September 15, 1988). The current list contains two designated substances, five chemicals recommended with intent-to-designate, and fourteen recommended substances. Authority: 15 U.S.C. 2603. Dated: November 4, 1988. Joseph J. Merenda, Director, Existing Chemical Assessment Division. - TWENTY-THIRD REPORT OF THE TSCA INTERAGENCY TESTING COMMITTEE TO THE ADMINISTRATOR, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Summary Section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA, Pub. L 94- 469) provides for the testing of chemicals in commerce that may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. It also provides for the establishment of a Committee (ITC), composed of representatives from eight designated Federal agencies, to recommend chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals) to which the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should give priority consideration for the promulgation of testing rules. Section 4(e)(1)(Al of TSCA directs the Committee to recommend to the EPA Administrator chemicals to which the Administrator should give priority consideration for the promulgation of testing rules pursuant to section 4(a). The Committee is required to designate thosa chemicals, from among its recommendations, to which the Administrator should respond within 12 months by either initiating a rulemaking proceeding under section 4(a) orpublishing the Administrator's reason for not initiating such a proceeding. At least every 6 months, the Committee makes those revisions in the TSCA section 4(e) Priority List that it determines to be necessary and transmits them to the EPA Administrator. As a result of its deliberations, the Committee is revising the TSCA section 4(e) Priority List by the addition of 6 chemicals. The Priority List is divided into three parts: Part A contains those recommended chemicals and groups designated for priority consideration and response by the EPA Administrator within 12 months. Part B contains chemicals and groups of chemicals recommended with intent-to-designate. This category was established by the Committee in its seventeenth report (50 FR 47603; November 19, 1985) to take advantage of rules promulgating automatic reporting requirements for non-designated ITC recommendations under the section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment rule and the TSCA section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting rule. Information received following recommendation with intent-to- designate may influence the Committee to either designate or not designate the chemicals or groups of chemicals in a subsequent report to the Administrator. Part C contains chemicals and groups of chemicals that have been recommended for priority consideration by EPA without being designated for response within 12 months. The changes to the Priority List are presented, together with the types of testing recommended, in the following Table 1: TABLE 1.-ADDITIONS TO THE SECTION 4(E) PRIORITY LIST [November 1988] Chemical/Group Recommended studies A. response whn12 CAS No. 4170- 30-3.

Chapter 1-Introduction 1.1 Background. The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (Committee) was established under section 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA, Pub. L. 94- 469). The specific mandate of the Committee is to recommend to the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chemical substances and mixtures in commerce that should be given priority consideration for the promulgation of testing rules to determine their potential hazard to human health and/or the environment. TSCA specifies that the Committee's recommendations shall be in the form of a Priority List, which is to be published in the Federal Register. The Committee is directed by section 4(e)(1)(A) of TSCA to designate those chemicals on the Priority List to which the EPA Administrator should respond within 12 months by either initiating a rulemaking proceeding under section 4(a) or publishing the Administrator's reason for not initiating such a proceeding. There is no statutory time limit for EPA response regarding chemicals that ITC has recommended but not designated for response within 12 months. At least every 6 months, the Committee makes those revisions in the section 4(e) Priority List that it determines to be necessary and transmits them to the EPA Administrator. The Committee is composed of representatives from eight statutory member agencies and seven liaison agencies. The specific representatives and their affiliations are named in the front of this report. The Committee's chemical review procedures and priority recommendations are described in previous reports (Refs. 1 through 7). 1.2 Committee's previous reports. Twenty-two previous reports to the EPA Administrator have been issued by the Committee and published in the Federal Register (Refs. 1 through 7). Ninety-six entries (seventy-six chemicals and twenty groups of chemicals) were recommended for priority consideration by the EPA Administrator and designated for response within 12 months. In addition, 24 chemicals and one group of chemicals were recommended without being so designated. Overall, in the 22 reports to the EPA Administrator, the CQmmittee has recommended testing for 100 chemicals and 21 groups of chemicals. Acomplete list of recommended chemicals may be obtained by contacting the ITC Executive Secretary at the following address/telephone number: Robert Brink, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (TS-792), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 382-3820. 1.3 Committee's activities during this reporting period. Between April 22, 1988 and October 20, 1988, the Committee continued to review chemicals from its fifth and sixth scoring exercises, and from nominations by Member Agencies, Liaison Agencies and State Agencies. The Committee contacted chemical manufacturers and trade associations to request information that would be of value in its deliberations. Most of those contacted provided unpublished information on current production, exposure, uses, and effects of chemicals under study by the Committee. During this reporting period, the Committee reviewed available information on 54 chemicals. Six were selected for addition to the section 4(e) Priority List, and twenty-one were deferred indefinitely. The remaining chemicals are still under study. In its twentieth report to the EPA Administrator (Ref. 5, ITC, 1987), the Committee placed ethylbenzene (CAS No. 100-41-4) on the Priority List in the \"Recommended with Intent-to- Designate\" category. The Committee recommeded that ethylbenzene be tested for acute toxicity to freshwater algae and invertebrates and to saltwater algae, invertebrates and fish. Subsequently, the Committee learned that acute toxicity testing of ethylbenzene with freshwater invertebrates had recently been completed at the University of Wisconsin. As noted in the twenty-first and twenty-second reports, the Committee also was informed that a consortium of ethylbenzene producers, the Styrene and Ethylbenzene Association, voluntarily sponsored studies on the other acute toxicity tests recommended by the Committee. The Committee deferred a decision on whether or not to designate ethylbenzene pending a review of the data developed during the above studies. The Committee has reviewed the data developed in those studies and has concluded that all of the data gaps identified in the twentieth report have been satisfactorily resolved. Therefore, the Committee has decided that ethylbenzene should be removed from the Priority List. 1.4 The TSCA section 4(e) Priority List Section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCA directs the Committee to: \"* * * make such revisions in the [priority] list as it46264 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices determines to be necessary and * * * transmit them to the Administrator together with the Committee's reasons for the revisions.\" Under this authority, the Committee is revising the Priority List by adding six chemicals: tris(2- chloroethyliphosphate (CAS No. 115-96- and butyraldehyde (CAS No. 123-72-8). In addition, the Committee is designating, for repsonse within 12 months, crotonaldehyde, which was recommended with intent-to- designate in the twenty-second report. Two chemicals are being removed from the Priority List at this time. Methyl ethyl ketoxime (CAS No. 96-29-7) was the subject of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (53 FR 35838; September 15, 1988) and ethylbenzene (CAS No. 100- 41-4) is being removed for the reasons given in section 1.3. With the six new recommendations and two removals noted in this report, twenty-one entries now appear on the section 4(e) Priority List. The Priority List is divided in the following Table 2 into three parts; namely, A. Chemicals and Groups of Chemicals Designated for Response Within 12 Months, B. Chemicals and Groups of Chemicals Recommended with Intent-to-Designate, and C. Chemicals and Groups of Chemicals Recommended Without Being Designated for Response Within 12 Months.

As provided by section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCA, the Committee is adding the following chemical substances to the section 4(e) Priority List: tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (CAS No. and butyraldehyde (CAS No. 123-72-8). In addition, the Committee is designating for response within 12 months one chemical that was recommended with intent-to-designate in the twenty-second report. The designated chemical is crotonaldehyde (CAS No. 4170-30-3). The recommendation of these chemicals is made after considering the factors identified in section, 4(e)(1)(A) and other relevant information, as well as the professional iudgment of Committee members. 2.2 Chemicals designated for response within 12 months-2.2.a Crotonaldehyde. In the twenty-second report to the Administrator of EPA (53 FR 181,96) crotonaldehyde was recommended with intent-to-designate. The rationale for that recommendation appears in the twenty-second report. Information reviewed by the Committee in response to the twenty-second report includes any public comments on the Committee's recommendations; production volume, use, exposure and release information reported by46265 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices manufacturers of crotonaldehyde under the TSCA section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment rule; health and safety studies submitted under TSCA 8(d) Health and Safety Data Report rule; and any unpublished and published data available to the Committee. After reviewing the information, the Committee concluded that data are still lacking on certain chemical fate factors and ecological effects. For these reasons and for the reasons previously presented(53 FR 18196) the Committee is now designating crotonaldehyde for response within 12 months and recommending that it be tested for the following: 1. Chemical fate. Volatilization rate from water, aerobic aquatic biodegradation rate. 2. Health effects. None. 3. Ecological effects. Acute toxicity to algae, fish and aquatic invertebrates. 2.3 Chemicals recommended with intent-to-designate-2.3.a Tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate-Summary of recommended studies, It is recommended that tris(2- chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) be tested for the following: 1. Chemical Fate. Environmental monitoring; vapor pressure; biodegradation, 2. Health Effects. None. 3. Environmental Effects. Acute toxicity to aquatic and terrestrial plants; chronic toxicity to fish, PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION CAS No. 115-96-8 .VMY1 ............................................ ............................................................... Boiling ('C) ................................................................ Pressure and Kirwin, 1981). 330 (Ret. 2, Aldrich, 1986).

Colorless liquid with slight odor (Ref. 17, Lefaux, 1968). Rationale for Recommendations 1. Exposure Information A. Production/use/release to the environment. Tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) is produced in substantial but CBI annual amounts in the U.S. Actual production volumes are considered to be confidential business information. It is used as a flame retardant additive for flexible and rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams, carpet-backing, flame-retardant paints and lacquers, various resins, coatings and adhesives (Ref 15, Kirk- Othmer, 1980). The major use appears to be in foams such as the flexible foams used in automobiles and furniture and iigid foams for building insulation mterials. It is unlikely that there is any natural production of TCEP. Most of the production eventually will be released to the environment as furniture, andlandfills. Some may be released during thermal decomposition (accidental fires and waste incineration). Muir (Ref. 21, 1984) cited a report by Cho and Klaus (1980) stating that 41 percent of TCEP remains intact after thermal oxidation in air at 370\u00b0C. However, Paciorek et al. (Ref. 23, 1978) reported that 85 percent of the TCEP chlorine was accounted for in volatile products of degradation at 370C, which indicates that no more than 15 percent of the TCEP was left undegraded. B. Evidence for environmental exposure. TCEP, in common with many similar tris(haloalkyl)phosphates, has been found in numerous environmental samples throughout the world, at very low concentrations. TCEP was found in river waters in Japan at 17 to 350 ng/L at 14 of 16 sites at Kitakyushu (Ref. 12, Ishikawa et al., 1985b) and in Canadian rivers at 13 sites, with a meanconcentration of 8.7 ng/L (Ref. 29, Williams and LeBel, 1981). TCEP was detected in the Netherlands in the river Waal (Ref. 19, Meijers and Van der Leer, 1976) and the Rhine (Ref. 24, Piet et al., 1987). TCEP was present in ground water from two wells at Fort Devens, MA at concentrations of 0.28 and 0.81 ug/L (Ref. 3, Bedient et al., 1983; Ref. 10, Hutchins et al.. 1984). Water from the Great Lakes contained TCEP at a mean concentration of 1.7 ng/L at ten Canadian sites (Ref. 30, Williams and LeBel. 1981] and at concentrations of 3 to 9.6 ng/L at 4 of 5 sites in a later report (Ref. 16, LeBel et al., 1987). Samples from 10 coastal sites in Japan contained 14 to 60 ng/L in the seawater (Ref. 12, Ishikawa et al., 1985b). Sewage treatment facilities in Japan contained from 540 to 1,200 ng/L TCEP in the influent to the plants and 500 to 1,20046266 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices ng/L in the effluents. Similarly, at night soil treatment facilities, the influent contained 190 to 1,500 ng/L TCEP and the effluents were found to have 190 to 1,500 ng/L (Ref. 13, Ishikawa et al., 1985c). Five river and ocean sediment samples from Japan contained 13 to 28 ng TCEP/g of sediment. None was detected in a sixth sample (Ref. 12, Ishikawa et al., 1985b). TCEP was detected but not quantified in ambient air at Kitakyushu, Japan (Ref. 9, Haraguchi et al., 1985). In a survey of infant and toddler dietary intake from October 1978 through September 1979, Gartrell et al. (Ref. 7, 1985a) reported finding TCEP in composite U.S. drinking water at an- average concentration of 0.3 ug/L. Drinking water in Japan, examined over a 1-year period, contained 2 to 60.5 ng/L TCEP, with a mean concentration of 17.4 ng/L (Ref. 1, Adachi et al., 1984). Fifteen pooled U.S. drinking water samples contained an average of 2.6 ng/L TCEP (Ref. 18, Lucas, 1984) and Millington et al. (Ref. 20, 1983) reported finding TCEP on activated carbon filter beds used at 40 U.S. drinking water treatment plants. In a study of drinking water samples in England, Fielding et al. (Ref. 6, 1981) found TCEP in one of fourteen samples. LaBel et al. (Ref. 16, 1987) found TCEP at 0.3 to 9.2 ng/L in duplicate drinking water samples from six sites in eastern Ontario. Drinking water from 22 other Canadian cities contained TCEP at 0.3 to 52 ng/L while water from 7 other cities contained no detectable TCEP (Ref. 29, Williams and LeBel, 1981). In a survey of drinking water from the Great Lakes at twelve Canadian cities, Williams et al. (Ref. 30, 1982) found concentrations of TCEP at 0.3 to 13.8 ng/L in water at 11 of the cities. In a survey of infant and toddler diets from October 1979 through September 1980, Gartrell et al. (Ref. 8, 1985b) reported TCEP in composite fruit and fruit juice samples at an average concentration of 0.2 ug/L It was not detected in other foods tested. Fish from the Okayama Prefecture in Japan contained from less than 0.005 ug/g up to 0.019 ug/g TCEP (Ref. 14, Kenmochi et al., 1981). TCEP and other widely used tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants appear to be widely distributed in the environment, especially in water, at low concentrations. It is not known whether the environmental concentrations are increasing with time or whether these anthropogenic phosphates have attained some steady-state, low-level concentrations.II. Chemical Fate Information A. Transport. The water solubility of TCEP is reported to be from 7,000 (Ref. 17, LeFaux, 1968) to 8,300 mg/L (Ref. 11, Ichikawa et al., 1985a). A measured value of 7,943 mg/L was reported by Yoshioka at al. (Ref. 31,1986). A measured value for the log octanol/ water partition coefficient was reported as 1.7 (Ref. 31, Yoshioka et al., 1986). These data indicate that TCEP, following release to the environment, will partition largely to water with little accumulation in sediments or biota. Vapor pressure data at environmentally relevant temperatures were not found, but the Henry's Law constant reported by Muir (Ref. 21, 1984) indicates no significant volatilization from water. The monitoring evidence (see preceding paragraph 1.B.) demonstrates widespread occurrence of TCEP in water with some partitioning to air, sediments and biolipids. B. Persistence. The trialkylphosphates, in general, are resistant to hydrolysis and free-radical oxidations although hydrolysis at the pH of sea water (approximtely 8.5) may be significant. TCEP is expected to demonstrate similar resistance to hydrolysis and oxidation, although no data were found. Biodegradation is probably the major degradation mechanism in nature but the available data, which indicate that biodegradation is slow, are mostly circumstantial. There are reports of very little biodegradation of TCEP as it passes through drinking water sand filtration units (Ref. 24, Piet et al., 1981) and through sewage treatment and night soil treatment facilities (Ref. 11, Iehikawa et al., 1985a). TCEP was reported to be hardly degraded after 50 hours in activated sludge (Ref. 11, Ishikawa, et al., 1985a). C. Rationale for chemical fate recommendations. There is widespread contamination of the environment by TCEP (and other tris(chloroalkyl)phosphates) at very low concentrations. There is some evidence that TCEP may be resistant to biodegradation. Based on its water solubility and octanol/water partition coefficients, TCEP released to the environment is expected to partition largely to water. No data were found on its vapor pressure at ambient temperatures. Since TCEP has been and will continue to be released to both water and soil (landfill) environments, there is a need to obtain measured vapor pressure data and to evaluate its biodegradability in natural waters. It also is recommended that appropriate follow-on monitoring studies be conducted at sites sampled in the 1970'sand early 1980's in an attempt to determine whether environmental concentrations are increasing with time. III. Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health A two-year gavage study with rats and mice has recently been completed under the National Toxicology Program (Ref. 22, NTP, 1988) and is currently in the histopathology stages. Given this information, the Committee has deferred its review of TCEP for health effects pending receipt and review of data from the NTP study. IV. Ecological Effects of Concern A. Acute and subchronic (short-term) effects. The 96-hour LC50 of TCEP 210 mg/L (Orizias latipes) and 90 mgtL with goldfish (Carassius auratus) (Ref. 26, Sasaki et al., 1981). These authors also reported spine deformations .(caused by convulsive muscle contractions) in killifish with exposure to 200 mg/L of TCEP for 72 hours and protrusion of killifish eyes after 24 to 72 hours exposure to 200 mg/L. Yoshioka et al. (Ref. 31, 1986) reported LC50 values of 251 mg/L with red killifish 158 mg/ L with a flatworm (Dugesia japonica). Another literature report (Ref. 5, Eldefrawi et al., 1977) stated that 5 mg/L TCEP had no observable effects on goldfish after 7 days exposure. B. Chronic (long-term) effects. No information on chronic effects was found. Sasaki et al. (Ref. 26, 1981), as noted in the preceding paragraph, reported spine deformations and eye bulging in killifish exposed to 200 mg/L for 72 hours. Eldefrawi at al. (Ref. 5, 1977) reported that TCEP is a weak inhibitor of acetyl-cholinesterase and this may produce some chronic effects. C. Other ecological effects (biological, behavioral, or ecosystem processes) No information was found. D. Bioconcentration and food-chain transport. The bioconcentration of TCEP was examined by Sasaki et al. (Ref. 26, 1981 and Ref. 27,1982) in both static and continuous-flow studies. Static tests with killifish and goldfish showed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of 2 and 1, respectively. A BCF of I was observed for killifigh in continuous-flow studies over a 10-day period. When the fish were placed in clean water there was rapid depuration with half gone in 0.7 hours after-cessation of exposure. E. Rationale for ecological effects recommendation. The widespread occurrence of TCEP in environmental samples raises concerns for its46267 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No, 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices ecological effects. On the other hand, the available data indicate that acute toxicity levels for fish and aquatic invertebrates are 1,000 times or more greater than observed environmental concentrations. However, there were no data on plants and it is recommended that TCEP be tested for acute toxicity to aquatic and terrestrial plants. There appear to be chronic exposures to low concentrations of TCEP in aquatic environments and reports of spine deformations raise concerns for chronic effects. Therefore, it is recommended that TCEP also be tested for chronic toxicity to fish. References (1) Adachi, K., Mitsuhaski, T., and Ohkuni, (2) Aldrich. Chemical Company.

Exposure Information A. Production/use/release to environment. TCPP, TCIP and TDCP are each produced in substantial annual amounts in the U.S. but actual production volumes are classified as confidential business information. TCPP and TDCP are used as additive flame retardants in various plastic materials. TDCP is known to be used primarily in flexible polyurethane foams. No information was found on the use of TCIP but it appears likely that it too is used as an additive flame retardant. Most of the production eventually will be released to the environment as the plastic materials containing them are scrapped or disposed of in dumps and landfills. Some may be released during thermal decomposition (accidental fires and waste incineration). A report by Cho and Klaus (1980) stating that 32 percent of TDCP remains intact after thermal oxidation in air at 370* C was cited by Muir (Ref. 11, 1984). It was reported by Paciorek et al. (Ref. 12, 1978) that TDCP underwent 68 percent thermal oxidation at 370* C. It is unlikely that there is any natural production of these (Ref. 18, Stauffer, 1979). No information was found. No information at environmentally relevant temperatures and pressures was found. 7 at 24'C (Ref. 2, Hollifield 1979); 100 at 25'C (Ref. 11, Muir, 1984); 1000 at 30'C (Ref. 18, Stauffer, 1979). 1.515 at 20/20- (Ref. 18, Stauffer, 1979). 3.8 (Ref. 13, Sasaki t al., 1981). B. Evidence for environmental exposure. No information was found on TCPP or TCIP and there was no indication that they have been looked for in the environment. TDCP, in common with many similar tris(haloalkyl)phosphates, has been found in many environmental samples throughout the world, at very low concentrations. TDCP was found in Great Lakes water at 4 of 5 Canadian sites (Ref. 9, LeBel et al., 1987). TDCP was found by LeBel et al. (Ref. 7, 1981) at 0.2 to 1.8 ng/L in drinking water at six eastern Ontario sites. Drinking water from 15 other Canadian cities contained TDCP at 0.3 to 23 ng/L while water from 14 other cities contained no detectable TDCP (Ref. 21, Williams and LeBel, 1981). In a survey of drinking water from the Great Lakes at twelve Canadian Cities, Williams et al. (Ref. 22, 1982) found concentrations of TDCP at 0.1 to 15.7 ng(L. A study of activated carbon filter beds used at 40 U.S. drinking water treatment plants found tris(chloropropyl)phosphate (not further identified) on the carbon (Ref. 11, Millington et al., 1983). Fish and shellfish from the Okayama ,prefecture in Japan were reported to contain tris(2, 3-dichloropropyl)phosphate (Ref. 6, Kenmochi et al., 1981). In an examination of Swedish products thought to contain additive flame retardants (Ref. 16, Sellestroem and Jansson, 1987), 11 of 104 samples were found to contain TDCP. It'was most common in polyurethane products such as sound absorbing materials and liners for cars and buses. These same authors also examined the contents of vacuum cleaner bags from one new and one older (15-year old) house and found TDCP in the dust from the older house. In analyses of human adipose tissues, LeBel and Williams (Ref. 8,1983) found TDCP in 5 of 16 samples at 0.5 to 110 ng/ g. TDCP also was found at 5 to 50 ppb in 34 of 123 human seminal plasma samples (Ref. 3, Hudec et al. 1981]. Japanese studies have reported finding tris(chloropropyl)-phosphate (CAS No. 26248-87-3) and tris(dichloropropyl)phosphate (CAS No. 26604-51-3) (Ref. 1, Haraguchi et al., 1985) and tris(3-chloropropyl)phosphate (CAS No. 1067-98-7) and tris(2, 3- dichloropropyl~phosphate (CAS No. 78- 43-3) (Ref. 4, Ishikawa et al., 1985a) in air and treatment plant influents and effluents in Japan. The first three CAS numbers are not listed in the TSCA Inventory and the fourth CAS number is46270 r-- lorOwlipnowpnate; Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices a compound that is produced in low amounts in the U.S. It may be that Japanese industry uses tris(chloropropyl)phosphate flame retardants not commonly used in the U.S. and that those compounds may be introduced into the U.S. environment from imported products. TDCP and other widely used tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants appear to be widely distributed in the environment. When they are looked for, they often are found. No information was found on monitoring studies designed to look for TCPP or TCIP and monitoring should be conducted if continued high production and use are confirmed. Additional monitoring studies to evaluate the concentrations of TDCP in the environment should be conducted to determine whether its concentration in the environment is increasing with time. I. Chemical Fate Information A. Transport. The water solubility of TDCP is reported to be from 7 to 1,000 mg/L (Ref. 2, Hollifield, 1981, Ref. 11, Muir, 1984, Ref. 18, Stauffer, 1979). The log octanol/water partition coefficient is reported to be 3.8 (Ref. 14, Sasaki et al., 1981). No information was found for TCPP and TCIP. The monitoring evidence (see I.B., above) for TDCP demonstrates widespread occurrence of TDCP in water with some partitioning to sediments and biolipids. TCPP and TCIP are expected to behave similarly. B. Persistence. No information was found for TCPP, TCIP or TDCP. However, Ishikawa et al. (Ref. 5,1985b) reported that influent and effluent data for activated sludge treatment showed no biodegradation of tris(chloropropyt~phosphate (CAS No. 1067-98-7) and tris(2,3- dichloropropyl)phosphate (CAS No. 78- 43-3). C. Rationale for chemical fate recommendations. There is widespread contamination of the environment by TDCP. There may be persistent background levels of TCPP and TCIP in the environment but this is unknown. There is a need to conduct appropriate monitoring studies to determine if TCDD and TCIP, like similar tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants, are present in the environment at low concentrations and whether the environmental concentrations of TDCP are increasing. There also is a need to obtain reliable, measured water solubility, vapor pressure and octanol/water partition coefficient data on these flame retardants to better estimate their transport in the environment and toevaluate their biodegradability in natural waters. II. Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health The Committee determined that tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (CAS No. 13674--87-8 has-been studied extensively for health effects and concluded that additional studies are not required. Therefore, health effects testing is not being recommended at this time. A. Metabolism and toxicokinetics. No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. B. Acute (short-term) effects. No information was found for TCPP. An LD5O of 56 mg/kg, administered intravenously in mice, was found for TCIP (U.S. Army data, cited in Ref. 13, RTECS, 1988). The reliability of this information cannot be assessed since experimental details are not available. Stauffer (cited in Ref. 20, USEPA, 1981) reported studies on the neurotoxic potential of TDCP, a structurally similar phosphate, on adult hens. At 10 g/kg, the maximum tolerated dose, there was 7 percent inhibition of brain neurotoxic esterase. In positive controls, treated with tri-o-cresyl phospate at 0.5 g/kg, there was an 85 percent inhibition. No subchronic effects data were found for TCIP. The neurotoxic potential of TCPP in adult white Leghorn hens was evaluated by Sprague et al. (Ref. 17, 1981). A group of 18 hens received an initial oral dose of 13.23 g TCPP/kg, followed by the same treatment 3 weeks later. The animals were sacrificed 3 weeks after the second dose. Loss of body weight, transient reductions in food consumption and one death were reported for the treated animals. Egg production ceased shortly after the first dose and there was severe feather loss. No behavioral or histological evidence of delayed neurotoxicity was observed. C. Genotoxicity. No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. D. Oncogenicity. No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. A structurally similar compound, TDCP, was tested for oncogenicity in rats of both sexes and -produced a significantly increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and interstitial cell tumors of the testes (Ref. 19, Stauffer, 1981). E. Chronic (long-term) effects. No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. F. Reproductive and developmental effects. No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. G. Observations in humans. No information was found for TCPP or TCIP.H. Rationale for health effects recommendations. Three tris(chloropropyl)phosphates (TCPP, TCIP and TDCP) are produced in substantial amounts in the U.S. and used as additive flame retardants. TDCP is widely distributed in the environment at low concentrations. No exposure information (occupational, consumer or environmental) is available for TCPP or TCIP. It is assumed that use of the latter two compounds as flame retardants will eventually lead to the release of TCPP and TCIP to the environment. TDCP appears to be well studied for potential health effects but there is very little health effects information on TCIP and TCPP. The health effects information is limited to a LD50 for TCIP in mice by intravenous exposure and a subchronic evaluation of the neurotoxic potential of TCPP in hens. An evaluation of neurotoxicity should be conducted for a period of 90 days. In view of the lack of health effects information on TCIP and TCPP and given the acute effects, oncogenicity and neurotoxicity of TDCP, it is recommended that TCIP and TCPP be tested for acute effects, including cholinesterase inhibition, 90-day subchronic effects and reproductive effects. Based on the results of the recommended studies, the need for long- term studies should be considered. IV. Ecological Effects of Concern A. Acute and subchronic (short-term) effects. No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. The 96-hr LC5O for TDCP was reported to be 3.6 mg/L with killifish and 5.1 mg/L with goldfish (Ref. 14, Saaski et al., 1981). These authors also reported spine deformations (caused by convulsive muscle contractions) in killifish after 24 hours exposure at 3.5 mg/L TDCP. B. Chronic (long-term) effects. No information on chronic effects was found. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, Sasaki et al. (Ref. 14, 1981) reported spine deformations in killifish exposed to 3.5 mg/L TDCP for 24 hours, C. Other ecological effects. No information was found. D. Bioconcentration and food-chain transport. The bioconcentration of TDCP was examined by Sasaki et al. (Ref. 14, 1981 and Ref. 15, 1982) in both static and continuous flow studies. Static tests with killifish and goldfish showed bioconcentration factors of 47 to 107 with killifish and 3 to 5 with goldfish. In continuous-flow studies, the bioconcentration factor for TDCP was 31 to 59 for up to 32 days exposure. There46271 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices was a rapid depuration following cessation of exposure to TDCP in the continuous-flow studies, with half gone in 1.7 hours. E. Rationale for ecological effects recommendations. The widespread occurrence of TDCP in environmental samples and the likely contamination of the environment by TCPP and TCIP raise concerns for their ecological effects. Each should be tested for acute toxicity to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae to better evaluate the hazard associated with chronic exposures to low environmental concentrations. The observation of spine deformations in fish exposed to TDCP and the widespread occurrence of TDCP at low concentrations also raises concerns for chronic effects. It is recommended that each of these tris(chloropropyl)- phosphates be tested for chronic toxicity to fish.

Tetrakis(2- chloroethyl)ethylene diphosphate (TCEEP) is produced in substantial annual amounts in the U.S. but actual production volumes are classified as confidential business information. TCEEP is used as an additive flame retardant in flexible polyurethane foams and may be used as a flame retardant in various resins. There is no known natural production of TCEEP. B. Environmental release. It is likely that most of the TCEEP production is eventually released to the environment as furniture, automobiles, construction materials, etc. are scrapped and disposed of in dumps and landfills. Some TCEEP may be released during thermal decomposition (in accidental fires and incinerators) but no information was found on thermal decomposition. C. Evidence for environmental exposure. No information was found. Related chioroalkyl phosphate flame retardants (e.g., tris(2- chloroethyl)phosphate and tris(1,3- dichloropropyll-phsophate), when looked for in the environment, have been found at low concentrations in a wide variety of environmental media in industrialized countries. It is not known whether anyone has looked for TCEEP in the environment. II. Chemical Fate Information A. Transport. The water solubility, vapor pressure and estimated octanol/ Water partition coefficient for TCEEP suggest significant transport to both air and water, with little sorption to soil or sediment. The calculated Henry's law constant, if true, would produce a half- life for volatilization from water ofabout I to 2 days. A related phosphate, the tris(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate, has a reported Henry's constant of 1.81 x 10-7 atm m3/mol for a predicted half-life in water of about 1.4 years. It is difficult to believe that there would be such a great difference between these two phosphates and the water solubility and vapor pressure used to calculate the Henry's constants should be reliably measured. If this phosphate behaves similarly to the tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants, it will partition largely to water following release to the environment. B. Persistence. No information was found. C. Rationale for chemical fate and recommendations. TCEEP, like the related tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants, may partition largely to the aquatic environment and be relatively persistent. The related tris(chloroalkyl)phospates have been found throughout the industrialized world in a variety of environmental media at low concentrations. There is a need for monitoring studies that look for TCEEP to determine if it also appears at low concentrations in the environment. In addition, it is recommended that studies be conducted to determine the water solubility, vapor pressure and octanol/water partition coefficient of TCEEP and to evaluate its biodegradability in natural waters. III. Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health The Committee, at the conclusion of its Sixth Scoring Exercise, concluded that it would not review TCEEP for health effects (52 FR 10409, April 1, 1987). Therefore, no health effects studies are being recommended at this time.W. Ecological Effects of Concern A. Acute and subchronic (short-term) effects. No information was found. B. Chronic (long-term) effects. No information was found. C. Other ecological effects. No information was found. D. Bioconcentration and food-chain transport. No information was found. E. Rationale for ecological effects recommendations. It is likely that TCEEP has been and will continue to be released to the environment in significant quantitieswhere it may persist and accumulate. Studies should be conducted to evaluate the acute toxicity of TCEEP to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae.

Production/use/release to environment Butyraldehyde is produced and used in the U.S. at a rate in excess of one billion pounds per year. SRI reported U.S. production of butyraldehyde in 1987 at 1.835 billion pounds by five manufacturers at six sites spread across Texas (Ref. 52, SRI International, 1987). Greater than 90 percent of the production is used as a chemical intermediate to synthesize n- butanol and 2-ethylhexanol. Domestic production of n-butanol and 2-, ethylhexanol was 935 million and 638 million pounds, respectively, in 1987 (Ref. 9, C&EN, 1988). Other important uses for butyraldehyde include its use as a solvent for surface coatings and its combination with polyvinyl alcohol to form a resin in laminated safety glass (Ref. 8, CEH, 1985).Butyraldehyde occurs naturally in many plants, including fruits and vegetables, and in cheese, meats and wines. It has FDA approval as a direct food additive for use as a synthetic flavoring substance and as an indirect food additive as a component of packaging (21 CFR 172.515; 21 CFR 175.105; and Ref. 44, Opdyke, 1979). The major releases of butyraldehyde to the environment will occur at the manufacturing sites in Texas and at major use sites elsewhere in the U.S. This volatile water soluble chemical may be released to water and air in significant quantities. One company (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988) reported 1987 emissions at its Texas plant of about 831,000 pounds with 90 percent of theemissions listed as fugitive emissions to air. Toxic chemical release inventory reporting forms submitted to the EPA in response to the Toxic Chemical Release Reporting rule (53 FR 4500; February 16, 1988) provide information on substantial releases to air (from 54,000 to 836,000 lbs. per year) at six manufacturing and use sites (Ref. 55, USEPA, 1988). B. Evidence for human and environmental exposure. According to the National Occupational Hazard Survey (NOHS) conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) from 197Z to 1974, 1,259 workers were potentially exposed to butyraldehyde in the workplace in 1970 (Ref. 38, NIOSH, 1976). Preliminary data available from the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES), conducted by NIOSH from 1980 to 1983, indicate that 5,392 workers, including 950 women, were potentially exposed to butyraldehyde in the workplace in 1980 (Ref. 39, NIOSH, 1984). Since domestic production has been increasing since 1982 (Ref. 56, USITC 1983) it is expected that more workers are exposed today. Occupational exposure limits have not been established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. One company (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988) reported that the major points of worker exposure to n-butyraldehyde are in sampling, loading, and unloading shipping containers, and maintaining the equipment. Also, during production at its Texas plant, from 4 to 8 workers are potentially exposed daily, and from I to2 maintenance workers are potentially exposed for approximately 120 days per year. The same company reported that during use of n-butyraldehyde to manufacture other chemicals, 12 to 18 workers are potentially exposed at its Tennessee plant. These processes run from 180 to 360 days per year. Personal monitoring of production workers (42 samples) indicated air concentrations of n-butyraldehyde averaging less than 1.0 ppm (8-hour.TWA) with no sample above 1.25 ppm. Personal monitoring of materials handling workers (7 samples) indicated a geometric mean (-hour TWA) of 3.7 ppm n-butyraldehyde. Five of the seven samples were under 1.0 ppm, the other two were 21.3 and 4.57 ppm. (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988). Another company (Ref. 26, Hoechst- Celanese, 1988) reported that 120 employees were working in the butyraldehyde unit of its Texas processing plant. It reported no monitoring data collected in previous years, and only one sample collected in 1988 which \"was I ppm for an 8 hour period.\" It was not reported whether this was a personal or area sample. Its Texas purification plant (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1988) reported 4 to 8 workers exposed to n-butyraldehyde with monitoring data indicating exposure levels less than 10 ppm. However, no information was given concerning the collection of monitoring data. There are no monitoring data available showing general population exposure to n-butyraldehyde. Exposures may be significant for populations living near major manufacturing sites sincebvnonwms ............................................ ..46274 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices toxic release information indicates substantial fugitive emissions from manufacturing and use sites (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988; Ref. 55, USEPA, 1988). One company (Ref. 26, Hoechst- Celanese, 1988), however, reported community exposure near its Texas processing plant to be less than 0.0004 ppm n-butyraldehyde although fugitive emissions of butyraldehyde at the plant exceeded 106,000 pounds per year. Details of the sampling and other procedures used to determine this number were not reported. Butyraldehyde was detected but not quantified in the respired air of a heterogenous nonsmoking control population living in' Chicago and the surrounding suburbs; however, it was not detected in the respired air of two other populations examined in the study: A prediabetic group and a diabetic group. The total sample was 62 persons. The authors classified butyraldehyde as a physiologic volatile metabolite but did not suggest a mechanism for its generation (Ref. 34, Krotoszynski and O'Neill, 1982). No information was found concerning drinking water exposures to n- butyraldehyde. Many of the monitoring studies that report environmental concentrations of butyraldehyde have dealt with urban air in areas where smogs are a problem. This appears to be due to the presence of butyraldehyde in the emissions from internal combustion engines and the involvement of butyraldehyde in smog formation. Grosjean et al. have conducted several of these studies in Southern California (Ref. 17, Fung et al., 1981; Ref. 21, Grosjean, 1982; Ref. 22, Grosjean et al., 1983; Ref. 23, Grosjean and Wright, 1983; and Ref. 24, Grosjean and Fung, 1984). Similar studies have been conducted in Sweden (Ref. 31, Jonsson et al., 1985). Isodorov (Ref. 28, 1985) reported on the emissions of butyraldehyde into the'atmosphere by ferns in the forests of northern Russia. Little or no monitoring data were found on the presence of butyraldehyde in theair near major manufacturing and use sites although toxic release information reveals substantial fugitive emissions at manufacturing and use sites. Some monitoring studies have looked for butyraldehyde in surface, ground and drinking waters and it has been found at very low concentrations in a few samples (Ref. 11, Corwin, 1969; Ref. 16, Ewing et al., 1977; and Ref. 58, Viar, 1988). No data were found on monitoring conducted on water samples obtained near manufacturing and use sites. Ito et al. (Ref. 29, 1980) reported finding butyraldehyde in fish in Japan. .11. Chemical Fate Information A. Transport. Based on its vapor pressure, water solubility and log P, butyraldehyde released to the environment will partition to both water and air. The Henry's law constant for butyraldehyde indicates that butyraldehyde in surface waters will volatilize rapidly with a half-life in water of about 12 hours., B. Persistence. Butyraldehyde released to the environment will not persist. It will be rapidly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with hydroxyl radicals with an atmospheric half-life of 4 to 9 hours (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988). Butyraldehyde is readily biodegraded under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions by acclimated microorganisms. C. Rationale for chemical fate recommendations. Butyraldehyde released to the environment will not persist and concerns for potential adverse effects are low in most parts of the U.S. However, the large production volumes at sites in Texas and the toxic release data on substantial releases to air at manufacturing and use site raise concerns with respect to environmental concentrations of butyraldehyde in air and water at those sites. Those emissions will occur on a nearly continuous basis and butyraldehyde may be present in the air and water at significant concentrations that represent a balance between rates of release andrates of removal by degradation processes. It .is recommended that monitoring studies be conducted to determine butyraldehyde concentrations in air and water in the vicinity of the major manufacturing and use facilities. Monitoring for the presence of low molecular weight, volatile, hydrophilic compounds in water samples, as noted by Ogawa and Fritz (Ref. 43, 1985), can be very difficult and special care should be taken to assure realistic results. III. Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health A. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Aldehydes are oxidized to the corresponding acid by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ref. 59, Weiner, 1980) Three isozymes have been identified from human liver, all of which oxidized several aldehydes, including butyraldehyde (Ref. 30, Jones and Teng, 1983). Butyraldehyde has been detected in mother's milk (6 or 8 samples) obtained from urban areas in the U.S. (Ref. 45, Pellizzari et al., 1982) and in the sera of normal and diabetic patients (Ref. 62, Zlatkis et al., 1980). In virto studies indicate that butyraldehyde at concentrations of 0.1 to 1 mM inhibits multiplication of mouse sarcoma cells in culture (Ref. 46, Pilotti et al., 1975; Ref. 13, Curvall et al., 1984), and inhibits chemotaxis and reduces viability of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 90 mM (Ref. 3, Bridges et al., 1977). Other in vitro effects incliuded:, damage to the cell membranes of human fibroblasts at 25 mM (Ref. 54, Thelestam et al., 1980; Ref. 13, Curvall et al., 1984) and human red blood cells at 1mM (Ref. 47, Poli et al., 1987), and Interference with lipolysis and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue cells at concentrations of I to 20 mM (Ref. 20, Giudicelli et al., 1973). B. Acute and subchronic (short-term) effects. The acute toxicity data for butyraldehyde are summarized in the following Table 3.

An RD50 of 1,532 ppm (4,518 mg/m3) was 1,015 ppm (2,993 5,572 ppm (16,431 mg/ms} was determined for male rats under similar conditions (Ref. 1, Babiuk et al., 1985). Inhalation exposure of ten Sprague- Dawley derived CD rats to measured concentrations of 1,820 ppm (5,367 mg/L) butyraldehyde for 4 hours caused irritation of the ocular and respiratory mucous membranes during the exposure and subsequent 4 hours (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1988). No other treatment-related effects were reported during the 14-day observation period or at necropsy. Inhalation exposure of rats to 1,000 ppm (2,949 mg/ml) butyraldehyde for twelve 6-hour exposures produced no observable toxic signs (Ref. 18, Gage, 1970. Oral administration of butyraldehyde to rats at dose levels of 0.075, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 g per kg, daily for 5 days per week for 13 weeks caused irritation, inflammation, necrosis, hyperplasia, and lesions in the forestomach and gastric mucosa (Ref. 40, NTP, 1988). The increased incidence of these lesions was dose-related and affected 100 percent of the males and 90 percent of females at the highest does level, 1.2 g/kg. Dermal exposure of rabbits to butyraldehyde (2.5 mL/kg) for 24 hours caused severe dermal lesions that became infected and led to termination of the study after 7 days (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1988). Extensive necrosis and severe edema were exhibited by all animals at 24 hours; eschar developed about day 4 or 5. Toxic signs evident in several animals during the 24-hour application period included ataxia, fine tremors, hypoactivity, and respiratory anomalies. Tremors, hypoactivity, hypopnea and respiratory arhythmia persisted in a few aniamls for an unspecified period of time. Apart from the dermal lesions, no other treatment-induced changes were evident at necropsy. Butyraldehyde is a severe skin and eye irritant in rabbits (Ref. 26, Hoechst- Celanese, 1988). It exhibits little or no potential to produce dermal sensitization in guinea pigs (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1981). After a 3-week induction period consisting of nine 6- hour applications of butyraldehyde, there was no dermal response fromguinea pigs challenged with 10 percent butyraldehyde. A second challenge at 25 percent elicited an equivocal response in only 2 of 20 animals. C. Genotoxicity. In the Salmonella assay, butyraldehyde was not mutagenic in strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98, or TA100, with or without activation (Ref. 35, Mortelmans et al., 1986). No increase in chromosomal aberrations was detected in Chinese hamster ovary cells at butyraldehyde concentrations of 59 to 135 ug/mL with or without metabolic activation, but sister chromatid exchange was induced in these cells at nontoxic levels ranging from 9 to 90 ug/ mL (Ref. 19, Galloway et al., 1987). The lowest effective doses were less than 9 ug/mL without activation and 30 ug/mL with activation. When butyraldehyde was administered to male mice (Q strain) in the drinking water at 0.2 mg/L for 50 days, chromosomal aberrations were evident as polyploidy at all stages of spermatogenesis and abnormal pairing of chromosomes at metaphase I (Ref. 37, Moutschen-Dahmen, 1976). Butyraldehyde did not increase sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes treated in vitro at a concentration of ZX10-3 percent (v/v) without metabolic activation (Ref. 42, Obe and Beck, 1979). No increase was reported in sex-linked recessive lethals of Drosophila melanogaster fed butyraldehyde at of 2,000 ppm in 5 percent aqueous sucrose (Ref. 57, Valencia et al., 1985). D. Oncogenicity. No information was found on the subject compound. Plans for a chronic inhalation bioassay of butyraldehyde were dropped by NTP because of technical difficulties in generating the atmosphere for exposure (Ref. 41, NTP, 1988). A related compound, isobutyraldehyde, is scheduled for a chronic inhalation bioassay starting in February 1989 under the National Toxicology Program. Other structural analogues of n-butyraldehyde including formaldehyde and acetaldehyde have shown sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in animal studies; the evidence in humans is considered by IARC to be limited for formaldehyde and inadequate for acetaldehyde (Ref. 27, IARC, 1987). E. Chronic (long-term) effects. No information was found. F. Reproducitve and developmental effects. A single intraperitoneal injection of I mg butyraldehyde per animal produced chromosomal damage and meiotic anomalies including degenerative nuclei, multispindle cells and polyploid cells at all stages of spermatogenesis in male mice I month following the treatment (Ref. 36, Moutschen-Dahmen et al., 1975). In alater study (Ref. 37, Moutschen-Dahmen et al., 1976), one group of male mice received a single intraperitoneal dose of 30 mg butyraldehyde per kg, and a second group received 0.2 mg/L in their drinking water for 50 days. Administration of butyraldehyde by either route damaged the spermatogenic cells of the seminiferous tubules. In addition to gross degeneration, polyploidy was observed at all stages of spermatogenesis and abnromal pairing of sex chromosomes occurred at metaphase I; there was increased incidence of spermatozoa without acrosomes in the vas deferens. G. Observations in humans. Among 12 individuals of Oriental ancestry characterized as susceptible to cutaneous flushing after ingestion of ethanol, all reacted positively (with erythema) to patch testing with 75 percent butyraldehyde (Ref. 60, Wilkin and Fortner,' 1985). Butyraldehyde was found to be mildly irritating when applied in epicutaneous tests (Ref. 44, Fiser and Pokorny, 1965, as cited in Opdyke, 1979), whereas 1 percent butyraldehyde in petrolatum produced no irritation after a 48-hour closed patch test (Ref. 44, Kligman 1977, as cited in Opdyke, 1979). One out of 25 tested with 1 percent butyraldehyde in petrolatum had a positive but nonspecific sensitization reaction in a maximization test. Butyraldehyde vapor (230 ppm) was nonirritating to the eyes of 15 men during a 30 minute exposure (Ref. 49, Sim and Pattle, 1957). H. Rationale for health effects recommendations. Annual domestic production of n-butyraldehyde is about 1.8 billion pounds by five manufacturers at six sites in Texas. Preliminary data indicate that over 5,000 workers (including 950 women) were potentially exposed to n-butyraldehyde in the workplace in 1980. Since domestic production has been increasing since 1982, it is expected that more workers are exposed today. Sizeable airborne fugitive emissions have been reported (from 54,000 to 836,000 lbs. peryear) from six major manufacturing and use sites. Therefore, there is potential for significant community population exposure in the vicinity of manufacturing and use sites. Structural analogues of n- butyraldehyde including formaldehyde and acetaldehyde have shown carcinogenic effects in animals. IARC considers that there is sufficient evidence from animal studies for the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde whereas the evidence in humans is limited or inadequate,46276 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No.- 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Notices 46277 respectively.

B. Chronic (long-term) effects. No information was found. C. Other ecological effects. In a series of articles, Bringmann and Kuhn reported on minimum inhibitory concentrations for a large number of chemicals and a variety of aquatic organisms. The definition of minimum inhibitory concentration varied according to the organism being tested. For daphnids it was described as the maximum tested concentration at which all of the daphnids were able to retain their swimming capability following 24 hours exposure to the test chemical. For protozoa the minimum inhibitory concentration was the concentration that caused cell counts in test cultures to be 5 percent or more below the counts in control cultures with 48 hours exposure. For algae, the minimum inhibitory concentration was the concentration of test material that inhibited cell multiplication in test versus control cultures during 8 days exposure. For the bacterium, Pseudomonasputida, the endpoint was inhibition of cell multiplication after 24 hours exposure, as determined by turbidity measurements of test versus control cultures (Ref. 4, Bringmann, 1978; Ref. 5, Bringmann and Kuhn, 1980; Kuhn, 1981; and Ref. 7, Bringmann and Kuhn, 1982). Their butyraldehyde .100 The butyraldehyde concentrations that inhibited the swimming capability of 50 percent and 100 percent of Dcphnio magna populations after 24- hours exposure also were reported by Bringmann and Kuhn (Ref. 7, 1982) to be 195 and 383 mg/L, respectively.Chou et al. (Ref. 10, 1978) reported that butyraldehyde was relatively non- toxic to methanogenic bacteria. In a study on the use of bacteria as an indication of toxicity to fish, Curtis et al (Ref. 12,1981) reported a 5-minute EC50 of 16.4 mg/L exposed to butyraldehyde. D. Bioconcentration and food-chain transport. An examination of fish in Japan revealed the presence of butyraldehyde at low concentrations (Ref. 29, Ito et al., 1980]. The significance of this information in unclear since butyraldehyde is produced naturally and is found in many food products. Based on its high water solubility and low octanol/water partitioning coefficient, butyraldehyde is not expected to bioconcentrate. E. Rationale for ecological effects recommendations. Butyraldehyde is produced in very large annual quantities at several locations in Texas. There are reports of substantial emissions of butyraldehyde to air at manufacturing and use sites. There may be significant concentrations of butyraldehyde in the air and surface waters in the vicinity of one or more of the manufacturing and use sites. Few data are available on the acute toxicity of butyraldehyde to aquatic species and none were found for terrestrial plants and animals. No chronic toxicity information was found. It is recommended that appropriate toxicity studies be conducted with representative species of biota if warranted by monitoring data.

Manufacturers, processors, 'and importers of these chemicals will be required to report end use, exposure, volume, and unpublished health and safety data to the Agency. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 32.7 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM- 223, U.S. Environmental.Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.I. Background Section 4(e) of TSCA established the ITC and authorized it to recommend to EPA chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals) to be given priority consideration in proposing chemical test rules. For some of these chemicals the- ITC may designate that EPA must respond to its recommendations within 12 months. In this time, EPA must either initiate a rulemaking to test the chemical or publish in the Federal Register its reasons for not doing so. For the remainder of the recommended substances, no time limit for Agency response is imposed. Elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register, EPA is announcing the receipt of the Twenty-third Report of the ITC, which was transmitted to EPA on November 1198& The Twenty-third Report revises and updates the Committee's priority list of chemicals and adds six substances to the section 4(e) priority list. This rule adds these six substances to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule which wil require manufacturers, importers, and processors to report volume, end use, exposure, and unpublished health and safety data to EPA. In addition, one chemical substance which 1iad been recommended with intent-to-designate by the ITC in its Twenty-second Report, 2-Butenal, CAS No. .4170-30-3. is now designated for response within 12 months. This revision does not'trigger any new reporting requirements because following the recommendation with intent-to-designate, 2-Butenal (also known as Crotonaldehyde), was added to the PAIR (53 FR 18211, May 20,1988) and the section aid) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule 151 FR 2890, January 22,1986), as published in the Federal Register of May 20, 1988 (53 R 18190). To assist EPA in responding to the ITC recommendations, EPA has developed two model information- gathering rules (PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule) which provide for the automatic addition of ITC priority list substances. Whenever EPA announces the receipt of an ITC report, EPA may, at the same time without notice and comment, amend the two model information- gathering rules by adding the recommended substances. The amendment adding these substances to the PAIR and the Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule becomes effective 30 days after publication. EPA issued PAIR under section 6(s) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2007(a)), and it is codified at 40 CFR Part 712. This modelsection 8[a) rule established standard reporting requirements for manufacturers and importers of the chemicals listed in the rule. These manufacturers and importers are required to submit a one-time report on general volume, end use, and exposure information using the Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's Report (EPA Form No. 7710-35). EPA uses this model section 8(a) rule to gather current information on substances of concern quickly. EPA issued the model Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule under section 8(d) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2807(d)), and it is codified at 40 CFR Part 716. EPA revised the section 8(d) model rule on September 15,1986851 FR 32720). The section 8Jd) nmdel rule requires past, current. and prospective manufacturers, importers, and processors of listed chemical substances and mixtures to submit to EPA copies 'and lists of unpublished health and safety studies on the listed chemicals that they manufacture, import, or process. These studies provide EPA with useful information and have provided significant support for EPA's decisionmaking under TSCA sections 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, IL Chemicals to be Added The following ITC priority list substances for which reporting i's required under 40 CFR Parts 712 and 716 are listed by ITC designation in ascending Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CAS No.) order: A.

Preliminary Assessment Information Rule All persons who manufactured or imported the substances named in this rule during their latest complete corporate fiscal year must submit a Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's Report (EPA Form No. 7710-35) for each manufacturing or importing site at which they manufactured or imported a named substance. A separate form must be completed for each substance and submitted to the Agency no later than February 14, 1989. Persons who have previously and voluntarily submitted a Manufacturer's Report to the ITC or EPA should read \u00a7 712.30(a)(3). This section allows these persons to submit a copy of the original Report to EPA or to notify EPA by letter of their desire to have this submission accepted in lieu of a current data submission. Complete details of the reporting requirements, including exemptions and a facsimile of the reporting form, are fully described in 40 CFR Part 712. Copies of the form are available from the TSCA Assistance Office at the address which procedes Unit I. B. Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule Listed below are the general reporting requirements of the section 8(d) model rule. 1. Persons who, in the 10 years proceding the date a substance is listed, either have proposed to manufacture, import, or process, or have manufactured, imported, or processed, the listed substance must submit to EPA: A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time the substance is listed. 2. Persons who, at the time the substance is listed, proposed to manufacture, import, or process; or are manufacturing, importing, or processing the listed substance must submit to EPA: a. A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time the substance is listed. b. A list of health and safety studies known to them but not in their possession at the time the substance is listed. c. A list of health and safety studies that are ongoing at the time thesubstance is listed and are being conducted by or for them. d. A list of each health and safety study that is initiated after the date the substance is listed and is conducted by or for them. e. A copy of each health and safety study that was previously listed as ongoing or subsequently initiated and is now complete-regardless of completion date. 3. Persons who, after the time the substance is listed, propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance must submit to EPA: a. A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance. b. A list of health and safety studies known to them but not in their possession at the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance. c. A list of health and safety studies that are ongoing at the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance, and are being conducted by or for them. d. A list of each health and safety study that is initiated after the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance, and is conducted by or for them. e. A copy of each health and safety study that was previously listed as ongoing or subsequently initiated and is now complete-regardless of the completion date. Detailed guidance for reporting unpublished health and safety data is provided in the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule published in the Federal Register of September 15, 1986 (51 FR 32720) (40 CFR 716.60). Also found there are the reporting exemptions. C. Submission of PAIR Reports and Section 8(d) Studies PAIR reports and section 8(d) health and safety studies must be sent to: TSCA Document Processing Center (TS-- 790), Office of Toxic Substances, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. ATTN: (insert either PAIR or 8 (d) Reporting). D. Removal of Chemicals From the Rules Any person who believes that section 8(a) or (d) reporting required by this rule is unwarranted, should promptly submit to the Agency in detail the reasons for that belief. EPA may then remove the substance from the rule, EPA will issue a rule amendment for publication in the Federal Register.IV. Release of Aggregate Data The Agency will follow procedures for the release of aggregate statistics as prescribed in a rule related notice published in the Federal Register of June 13,1983 (48 FR 27041). Included in the notice are procedures for requesting exemptions from the release of aggregate data. Exemption requests concerning the release of aggregate data on any chemical substance must be received by EPA no later than February 14, 1989. V. Economic Analysis A. Preliminary Assessment Information Rule EPA estimates the PAIR reporting cost of this rule is $33,635. To calculate this figure EPA used the TSCA Inventory to generate a list of manufacturers and importers of these substances. Since no companies qualify as small businesses as defined in 40 CFR 712.25(c), EPA expects thirteen firms to report a total of twenty-five reports.

Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule EPA estimates the total reporting costs for establishing section 8(d) reporting requirements for these substances is $19,680. This cost estimate is relatively high, because the Agency is uncertain about the likely number of respondents to the rule. Although EPA has used the best available data to make its economic projections, much of the data is not current. Therefore, EPA intends to overestimate rather than underestimate the reporting burden. Nevertheless, the cost of this rule is low in comparison with its potential benefits. Health and safety studies concerning these substances would improve EPA's ability to identify potential public health and environmental problems with regard to these chemicals.

Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is \"major\"and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This rule is not major because it will not result in an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, an increase in costs or prices, or any of the adverse effects described in the Executive Order. This amendment was not submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review, because the automatic listing of designated substances is provided for in 40 CFR 712.30(c) and 716.18(b)-final rules which have been previously reviewed by OMB under the terms of the Executive Order. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and have been assigned OMB control numbers 2070-0054 and 2070-0004.

AcTION: Final rule. SUMMARY. This final rule prescribes the collection of scheduled and nonscheduled service traffic data from foreign air carriers which provide service to and from the United States * and for the domestic and international operations of United States carriers. These data will augment the charter data already reported by foreign air carriers serving the United States. At the same time, the Department of Transportation, hereafter referred to as DOT or the Department, is establishing a single automated system for collecting traffic data from both U.S. and foreign air carriers. This system: (1) Replaces the collection of U.S. and foreign air carriers' charter data on Form 217; (2.) eliminates most of the burden associated with the recurrent hard-copy submissions of Form 217 and Form 41 \"I\" schedules; (3) reduces the number of traffic and capacity data elements for U.S. air carriers; and (4) through summarization, it simplifies submissions from all reporting air carriers. This more closely aligns the data collected by the, Department with that necessary to fulfill its aviation responsibilities under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. EFFECTIVE DATES: January 1,1989, for foreign air carriers; January 1, 1990 for U.S. air carriers. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald Bright or Richard King, Office of Aviation Information Management, DAI-10, Research and Special Programs Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366.4384, or 366-4375, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Periodic Review The Department plans to review the reporting results experienced under the T-100 data collection system after two years, and to request comments on theeffectiveness of these regulations in achieving the DOT objectives, including whether there are less burdensome reporting methods. These may include some data alternatives, impracticable today, that become possible due to . future technological or other advances, such as the rapidly evolving computer innovations and reservations processes, which may enable air carriers to provide these market-oriented traffic data with much less burden than presently feasible systems. Background The Airline Deregulation Act (Pub. L 95-504, October 24, 1978) (ADA), as amended by the Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-443, October 4, 1984), revised section 329(b)(1) of Title 49 of the United States Code to require the Secretary of Transportation to collect and disseminate information on civil aeronautics and to continue certain data collection activities of the former Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). These activities include continuing the collection and dissemination of data on the number of passengers traveling by air in interstate and overseas (i.e., domestic) air transportation without flight number identification, unless the flight is providing domestic essential air service, in which case flight numbers may be required. In 1970 the CAB adopted Economic Regulation ER-588 to provide for the collection of traffic and capacity data on a service segment basis (a pair of airports served by a single flight stage), from certificated air carriers, with submission of the data on computer magnetic tape or other Automatic Data Processing (ADP) media. A few air carriers did submit modified service segment data on a hard-copy form. Although much of the economic regulation over domestic air transportation was eliminated by the ADA, and other changes have taken place within the aviation industry, the Department continues to need data for nonstop segments and for on-flight markets, but in much less detail than has been reported in Service Segment Data (SSD). Besides Service Segment Data, the Department has collected traffic and capacity data from large certificated'air carriers on nine Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) Form 41 \"T\" (traffic) schedules, and on RSPA Form 217 \"Report of Civil Aircraft Charters Performed by U.S. Certificated and Foreign Air Carriers.\" Other sources of air carrier traffic data have included: foreign trade data collected from importers by the Department of Treasury's CustomsService and from exporters by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Census; and the passenger data collected by the Department of Justice's Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on Form 1-92. This final rule implements a consolidated set of schedules and procedures for reporting all traffic and capacity statistics that both modernizes the process and significantly reduces air carrier burden. The new set of schedules includes only (1) the Schedule T-100(f) for foreign air carriers, and (2) for large U.S. air carriers holding 401 certificate authority, it includes the T-100 Schedule, plus the reduced and redesignated supplemental Form 41 Schedules T-1, T-2 and T-3. The T- 100(f) collects from foreign air carriers for the first time certain limited data related to scheduled service operations in the U.S. market. As a whole, these schedules are known as the T-100 system. For U.S. air carriers, the T-100 system replaces the former Form 41 Schedules T-1(ab,c), T-2, T-3(a,b,c) and T-9, along with the ER-586 Service Segment Data and Form 217 reporting. The heart of the final rule is the T-100 report, which collects nonstop segment data and on- flight market information by equipment type and by service class. In the T-100 system, air carriers are no longer required to submit data on down-line deplanements or to report specific flight numbers for international operations (consistent with the previous elimination of flight numbers in domestic U.S. operations). Much of the information formerly collected on hard- copy Schedules T-1(a,b,c), T-2, and T- 3(a,b,c) will be derived directly from the computerized T-100 detail reports, thus eliminating much of the air carrier burden associated with the preparation of these reports. However, the Department still finds it necessary to retain portions of these supplemental schedules to obtain summary data elements not collected on the-Schedule T-100. Foreign air carriers holding 402 permits, or exemption authority, and using aircraft with a maximum seat capacity of more than sixty seats or a maximum payload capacity of more than 18,000 pounds, will file Schedule T- 100[f. The T-100(f) only applies to nonstop segments and on-flight markets where one or both points are within the U.S. and its possessions. When carriers are granted a foreign carrier permit or exemption authority by the Department, they will also receive a letter from the Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16. 1988 I Rules and Regulations 46285 Office of Aviation Information Management (DOT, RSPA, OAIM) advising them of their reporting obligations. Public Comments Forty-seven public comments were received, including six U.S. air carriers (Air Berlin, American, Delta, Northwest, USAir and United); three trade associations (Aerospace Industries Association of America, Inc. (AIA), Air Transport Association of America (ATA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA)); one embassy (British); four U.S. Government agencies (Department of State-Office of Aviation Programs and Policy, Department of Labor-Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Commerce-U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration and Department of Commerce-Bureau of Economic Analysis); thirty foreign air carriers; one airport (Stewart); one data service firm; and one data user (USAF). Initial Reporting and Phase-in Period Before Reporting Begins Avensa wants a 6 month interval between adoption of a final rule and the first period for which reports are due, and it requested a quarterly report, rather than monthly, particularly for the first year, to ease the transition. Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa and ATA ask that the effective date of the final T-100 rule be delayed for at least 6 months after it is published to provide time for all interested persons and governments to act. Swissair wants foreign carrier reporting delayed at least a year after the final rule is enacted, to allow sufficient time for reprogramming. *The T-100 reporting system will be implemented in two stages over a year. Foreign air carriers will be required to begin reporting on January 1, 1989, while U.S. carriers will begin a year later. The Department feels that several months lead time is sufficient for foreign carriers to design their initial reporting systems to report 11 data items monthly. However, since it is a completely new system for foreign carriers, the Department's limited staff resources can be used to their fullest extent in helping them with any problems they may have before the U.S. carriers are brought on board. Further, the need for data from foreign air carriers is much more critical, since the Department has no data on their scheduled operations in the U.S. market, but does have data for U.S. carriers. The Department does not expect as many implementation problems from U.S. carriers, because they will be modifying existing systems instead of implementing new systems.Finally, the Department feels a year is necessary for assisting foreign carriers, because there are potentially about three times more foreign carriers than U.S. carriers, there could be language problems, the communicating distance is much greater, and not as much is known about their information systems. This approach will produce the greatest benefits and correctly focus the Department's efforts while preserving the flow of U.S. carrier data. Costs and Burdens In general, the U.S. air carriers, did not express significant concerns about cost burdens or about personnel training and procedural changes that may impact them as a result of the T-100 system. Burden did figure more prominently in foreign air carrier responses. United said that the T-100 system for foreign air carriers is long overdue, but Delta is opposed to the T-100 system, which it considers very burdensome to U.S. carriers, and unnecessary; separating tickets by three classes of service instead of the current two sorts would cost almost $200,000 in reprogramming effort alone, it estimates. Delta believes that the revenue data by fare class that are included in the current DOT data collection, \"Passenger Origin-Destination Survey,\" could be used to derive middle cabin data, if DOT will reformat the information already reported. Codes for services such as middle cabin vary so widely that inconsistent data would be the end result; although DOT treats the terms \"middle cabin\" and \"business class\" as though they were interchangeable, they are not, Delta contends. The Air Transport Association (ATA) is concerned about burden. ATA estimates that to implement the new T- 100 system would result in an aggregate cost to its members that would be in excess of $1,000,000. More than 20 U.S. air carriers are members of ATA, including Delta. British Airways (BA) estimated a cost of 180 man-hours per year, plus computer-time and associated costs, which would appear to indicate a cost estimate.of several thousand dollars annually; BA disputes that monthly traffic and capacity data of such detail is necessary to bilateral negotiations, and said DOT has not stated the changed circumstances that would justify imposition of new regulatory burdens. BA said that INS reductions will not reduce these costs, and that the 1-92 is already a \"batching\" document for 1-94. Since British Airways has a large presence in U.S. markets relative to many other foreign air carriers, it maybe expected that only a few other foreign carriers would equal or exceed its burden hours. Air Canada, Air Jamaica, Balair, Condor and Philippines believe that the T-100 system is, contrary to assertions, enormously burdensome and unnecessary. For an annual period, these 5 carriers allege that their burden will increase from 94 forms to 3,056 and for all foreign air carriers reporting would increase from a few hundred to 75,000 forms annually, since they must include scheduled service on the T- 100(f) reports. Air Afrique opposed the T-100 system as an unjustifiable reporting burden, 6 separate reports each month for its 2 weekly flights to the U.S., 72 a year. Canadian Airlines International (CAI) said the proposal is burdensome and redundant; it suggested that such data can be derived from true O&D exchanged quarterly by the U.S. and Canada. CAI said the burdensome, costly T-100(f) would not be offset by I- 92 report reductions, because Canadian carriers do not file the INS data. Caricargo believes its reporting burden will increase; although Form 217 will be eliminated, the 217 data will continue to be reported on T-100(f). Caricargo has no ADP capability, and would submit burdensome manual reports. Finnair considers T-100(f) a burden that is not justified by any need for additional data; the statistics supplied to ICAO and to IATA should be sufficient. If collected, the T-100(f) should be collected quarterly, not monthly, to reduce reporting burden IATA said there would be unnecessary duplication and conflicting data requirements; it suggested that DOT satisfy its data needs through existing IATA data collection programs. IATA said it may be possible for IATA to expand its programs to collect the data that DOT *needs. Japan Air, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and Swissair want DOT to defer the final T-100 rule pending revision of the IATA/ICAO data reporting systems, which they believe will provide market data that will satisfy DOT's needs. Avianca, Mexicana, LAV, LACSA, and VASP also feel that the current ICAO data, or INS data, or data exchanges between governments are adequate, and that the portion of the rulemaking (14 CFR Part 217) applicable to foreign air carriers should be withdrawn. Avianca, Finnair, Japan Air, LACSA, Lufthansa, Mexicana, Swissair and VASP are members of IATA. Aeromexico, TAP and Nippon Cargo believe that burden is not reduced, butFederal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16,1988 / Rules and Regulations 46285 46286 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations will increase. Air France said the T- 100(f) would be very burdensome and opposed the burden as a step backward from the deregulation championed by the U.S. Alitalia believes burdens to foreign carriers are greater than benefits to DOT; ad hoc information should be sufficient. KLM objects to burden, saying much of the requested T-100(f) data is not currently available to KIM, and would have to be generated. Avensa considers the proposal more complex and costly than the present level of reporting and is opposed to the T-100 system. The British Embassy said that the Schedule T-100(f) reporting in the T-100 system would be an unjustified expense and staff burden. The Department is not convinced there would be an overwhelming paper reporting burden, since foreign carriers would not be faced with a manual system if they adopt the modern, efficient computer oriented system that DOT envisions. It is likely that only the smallest foreign air carriers, or those with very little U.S. traffic volume, and hence a very small burden, would elect to submit the manual paper reports. An analysis of 12 foreign carriers' reporting on the Schedule T-100(f) using the June 1988 Official Airline Guide schedules discloses that one of the largest carriers would only have 61 lines of entry for its scheduled service operation in the U.S. market for June using the redesigned Schedule T-100(f) (see next paragraph on the redesigned form). This carrier serves 17 U.S. points from 3 homeland points with 4 different aircraft types and had over 1300 departures. The number of lines would be considerably decreased if the number of points were less and/or the number of different aircraft types were less. A typical small carrier would have only 0 lines of data for 18 departures serving 1 U.S. point from 3 homeland points. The average number of lines of data for the whole group was about 20. This analysis included a cross section of foreign carriers ranked into 12 groups based on scheduled service passenger volumes for calendar year 1987. The groups ranged from under 10,000 passengers (smallest group) to over 2 million passengers (largest group). The reporting for one carrier was analyzed from each group. A review of reporting for several purely charter carriers disclosed that the number of line entries generally would be the same as for Form 217. For those carriers which reported different flight stages, the T-100 would require 50 percent fewer line entires than previously. Twenty lines of data per month for a foreign carrier is not an unreasonableburden in view of the Department's need for the data. Nevertheless, the Department is sensitive to foreign carrier concerns in this area and wants to minimize any potential reporting burden on carriers as much as possible. In this context, the Schedule T-100 has been redesigned to permit 20 lines of data on each form in lieu of multiple submissions on separate forms. In an\"extreme\" case scenario, even the foreign air carriers with the most extensive service in U.S. markets should not expect to submit more than 12 monthly ADP reports each, per annum, or a few hundred lines of data each year. Virtually all foreign carriers except Canadian carriers should realize a substantial decrease in INS reporting burden. Reporting burden is related to the size of a carrier's U.S. operations, and the sophistication of its data retrieval system. We believe most foreign carriers do generate this data for their own business purposes. The burden is to conform their data to the DOT rule, and that burden is justified in light of the benefits to be derived for aviation information collection, use and dissemination. Data collections conducted by ICAO or IATA are not viable alternatives to the T-100 system as some carriers suggest for a many reasons. All foreign carriers are not members of IATA, and all carriers are not reporting to ICAO. Either data base might suffice if the broad picture was the focus. The Department's needs are much more narrow. That is, country to country is the primary focus and if a carrier is not reporting and is the only carrier of that country, then the Department has no data to use. See caption entitled \"Alternative Data Sources\" for more information. The Department does not dispute that there will be some costs to reprogram for U.S. carriers, whether it is approximately $50,000 per carrier as ATA estimates or $200,000 as Delta estimates for its own program, the Department believes in the long run that there will be cost savings since there is less data to report to the Department and INS. The Department conslders as quite reasonable both the potential costs to each foreign carrier of reporting (which are estimated at from $100 to $2,000 per each monthly submission, based upon the size of the carrier's reported operations) and the possible manpower burdens to the air carriers (which are estimated at from I to 20 staff hours per submission). Further, it may be somewhat disingenuous for carriers to suggest that the Department wants thousands of reports each year whenonly one ADP submission or a few pages of a hardcopy report per month is required. The Department has reexamined its need to collect two capacity data elements (available seats and available payload weight) from foreign air carriers. In lieu of requiring that these elements be reported to DOT, the Department will rely, for a trial period. upon existing data sources in the private sector. The Department will generate estimated seat capacity data from the Official Airline Guides (OAG) semiannual seat configuration data voluntarily supplied by the foreign air carriers. Similarly, the Depatment will also estimate available payload weighL If the experiment is only partially successful and private sector data gaps exist for a very few carriers, the Department may employ ad hoc reporting pursuant to 14 CFR 385.27. However, if the private sector data are substantially inadequate, DOT may require foreign air carriers to submit actual capacity data on Form 41 Schedule T-100{f), as originally proposed. Eliminating collection of capacity information reduces the proposed 13 data elements to 11. Several of these data elements are merely labels (namely: Air carrier, report date, origin airport, destination airport, service class, and aircraft type), and only the remaining few (passengers, freight kilograms, and aircraft departures) represent hard data items that foreign carriers must report. Confidentiality and Access to Detail T- 100 System Information Many of the carrier comments dealt with the question whether limited or permanent confidential treatment should be accorded the T-100 system's detailed data by carrier. Comments ranged from urging immediate release to permanent confidentiality. Avensa wants the data collected to be released immediately; it said DOT should require simultaneous disclosure of all individual carrier market data as to a particularly country to each carrier, U.S. or foreign, serving the market American would make the T-100 data of U.S. and foreign carriers public 90 days after the end of the reporting month-or not collect it at all. American does not believe that the data can be kept confidential or that it should be restricted from release to the public. American urged that prompt public dissemination of on-board and on-flight market data of both U.S. and foreign air carriers will assist the nation's airlines in more intelligently distributing their Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46287 capacity and enhancing competition, leading to a more efficient national airline industry. Keeping the data confidential for 3 years will deny airline management the information that allows them to optimize their resources and offer the best service to the traveling public. USAir would permanently preclude the availability of its data to its competitors because it contends that detailed on-board and on-flight market data remain valuable to potential competition even after 36 months. It believes that such data would not be disclosed in an unregulated industry. Aeromexico objects to any disclosure before or after a 3-year period, because it has fundamental problems regarding public disclosure of highly sensitive competitive information. Both Aeromexico and British Airways feel disclosure should be limited to the U.S. government and to parties who have obtained the prior written consent of the foreign air carrier owning the data. Air Canada, Air Jamaica, Balair, Condor and Philippine (oint comment) and Qantas also make the same argument concerning sensitivity and would object to the U.S. releasing their data to other governments. They would prefer an absolute veto power regarding any request for their data. Cathay Pacific also does not want the U.S. to be able to release one foreign government's data to another country. Air Afrique wants assurances the data will be kept confidential for 3 years, with no exceptions. Canadian Airlines International is concerned that sensitive data must be held in strict confidence. KLM said it is anti- competitive for governments to collect and disseminate such sensitive commercial information. Jointly, Avianca, Mexicana, LAV, LACSA, and VASP expressed their concern for adequate safeguards ensuring the confidentiality of data. Japan Air, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and Swissair are concerned with safeguarding sensitive data, but want the U.S. to share the data, to the extent that it is collected, with affected foreign governments with whom the U.S. is involved in bilateral negotiations, and they object to the data being available to any other party, such as their U.S. carrier competitors. Nippon Cargo wants protection for its confidential traffic data, including restrictions on release by an Administrative Law Judge. The carrier said that the proposed regulations provide intolerable latitude for DOT to release Nippon Cargo's data to anyone who can show significant need, if DOT finds it in the public interest.IATA said individual market share data should not be publicly disclosed. Such data are often protected by privacy and confidentiality laws in an airline's own country. There should be no exception to confidentiality unless the foreign government concerned specifically concurs. The Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) said it would prefer to have access to the T-100 data within 12 months. Stewart International Airport said that the final rule should include provisions that assure access to T-100 data for U.S. airports. The Department has decided to keep U.S. carrier data confidential for 3 years with limited access, as proposed. The T- 100 final rule conforms with the DOT policy on \"confidential commercial information\" which provides business submitters of data both notification and an opportunity to object before a disclosure determination is made. Therefore, the Department will take into account the views of the carriers providing data before deciding whether to release it to non-U.S. Government parties requesting access. Certainly, the Department has no intention of prematurely releasing sensitive carrier data to competing carriers or other governments. The objective is to collect limited data that DOT needs, and to provide adequate safeguards while allowing reasonable current releases of aggregate data. The Department intends to continue publishing summary level data, as it has in the past, that are derived from the reported data, such as the Airport Activity Statistics and the Monthly Air Carrier Traffic Statistics. Also, the Department will release country-to-country passenger data without carrier detail, similar to INS data. The Department has established a reasonable period of time during which it will prevent unauthorized access to detail traffic data that the reporting carriers consider to be sensitive commercial information. However, the Department cannot accept that these data should be kept confidential forever, or even after 3 years, because there are public interest benefits in making these data available. A 3-year restricted release period is considered to be adequate protection to the reporting carriers, and to the extent that subsequent release may lead to constructive competition, that is found to be in the public interest The Department assures foreign governments and foreign air carriers that the data carriers submit will not be released prematurely to other airlines or other foreign governments. Further, the reporting carriers' views will be soughtregarding public requests for access to their data, and these views will be accorded significant weight by the Department in its decision whether to release the requested data. The IATA noted that ICAO does not publish on- flight O&D data where only one carrier provides service in a market, which eliminated about one-half of all origin/ destination city pairs. The Department's final rule is more stringent than ICAO (which has no restrictions on disclosure of its annual' Form C \"Traffic by Flight Stage' data and does not publish monopoly markets or release individual carrier data from its quarterly Form B \"On-Flight Origin and Destination\"), .because T-100 detail traffic data by carrier will not be available to the public during the 3-year restricted release period; even summary data in an on-flight market (country-to-country data) will not be available, unless three or more carriers are represented. On balance, the Department's considered opinion is that these regulations provide adequate protection to sensitive commercial information during the 3-year period when release would be most critical and potentially harmful to the interests of the reporting carriers, while still making them public after that restricted release period so that they are available for relevant research and academic studies to enhance and promote healthy competition in the industry. International Reciprocity A number of foreign carriers expressed the common theme that the T-100 data collection system would reduce reliance on current cooperative data endeavors and may impact bilateral negotiation policy on data exchanges. Some foreign carriers believe Congress did not intend for DOT to collect foreign carrier data on a regular, recurrent basis as is proposed, although wide latitude in data collection authority is conferred upon the Department in section 407(a) of the Act. Their opinion is that international principles of comity and reciprocity preclude such unilateral data collection efforts. Some question the legality of the T-100 system under current bilaterals and suggest their governments would forbid their compliance. Further, potential foreign \"retaliation\" was raised as an issue in that some countries that do not already collect data from U.S. carriers may opt to collect equivalent data or more. American expects foreign governments to require similar data of U.S. air carriers. British Airways said the T-10 system is \"pregnant\" with 48288 Federal Register I Vol. 53, No. 221 I Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations international controversy; scheduled data have not been needed for 50 years, except in limited, episodic bilateral negotiations, and many years may pass between negotiations. Therefore, the T- 100(f) is unnecessary and will provoke similar requirements from foreign governments on U.S. air carriers. The British Embassy said the T-100(f) was unnecessary and will lead to the imposition of similar burdens by many other governments; It urges that DOT 'reconsider. Her Majesty's Government does not consider that the case for seeking this information has been made and would therefore question the need for it. Aeromexico says T-100(f) data are needed only on a country-to-country basis, not on an expensive carrier-by- carrier basis, and they are too sensitive to be collected in the form prescribed by DOT. Nippon Cargo said such data should be submitted, if at all, on a bilateral, government-to-government basis; Nippon Cargo considered the requirement to be unprecedented and inconsistent with the principles of international comity and reciprocity. Air Afrique sees no basis or justification for not continuing the reciprocal exchange of market data on a government-to-government basis. Air France said bilateral and competitive implications of reporting such data could require it to obtain detailed instructions from its government. Air France alleges that the T-100 system is a complex change of reporting responsibilities, much of which would be first time requirements for foregin flag carriers. The complex pattern of services operated by Air France to the U.S., or via the U.S. to third countries, would probably be misinterpreted in such reports. Due to the magnitude of potential for competitive damage, the only data Air France would even consider reporting are market data, limited to passenger statistics. Sabena said the U.S./Belgium Air Agreement does not provide for such statistical data; therefore, any request for data by DOT would not be in accord with the Agreement, and it must put the matter before Belgian authorities. Air Indian said DOT must defer to the recently concluded bilateral agreement between the U.S. and India, which provides for a far more detailed exchange of traffic data than DOT proposes. It suggests a waiver from the T-100 system reports in cases where an aviation bilateral agreement provides for an exchange of substantially equivalent detail. Alitalia questioned DOT's authority to collect such data, and questioned the propriety ofattempting to implement the T-100 system in view of the existence of the U.S./Italian bilateral agreement. Alitalia believes such collection should be implemented only after bilateral, consultations and negotiations. Canadian Airlines International said the Canada/U.S. Air Transport Agreement has no provision for Canadian carriers to submit data such as would be reported on Schedule T-100(f). Even if it did, Canadian carriers should be exempted, due to the current informal bilateral exchange of true O&D data. KLM cited Netherlands/U.S. air transport agreement which agreed to minimize the administrative burdens of filing requirements. KLM objects to the T-100 system, believing it is against the interests of competition in international aviation to have governments collect and disseminate market information. Alitalia, Japan Air, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Swissair, Air Canada, Air Jamaica, Balair, Condor, and Philippine Airlines indicated that the unilateral imposition of T-100(f) by DOT may violate existing international aviation agreements. Government-to- government consultations under existing aviation agreements are considered necessary. They believe the data collection is contrary to the intent of Congress, and cited the legislative history qf the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (IATCA) (Pub. L. 96-192, 94 Stat. 38, (1979)). The authority granted by section 407(a) of the FAAct, with respect to foreign air carriers, was to be exercised with great discretion. Some carriers cited statements in that legislative history by former officials of the State Department, CAB and DOT who said the U.S. must use great caution in asking for data from foreign air carriers. The carriers said foreign retaliation is likely, as well as bilateral confrontations. In a separate comment, in addition to the joint statement with other carriers, Lutfhansa said the Department should be aware that, pursuant to its operating authority granted by the Federal Republic of Germany, Lufthansa is precluded from submitting data, such as would be required, without the consent of its Government. Accordingly, Lufthansa might be unable to comply. Further, it believes the T-100 system is contrary to the intent of Congress; Lufthansa said Congress did not intend in section 407(a) \"to authorize a wide- ranging periodic reporting requirement such as is proposed in the NPRM.\" It is clear that section 407(a) of the FAAct authorizes the T-100 system of data collection. The T-100 element for scheduled service traffic as adopted in.this rule are designed to impose the least practicable amount of burden. Also, foreign air carriers have been submitting detail charter flight traffic statistics under DOT/CAB regulations for many years without substantial objections. The Department promulgated this reporting requirement to obtain information enabling it more adequately to meet its statutory requirements in a number of program areas. It is not the intention of the Department to impose an unreasonable burden on foreign carriers or to require a more onerous report which represents a dramatic deviation from those commonly collected from U.S. carriers by foreign aviation authorities, In exercising its authority under section 407(a) of the FAAct to require the T-100 system, the Department conducted a thorough study that concluded that the T-100 system was absolutely essential to the efficient and effective performance of the Department's responsibilities under the law. Several persuasive factors have influenced the Department's decision, not the least of which is the increasing technological sophistication of the air carrier information systems, which tends to facilitate better reporting, at less cost than a munual system. While the T-100 system data may have been somewhat burdensome for larger U.S. or foreign carriers if it could only be submitted manually, the increasing computerization of the aviation industry information systems greatly facilitate the carriers' accumulation of these data at minimal cost. While it is true that DOT and before it, the CAB, has used estimates, it can no longer continue to collect less than it needs, given the current intense competition in the marketplace, the maturity of the industry, and the ability of the air carriers to report more detailed data. The Administration is on record as taking a closer look at the trade between countries to ensure that U.S. trade interests are properly protected in negotiations on air routes and other rights. In order to carry out the U.S. international aviation policy effectively, as required by the Congress and the Administration, the Department requires more precise data as prescribed in the T-100 reporting system. With the cooperation of the U.S. Department of State (DOS), the Department conducted a survey, in May and June 1988, of foreign country traffic reports submitted by U.S. airlines to determine whether the complexity and reporting requirements proposed in the T-100 system represented a more onerous reporting burden or dramatic46288 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, I1988 / Rules and Regulations Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, deviation from the information customarily collected from U.S. carriers by other countries. The survey analyzed the traffic reporting requirements of 20 countries which represented a broad geographical distribution. While most of these countries are among the United States' major aviation trading partners, there was a wide range in the volume of traffic in the United States market. In total, these 20 countries in 1987 represented about two-thirds of the U.S.'s international air passenger volume and almost 60 percent of the U.S. international air freight tonnage. While the reports are quite diverse in terms of content, the survey concluded that the T-100 system is well within the limits of common international reporting practices, and is by no means as extensive as many of the reports that U.S. carriers are required to file abroad. Of the 20 countries, only 2 do not have periodic traffic reporting requirements. Two other countries' requirements are slightly less than those of the T-100. Of the remaining 16 country reports, all have one or more significant features which make them as detailed and in most cases more extensive or budensome than the T-100 system. For example, 13 have daily or per flight reporting requirements. Like the T-100 system, two provide for monthly reporting, while one is an annual report. Eight require two or more different reports. While 15 of the 16 reports have more data elements than the T-100 system, we have decided to reduce the number of data elements on the Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) from 13 to 11. Three of the foreign governments even require financial reporting of U.S. carrier operations. Some countries, that do not require detailed traffic reports, require that U.S. air carriers submit copies of each flight passenger manifest and copies of all airway bills and tickets, from which the government has the ability to compile exact traffic and revenue statistics. Therefore, the Department has concluded that the T-100 system is not unduly budensome to foreign carriers and that it is well within the scope of the types of data that foreign countries commonly collect form U.S. air carriers. Need for Aviation Data by Other U.S. Government Agencies The United States' Department of State-Office of Aviation Programs and Policy (DOS) believes DOT should collect data on passenger traffic originating or destined for foreign points \"behind\" or \"beyond\" those homeland points served by non-stop flights to/ from the U.S DOS said.carriersoperating directly to the U.S. appear, incorrectly, to carry a much larger share of total traffic than do those serving points via connections at intermediate stops; thus, SAS appears to carry most of the traffic from Scandinavia, while U.S. carriers serving Scandinavia as a beyond point through, for instance, connections in London, do not appear to carry Scandinavian traffic. DOS also suggested that DOT require reporting in the T-100 system of traffic to \"behind\" or \"beyond\" points involving international air cargo services. The U.S. Department of Commerce- U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) opposes loss of citizenship on Form 1-2 and flight number detail from Service Segment Data, saying that the data needs of other agencies require consideration. It may be easier for DOT to collect a few supplemental data items from air carriers to meet their needs than for USTTA to create a whole new air carrier data collection. The U.S. Department of Commerce- Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) wants the number of U.S. citizens on foreign air carriers, the number of foreign citizens on U.S. air carriers, and the total number of U.S. citizens traveling by air. These data are used in computing the U.S. balance of payments, gross national product, and U.S. input- output account. -The U.S. Department of Labor-Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) International Price Program (IPP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are current users of DOT data for their air passenger fare price indexes. The IPP uses Form 1-92 data to calculate the balance-of- payments expenditure weights for the export air passenger fares indexes, and as the sampling frame for the foreign carrier and import air passenger fares series. Since BLS' programs need U.S. resident and alien passenger counts for U.S. and foreign gateway port pairs in order to calculate accurate balance-of- payment weighing factors, it strongly opposes loss of citizenship data. BLS also asks for data that DOT did not porpose in the T-100 system-a fourth fare class (coach discount), in addition to first class, business and coach. BLS has found it difficult to obtain information about the fare class seating distributions for foreign carriers, and asks DOT to extend its reporting of on- flight markets connected to a U.S. gateway to include points beyond the homeland of the foreign carrier. The United States Air Force (USAF) said the T-100 proposal posed no problems for its military Airlift Command (MAC) ratemaking, butexpressed concern that DOT should not futher reduce the Form 41. The Department is acutely aware of the importance of the DOT aviation data bases to other Federal Government agencies. However, with the exception of two service class codes (N and R) collected specifically for the Department of Defense-United States Air Force (USAF) with the concurrence of OMB, the rule provides for only the data needed by the Department. Reporting Period Avensa, Qantas and Swissair request 45 days following the subject month, in which to submit the form 41 Schedule T- 100(f) data. Qantas believes that, in view of the volume of data requested by the Department, the processing time needed to accurately produce data in the format specifically required, and the time required to deliver the data to the Department, the 30 day filing requirement is unreasonably short. Finnair wants the T-100(f) data to be submitted quarterly, similar, to the reporting period prescribed for Form 217. The Department understands the carriers' desire for a longer interval to submit the report. Once the reporting system is in place, we feel the carriers will be able to submit the data to the Department within 30 days. The majority of carriers are meeting the 30 day deadline on the Form 217 report. Carriers are able to report within 30 days without undue difficulties, since many carriers have traffic data systems that provide fully-edited, final traffic data to management within 5 to 15 days after the end of the reporting month. The comment suggesting an increase in the reporting period, from monthly to quarterly, is not a viable alternative. The first month's data of the quarter would be several months old when the Department receives it. This is to much of a lag for the Department to keep on top of the changes taking place in the scheduled service sector. Collection of T-100 Data by Cabins (First, Middle, Coach) The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposed adding a middle cabin (business class) category to the existing data elements (first class and coach) collected from Group III U.S. air carriers; that is, these carriers would report passengers enplaned and transported, and available seats by these classes. American believes both foreign and U.S. carriers should identify three separeate cabins (classes) for domestic and international routes. On the other hand, Delta opposes the T-100 proposal1988 / Rules and Regulations 46289 46290 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations to collect middle cabin data, and supports simply continuing the first class and coach class data collection. The ability to gauge the increasing significance of middle (business) cabin service within the international sector of the industry is an important feature of the T-100 collection system. The Department historically has needed U.S. carrier data by cabin, and continues to need such data to make decisions and to analyze the relative costs and revenues of U.S. air carriers and their foreign competitors. Foreign carriers are not required to report any traffic statistics by cabin, or passenger revenue data. Because business class fares are more extensively used in the air carriers' international operations (versus domestic operations), the Department has decided that business class, along with first class and coach class cabins, will be reported by Group III air carriers in the international sector only. Also, the Department has decided that no cabin distinctions are needed for domestic operations of any air carrier group. To the extent that the Department needs domestic traffic data segregated into first class, middle (business class) and coach cabin categories, it will rely upon ad hoc requests as provided by the authority in 14 CFR 385.27. In summary, Group III U.S. air carriers will report first, coach and middle (business class) cabin data only for international operations. All domestic operations and the international operations of Groups I and II U.S. air carriers will be reported by summarizing the three classes and reporting them on Schedule T-100 in the total category provided for Available Seats, Passengers Transported, and Passengers Enplaned. Because of the many innovative air fares'developed since deregulation, and the heavy use of discount.air fares, the Department's definition of fare classes (first class, coach, etc.) may very well be outmoded for statistical purposes. The Department plans ro review the fare class definitions and propose any necessary revisions or additions in the traffic and revenue requirements commensurate with the Department's needs (Regulatory Agenda, 53 FR 14040, RIN 2137-ABOO). Form 41 Revenue Passenger Data by Fare Class In an issue not a part of the T-100 system, the Department proposed in the NPRM to combine the two passenger revenue categories (Accounts 3901.1 First Class and 3901.2 Coach) on Form 41 Schedule P-1.2 \"Statement of Operations\" into a single revenueaccount, \"3901 Transport Revenues-- Passenger.\" Based upon further analysis, the Department has decided to retain Accounts 3901.1 and 3901.2 on Schedule P-1.2 and to require the reporting of these data only for international operations of Group III air carriers. In all other instances, a single category of passenger revenue is reported in Account 3901. However, U.S. air carriers may continue to report first class and coach revenue data, if they conclude that such voluntary reporting would be less burdensome than changing their existing financial reporting system. Classes of Service On a T-100 issue, American wants foreign carriers to have the same charter and scheduled service categories (service classes) as required from U.S. carriers. Although IATA suggests its system as a supplement to or a substitute for aspects of the T-100 system, the Department has not found any alternative data collection system from IATA, ICAO, or any other source, that could substitute for the T-100 system. IATA said its ODS (On-Flight Origin and Destination Traffic Statistics) system is similar in most respects to the T-100 system proposed by DOT, except that it contains only scheduled service data, and IATA does not collect capacity data (such as tons and seats available for sale) by segments (city pairs). IATA's ODS system does have passengers segregated into cabins (First, Business, and Economy). The Department recognizes the merit in American Airlines's position that U.S. and foreign carrier data service classes should be aligned as closely as possible for scheduled or charter service operations, and has adopted uniform service class codes for both. INS Reports Stewart International Airport wants DOT to collect citizenship data or to ensure that INS Form 1-92 is continued because access to such data is critical to Stewart's promotional efforts to attract more airlines and develop a full pattern of service, including scheduled service airlines. USDOC-USTTA wants \"1-92\" data continued, or replicated in the T-100 reports, so it will have citizenship and flight number data. These data are essential to USTTA's programs to promote tourism. USDOC-BEA requests that citizenship data be transferred from the 1-92 data collection to the T-100 reporting system. BEA programs rely on these data. USDOL-BLS wants INS Form 1-92 continued, because it needs citizenshipdata for the International Price Program (IPP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI). American Airlines is opposed to discountinuing the submission of the INS Form 1-92 to INS. It said these reports are necessary to help identify the U.S. citizen/alien distribution for the various on-off (on-flight market) segments of international journeys. Understanding this mix is important to a successful international marketing effort and should be protected or enhanced rather than potentially reduced, according to American Airlines. TAP is concerned INS may not eliminate 1-92 data, and it believes it will have to submit duplicate data .to INS and to DOT. The Department cannot provide any assurances as to INS actions regarding its data collections on INS Forms 1-92 and 1-94. Whether these data systems will continue unchanged, or will be greatly reduced, must be decided by INS (although we note that INS has informed DOT of its continuing efforts to reduce the number of data elements in these data collections and that 1-92 data are no longer required by them, except as batch control totals). The Department has identified the data required by its programs. Except for citizenship data, the T-100 system virtually eliminates the Department's need for INS data, Reporting of \"Freedom\" Traffic Northwest suggested that the T-100 should divide traffic between locally enplaned and through traffic. Northwest views the lack of this data as a concession to foreign airlines' that all traffic to and from the homeland point is \"third\" and \"fourth freedom\". The term \"freedom\" refers to various transit or transport rights existing and negotiated among sovereign nations. The \"Freedoms of the Air\" deal with the passage of aircraft within the airspace of a nation; for example, the first freedom is the freedom of an air carrier to fly across the airspace of another country without landing; the second freedom provides for non-traffic technical and refueling stops; the third freedom regards transport of traffic between an air carrier's homeland and a foreign country; the fourth freedom regards transport of traffic from a foreign county to the air carrier's homeland; the fifth freedom regards transport of traffic between two foreign countries, neither of which is the air carrier's homeland; and the sixth freedom is a traffic right that is exercised from behind the air carrier's homeland gateway. The provisions of this final rule are a reflection of the Department's data Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46291 needs rather than a concession to foreign air carriers. Where the Department needs to segregate locally enplaned and through traffic into the various \"freedom\" categories, it will. DOS said DOT should collect passenger traffic originating or destined for foreign points \"behind\" or \"beyond\" those served by non-stop flights to/from the U.S. Its concerns also extended to \"behind\" and \"beyond\" cargo traffic, as well. DOS said a strong U.S. negotiating posture depends in part on having accurate information on traffic volume to and from the U.S., and the improved data collection procedures to account for \"sixth freedom\" traffic is of paramount concern. Both the current data and the proposed T-100 system are distorted, because connecting traffic from third countries is not well documented, and the relative importance of such countries to the U.S. as traffic generators and actual market shares by air carriers are not apparent. The Department has decided that it will not separately collect In the T-100 system data for city-pairs behind a foreign homeland or for city-pairs beyond a third country to another country. Although these behind and beyond homeland data by city pairs will not be separately reported, these data will be included with the homeland data and reported as traffic enplaned or deplaned at the homeland. The Department does require all U.S.-related market data to be reported for any nonstop market that includes a U.S. airport. The data which are not reported by foreign carriers are, for instance, homeland-to-homeland markets. In its decision not to specifically identify such behind and beyond markets, the Department took into consideration the fact that it is extremely rare for other countries to collect such information. Foreign Carrier Available Capacity by Aircraft Type and Airport Lufthansa argues that available capacity data cannot be prepared on a meaningful basis, because only partial segments (to and from the U.S., involving homeland Germany) on a flight are reported. Such piecemeal capacity data would be misleading and useless, Lufthansa believes. Swissair wants to report the typical seating pattern of the relevant aircraft type, rather than the slightly varying number of seats available for sale. Thus, Swissair would prefer to report available capacity, if at all, as a standard number of seats for each aircraft type-and asks to report all required traffic data by city-pairs, as opposed to the required airport-pairs.As stated under another caption, 'the Department has re-evaluated its proposal to collect foreign air carrier available capacity information. Accordingly, data on the number of available seats and available payload weight for sale by aircraft type and flight segment will not be reported to DOT. Instead, the Department will rely upon private sector data, and to the extent that the Official Airline Guides or other private sector data are not sufficient, may rely upon ad hoc reporting, under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27. Other Comments Data Base Products was in favor of the T-100 system, but said DOT would make a serious policy mistake to restrict public availability of the T-100 data for 3 years, since in a deregulated environment, immediate public access to data should improve market efficiencies and ensure the benefits of deregulated competition to consumers. Air Berlin asked to be excused from T-100 reporting. Canadian Airlines International asked for a waiver from the T-100(f) reporting, citing voluntary exchanges of true O&D data between the U.S. and Canada; they also noted they are not required to file INS Form 1-92 data. While Data Base Products' view is understandable, the provisions in this rule, as further explained under the caption on confidentiality, represent the appropriate balance in the Department's judgment between the legitimate security needs of the data providers and the public benefits from disclosure of the data. Air Berlin will not report data under the T-100 reporting system, because its current operations are not performed pursuant to a 401 certificate, and thus do not meet the reporting criteria of the rule. Regarding Canadian carrier data, the Department still requires the T-100 system while fully aware of the benefits of the exchanges of true O&D data with Canada. Reporting of Code Sharing, Wet Leases, Part Charters and Blocked Space The Department will use ad hoc reporting under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27 to collect data for joint services, rather than complicating the regular monthly reporting for a few international arrangements dealing with code sharing, wet leases, part charters and blocked space agreements. Ad hoc reporting will only be used if additional data is needed. That is, there could be occasions where the Department does not need any additional data on the joint service agreement. When ad hoc reporting is used it will normally be on an annual basis with sufficient lead timefor the carrier to make the necessary adjustments in its information system to provide the data at a minimum cost and burden. Collection of Military Charter Data by Aircraft Type The Department's objective is to collect only the data required for its programs. In addition, the Department will collect data required for the programs of other Federal agencies, if OMB has determined that it is less burdensome for the Department to collect for those agencies and has designated DOT as the central collection point. The Department only needs summary data on military flights by U.S. air carriers for industry analysis purposes (for instance, total revenue passengers enplaned on Schedule T-1 and total aircraft departures in the Airport Activity Statistics on Schedule T-3). Therefore, an overall military summary service class (V, Nonscheduled) is adequate for the Department's needs, However, in a prior rulemaking (50 FR 232), the Department of the Air Force (USAF) specified a need for the breakout by aircraft type of military charter data on Schedule T-1 by Service Class Codes N (Nonscheduled Military Passenger/Cargo) and R (Nonscheduled Military Cargo). In the proposed rule, the Department requested USAF to reaffirm its need for service class codes N and R. The USAF submitted a statement in the docket which indicated that the Department should continue collecting separate military service classes (N and R). The Department interprets the USAF statement as being a request for data collection that is subject to the provisions in 5 CFR 1320.15. Therefore, with OMB approval, the Department will continue to require air carriers to segregate service class codes N and R in reporting nonscheduled data on Form 41 Schedule T-1, rather than reporting an overall summary service class (V, Nonscheduled), as proposed in the NPRM. Traffic Data Collection (Foreign Air Carriers) RSPA Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) Prior to this final rule, foreign air carrier recurrent reporting of traffic data to the Department was limited to charter operations to and from the United States. Charter traffic flow information was reported quarterly to the Department by foreign air carriers on RSPA Form 217 \"Report of Civil Aircraft Charters Performed by U.S. Certificated and Foreign Air Carriers.\" These charter 46292 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations data are required to assess the impact of charter traffic on specific international markets for use in international aviation negotiations, evaluating foreign air carrier requests for operating authority to serve U.S. points, and monitoring international fares and rates. In addition to Form 217, the Department has used the Immigration and Naturalization Service's INS Form 1-92 \"Aircraft Vessel Report\" and freight data obtained from the Department of Commerce to estimate foreign air carriers' scheduled operations activity. Form 1-92 has provided arriving and departing passenger count data at gateways, and has been used as a measure of the scheduled passenger traffic for such points. Both U.S. and foreign air carriers, excluding Canadian carriers, operating to and from the U.S. are required to file INS Form 1-92. The Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census \"Airborne Trade\" data provided a similar measure for freight data, although these statistics combine sheduled and charter traffic, and a differentiation between the two services has not been possible, although DOT needs this data. Under the provisions of the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, the Secretary of Transportation is charged with developing an international air transportation negotiating policy which includes, among other responsibilites: (1) The strengthening of the competitive position of United States air carriers to at least assure equality with foreign air carriers; {2) The freedom for U.S. air carriers and foreign air carriers to offer fares and rates corresponding with consumer demand; (3) The fewest possible restrictions on charter air transportation; (4) The maximum degree of multiple and permissive international authority for United States air carriers so that they will be able to respond quickly to shifts in market demand; (5) The elimination of operational and marketing restrictions to the greatest extent possible; (6) The provision of opportunities for foreign air carriers to increase their access to United States points if exchanged for benefits of similar magnitude for United States carriers or the traveling public with permanent linkage between rights granted and rights given away; and (7) The elimination of discrimination and unfair competition. In carrying out this mandate in the highly competitive international marketplace, the Department operates mainly within the framework of bilateral aviation agreements which existbetween the United States and most foreign countries. In evaluating existing and proposed changes to bilateral air service agreements, a determination is made of the air transportation commerce between the U.S. and foreign countries. Examples of traffic data elements needed to make these evaluations include passenger and freight traffic volume. Within today's continuously changing competitive environment, these determinations have become an item of critical importance in U.S. aviation relations with foreign governments. This environment has created an awareness of the importance of the availability of timely and accurate aviation information in discovering and responding to short-notice changes in the marketplace. In addition to timeliness and accuracy, the Department has also identified certain inherent problems with the data available for estimating foreign air carrier scheduled traffic flows tolfrom the United States. In estimating traffic for scheduled service operations, the Department has been forced to use diverse and somewhat incompatible data sources, such as INS Form 1-92 data, even though such sources were not always directly responsive to program needs. Such data are used to supplement the foreign air carrier charter data reported on Form 217. Because Form I- 92 is an INS, not a DOT, data collection, the Department has not had the flexibility to quickly revise the data collected in order to respond to changing information needs. In reviewing its overall aviation responsibilities and related data requirements, the Department has concluded that it may increase the reliability of its international aviation information data base while mitigating foreign carrier reporting burden. To accomplish this, the Department is prescribing a Schedule T-100{f) reporting system for foreign air carriers. This system is a minimum-level uniform nonstop segment and on-flight market data collection system that is compatible with the Schedule T-100 reporting system for U.S. air carriers that may reduce their reporting burden- hours by 48%. By comparison, foreign air carriers are required to report on a monthly basis only 11 of the total 24 data items that are reported by Group III U.S. air carriers. The 11 items fall into 3 major informational groupings: Service Pattern Information: Carrier code, Report date, Origin airport code, Destination airport code, and Service class code;Nonstop Segment Information: Aircraft type code, Revenue aircraft departures performed, Total revenue\" passengers transported and Revenue freight transported; and On-Flight Market Information: Total revenue passengers in market, and Total revenue freight in market. The 11 items encompass scheduled, charter and nonscheduled operations. Foreign air carriers do not separate behind homeland traffic from homeland traffic since for the purpose of the T- 100(f) report, traffic is considered to enplane or deplane at the first or last homeland point reportable on the segment or market report. The above data base closes critical data gaps for scheduled passenger and scheduled cargo services affecting the U.S. that are operated by foreign air carriers. While providing for data collections more consistent with current needs, the Department also is taking advantage of technological innovations in computer reporting and processing capabilities to reduce carrier burden. Under the T-100 system, foreign air carriers are able to (and are urged to) report their traffic data by using ADP media. The Schedule T-100(f) automated reporting system is designed to be an essential part of the Department's integrated traffic and capacity reporting system. Adoption of the T-I00 system eliminates the need for foreign and U.S. air carriers to report their charter operations on Form 217. Except for citizenship data, it also virtually eliminates the Department's need for INS Form 1-92. Traffic And Capacity Data Collection (U.S. Air Carriers) RSPA Form 41 Schedule T-10W System The Department is continuously reviewing its aviation information requirements and data collection activities to ensure that the data collected are sufficient to meet the Department's program needs at a minimum of reporting burden to the affected air carriers. To this end, various data collection alternatives, such as ADP media instead of hardcopy formats, were considered. The Department identified the Form 41 traffic and capacity system as an area for burden reduction. During the course of its review, the Department reassesged the specific traffic and capacity data it requires for meeting its program responsibilities and concluded that, beyond the data now collected and used, it requires a standard aircraft size cutoff of 18,000 pounds of available Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46293 capacity payload; a limited amount of traffic information from foreign air carriers; and some additional information on service classes operated by those large U.S. certificated air carriers reporting as Group III air carriers. Essentially, the Department is prescribing a reporting system, hereafter referred to as the RSPA Form 41 Schedule T-100 Reporting System (T- 100 system), to collect scheduled, nonscheduled, and charter traffic and capacity data from both U.S. and foreign air carriers that is assembled into a uniform data base. This new system eliminates most of the burden from filing the current Form 41 \"T\" schedules for U.S. air carriers. Of the Form 41 \"T\" schedules, only Schedule T-8 \"Report of Domestic All-Cargo Operations\" remains unchanged. Schedule T-8 is still needed to provide critical financial and traffic information on domestic all-cargo operations. This final rule incorporates the Form 217 charter reporting into the T-100 system. This new system consists of the Form 41 Schedule T-100 and three simplified supplemental schedules for U.S. air carriers. The supplemental schedules would collect miscellaneous data not provided for in the basic Schedule T-100, such as \"Aircraft Days Assigned to Service-Carrier's Equipment\". On the Schedule T-100, U.S. air carriers would re'port nonstop segment and on-flight market information. On the new supplemental schedules (T-1, T-2, and T-3), U.S. air carriers would report data for domestic passenger and cargo charters, domestic scheduled all-cargo, and domestic or international military charters excluded from the Schedule T-100. The T-100 system also replaces the current Service Segment Data collection system. Under the T-100 system, Group 11 U.S. air carriers submit a maximum of 24 data items (only 18 data items for carriers other than Group III), representing a significant reduction in the 49 SSD data elements previously collected. Collection of downline deplaning data is also eliminated. Burden reductions also result from the elimination of data elements that are no longer required due to the summarization of data by on-flight market without regard to intermediate stops, and summarizing data by nonstop segment without regard to international flight numbers. The Department has not required flight numbers to be reported in the domestic entity since 1984; Overall, the traffic and capacity data' elements reported by U.S. air carriers are reduced by 61% and the burden hours are reduced by 48%. The Group IIIU.S. carriers have 24 Schedule T-100 data items (18 for other U.S. air carriers that do not report multiple cabin data- First, Coach and Middle) that are reported in 3 categories: Service Pattern Information: Carrier entity code, Report date, Origin airport code, Destination airport code, and Service class code; Nonstop Segment Information: Aircraft type code, Revenue aircraft departures scheduled (520), Revenue aircraft departures performed (510), Available capacity payload (270), Available seats--first cabin (311), Available seats-middle (business) cabin (313), Available seats-coach (312), Revenue passengers transported- Frist Cabin (133), Revenue passengers Transported-middle (business) cabin (133), Revenue passengers transported- coach (132), Revenue freight transported (237), Revenue mail transported (239), Revenue aircraft hours (ramp-to-ramp) (630), Revenue aircraft hours (airborne) (610); and On-Flight Market Information: Total revenue passengers enplaned in market-First cabin (111), Total revenue passengers enplaned in market-middle (business) cabin (113), and revenue passengers enplaned in market-coach (112), Total revenue freight enplaned in market (217), and Total revenue mail enplaned in market (219). The T-100 system eliminates the filing of much of the data now reported on Form 41 Schedules T-1(a,b,c), T-2, and T-3(a,b,c,). However, there are two areas in domestic service not covered by the Schedule T-100 detail reports: (1) Domestic all-cargo operations, and (2) domestic charter operations. Also, domestic and international military charter data are not collected in the Form 41 Schedule T-100 reports. To provide statistics needed for assessing total air carrier operations, the Department is prescribing revised Schedules T-1 and T-3 for carriers to report only the data elements needed for these operations that are not otherwise reported. Schedule T-2 will also be retained, in part, to collect miscellaneous factors by aircraft type not required in the detail T-100 schedule. In general, the traffic and capacity statistical elements previously reported on the eliminated hard-copy Form 41 schedules that are still needed will be submitted in computer media, such as magnetic tape or \"floppy\" diskette. T- 100 data entry forms (paper) will be provided for those U.S. carriers without any computer capability that obtain a \"hardship\" waiver to submit data in noncomputer media. The Department plans to produce computer outputs fromthe T-100 data system in essentially the same formats as are now available in the hardcopy Form 41 \"T\" schedules. Thus, the Department is simplifying and modernizing data collection procedures to eliminate even minor duplicate data collections from air carriers, resulting in substantial burden reductions in terms of reports submitted by carriers. Alternatives Data Sources As previously stated in response to the IATA public comment, the Department has considered various alternatives to the T-100 system. In reviewing its requirements for RSPA Form 41 Schedules T-100, T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-100(f) data, the Department was unable to identify any viable alternative data sources. In this research, the Department investigated the possible use of alternative international data sources to determine whether the information contributed by member carriers of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the data collections of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) could be used by the Department, in whole or in part, in lieu of the T-100 system. The Department compared these potential alternatives with its data needs in areas involving content, frequency and cbverage and found that these data did not meet its requirements. As a result, the Department has decided that reliance upon nonair carrier entities as suppliers of data (such as IATA or ICAO) would present insurmountable problems for the Department, such as the timely availability of data, and therefore the T- 100 system has been designed as a stand-alone system for the Department only. Executive Orders 12291, 12612 and 12630, Regulatory Flexibility Act, Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Federalism, and Takings This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it has been determined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be no increase in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local governments, agencies or geographical regions. Furthermore, this proposed rule would not adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, and will enhance the ability' of United States based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or exports markets. This proposed regulation would result in a 46294 Federal Register /Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 I Rules and Regulations net reduction in reporting burden. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. This regulation is significant under the Department's Regulatory Policies and, Procedures, dated February 26.1979, because it involves important Departmental policies. Its economic impact should be minimal and a full regulatory evaluation is not required. It is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendments would affect only large U.S. certificated and large foreign air carriers. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12630, and it has been determined that it does not pose the risk of a taking of constitutionally protected private property. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from I hour to 20 hours per monthly response, depending upon the size of the carriers' operations subject to the reporting requirement, with an average of 7 hours per monthly response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to: Director, Office of Aviation Information Management, DAI-1, U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

Blank copies of Schedule T- 10(f) are available from the Office of Aviation Information Management, DAI-1, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20590. APPENDIX to Section 217.10 of 14 CFR Part 217--structions to Foreign Air Caniers for Reporting Traffic Data on Form 41 Schedule T-100(O (a) General instructions. (1 Description. Form 41 Schedule T-10(f) provides flight stage data covering both passenger/cargo and all cargo operations in scheduled and nonscheduled services. The schedule is used to report all flights which serve points in the United States or its territories as defined in this part. (2) Applicability. Each foreign air carrier holding a 402 permit, or exemption authority, and operating aircraft with seating configurations of more than sixty seats and/ or available capacity (payload of passengers and cargo) of more than 18,000 pounds shall file Form 41 Schedule T-100(f). Reference to 402 is to section 402 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (FAAct). (3) Address for filing reports: Data Administration Division, DAI-2, Room 4125, Office of Aviation Information Management, Research and Special ProgramsAdministration, U.S. Department of. Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. (4) Filing period. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) shall be filed monthly and is due at the Department thirty (30) days following the end of the reporting month to which the data are applicable. (5) Number of copies. A single set of legible Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) data and certification shall be submitted. (6) Foreign air carrier certification. Each foreign air carrier shall submit a certification statement (illustrated at the end of this Appendix) as an integral part of each monthly Schedule T-100f), as prescribed in \u00a7 217.5 of this part. .(7) Alternative filing on Automatic Data Processing (ADP) media. Foreign air carriers are encouraged to use ADP equipment to reduce the manual effort of preparing Schedule T-100(f). Foreign air carriers may use the floppy disk medium. ADP submission requirements for floppy discs are prescribed in paragraph (f). (b) Preparation of Form 41 Schedule T- 100(f): (1) Explanation of nonstop segments and on-flight markets. There are two basic categories of data, one pertaining to nonstop segments and the other pertaining to on-flight markets. For example, the routing (A-B-C-D) consists of three nonstop segment records A- B, B-C, and C-fD, and six B-C, B-D, and C-D. (2) Guidelines for reporting a nonstop segment. A nonstop segment is reported when one or both points are in the United States or its territories. These data shall be merged with that for all of the other reportable nonstop operations over the same segment. Nonstop segment data must be summarized by aircraft type, under paragraph h)1), and class of service. paragraph (g)(1)(v). (3) Rules for determining a reportable on- flight market On-flight markets are reportable when one or both points are within the U.S., with the following exceptions: (i) Do not report third country to U.S. markets resulting from flight itineraries which serve a third country prior to a .homeland point in flights passing through the homeland bound for the U.S.; and (ii) do not report U.S. to third country markets resulting from itineraries serving third country points subsequent to a homeland point in flights outbound from the U.S. and passing through the homeland. In reporting data pertaining to these two exceptions, the traffic moving to or from the U.S. relating to the applicable prior or subsequent third countries (referred to as \"behind\" or \"beyond\" traffic) is to be combined with the applicable foreign homeland gateway point, just as though the traffic Were actually enplaned or deplaned at the homeland gateway, without disclosure of the actual prior or subsequent points. Applicable flights are illustrated in examples (6) and (7) under paragraph (c). (c) Examples of flights. Following are some typical flight itineraries that show the reportable nonstop segment and on-flight market entries. The carrier's homeland is the 46296 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations key factor in determining which on-flight foreign country.

(c) The reported data shall be compiled as aggregates of the basic data elements and service classes prescribed in sections 19-4 and 19-5 of this part. E. A new Appendix is added to \u00a7 241.25 to read as follows: Appendix to Section 241.25 of CFR Part 241- Instructions to U.S. Air Carriers for Reporting Traffic and Capacity Data on Form 41 Schedules T-100, T-1, T-2, and T-3 (a) Applicability. Each large U.S. air carrier that holds a 401 certificate and operates aircraft designed with a maximum capacity of more than 60 seats or a maximum payload capacity of more than 18,000 pounds must file these schedules. A carrier that conducts all of its operations under section 418 of the Act (all-cargo certificates) does not file. Each air carrier will be advised of its reporting requirements by letters of instruction from the Office of Aviation Information Management (OAIM). (b) Schedules, frequency, and entity: (1) Schedule T-100, Monthly. Schedule T- 100 collects summarized flight stage data by reporting entity as follows: International entity reports cover scheduled and nonscheduled passenger/cargo and all cargo services. Domestic entity reports cover passenger/cargo operations in scheduled services only. The term entity refers to the geographic location designator prescribed by the Department in section 19-5(c)(2) of this part, such as, for instance, domestic entity air transport operations as distinguished from international entity air transport operations. (2) Schedule T-1, Monthly. For the domestic entity, Schedule T-1 collects summary statistics on domestic all-cargo operations, and on both civilian and military charters. For international entities, it collects summary information on military charter operations only. (3) Schedule T-2, Quarterly. Schedule T-2 collects summary information for all reporting entities. It contains data elements for which there are no corresponding details in T-100 reports. It is submitted for each operating entity prescribed by the Department for each air carrier.(4) Schedule T-3, Quarterly. For the domestic entity. Schedule T-3 collects summary statistics on all-cargo operations and on both civilian and military charters; and for international entities, it collects summary information on military charter operations only. Further, only the U.S. airport must be identified for international military charter operations, and airports outside the U.S. are summarized as a one-line total, coded \"NON\" in lieu of the airport code, since international military charters are not reported in the detail international Schedule T-100 data. (c) Format of reports: (1) Automatic Data Processing (ADP) magnetic tape. Refer to paragraph (f) below for instructions pertaining to mainframe and minicomputer reporting. The Department will issue \"Reporting Directives\" to make necessary technical changes to these T-100 instructions, where no policy issues are involved that would require a new rulemaking, or where only a few air carriers are affected. (2) Microcomputer diskette. (i) Optional specification. If an air carrier desires to use its personal computers (PC's). rather than mainframe or minicomputers to prepare its data submissions, the following specifications for filing data on diskette media apply: (ii) Reporting medium. Microcomputer ADP data submission of T-100 information must be on IBM-compatible floppy disk, including diskettes, floppy disks, or flexible disks. The particular type of acceptable minidisk is on 5% inch, double-sided/double-density, with a capacity of approximately 360,000 characters of data (360K). Carriers wishing to use a different ADP procedure must obtain written approval to do so from the Director, OAIM, under the waiver provisions in section 1-2 of this part. Requests for approval to use alternate methods must disclose the proposed data transmission methodology. Refer to paragraph (k) for microcomputer record layouts. (iii) Microcomputer file characteristics. The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks (\" \")and separated by a comma (,) and numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma. The data is identified by its juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore, each record must contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. Personal computer software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC are capable of producing files in this format. (d) Filing data for reports. The reports- must be received at DOT within 30 days following the end of each reporting period. Refer to \u00a7 241.22 of this part for more information on date requirements. (e) Address for filing: Data Administration Division. DAI-20, Room 4125, Office of Aviation Information Management, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. (f0 ADP format for magnetic tape: (1) Magnetic tape specifications. IBM compatible 9-track EBCDIC recording. Recording density of 6250 or 100 bpi. The order of recorded information is: Volume label. Header label. Data records. Trailer label. (g) External tape label information. Carrier name. Report date. File identification. Carrier address for return of tape reel. (h) Standards. It is the policy of the Department to be consistent with the American National Standards Institute and the Federal Standards activity in all data processing and telecommunications matters. It is our intention that all specifications in this application are in compliance with standards promulgated by these organizations. (i) Volume, header, and trailer label formats: (1) Use standard IBM label formats. The file identifier field of the header labels should be \"T-100.SYSTEM\".

Report date The record layouts for diskette are generally identical to those shown for magnetic tape, with the exception that delimiters (quotation marks and commas) are used to separate fields. It is necessary that the order of fields be maintained in all records. (1) File characteristics. The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimescalled Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by ,quotation marks (\"I and separated by a comma (,) and numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma. The data is identified by its juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore it is critical that each record contain the exact number of data elements, all of which data must be juxtapositionally correct. PC software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC produce minidisks files in this format. (2) File naming conventions for diskettes. For microcomputer reports, each record type should be contained in a separate DOS file on the same physical diskette. The following DOS naming conventions should be followed: Record type S = SEGMENT.DAT Record type M =MARKET.DAT Record type I = T-1.DAT Record type 2 = T-2.DAT Record type 3 = T-3.DAT (1) Discussion of reporting concept. (1) The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. First, the nonstop segment information which is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type of flight number. (2) The Schedules T-1 and T-3 information is applicable only to operations that are not required in the detail T-100 report. The Department will derive other necessary summary data directly from the detail T-100. The T-1 and T-3 data pertaining to domestic entities is for scheduled all-cargo service and charter operations. The T-1 for international entities contains data on military charter operations only. (3) The Schedule T-2 information is required from each carrier and for each reporting entity. It contains some data elements for which there is no corresponding detail in T-100. (4) A single tape file shall be submitted containing nonstop segment and on-flight market records for all applicable entities. The summary data pertaining to schedules T-1.T-2. and T-3 should be submitted on a second tape reel. A carrier reporting on diskette should create separate files for each record type, using DOS file naming conventions to-identify them. (5) An air carrier who submits middle cabin data may be confronted by a situation resulting from a change of gauge or other considerations wherein a given leg of a flight may not offer the same classes of service that is available on the remainder of the legs. When preparing on-flight market records applicable to this situation, the carrier should consider passengers transported as though the entire trip was configured as the first segment. The passenger cabin where the passenger is seated at the beginning of the flight determines the classification for the whole trip. (in) Joint Service. (1) The Department may authorize joint service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-character agreements; code-sharing agreements; Wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements. (2) Joint service operations shall be reported in Form 41 Schedule T-100 and T- 100(f) within the following guidelines: (i) Blocked space, part-charters and code- sharing arrangements shall be reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight. The traffic moving under those agreements is reported the same as any other traffic on board the aircraft. (ii) Wet lease agreements shall be reported by the lessee as though the leased aircraft and crew were a part of the lessee's own fleet. (iii) If there are questions about reporting a joint service operation, contact the Director, Office of Aviation Information Management at the address in paragraph [d) of this Appendix. [iv) The Department may require information pertaining to joint service operations in addition to that reported by in Schedules T-100 and T-100(f) by US. and foreign air carriers. If additional information is needed, ad hoc reporting will be used by the Director, Office of Aviation Information Management 0AIM), under authority delegated in I \u00a7 385.27 (b) and (d) of this chapter. Ad hoc reporting requirements will be communicated to the applicable carriers by letter. (in) Glossary of date elements. Sections 19- 5 and 03 of 14 CFR Part 241. (n) Schedules.

ACTION: Notice of adoption of final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Army hereby gives notice that it is adopting revised policy and procedures for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations. These guidelines replace policy and procedures found in current Army Regulation 200-2 (32 CFR Part 651), Environmental Effects of Army Actions. The revision is necessary to clarify and update the current regulation. The revision clarifies organizational responsibilities, revises the list of actions which are categorically excluded from environmental impact analyses, clarifies public involvement procedures, and provides new guidance on mitigation and monitoring of environmental impacts. The final rule provides new guidance on the Army policy of integrating NEPA procedures into the Remedial investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) stages of hazardous substance cleanup actions required under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). The final rule provides Army policy relative to compliance with NEPA in airspace proposals. The revised regulation incorporates field and other experiences since the publication of the last publication of the regulation. EFFECTIVE DATE: These procedures are effective December 16, 1988. ADDRESS: Office of the Assistant Chief of Engineers, Army Environmental Office, Room 1E671, Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-1000. Comments or request for changes may be submitted on a Department of Defense Form 2028, Recommended Changes to Publications and Blank Forms. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Tim Julius, Army Environmental Office, (202) 272-0596 or Mr. Ray Clark, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (I&L), (202) 695-7824.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification The Secretary of the Army has determined that this revision is not a\"major\" rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291. The effect on the economy will be less than $100 million. The rule will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, geographic regions, or Federal, State, or local governmental agencies. The rule will not have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment productivity, innovation, or on the ability of a United States-based enterprise to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Paperwork Reduction This rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Costs and Benefits This rule has been reviewed under E.O. 12291 and the Secretary of the Army has classified the action as non- major. The effect of the rule on the economy will be less than $100 million. Therefore, neither a regulatory impact analysis nor a full regulatory evaluation was required. Small Business Impact This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Secretary of the Army has certified that this section does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Background On 17 February, 1988, a notice of proposed rule 32 CFR Part 651, Environmental Effects of Army Actions, was published in the Federal Register (53 FR 4647-4671). A 30 day comment period for public review was provided. During that period seven (7) letters were received. Two letters were from state agencies, three were from federal agencies, and two letters were from Army field agencies. The seven letters provided 53 comments. The largest category of comments were related to administrative processing of environmental documentation through Army channels (16). The comments generally were from the Army field agencies who chose to respond to the proposed rule, A second category dealt with the inclusiveness of regulation, i.e.; the regulation should cover broader categories of actions which requireenvironmental impact analysis (13). A third category also received 13 comments, that the regulation required clarification. Five comments were in the category of typographical/grammatical errors. Three comments suggested changes in terminology to ensure Army is using proper criteria for determining the level of environmental documentation required for Army actions. Thefollowing discusses the comments and Army's responses to the general and specific concerns expressed on the proposed rules. Copies of all written comments have been provided to CEQ and are available for public review at the Army Environmental Office, Room 1E671, Pentagon, Washington, DC. Specific Comments on the Rule 1. Section 651.4 Policy. One commenter suggested the rule cite other environmental laws and Where they can be found. This comment was not adopted because this rule is not the appropriate place to cite all environmental regulations. The scope of this rule is confined to implementing NEPA. The Army has a regulation (AR 200-1) concerning compliance with other environmental laws and regulations. 2. Section 651.5 Responsibilities. One commenter suggested sentence structure change to enhance clarity and that suggestion was adopted (1 651.5(b)). The same commenter suggested the responsibilities of the Program Executive Officer's responsibilities be defined in this section. This is an inappropriate place to define the PEO responsibilities. All the Army organizations which appear in this section have a special responsibility in the environmental program. The PEO has responsibilities which mirror those of HQDA staff agencies and those responsibilities are defined in \u00a7 651.5(c). 3. Section 651.6 Records and Documents. One commenter suggested that the regulation should specifically note that using a Categorical Exclusion does not exclude compliance with other environmental laws. This suggestion was not adopted because there is no instance in this rule that intimates that the rule repeals or usurps any other environmental law or regulation. In fact, many of the Categorical Exclusions (CX) are predicated upon compliance with other environmental laws and regulations. It is inherent that a CX does not exclude compliance with other environmental laws. Likewise, even though one prepares an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, the proponent is not exempt from other environmental laws and Federal Register / Vol. 53, No.- 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46323 regulations. A second.comment on this part refuted the need for Army to require a Record of Fvironmental Consideration (REC) for actions that are CXs. this suggestion is not adopted because CXs are broad, by design, to cover many Army actions that have no potential for environmental impact. The RECs are for those CXs that must be rigidly defined to be properly excluded. There Is very little paperwork associated with a CX yet the REC provides the proponent a vehicle to document his/her consideration of the potential environmental impacts. The Army finds these RECs useful. 4. Section 651.7 Definitions. One commenter requested clarification of the sentence \"major federal action is not a determinate in a decision to prepare or not prepare environmental documentation\". While it is true that a\"major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" clearly requires an EIS, a major federal action with merely\"potential\" may not have significant effects on the environment, and therefore may require only an EA. It is conceivable that even a \"major federal action\" could be excluded because of its category. Another commenter suggested that the definition of \"significantly affecting the environment\" should also include that positive impacts, as well as negative environmental impacts, require environmental impact analysis. This Is true and has been incorporated in the final rule. 5. Section 651.8 Responsibilities. Several commenters recommended additional Army agencies be added to this section. One state military agency pointed out that the National Guard Bureau (NGB) respoisibilities are not incorporated, nor is the relationship between the NGB and the state Adjutant Generals (AG) clearly defined. The NGB responsibilities are the same as any other Headquarters, Department of Army (HQDA) staff agency and are therefore defined in I 651.5(c) 1-9. No change to the rule is required. The relationship of the NGB and the State AGs has been clarified in several sections of the rule. 6. Section 651.9 (a). Applicability. One respondent expressed concern that installation restoration projects pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Respbnse, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) would not be adequately assessed under the Army's proposed rule. As a matter of policy, the Army will comply with the 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508 and the final rulehas incorporated this revision. Another commenter suggested that applicability of the regulation should extend to Section 802 housing projects, as well as Section 801 housing. This suggestion has been adopted and incorporated in the final rule. 7. Section 651.10 Categories of Actions. One commenter suggested that paragraph (b) of this section, which deals with emergencies, did not provide relief for those emergency actions where the impacts may not be significant, but require preparation of an EA and publication of a FNSL The intent of the proposed rule was to note that even projects with significant impacts may be undertaken without the benefit of an EIS. It was intended to be inclusive. However, the final rule clarifies this point. 8. Section 651.11 Classified Actions. One federal agency offered to participate in review of classified actions at the Army's request and noted the agency had reviewers with appropriate security clearances for such review. The Army appreciates the offer and will consider it for use In the future. 9. Section 651.12 Integration with Army Planning. One commenter noted that while the Army requires publication of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI), it fails to mention the circulation of the EA which is the basis of the FNSI. It has always been Army policy and practice that the EA is available for public review. However, the sentence in \u00a7 651.12(b)(2) has been changed to amplify this policy. A federal agency noted that the proposed rule stated that EPA accepts Notices of Availability until noon on Friday, when the EPA actually accepts NOAs until the close of business each Friday. This information will be incorporated into the final rule. One respondent asked for criteria to understand what triggers a 30 day waiting period described in J 051.12(b)(2)(ii). It is Army policy that there is a 30 day waiting period after a FNSI is published before a decision is made. It should be noted that although CEQ does not require a 30 day waiting period, it is Army policy. There may be peculiar circumstances where the 30 day comment period is not followed, but . those are rare. To clarify, this final rule states the Army policy to wait 30 days for comments. Another comment suggested that Historic Preservation Plans were mentioned twice in the same section for the same purposes and that one reference should be deleted. This suggestion was adopted. 10. Section 651.13 Mitigation and Monitoring. One respondent requested the rule incorporate guidance on thetypes of mitigation measures that should be included as line items in the budget. This suggestion was adopted and the wording has been revised. The final rule clarifies the responsibility of the proponent with respect to funding mitigations. i 11. Section 651.16 Categorical Exclusions (Procedures). Respondent suggests the final rule explain why some CXs require RECs and others do not. The final rule states the rationale for this requirement in I 651.16(a). Another commenter suggested that J 651.16(b)(5) does not include other safety regulations with which Army agencies will comply besides AR 385-10. This suggestion is adopted and the final rule adds the phrase \" * * and all other applicable Army safety and preventive medicine regulations\", in order to be more inclusive. 12. Section 651.22 Components of the EA. One commenter stated that the Army should not require both the EA and the FNSI to be signed. If the EA and the FNSI are integrated and never separated, only the FNSI would need to be signed. However, there are cases where the two are separated and requires that reviewers are aware that both have been reviewed and approved by the decisionmaker. It is Army policy that both will be signed. 13. Section 651.23 Decision Process. One commenter suggested that the preface to this section should include provisions for the proponent to go directly to a decision to prepare an EIS without first preparing an EA. Although Army believes this has not been a point of confusion within the agency, explicit wording has been incorporated in the final rule to reflect that a proponent may determine to prepare an EIS at any point in the decision process. 14. Section 651.27 Criteria. Two commenters pointed out that the criteria to prepare an EIS should not be based solely on \"degradation\" of the environment, but may also include \"beneficial\" impacts. It is true that a more appropriate term is \"significantly affect\" and the final rule has adopted this comment. Another commenter pointed out that paragraph (b) In this subsection needed a rewrite to create a complete second sentence. This was adopted. One respondent suggested the Army will prepare an EIS when an action \"affects the environment, or parts of it, in ways or by means found by other federal agencies to be significant and to require an EIS.\" This suggestion was not adopted. The Army is responsible for its actions and must decide when an EIS is appropriate. 46324 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 15. Section 651.28 Actions Normally Requiring on EIS, One respondent urged a rewrite of the provision dealing with Life Cycle Environmental Documentation (LCED) of weapon systems to incorporate the broader concept of \"research and development systems\". It is not clear that all research and development systems require an EIS. However, the point the respondent makes is well taken, i.e., that not just weapon systems will be subject to EISs. Therefore, the final rule incorporates the phrase \"materiel, such as weapon systems\", to broaden the concept. It remains the responsibility of the proponent to determine the level of environmental documentation required to comply with NEPA and CEQ regulations. 16. Section 651.30 Steps on Preparing and Processing on EIS. Six comments were received regarding this section. One commenter suggested Army provide more information on internal processing of EISs through Army channels. This comment was adopted and guidelines were expanded in \u00a7 651.30(a). However, it is anticipated that a Department of Army pamphlet will be initiated in 1989 which will contain more how-to instructions than a policy rule can accommodate. A state military agency requested that the final rule indicate how lead agency is determined for an action initiated by the State Adjutant General. This regulation is meant for Department of Army Actions. The National Guard Bureau is always the proponent, and lead agency, when the action is accomplished with federal , dollars. The state may be either a joint lead or cooperating agency. Language has been incorporated to clarify this point. Another commenter suggested the rule should not discuss the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in the section on public review of the Draft EIS (DEIS). Army agrees with this comment and will move this paragraph to \u00a7 651.30(g). Another commenter - suggested Army point out that Final EISs should be mailed to the commenters on the Draft EIS before filing the NOA with EPA. This was a shortcoming in the proposed rule and new language is incorporated in the final rule. The last comment is this section suggested that a paragraph should be added to provide guidance on preparation and coordination procedures for Supplemental EISs. -This has been added in this section. 17. Section 651.31 Existing EISs. Commenter recommends that the final rule add a paragraph that will facilitate adoption of other agencies NEPAdocuments when appropriate. This language is included in the final rule. 18. Appendix A-Categorical Exclusions. Two comments were received on the Appendix. One respondent suggested the Army change the \"Screening Questions\" to \"Screening Criteria\". Since the 10 statements in the screen do represent criteria for using a CX, this suggestion was adopted. CEQ requested the Army delete CX A-28 because of its broadness and the potential for abuse. The proposed rule had incorporated stricter measures and provided a greater internal control on the use of A-28. The Army believes the elimination of A-28 will require additional specific CXs and therefore the list will be expanding periodically in the first one-two years after the final rule. However, the Army has removed CX A-2& 19. As a result of comments regarding the presentation of the material, Subpart A-Introduction was reorganized and Subpart B-Records and Documents was transposed with Subpart C--NEPA and the Decision Process to ensure logical presentation of the material. In addition, the CFR section numbers have been revised for format consistency. List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 651 Environmental protection.

(k) Installation, activity, and unit commanders will accomplish responsibilities listed in paragraphs j1 (1) through (3), (5), (7), and (9) of this section.1651.5 Polcies. ( (a) The DA will endeavor to ensure the wise use of natural resources on Army land. The DA will match military mission activities with the ecological compatibility of the land and natural resources in order to maintain resources for realistic training, while minimizing the adverse impact on the human and natural environment. Decisionmakers will be cognizant.of, and responsible for the impact of their decisions on cultural resources; soils, forests, rangelands, water and air quality, and fish and wildlife; as well as other natural resources under their stewardship. The DA will identify significant environmental effects of proposed programs and projects in adequate detail. These effects will be considered in the decision process along with technical, economic, and other necessary factors. DA will carry out the mission of national security in a manner consistent with NEPA and other applicable environmental standards. laws, and policies. DA will employ all practicable means consistent with other essential considerations of national policy to minimize or avoid adverse environmental consequences and attain the goals and objectives stated in sections 101 and 102 of NEPA. (See Appendix C.) (b) Environmental considerations will be integrated into the decisionmaking process to ensure that- (1) Major decision points are designated for principal programs and proposals likely to have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment, while providing for the NEPA process to coincide with these decision points. (2) Relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses accompany the proposal through the existing Army review and the decisionmaking process. The Army will integrate NEPA requirements with other planning and environmental review procedures required by law or Army practice so that review of environmental considerations is concurrent rather than consecutive. (3) The alternatives considered are within the range of alternatives discussed in relevant environmental documents. (c) Worldwide and long-range character of environmental problems will be recognized, and where consistent with national security requirements and United States (U.S.) foreign policy, appropriate support will be given to initiatives, resolutions, and programs designed to maximize international cooperation in protecting the quality of the world human environment. Inaccordance with Executive Order 12114, DOD Directive 6050.7 and Subpart H of this regulation, an environmental planning and evaluation process will be incorporated into Army actions that may significantly affect global commons, environments of other nations, or any protected natural or ecological resources of global importance. (See Subpart H.) (d) Laws, other than NEPA, that require the Army to gain approval of other Federal. State, or local Government agencies before taking actions that may have environmental consequences will be obeyed. However, compliance does not relieve the responsible official from preparing environmental impact analyses and processing necessary environmental documents. NEPA compliance is required unless existing law, applicable to a specific action or activity, prohibits, exempts or makes compliance impossible. (e) When appropriate, environmental documentation to consider operations security principles and procedures described in AR 530-1 will be reviewed and documented on the cover sheet or signature page. \u00a7 651.6 Procedures. (a) The Assistant Chief of Engineers retains a copy of each draft and final EIS (Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)) prepared by the Army. The EIS will be retained until the proposed action and any mitigation program is complete or the information therein is no longer valid. The EIS is then deposited in the National Archives and Records Administration. (b) DA agencies are encouraged to draw upon the special expertise that is available within the medical department, including the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency (AEHA), to identify and evaluate environmental health impacts. (c) Military Construction Army/ Military Construction ARNG (MCA/ MCAR) funds may not be used for preparation of environmental documents. Operations and Maintenance/Operation and Maintenance, ARNG (OMA/OMAR) or other operating funds are the proper sources of funds for environmental document preparation. (d) The proponent for federally funded ARNG actions is the National Guard Bureau (NGB) division in whose area of responsibility the action rests. For instance, National Guard Bureau- Installations Division (NGB-ARI) would Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46327 be the proponent for proposed training activities. The NGB division proponent performs the actions described in this section with the States or territories affected by the proposed action. (e) In specific cases, such as the construction of a water treatment facility or a flood control plan, the engineer could be the proponent. The engineer and/or his environmental management staff should advise proponents as to the format and technical data that must be considered in the environmental document The engineer's environmental management staff is, however, responsible for reviewing each environmental document for compliance with NEPA and appropriate Army and/or ARNG regulations. No matter who prepares the environmental document, the proponent remains responsible for its content and conclusions. (f) The decisionmaking process often subjects proposal decisions to review and/or approval by higher level authorities including HQDA proponent (defined in the Glossary); therefore, the review and approval of the environmental document follows the same channel of review and approval as that of the proposed action. This does not apply to federally funded ARNG actions since the NGB division, which is the proponent for such actions, is also the HQDA proponent. Subpart B-National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Decision Process \u00a7 651.7 Introduction. (a) NEPA establishes policies and goals for the protection of the environment. Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain procedural requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. (See Appendix C for a copy of NEPA.) The CEQ issued regulations to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA and they are provided in Appendix E. Implementing procedures to CEQ regulations are contained in DOD Directive 6050.1 (applicable in the continental United States (CONUS)) and DOD Directive 6050.7 (applicable outside the continental United States (OCONUS)). (b) The NEPA process includes the systematic examination of possible and probable environmental consequences of implementing a proposed action. To be effective, integration of the NEPA process with other Army project planning will occur at the earliest possible time to ensure- (1) Planning and decisidnnaking reflect environmental values.(2) Policies and goals of \u00a7 651.4 are implemented. (3] Delays and potential conflicts later in the process are minimized. (c) To achieve these actions, all Army decisionmaking that may have an impact on the human environment will use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that ensures the integrated use of the natural and social sciences, planning, and the environmental design arts. (Pub. L. 91-190 sec. 102(2)(A)). This approach allows timely identification of environmental effects and values in sufficient detail for evaluation concurrently with economic, techical, and mission-related analyses at the earliest possible step in the decision process. When EAs or EISs are undertaken, the economic and social impacts will be included in the analysis of total environmental impacts. However, these secondary impacts, unaccompanied by physical environmental impacts, should not determine whether or not to prepare an environmental document. (d) NEPA also requires the proponent of an action or project to identify and describe all reasonable alternatives to the proposed action or project. To assist in identifying reasonable alternatives, the proponent must consult appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, and the general public. (e) These procedures will assist the decisionmaker in selecting a preferred couse of action. They provide the relevant background information and subsequent analyses of the proposal's positive and negative environmental effects. The decisionmaker's written environmental evaluation is either a CX with a record of consideration (REC), an EA with a FNS, or an EIS with a ROD. (See Subpart C.) \u00a7 651.8 Action requiring evaluation. (a) The types of projects or actions to evaluate for environmental impact include- (1) Policies, regulations, and procedures (for example, Army regulations and circulars). (2) New management and operational concepts and programs in areas such as logistics, research, development, test and evaluation, procurement, and personnel assignment. (3) Projects (for example, facilities construction, research and development for weapons, vehicles, and other equipment). (4) Activities (for example, individual and unit training, flight operations, overall operation of installation, or facility test and evaluation programs). (5) Requests for a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license (new, renewal, oramendment) or an Army radiation authorization. (6) Materiel development, acquisition, and/or transition. (7) Research and development in areas such as genetic engineering, laser testing, and electromagnetic pulse generation. (8) Installation restoration projects undertaken pursuant to section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (40 CFR Part 300), implements the requirements of CERCLA/SARA, and describes a formal process, the feasibility study (FS). (i) The FS provides substantive and procedural standards to ensure full consideration of environmental issues and alternatives, and an opportunity for the public to participate in evaluating environmental factors and alternatives before a final decision is made. (ii) In most'cases, when a FS is prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 300, a second NEPA document is not required. As a matter of policy, the organization preparing the FS will ensure the document also complies with 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508. The cover of the FS document and the subsequent ROD will contain the legend \"This document is intended to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\" All public notices announcing the availability of the FS will also note this intent. Installation Restoration Program actions in which an FS is not prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 300 will require appropriate environmental documentation. (9) Requests for special use airspace in accordance with AR 95-50 that require Federal Aviation Administration approval (new, renewal, or amendment). (b) In addition to the above, certain activities supported by the Army through the following actions require proper environmental documentation: (1) Federal contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of funding such as Government owned contractor operated industrial plants and section 801/802 Housing, Military Appropriations Act of 1984, construction, (via third-party contracting). (2) Leases, easements, permits, licenses, certificates, or other entitlement for use (for example, grazing lease and grants of easement for highway right-of-way). (3) Request for approval to use or store materials, radiation sources, 46328 Federal Register I Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations hazardous and toxic material, or wastes on Army land. If the requester is non-. Army, the responsibility to prepare the proper environmental documentation is that of the non-Army requester. If required, the requester will provide information needed for the Army review. The Army reviews and approves all environmental documentation before approving the request. \u00a7 651.9 Environmental review categories. The following are the five broad categories into which a proposed action may fall for environmental review: (a) Exemption by law. The law must apply to DOD and/or Army and must prohibit, exempt, or make impossible full compliance with NEPA (40 CFR 1500.6). (See \u00a7 651.11 for security exemptions). (b) Emergencies. (1) In the event of an emergency, the Army may need to take immediate actions that have environmental impacts, that may include immediate actions to promotenational defense or security and actions necessary for the protection of life or property. In such cases the HQDA proponent will notify the Army Environmental Office, which in turn will notify the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Installations and Logistics (OASA (I&L)) who will coordinate with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Production and Logistics (ASD (P&L) regarding the emergency action. Time is of the essence so that OASA (I&L) may consult with the CEQ if necessary. A public affairs plan should be developed as soon as possible so that channels of communication remain open between the media, public, and the installation. In no event will Army delay an emergency action necessary for national defense, security, or preservation of human life or property to comply with this regulation or the CEQ regulations. State call-ups of ARNG during a natural disaster are excluded from this consultation requirement.(2) These notifications apply only to actions necessary to control immediate effects of the emergency; other actions remain subject to NEPA review. (40 CFR 1506.11) (3) After action reports may be required at the discretion of the OASA (I&L). (c) Categorical exclusions (CX. These actions (Subpart D and Appendix A) normally do not require an EA or an EIS. The Army has determined that they do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Qualification for a CX is described in Subpart D of this regulation. (d) Environmental assessment (EA). (See section for actions normally requiring an EA.) (1) If the proposed action is adequately covered within an existing EA or EIS, prepare a REC to that effect. (See Figure 1). BILLING CODE 3710-0M Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations Figure 1. Flow chart summarizing process for determination of document requirements *LLIUNG CODE 5104M-46329 46330 Federal Register /: VoL 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 /.Rules and Regulations (2) If the proposed action is within the general scope of an existing EA or EIS, but requires additional information, prepare a new environmental document that considers the new, modified, or missing information. Incorporate by reference, existing documents and publish the conclusion (FNSI or NOI). (3) If the proposed action is not covered adequately in any existing EA or EIS, or is of significantly larger scope than that described in the existing document, then prepare an EA followed by either a FNSI or a new EIS. (e) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). (See \u00a7 651.30 for actions normally requiring an EIS.) (1) If it is determined that the action is covered adequately in a previously filed FEIS, the REC must so state, citing the applicable FEIS by name and date. The REC is then attached to the proponent's record copy of that FEIS. As a general rule, a FEIS older than 3 years cannot be used in this manner, but must be supplemented. (2) If the proposed action is within the scope of an existing FEIS, but was not covered in that document or not covered adequately, then the proponent must prepared supplemental documentation to that FEIS. (3) If the proposed action is not within the scope of any existing EIS, then the proponent must begin the preparation of a new EIS. \u00a7 651.10 Determining appropriate environmental documentation. (a) The flowchart shown in Figure 1 summarizes the process for determining documentation requirements. (b) The proponent of a proposed action may adopt appropriate environmental documents (EAs or EISs) prepared by another agency (40 CFR 1500.4(n) and 1506.3). In such cases, the proponent will retain its own record keeping for RECs and RODs. (See 40 CFR 1506.3 for procedures to follow when adopting other documents.) (c) When an existing adequate EA or EIS is used in lieu of preparation of a new document, the REC should state the document title, date, and where it may be reviewed. \u00a7 651.11 Classified actions. (a) For public dissemination of environmental documents containing classified information, AR 30-5 will be followed. (b) Classified facts will be separated from unclassified facts and conclusions related to the proposed action. Unclassified portions of the action may then be processed routinely in accordance with this regulation. Classified portions will be kept separatefor reviewers and decisionmakers with need-to-know as defined in AR 380-5 and (c) of this section. (c) Classification does not relieve a proponent of the necessity to assess and document the environmental effects of the proposed action. The HQDA proponent, in coordination with the Army Environmental Office and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Security Division (DAMI-CIS), may select a review team. The team may be drawn from the Army agency or office not connected with the proponent agency, or from agencies outside the Army. The review team's purpose is to provide an external review of classified environmental documents. \u00a7 651.12 Integration with Army planning. (a) Early integration. The Army goal to integrate environmental reviews concurrently with other Army planning and decisionmaking actions avoids delays in mission accomplishments. To achieve this goal, proponents should provide complete environmental documents for early inclusion with any recommendation or report to decisionmakers (Master Plan, Natural Resource Management Plan, Remedial Investigation, FS, etc.). The same documents will be forwarded to the planners, designers, and/or implementers so that recommendations and mitigations on which the decision was based may be carried out. (b) Time limits. The timing of the preparation, circulation, submission, and public availability of environmental documents is of great importance in ensuring that environmental values are integrated in the planning and decision processes. It is important to remember that next to the project itself, a properly prepared EIS may require the longest time to complete.(1) Categorical exclusions (CX). When a proposed action is categorically excluded from further environmental review (Subpart D and Appendix A), the proponent may proceed immediately with that action. (2) Findings of no significant impact (FNSI). (i) If the proposed action is one of national concern, is unprecedented, or normally requires an EIS, the proponent will make the EA and FNSI available for public review 30 or more days prior to making a final decision. A news release is required to publicize the availability of the FNSI. If the action is of national significance, a simultaneous announcement that includes publication in the Federal Register (FR) must be made by HQDA.(ii) For proposed actions referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the proponent must allow a 30-day period for public comment between the time that the FNSI is publicized (40 CFR 1506.6(b)) and the time the proposed action begins. In those cases where the 30 day wait jeopardizes the project, the additional comment period provides no public benefit, and none of the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) apply, the period may be shortened with MACOM approval. In no circumstances should the public comment period for an EA/FNSI be'less than 15 days. (iii) A deadline and POC must be included for receipt of comments in the FNSI and the news release. (3) Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). The EPA publishes a weekly notice in the FR of the EISs filed during the preceding week. This notice usually occurs each Friday. A NOA reaching EPA on a Friday will be published in the following Friday issue of the FR. (Failure to deliver a NOA to EPA by close of business on Friday will result in an additional one week delay.) A news release publicizing the action will be made in conjunction with the notice in the FR. The following time periods calculated from the publication date of the EPA notice will be observed: (i) Not less than 45 days for public comment on DEISs (40 CFR 1506.10(c)). (ii) Not less than 15 days for public availability of DEISs prior to any public hearing on the DEISs (40 CFR 1506.(c)(2)). (iii) Not less than 90 days total for public availability of the DEIS and FEIS prior to any decision on the proposed action. These periods may run concurrently (40 CFR 1506.10 (b) and (c)). (iv) The time periods prescribed here may be extended or reduced in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2) and 1506.10(d). (v) When variations to these time limits are set, the Army agency should consider the factors in 40 CFR 150.8(b)(1). (vi) The proponent may also set time limits for other procedures or decisions related to DEISs and FEISs as listed in 40 CFR 150M1.b)(2). (vii) The entire EIS process could require more than I year. (See Figure 2.) Thus, it is important that the process begin as soon as the project is conceptualized and that the proponent coordinate with all staff elements who may have a role to play in the NEPA process. Most of this time is taken by the preparation of the DEIS and the revision and response to comments to prepare the FEIS. Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 I Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46331 (viii) A public affairs plan should be developed that provides for periodic interaction with the community. There is a minimum public review time of 90 days between the publication of the DEIS and the announcement of the ROD. Army EISs are not normally processed in so short a time due to the internal staffing required for this type of action. After the availability of the ROD is announced, the action may proceed. Figure 2 indicates typical and required time periods for EISs.

(1) Army agencies are encouraged to write programmatic environmental analyses when such programs are being considered for general application (40 CFR 1502.4(c), 1502.20 and 1508.23). This will eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and focus on the key issues at each appropriate level of project review., When a broad EIS or EA has been prepared and a subsequent EIS or EA is then prepared on an action included within the entire program or policy (particularly a site-specific action), it need only summarize issues discussed in the broader statement and concentrate on the Issues specific to the subsequent action. This subsequent document will state where the earlier document is available. (2) An example would be the assessment of a proposed major weapon system program. Development of an overall programmatic EIS or EA for the life cycle of the system is recommended. Tiered EAs and EISs, as appropriate, would evaluate specific subphases such as testing, production, development, use, and ultimate disposal. (d) Scoping. (1) When the planning for an Army project or action indicates a- need for an EIS preparation, the proponent initiates the scoping process. (See Subpart G for procedures and actions to be taken during the scoping process.) This process determines the 'scope of issues to address In the EIS and identifies the significant issues related to the proposed action. During the scoping process the participants Identify the range of actions, alternatives, and impacts to consider in the EIS (40 CFR 1508.25). For an individual action, the scope may depend on the relationship of the proposed action to other environmental documents. (2) The extent of the scoping process, including public involvement, will depend on several factors. These factors include- (I) The size and type of the proposed action. (ii) Whether the proposed action Is of regional or national interest. (iii) Degree of any associated environmental controversy. (iv) Size of the affected environmental parameters. (v) Significance of any effects on them. (vi) Extent of prior environmental review. (vii) Involvement of any substantive time limits. (viii) Requirements by other laws for environmental review. (3) The proponent may incorporate scoping in the public involvement orenvironmental review process other than that required for an EIS. If so, a significant reduction in the extent of scoping incorporated is at the proponent's discretion. (e) Analyses and documentation. Environmental analyses and documentation required by this regulation will be Integrated as much as practical with other environmental reviews, laws, and executive orders (40 CFR 1502.25) and- (1) Environmental analysis and documentation required by various State laws. (2) Any cost-benefit analyses prepared in relation to a proposed action (40 CFR 1502.23). (3) Permitting and licensing procedures required by Federal and State law. For instance, the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 57401 et seq.) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 125 et seq.). (4) Installation and Army Master Planning functions and plans. (5) Installation management plans, particularly those that deal directly with the environment. These include the Natural Resource Management Plans (Fish and Wildlife Management Plan, Forest Management Plan, and Range Improvement or Maintenance Plan). (6) Stationing and installation planning, force development planning, and materiel acquisition planning. ,(7) Installation Compatible Use Zone (ICUZ) program. (8) Hazardous waste management plans. (9) Historic Preservation Plan as required by AR 420-40. (10) Intergovernmental coordination as required by AR 210-10. (11) Asbestos Management Plans. (0 Relations with local and regional agencies. (1) Installation, agency, or activity environmental officers or planners should establish planning relations with other agencies. These agencies include the staffs of adjacent local governments and State agencies. This will promote cooperation and resolution of mutual land use and environment-related problems. (2) Preparation of a Memorandum of Understanding is desirable for promoting cooperation and coordination. This memorandum will Identify areas of mutual interest, establish POCs, identify lines of communication between agencies, and specify procedures to follow in conflict resolution. Additional coordination is available from State and area-wide planning and development agencies, including those designated by AR 210- 10. Thus, the proponent may gain insights on other agencies' approachesto EAs, surveys, and studies of the current proposal. These other agencies would also be able to assist in identifying possible participants in scoping procedures for projects requiring an EIS. \u00a7 651.13 Mitigation and monitoring. (a) Identification in environmental documents. Only those mitigation measures that can reasonably be accomplished as part of a proposed alternative will be identified in environmental documentation (EA, FNSI, or EIS). Measures that the proponent implements as part of the selected action will be Included in the environmental documentation. Mitigation measures that appear practicable, but unobtainable within expected resources or that some other agency (including non-Army agencies) should perform, will be identified as such in the environmental document. \"Practicable\" measures include, among others, actions that appear capable of being accomplished. Complete' development or testing of the exact means of performing the action may not have occurred. (b) Consideration throughout the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Consider mitigation throughout the NEPA process. When an EIS or EIS Supplement is prepared, the ROD will state specific mitigation measures taken to reduce or avoid the selected action's adverse environmental effects. For EAs, the FNSI will state, when applicable, the appropriate mitigation measures that will be implemented. The proponent must ensure such mitigation measures become a project line item In the 'proposal budget Mitigations that are committed to in an EA, but that are eventually not funded, must lead to reevaluation of the project and the significance of its impacts. In addition, the FNSI will state those practicable mitigation measures that have not been adopted. (40 CFR 1505.2(c)). (c) Assistance from cooperating non- Army agencies. Proponents may request assistance with mitigation when appropriate. Whether it is appropriate to request assistance is determined by whether the requesting agency- (1) Was a cooperating agency during preparation of an environmental document, or (2) Has the technology, expertise, time, funds, or familiarity with project or local ecology necessary to implement the mitigation measure more effectively than the lead agency. (d) Implementing the decision.Federal Registar / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16,1988 / Rules and Regulations 46333 46334 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations (1) The proponent agency or other appropriate cooperating agency will implement mitigation an6 other conditicns establiched in the EA or EIS or during its review, and committed as part of the FNSI or the ROD. (2) Le;J documents implementing the action (contracts, permits, grants, and so forth) will specify m tigation measures to be performed. Penalties against the contractor for noncompliance may also be specified as appropriate. Specifitaticn cf penalties should be fully coordinated with the appropriate legal advicar. 3 A mozn!tcrin and enorcement program will be adopted nd summarized in the ROD where applicable for any itegatfen. (See Appendix F for guide2nes Gn implementing E.ch a prcrani.) Whether adoption of a morntering c d enforcement program is applicable (40 CFR 1505.2(c)) and whether the specific adopted action is an important case (40 CFR 1505.3) may depend on such factors as the following:(i) A change in environmental conditions or project activities assumed in the EMS (such that original predictions of the extent of adverse enviror-nental impacts may be too limited). (ii) Cases when the outcome of the mitigation measure is uncertain (for example, new technology). (iiI) Projects in which major environmental controversy ramar associated with the selected alternative. (iv) Cases when failure of a mitigation measure, cr cther unfareseen circumstances, could result in serious harm to Federal or State listed endangered or tLeatened species; important historic or erchaeoiogiral sites that are eiler on, or meet eligibiity requirements for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places; widerness areas, wild and scenic rivers, or other public or private protected r.-ources. Evaluation and determination of what constitutes serious harm in coordination with the appropriate Federal, State or local agency responsible for each particular program must be made.(v) The proponent will respond to inquiries from the public or other agencies regarding the status of mitigation measures adopted. Subpart C-Required Records and Docaments and documents are requiredL (a) Record of Environmental Consideration (REC. The REC describes the proposed action and anticipated timeframe, identifies the proponent, and explains why further environmental analysis and documentation is not required. It is a signed statement to be submitted with project documentation. It is used when the proposed action is exempt from the requirements of NEPA, or has been adequately assessed in existing documents and determined not to be environmentally significant. A REC is also used to document the use of those CX that require such records. (See Figure 3 for format.)

An EA is a document that- (1) Briefly provides the decisionmaker with sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether a FNSI or an EIS should be prepared. (2) Assures compliance with NEPA, if an EIS is not required and a CX is inappropriate. (3) Facilitates preparation of a required EIS. (4) Includes brief discussions of the need for the proposed action, alternatives to the proposed actions (NEPA, sec. 102(2)(e)) (see Appendix C), proposed and alternative actions environmental impacts, and a listing of persons and agencies consulted. (See Suppart E for requirements.) (c) Finding of no significant impact (FNSI. A FNSI is a document that briefly states why an action will not significantly affect the environment, thus voiding the requirement for an EIS. The FNSI will include a summary of the conclusions of the EA and will note any environmental documents related to it. If the EA is attached, the FNSI need not repeat any of the EA's discussion, but may incorporate it by reference. A FNSI is always signed by the decisionmaker. (See \u00a7 651.24 for processing.) (d) Notice of intent (NOI). An NOI is a public notice that an EIS will be prepared and considered. The NOI will briefly- (1) Describe the proposed and alternative actions. (2) Describe the proposed scoping process, including whether, when, and where any public meetings will be held. (3) State the name and address of the POC who can answer questions on the proposed action and its EIS. (See \u00a7 \u00a7 651.32(a), 651.34(a), and 651.37 for application.) (e) Environmental impact statement (EIS). An EIS is a detailed written statement required by NEPA for major Federal actions with significant environmental effects (42 U.S.C. 4321, sec. 102(2)(c). (See Appendix C.) (See Subpart F for requirements.) (f) Life cycle environmental document (LCED). The LCED is intended to be a programmatic assessment that addresses the known and reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of a proposed item/system during all phases of development, production, use, and ultimate disposal of the item/system. The LCED may be in the form of an EA or an EIS, and must be supplemental to address additional significant environmental impacts as conditions change. The LCED will be prepared by the DA proponent/developer (or program manager) and is most frequently used within the materielresearch, development, and acquisition community. (g) Record of Decision (ROD). A public ROD is required under the provisions of 40 CFR 1505.2 after completion of an EIS. Nevertheless, the ROD is not considered to be an environmental document since the decision considers other factors in addition to environmental issues. (See \u00a7 651.32(i) for application.) \u00a7 651.15 Optional documents. The following additional documents may assist in the implementation of this regulation. These documents are optional, but their use is encouraged. (a) Environmental planning guide. Prepared prior to or at the outset of a major program concept exploration. It is a concise (for example, 10-page) document intended for use by the program planners and designers. It provides guidelines and supporting rationale by which planners and designers could prevent, avoid, or minimize adverse environmental effects through environmentally sensitive design and planning. Through appropriate language in the scope of work, contractors can be encouraged or required to use such an environmental planning guide. (b) En vironmental planning record. This records the progress and process of environmental considerations throughout a given program's development. Ideally, it is a document that is written when the program commences. There is no set form; it may be a journal with periodic entries, a file of memoranda, trip reports, and so forth. This document is a visible track record of how environmental factors have actually been considered and incorporated throughout the planning process. Through appropriate language in the scope of work, contractors can be encouraged or required to prepare an environmental planning record, or parts thereof. (c) Environmental monitoring report. This report is prepared at one or more points after program or action execution. Its purpose is to determine the accuracy of impact predictions. It can serve as the basis for adjustments in mitigation programs and to adjust impact predictions in future projects. Subpart D--Categorical Exclusions (CX) \u00a7 651.16 ' Introduction. (a) The use of CX is intended to reduce paperwork and delay and eliminate unnecessary EA and EIS preparation. CX is defined in the Glossary.(b) The following criteria will be used to determine those categories of actions that normally do not require either an EIS or EA: (1) Minimal or no individual or cumulative effect on environmental quality. (2) No environmentally controversial change to existing environmental conditions. (3) Similarity to actions previously examined and found to meet the above criteria. \u00a7 651.17 Determining when to use a CX. In order to use the CX provision, the proponent must take the following actions: (a) Determine whether the proposal is encompassed by one of the categories not normally requiring the preparation of an EA or EIS. (See Appendix A.) (b) Determine if there are any extraordinary circumstances that may result in the proposed action having an impact on the human environment that would require an EA or EIS. These circumstances include- (1) Greater scope or size than normally experienced for a particular category of action. (2) Potential for degradation, even though slight, of already existing poor environmental conditions. Also, initiation of degrading influence, activity, or effect in areas not already significantly modified from their natural condition. (3) Employment of unproven technology. (4) Presence of threatened or endangered species and their habitats, archaeological materials, historical places, or other protected resources, (5) Use of hazardous or toxic substances that may come in contact with the surrounding natural environment. Nevertheless, a categorical exclusion exists for use of hazardous and toxic substances under adequately controlled conditions within established laboratory buildings that are designed for, and in compliance with, regulatory standards. Adequately controlled conditions includes complying with AR 385-10 and all other applicable Army safety and preventive medicine regulations for the processing of hazardous and toxic substances, and complying with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for their disposal. (6) Proposed actions affecting areas of critical environmental concern. These include, but are not limited to, prime or unique agricultural lands, wetlands, coastal zones, wilderness areas, Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46337 aquifers, floodplains, or wild and scenic river areas. (c) Determine whether all the screening criteria in Appendix A are true for the proposal (d) If the proposed action qualifies for one of the CX, no analytical environmental document is necessary. However, if a REC (Figure 3) is required by the CX listing in Appendix A. a REC will be completed and signed by the proponent. Consultation between the proponent and the installation environmental coordinator is required. \u00a7 651.18 CX actions. Types of actions that normally qualify for CX are listed in Appendix A. \u00a7 651.19 Modification of the CX list. The Army list of CXs is subject to continual review and modification. Send, for review, requested additional modifications to the Army Environmental Office. Subordinate Army headquarters may not modify the CX list through supplements to this regulation. Upon approval, proposed modifications to the list of CXs will be published in the Federal Register-by the Army Environmental Office. This provides an opportunity for public review and comment. Subpart E-Environmental Assessment (EA) \u00a7 651.20 Introduction. An EA is made to determine the extent of environmental impacts of a project and decide whether or not those impacts are significant. It is not required for actions that are subject to categorical exclusion or exclusion from environmental review by law. (See 40 CFR 1508.9.) The EA is described in Conditions requiring an EA. An EA is required when the proposed action has the potential for- (a) Cumulative impact on environmental quality when combining effects of other actions or when the proposed action is of lengthy duration. (b) Release of harmful radiation or hazardous/toxic chemicals into the environment. (c) Violation of pollution abatement Standards. (d) Some harm to culturally or ecologically sensitive areas. \u00a7 651.22 Actions normally requiring an EA. The following actions normally require an EA: (a) Special field training exercise or test activity on Army land of a nature or magnitude not within the annual installation training cycle.(b) Military construction, including contracts for off-post construction. (c) An installation pesticide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, and rodenticide- use program. (d) Changes to established installation land use that generates impacts on the environment. (e) Proposed changes in doctrine or policy that may have a potential environmental impact (40 CFR 1508.18 (b) (I). (f) Repair or alteration projects affecting historically significant structures, archaeological sites, or places on, or meeting, the criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. (g) Acquisition or alteration of, or space for, a laboratory that will use hazardous chemicals, drugs, or biological or radioactive materials. (h) Actions that could potentially cause soil erosion, affect prime or unique farmland, wetlands, floodplains, coastal zones, wilderness areas, aquifers or other water supplies, or wild and scenic rivers. {i} New weapon systems development and acquisition, including the materiel acquisition, transition, and release processess. (j) Development of installation master plan. (k) Development of natural resource management plans (land, forest, fish, and wildlife). (1) Proposals that may lead to the excessing of Army real property. (in) Actions that take place in. or adversely affect, wildlife refuges. (n) Proposals for energy conversion through forest harvest. (o) Field activities on land not controlled by the military. This includes firing of weapons, missiles, or lasers over navigable waters of the United States, or extending 45 meters or more above ground level into the national airspace. It also includes joint air attack training that may require participating aircraft to exceed 250 knots at altitudes below 3000 feet above ground level. (p) An action with local or regional effects on energy availability. (q) An activity that affects any species on, or proposed for, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service list of Threatened and Endangered Plant and Animal Species. Also, activities affecting any species on an applicable State or territorial list of threatened or endangered species. (r) Production of hazardous or toxic materials. (s) Installation restoration projects undertaken in response to the CERCLA. (See \u00a7 651.8(a)(8) for a full discussion of the integration of NEPA and CERCLA/ SARA.)(t) Operations and Maintenance/ Army National Guard projects that will impact environmental quality. (u) Site specific deployment of life cycle systems meeting the threshold criteria for requiring an EA. (v) Special field training excercises or test activities off Army or DOD property that extend into the national airspace (45 meters above ground level). (w) Changes to established airspace use that generates impacts on the environment or socioeconomic systems, or creates a hazard to nonparticipants. \u00a7651.23 EA components. (a) The EA will be the responsibility of the proponent. The Army Environmental Office will advise and assist in the preparation of the EA. In the case of United States Army Reserve (USAR) environmental documentation, the supporting installation facility engineer is responsible for ensuring proper environmental documentation is prepared and will comply with the provisions of AR 140-475. The EA will include brief discussiona of-. (1) Purpose and need for the proposed action. (2) Description of the proposed action. (3) The alternatives considered [always including the \"no action\" alternative). (4) Affected environment (baseline conditions). (5) Environmental consequences of the proposed action and the alternatives. (6) Listing of agencies and persons consulted. (7) The conclusion, or finding, on whether the environmental impacts are significant. If the finding is that there are no significant impacts, a FNSI will be published. If the findinj is that impacts are potentially significant, the EA should state that a NOI will be published leading to preparation of an EIS. (b) The EA, the FNSI, and all other appropriate planning documents will be provided to the appropriate decisionmaker for review and consideration. The signature page for the EA and FNSI package will be signed by the decisionmaker to indicate his or her review and approval. \u00a7 651.24 Decision process. Every EA.results in a FNSI or a NOI to prepare an EIS. Initiation of a NOI to prepare an EIS should occur at any time in the decision process when significant effects are determined. (a) The FNSI is a separate document (40 CFR 1508.13) that briefly presents reasons why an action will not have a 46338 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules, and Regulations significant effect on the human environment and, thus, will not be the subject of an EIS. The FNSI will contain a summary of the EA or have the EA attached. If the EA is attached, the FNSI may incorporate it by reference, thus avoiding duplication of discussion. The FNSI will reference other relevant environmental documents that are being or have been prepared. The FNSI must contain the following: (1) The name of the action. (2) A brief description of the action (including any alternatives considered). (3) A short discussion of the anticipated environmental effects. (4) The facts and conclusions that have led to the FNSL (5) A deadline and POC for further information or receipt of public comments. (See \u00a7 651.35.) (b) The FNSI should not exceed two typewritten pages in length. (c) The FNSI will be made available to the public prior to initiation of the proposed action, unless it is excluded on a security basis. (See \u00a7 651.11 for security exclusions.) FNSIs that have national interest should be submitted with the proposed press release through command channels to Deputy of Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (DESOH) for approval and subsequent publication in the FR. FNSIs having national interest will be coordinated with.Office of the Chief of Public Affairs (OCPA). Local publication of the FNSI will not precede the FR publication. The text of the publication should be identical to the FR publication. (d) For actions of only regional or local interest, the FNSI will be publicized in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6(b) and \u00a7 651.12(b)(2) of this regulation. Distribution of the FNSI (30 days prior to intitiation of the proposed action) should include any agencies, organizations, and individuals who have expressed interest in the project and others whom the proponent and preparers (defined in the Glossary) deem appropriate, \u00a7 651.25 Public Involvement. (a)Environmental agencies, applicants, and the public should be involved to the extent practical in the preparation of an EA. When considering the extent practicable of public interaction (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), some of the factors to be weighed are- (1) Magnitude of the proposed project/ action. (2) Extent of anticipated public interest. (3) Urgency of the proposal. (4) Any relevant questions of national security classification.(b) See \u00a7 651.35 for additional public involvement information. \u00a7 651.26 Public availability. Documents incorporated into the EA or FNSI by reference will be available for public review. Where possible, use of public libraries is encouraged. Operating hours of the chosen depository should extend beyond normal business hours. \u00a7 651.27 Existing environmental assessments (EAs). EAs are dynamic documents. To ensure that the setting, actions, and effects described remain substantially accurate, the proponent or installation environmental officer will periodically review existing documentation (environmental impact assessment (EIA) or (EA)) as an action continues. Preparation of a new environmental document is necessary if substantive changes have occurred. Subpart E-Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) \u00a7 651.28 Introduction. An EIS is a public document with a primary purpose of ensuring that NEPA policies and goals are incorporated early into the programs and actions of Federal agencies. AnEIS is required to provide a full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts, Along with other project documentation, the EIS provides a basis for informed decisionmaking. Further, it allows public review and comment on the proposal. \u00a7 651.29 Conditions requiring an EIS. An EIS is required when a proponent, preparer, or approving authority determines that the proposed action has the potential to-- (a) Significantly affect environmental quality or public health or safety. (b) Significantly affect historic or archaeological resources, public parks and recreation areas, wildlife refuge or wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, or aquifers. (c) Have significant adverse effect on properties listed or meeting the criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or the National Register of Natural Landmarks. (The National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior maintains the National Register.) (d) Cause a significant impact to prime and unique farm lands, wetlands, floodplains, coastal zones, or ecologically or culturally important areas or other areas of unique or critical environmental concern.(e) Result in potentially significant and uncertain environmental effects or unique or unknown environmental risks. (f) Significantly affect a species or habitat listed or proposed for listing on the Federal list of endangered or threatened species. (g) Either establish a precedent for future action or represent a decision in principle about a future consideration with significant environmental effects. (h) Adversely interact with other actions with individually insignificant effects so that cumulatively significant environmental effects result. (i) Involve the production, storage, transportation, use, treatment, and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials that may have significant environmental impact. \u00a7 651.30 Actions normally requiring an EIS. The following actions normally require an EIS: (a) Significant expansion of a military facility, such as a depot, munitions plant, or major training installation. (b) Construction of facilities that have a significant effect on wetlands, coastal zones, or other areas of critical environmental concern. (c) The disposal of nuclear materials, munitions, explosives, industrial and military chemicals, and other hazardous or toxic substances that have the potential to cause significant enviionmental impact. (d) The life cycle development of new material such as weapon systems that requires the construction and operation of new fixed facilities or the significant commitment of natural resources. (e) Land acquisition, leasing or other actions that may lead to sinficant changes in land use. (0) Continental United States (CONUS) realignment or stationing of a brigade or larger table of organization and equipment (TOE) unit during peacetime (except where the only significant impacts are sbci6economic with no significant biophysical environmental impact). (g) Training exercises conducted outside the boundaries of an existing military reservation where significant environmental damage might occur. (h) Major changes in the mission of facilities either affecting areas of critical environmental concern or causing significant environmental impact. \u00a7 651.31 Format of the EIS. (a) The EIS must contain the following: (1) Cover sheet. (2) Summary. Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46339 (3) Table of contents. (4) Purpose of and need for the action. (5) Alternatives considered, including proposed action. , (6) Affected environmental (baseline conditions). (7) Environmental and socioeconomic consequences. (8) List of preparers. (9) Distribution list. (10) Index. (11) Appendixes (if any). (bJ The content of each section is discussed in greater detail in Appendix D.\u00a7 651.32 Steps In preparing and processing an EIS. (a) Notice of intent (NOI). (1) Prior to preparing an EIS{se Figure 4), a NOI will be published in the FR and in newspapers with appropriate or general circulation. in the Areas potentially affected by the proposed action. The Office of Legislative Liaison (OCLL) will be notified by the ARSTAF proponent of pending EISs so that congressional coordination may be effected. After the NOI is published in the FR, copies of the notice may also be distributed to agencies, organizations, and Individuals, as the responsible official deems appropriate.(2) Forward the NOI and the proposed press release to the HQDA proponent for coordination prior to publication. The ARSTAF proponent will coordinate the NOI with HQDA (Army Environmental Office, OCLL, and OCPA). The DESOH is the only person authorized to release an NOI to the FR for publication. A cover letter similar to Figure 5 will accompany the NOI. An example NOI is at Figure 6. The NOI initiates the scoping process; therefore, provide adequate response time for those wishing to comment on the NOI or participate in the scoping process.

Jefferson, CA. Agency: DOD, U.S. Army, Ft. Jefferson, California. Summary: Proposed Action: A series of three barracks are proposed for construction at Ft. Jefferson, California in order to provide adequate housing for bachelor enlisted personnel assigned to the installation. These facilities are proposed to replace existing substandard facilities for personnel who currently live in expensive rental units within the community or in inadequate quarters on the installation. The inadequate quarters are deficient in seismic design and do not meet DOD standards for privacy, spaCe, or security. The requirements for these projects are not the result of new or expanded missions. The location of the proposed barracks is between M and N Streets on Wisconsin Avenue. Alternatives: a. No Action b. Rehabilitation of existing facilities c. Alternate site locations Scoping Process: Comments received as a result of this notice will be used to assist the Army in identifying potential impacts to the quality of the environment. Individuals or organizations may participate in the scoping process by written comment or by attending a scoping meeting to be held on May 23, 1989, 8 PM, at the Norwood Avenue Elementary School, 123 Norwood Avenue. Written comments may be forwarded to: Commander, U.S. Army Engineer School, Attention: Director of Facilities Engineering, Fort Jefferson, California. Comments and suggestions should be received not later than 15 days following the public scoping meeting to be considered in the DEIS. Questions regarding this proposal may contact Ms. Jane McIntyre, (900) 555-9876. Lewis D. Walker Deputy for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health OASA (I&L) Figure 6. Sample Notice of Intent (NOI) BILUNG CODE 3710-0-C Federal Register I Vol. ~53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 18, 1988 I Rules and Regulations 46343 (j) Lead and cooperating agency dc..rrmincticn As soon as possible after the decision is made to prepare an EIS, the proponent, if necessary, will contact apFopriate Federal, State, and local agEnmcies to identify lead or caparat-ng agEncy respc-sibilities csncerning EIS p.-eparation. At this point, a public aeaL-s plan must be developed. In State AXNG actions that have any Federal funding, the National Guard Bureau (NGB} will be the lead agency for the purpose of Federal compliance with NEPA. The State may be either a joint lead or a cooperating agency, as det3rmined by NGB. (c) Scoping. If determined that Army is the lead agency, the proponent will begin the soaping process described in \u00a7 651.36. Portions of the scoping process may take place prior to publication of the NOL (d) Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) preparation and processing. (I) Preliminary DEIS (PDEIS]. Based on information obtained and decisions made during the scoping process, the proponent will prepare the PDEIS. Forward 15 copies of the PDEIS to the HQDA proponent for circulation to OASA (I&L), Office of the Assistant Chief of Engineers (OACE), Office of the Judge Advocate General (OTJAG). Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG), Office of the Chief of Public Affairs (OCPA), and other interested offices for review and comment. The PDEIS is then returned to the preparer for revision as required and printing of the DEIS for filing. (2) DEIS. The Army proponent will advise the DEIS preparer of the number of copies to be forwarded for final HQDA review (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section for distribution list] and those for filing with EPA. Distribution may include interested Congressional delegations and committees, governors, national environmental organizations, the DOD and Federal agency headquarters, and other selected entities. The Army proponent will prepare the FR NOA, the proposed news release, and the EPA filing letter for signature of the DESOH. When the DEIS has been formally approved by the DESOH, the HQDA proponent will notify the preparer to distribute the DEIS to the remainder of the distribution list. The DEIS must be distributed prior to, or simultaneous to, filing with EPA. The list includes Federal, State, regional, and local agencies, private citizens, and local organizations. The EPA will publish the NOA in the FR. The 45-day comment period begins on the date of the EPA notice in the FR.(e) Public review of DEIS. (1) The length of the DEIS public comment period will normally be no less than 45 days from publication of the NOA in the FR. If the statement is unusually long, circulate a summary with an attached list of locations where review of the entire DEIS may take place (for -example, local public libraries).. (2) However, EIS distribution must include the following: (i) Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved and any appropriate Federal, State, or local agency authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards. (ii) The applicant, if any. (iii] Any person, organization, or agency requesting the entire environmental impact statement. (3) Hold public meetings or hearings on the DEIS in accordance with the criteria established in 40 CFR 1506.6 (c) and (d) or for any other reason the proponent deems appropriate. News releases should be prepared and issued to publicize the meetings or hearings. (f) Response to comments. Incorporate responses to comments in the DEIS by modification of the text and/or written explanation. Where possible, group similar comments for a common response. The preparer or a higher authority may make individual response, if considered desirable.. (g) Prepare Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). If the changes in the DEIS are exclusively factual corrections, prepare and circulate only an errata sheet containing DEIS comments, responses, and changes. Nevertheless, the entire document and new cover sheet will be filed with EPA (40 CFR 1503.4(c)). If broader modifications are necessary, the proponent will prepare a preliminary FEIS incorporating these modifications. Processing the FEIS is essentially the same as the process outlined for the DEIS transmittal. The FEIS distribution must include any person, organization, or agency that submitted substantive comments on the EIS. Also, distribution to commenting agencies and the public must occur prior to, or simultaneously with, filing the NOA for the EIS with EPA. There is no need to invite public comment during the 30 day post-filing waiting period. (40 CFR 1503.1(b).) (h) Decision. Make no decision on a proposed action until 30 days after EPA has published the NOA of the FEIS in the FR, or 90 days after the NOA of the DEIS, whichever is later. EPA publishes NOAs weekly. Those NOAs ready for EPA by close of business Friday arepublished in the next Friday's issue of the FR. (i] Record of decision (ROD). When a decision is made, the decisionmaker will prepare a ROD (40 CFR 1505.2 and 1505.3] which will become a part of the environmental documentation presented for the final decision. Forward a copy of the signed ROD to the Army Environmental Office. The ROD will- (1) State the decision. (2) Identify all alternatives considered by the Army in reaching ita decision, specifying the preferred alternatives as well as the environmental alternatives, if they are not the same. The Army may discuss preferences among alternatives based on relevant factors including economic and technical considerations and agency statutory missions. (3) Identify and discuss all such factors, including any essential considerations of national policy that were balanced by the Army in making its decision. Because economic and technical analyses are balanced with environmental analysis, the agency preferred alternative will not necessarily be the environmentally preferred alternative. (4] State how those considerations entered into the final decision. (5) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the selected alternative have been adopted, and if not, why they were not. A monitoring and enforcement program will be adopted and summarized for any mitigation. (See Appendix F.) (j) Pre-decision referrals. 40 CFR Part 1504 specifies procedures to resolve Federal agency disagreements on the environmental effects of a proposed action, Pre-decision referrals apply to interagency disagreement on a proposed action's potential unsatisfactory effects. (k) Changes during preparation. If there are substantial changes in the proposed action, or significant new information relevant to environmental concerns during the proposed action's planning process, the proponent will prepare revisions or a supplement to any environmental document or prepare new documentation as necessary. (1) Mitigation. All measures planned to minimize or mitigate expected significant environmental impacts will be identified in the EIS. Implementation of the mitigation plan is the responsibility of the proponent (See Appendix F.) The proponent will make available to the public, upon request, the status and results of mitigation measures associated with the proposed action.Federal Register / VoL 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16,1988 / Rules and Regulations 46343 46344 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations (m) Implementing the decision. The Army may provide for monitoring to assure that its decisions are carried out and should do so in controversial cases or environmentally sensitive areas. (See Appendix F.) Mitigation and other conditions established in the EIS or during Its review, and comment as part of the decision, will be implemented by the lead agency or other appropriate consenting agency. The proponent will- (1) Include appropriate conditions in grants, permits, or other approvals. (2) Condition funding of actions on mitigation. (3) Upon request, inform cooperating or commenting agencies on the progress in carrying out adopted mitigation measures that they have proposed and that were adopted by the agency making the decision. (4) Upon request, make the results of relevant monitoring available to the public and Congress. (n) Supplemental EIS (SEIS). SEISs (40 CFR 1502.9(c)) are processed in the same way as draft and final EISs. Scoping is not required for an SEIS. \u00a7 651.33 Existing EIS. A newly proposed action must be the subject of a separate EIS. The proponent may extract and revise the existing environmental documents in such a way as to bring them completely up to date, in light of the new proposals. Such a revised EIS will be prepared and processed entirely under the provisionsof this regulation. If an EIS of another agency is adopted, It must be processed in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.3. \u00a7 651.34 Major Army command (MACOM) processing of an EIS. In certain cases where the scope of the EIS is limited, the HQDA proponent may authorize a MACOM to process an EIS. (a) NO When the NOI is forwarded to the HQDA proponent (\u00a7 651.32(a)(2)), the proponent may determine that the MACOM should accomplish EIS processing. The HQDA proponent will consult with the Army Environmental Office, who will gain approval from DESOH. Proponent will return the NO! with any comments and a letter authorizing the MACOM to process the EIS in accordance with the guidance in this chapter. The MACOM is responsible for preparing the NOI, proposed news release, and a transmittal letter as described in Figure 5, and for forwarding that material to the Army Environmental Office. After a review to ensure acceptability of the document, the OASA (I&L) will forward the NOI to the FR. (b) PDEIS When the PDEIS is staffed at the unit Headquarters, copies will be provided for concurrent review to the following HQDA elements to ensure that OGC, and the HQDA proponent.(c) Filing the EIS. The unclassified portions of the DEIS and FES will be filed with the EPA Federal Activities Office by forwarding five copies with a transmittal letter as described in Figure 7. An additional five copies will be sent to the applicable EPA regional office for its review of the proposed action. One copy will be forwarded to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) (Figure 8). Distribution of HQDA EIS copies will follow that of the PDEIS list. (See paragraph (b) of this section.) Copies will be coordinated for Congressional delegations and committees with the HQDA (OCLL) to meet Congressional notification procedures. Remaining distribution is for interested governors, Federal agency headquarters, national environmental organizations, regional, State and local agencies and organizations, and interested private citizens. The proponent is responsible for developing the distribution list; advice is available from the Army Environmental Office. A NOA may be published in the FR by forwarding the notice, a proposed news release, and a transmittal letter by the same method used for the NOI (See paragraph (a) of this section.) (d) ROD. At the time of decision, a ROD will be prepared. (40 CFR 1505.2 and 1505.3.) A copy of the ROD will be provided to the Army Environmental Office.

(a) The requirement (40 CFR 1506.6) for public involvement recognizes that all potentially affected parties will be involved, when practical, whenever developing environmental documentation. This requirement can be met at the very beginning of the environmental analysis and documentation process by developing a plan to include all affected parties. (See also AR 360-5.) The plan will include the following: (1) Information disseminated to local and installation communities through such means as news releases to local media, announcements to local citizens groups, and Commander's letters at each phase or milestone (more frequently if needed) of the project. Such information may be subject to Freedom of Information Act and operations security review. (2) Each phase or milestone (more frequently if needed) of the project will be coordinated with representatives of local, State, and Federal Government agencies. (3) Public comments will be invited and two-way communication channels will be kept open through various means as stated above. (4) Public affairs officers at all levels will be kept informed. (b) When an EIS is being prepared, public involvement is a requisite element of the scoping process (40 CFR 15(n.7(a)(1)), (c) Preparation of EAs will incorporate public involvement processes whenever appropriate (40 CFR 150.6). (d) Persons and agencies to be consulted include the following: (1) Municipal, township, and county elected and appointed officials. (2) State, county, and local government officials and administrative personnel whose official duties include responsibility for activities or components of the affected environment related to the proposed Army action. (3) Local and regional administrators of other Federal agencies or commissions that may either control resources potentially affected by the proposed action (for example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service); or who may be aware of other actions by different Federal agencies whose effects must be considered with the proposed Army action (for example, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)). (4) Members of identifiable population segments within the potentially affected environments, whether or not they haveclearly identifiable leaders or an established organization such as .farmers and ranchers, homeowners, small business owners, and Indian tribes. (5) Members and officials of those, identifiable interest groups of local or national scope that may have interest in the environmental effects of the proposed action or activity (for example, hunters and fishermen, Isaak Walton League, Sierra Club, and the Audubon Society). (6) Any person or group that has specifically requested Involvement in the specific action or similar actions. (e) The public involvement processes and procedures by which participation may be solicited include the following: (1) The direct individual contact process identifies persons expected to express an opinion and participate in later public meetings. Direct contact may also identify the preliminary positions of such persons on the scope of issues that the EIS will addiess. Such limited contact may suffice for all required public involvement, when the expected environmental effect is of very limited scope. (2) Smal workshops or discussion groups. (3) Larger public gatherings that are held after some formulation of the potential issues. The public is invited to express its views on the proposed courses of action. Public suggestions or' alternative courses of action not already identified may be expressed at these gatherings that need not be formal public hearings. (4) Identifying and applying other processes and procedures to accomplish the appropriate level of public involvement. (f) The meetings described in paragraph (e) of this section should not be public hearings in the early stages of evaluating a proposed action. Public hearings do not substitute for the full range of public involvement procedures under the purposes and intent of a above. (g) Public surveys or polls to identify public opinion of a proposed action will be performed. (AR 335-15, chapter 10). \u00a7 651.36 Scoplng process. (a) Introduction. The scoping process, required for EIS preparation (40 CFR 1501.7), should aid the proponent in determining the scope and significant issues related to the proposed action. The process requires appropriate public participation immediately following publishing the NOI in the FR. The Army policy is that EISs for legislative proposals significantly affecting the environment will go through scopingunless extenuating circumstances make it impractical. ( (b) Scoping procedures. Scoping procedures fall into preliminary, public interaction, and final phases. These * phases are discussed in \u00a7 \u00a7 651.37, 651.38, and 651.39, respectively. \u00a7651.37 Preliminary phase. In the preliminary phase, the proponent agency or office identifies as early as possible, how it will accomplish scoping and with whose involvement. Key points will be identified or briefly summarized as appropriate in the NOIs. The proponent will- (a) In the NOI, identify the significant issues to be analyzed in the EIS. (b) In the NOL, identify the office or person responsible for matters related to the scoping process. If they are not the same as the proponent of the action, make that distinction. (c) Identify the lead and cooperating agency, if-already determined (40 CFR 1501.5-6). (d) Identify the method by which the agency will invite participation of affected parties and identify a tentative list of the affected parties to be notified. (e) Identify the proposed method for accoihiplishing the scoping procedure. (f) Indicate the relationship between thd timing of the preparation of environxiiental analyses and the tentative planning and decisionmaking schedule including- -' (1) The scoping process itself. (2] Collecting or analyzing environmental data, including studies required of cooperating agencies. (3) Preparation of DEISs and FEISs. () Filing of the ROD. .(5) Taking the action. (6) For a programmatic EIS, preparing a general expected schedule for future specific implementing actions that will involve separate environmental analysis.. (g) If applicable, in the NOI, identify the extent to which the EIS preparation process is exempt from any of the normal procedural requirements of this regulation, including scoping. \u00a7 651.38 Public Interaction phase. (a) During this portion of the process, the proponent will invite comments from all affected parties and respondents to the NOI to assist in developing issues for detailed discussion in the EIS, Assistance in identifying possible participants is available from the Army Environmental Office. (b) In addition to the affected parties identified above, participants should include the following: 46348 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations (1) Technical representatives of the proponent. Such persons must be able to describe the technical aspects of the proposed action and alternatives to other participants. (2) One or more representatives of any Army-contracted consulting firm, If one has been retained to participate in writing the EIS or providing reports that the Army will directly use to create substantial portions of the RIS. (3) Experts in various environmental disciplines, if any area where impacts are foreseen is not already represented among the other scoping participants. (c) In all cases, provide the participants with information developed during the preliminary phase and with as much of the following information that may be available: (1) A brief description of the environment at the affected location. When descriptions for a specific location are not available, use general descriptions of the probable environmental effect. Also include the extent to which the environment has been modified or affected in the past (2) A descriptaon of the proposed alternatives. The description will be sufficiently detailed to enable evaluation of the range of impacts that may be caused by the proposed action and alternatives. The amount of detail that is sufficient will deperd on the stage of the development of the proposal, its magnitude, and its similarity to other actions with which participants may be familiar. (3) A tentative identification of \"any public environmental assessments and other environmental impact statements that are being or will be prepared that are related to but are not part of the scope of the impact statement under consideration\" (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)). (4) Any additional scoping issues or limitations on the EIS, if not already described during the preliminary phase. (d) The public involvement may begin with the NOI to publish an EIS. The NOI may indicate when and where a scoping meeting will take place and whom to contact to receive preliminary information, The purpose of the scoping meeting is to be an informal public meeting. It is a working session where the gathering and evaluation of information relating to potential environmental impacts can proceed. (e) Starting with the above information, the person conducting the scoping process will use input from any of the involved or affected parties. This will aid in developing the conclusions. The proponent determines the final scope of the BiS. If the proponent chooses not to require detailed treatment of significant issues or factorsin the EIS, in spite of relevant technical or scientific objections by any participant to the contrary, the proponent will clearly identify (in the environmental consequences section of the EIS) the criteria that were used to eliminate such factors from detailed consideration. \u00a7 651.39 The final phase. (a) The scope used in the preparation of DEIS consists of the determinations made by the proponent during and after the public interaction phase of the process, as follows: (1) The scope and the significant issues for detailed analysis in the EIS (40 CFR 1501.7(a)[2)). To determine the scope of EISs, the proponent will consider three types of actions, alternatives, and impacts. (2) The three actions (other than unconnected single actions) are as follows: (i) Connected actions, that are closely related and should be discussed in the same impact statement. Actions are connected if they automatically trigger other actions that may require EISs, cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously, are interdependent parts of a larger action, and depend on the larger action for their justificaton. (ii) Cumulatve acticns, when viewed with other proposed actions, have cumulatively significant impacts and should be discussed in the same impact statement. (iii) Similar actions, that have similarities that provide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences together, such as common timing or geography, may be analyzed in the EIS. Agencies should do so when the best way to assess such actions is to treat them in a single EIS. (3) The three alternatives are ao follows: (I) No action. (ii) Other reasonable courses of action. (iii) Mitigation measures (not in the proposed action). (4) The three types of impacts are as follows: (i) Direct. (ii) Indirect. (iii) Cumulative. (5) Indentification and elimination from detailed study of issues that are not significant or have been covered by prior environmental review. This narrows the discussion of these issues to a brief presentation of why they will not have a significant effect on the human environment. It may also provide a reference to their coverage elsewhere. (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(3)).(6) Allocation of assignments for preparation of the EIS among the lead and any cooperating agencies, with the lead agency retaining responsibility for the statement (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(4)). (7) Indication of any public EAs and other EISs, prepared by the Army or another Federal agency, related to, but not part of, the EIS under consideration. (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(5)). (8) Identification of any other environmental review and consultation requirements so the lead and cooperating agencies may prepare other required analyses and studies concurrently with the EIS. (40 CFR 1501.7(a)(6)). (b) As part of the scoping process the lead agency may- (1) Set time limits, as provided in - \u00a7 651.12(b), if they were not already indicated in the preliminary phase. (2) Prescribe overall page limits to the EIS in accordance with the CEQ regulations that emphasize conciseness. (c) All determinations reached by the proponent during the scoping process will be clearly conveyed to the preparers of the EIS in a Scope of Statement. The Scope of Statement will be made available to participants in the scoping process and to other interested parties on request. Any conflicts on issues of a scientific or technical nature that arise between the proponent and scoping participants, cooperating agencies, other Federal agencies, or preparers of the document will be identified during the scoping process and resolved or discussed by the proponent in the DEIS. \u00a7 651.40 AIdsto Information gathering. The proponent may use or develop graphic or other innovative methods to aid information gathering, presentation, and transfer during the three scoping phases. These include methods for presenting preliminary information to scoping participants, obtaining and consolidating input from participants, and organizing its own determinations on scope for use during preparation of the DEIS. \u00a7 651.41 Modifications of the scoping process. (a) If a lengthy period exists between a decision to prepare an EIS and the time of preparation, the proponent will Initiate the NOI at a reasonable time in advance of preparation of the DEIS. The NOI will state any tentative conclusions regarding the scope of the EIS made prior to publication of the NOL Reasonable time for public participation will be allowed before the proponent Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 [ Rules and Regulations 46349 makes any final decisions or commitments on the EIS. (b) The proponent of a proposed action may use scoping during preparation of environmental review documents other than EIS, if desired. The proponent may use the above procedures or may develop modified procedures at his or her discretion. Subpart H-Environmental Effects of Major Army Actions Abroad \u00a7 651.42 Introduction.

It should list all Federal permits, licenses, and other entitlements that must be obtained prior to proposal implementation. Further, a statement of compliance with the requirements of other Federal environmental protection laws will be included (40 CFR 1502.25). In order to simplify consideration of complex relationships, every effort will be made to present the summary of alternatives and their impacts in a graphic format with the narrative. This summary should not exceed 10 pages. D-3. Table of Contents This section will provide for the table of contents, list of figures and tables, and a list of all referenced documents, including a bibliography of references within the body of the EIS. The table of contents should have enough detail so that searching for sections of text is not difficult. D-4. The Purpose of and Need for the Action This section should clearly state the nature of the problem and discuss how the proposed action or range of alternatives would solve the problem. This section is designed specifically to call attention to the benefits of the proposed action. If a cost-benefit analysis has been prepared for the proposed action, It may be Included here, or attached as an appendix and referenced here. This section will briefly give the relevant background information on the proposed action and summarize its operational, social, economic. and environmental objectives. D-5. Alternatives Considered This section presents all reasonable alternatives and their environmental impacts. An examination of each specific proposal in clear terms is required. This section should be written in simple, nontechnical language for the lay reader. A no action alternative will be included (40 CFR 1502.14(d)). For actions other than construction, the term no action is often misleading because a continuation of the status quo is implicit. This section needs no examination of the status quo. A preferred alternative need not be identified in the DEIS; however, a preferred alternative generally must be included in the FETS (40 CFR 1502.14(e)). A simple title or a letter or numerical symbol may be used for each of the discussed alternatives (for example, alternative A). Reference to the title or designation will be continued uniformly throughout the document in the appropriate sections. The environmental impacts of the alternatives will be presented in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among the options that are provided the decisionmaker and the public (40 CFR 1502.14). The information should be summarized in a brief, concise manner. The use of tabular or matrix format is encouraged to provide the reviewer with an at-a-glance review. In sum, the following points are required:,(a) A description of all reasonable alternatives including' the preferred action, alternatives beyond DA jurisdiction (40 CFR 1502.14(c)), and the no action alternative. (b) A comparative presentation of the environmental consequences of all reasonable alternative actions including the preferred alternative. (c) A description of the mitigation measures nominated for incorporation into the proposed action and alternatives, as well as mitigation measures that are available but not incorporated. (d) Listing of any alternatives that were eliminated from detailed study. A brief discussion of the reasons for which each alternative was eliminated. D-6. Affected Environment This section will contain information about existing conditions in the affected areas necessary to understand the potential effects of the alternatives under consideration (40 CFR 1502.15). Environments created by the implemented proposal will be included as appropriate. Affected elements could include, for example, biophysical characteristics (ecology and water quality); land use and land use plans; architectural, historical, and cultural amenities; utilities and services; and transportation. This section will not be encyclopedic. It will be written clearly and the degree of detail for all points covered will be related to the significance and magnitude of expected impacts. Elements not impacted by any of the alternatives need only be presented in summary form or referenced. D-7. Environmental and Socioeconomic Consequences This section of the EIS forms the scientific and analytic basis for the summary comparison of effects discussed in D-5. The * following will be discussed (40 CFR 1502.16): (a) Direct effects and their significance. Include in the discussion the direct impacts on human health and welfare and on other forms of life and related ecosystems. Examples of direct effect might include noise from military helicopter operations or the benefits derived from the installation of wet scrubbers to meet air quality control standards. (b) Indirect effects and their significance. Include here socioeconomic impacts. Many Federal actions attract people to previously unpopulated areas and indirectly induce pollution, traffic congestion, and haphazard land development. Conversely, other actions may disperse the existing population. Aircraft noise often affects future development patterns, and air pollution abatement operations may result in secondary water pollution problems. (c) Possible conflicts between the proposed actions and Federal, regional, State, and local (including indian tribe) land and airspace use plans, policies, and controls for the area concerned. Compare the land use aspects of the proposed action and-discuss possible conflicts, such as siting an extremely noisy activity adjacent to a residential area, leasing land for purposes inconsistent with State wildlife management, or creating conflicts with prime and unique farmland policies. (d) The environmental effects of alternatives, including the proposed action.(1) Impacts of the alternatives, including a worst case analysis where there are gaps in relevant information or scientific uncertainty. (2) Adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented. Include the relationship between short-term uses of the human environment and the maintenance and enhancement'of long-term productivity. The section should discuss the extent to which the proposed action and its alternatives involve short-term vs. long-term environmental gains and losses. In this context, short-term and long-term do not refer to any rigid time period and should be viewed in terms of the environmentally significant consequences of the proposed action. Thus, short-term can range from a very short period of time during which an action takes place to the expected life of a facility. (a) Energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures. Consult the Energy Resource Impact Statement (AR 11-27), when applicable, to satisfy this requirement. Account for the energy consumption of each proposed alternative and associated economics. Discuss, where appropriate, the uses of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources. Conservation techniques that could attenuate energy consumption should also be discussed within this section; for example, the use of insulation for newly constructed family housing that would reduce the long-term consumption of fuel oil or natural gas. (f) Natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential of various mitigation measures. Include discussion of any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources that would be. involved in the proposal should it be implemented. The term resources should include- (1) Materials. Discuss materials in short supply such as metals and wood, but do not include materials that are plentiful or have competitive alternatives (for example, aggregate or fill materials). (2) Natural. Discuss the use of natural resources resulting in irrevocable effects such as ecosystem imbalance, destruction of wildlife, loss of prime and unique farmlands. Specifically include consumption of natural energy resources in short supply, such as oil or natural gas. (3) Cultural. Discuss destruction of human interest sites, archaeological and historical, scenic views or vistas, or valued open space. Reiterate lasting socioeconomic effects the proposed action might have on the surrounding community. (g) Urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the design of the built environment, including reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures. Discuss the effect on adjacent neighborhoods and the city at large. Examine the effects on physical design features (also known as the built environment) and resultant impacts on social interaction areas such as privacy, public opinion, personnel perceptions, and other aspects of the social environment. Review the 46354 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations reuse potential of existing building space and' its time-use allocation, usually referred to as time and spatial management. (Time and spatial management allows for conservation of energy and other resources by discouraging new construction and operation until all existing building and time allocations have been fully scrutinized for alternate reuse.) (h) Means to mitigate adverse environmental effects. Include mitigation not already included as part of the various alternatives. Also, specify migitations that require action by other agencies or outside parties. )-& List of Preparers The EIS will list the names of its preparers, together with their qualifications (expertise, experience, and professional disciplines.) (40 CFR 1502.17). Include those people who were primarily responsible for preparing (research, data collection, and writing) the EIS or significant background or support papers, and basic components of the statement. When possible, the people who are responsible for a particular analysis, as well as an analysis of background papers, will be identified. If some or all of the preparers are contractors' employees, they may be identified as such. Identification of the firm that prepared the EIS is not, by itself, adequate to meet the requirements of this point. Normally, the list will not exceed two pages. D-0. Distribution List For the DEIS, a list will be prepared indicating from whom review and comment is requested. The list will include public agencies and private parties or organizations. The FEIS will normally only list those who have commented or shown an interest in the proposed action. D-I0. Index The index will be an alphabetical list of topics in the EIS, especially of the types of effects induced by the various alternative actions. Reference may be made to either page number or paragraph number, D-11. Appendices If an agency prepares an appendix to an EIS, the appendix will- (a) Consist of material prepared in connection with an EIS (as distinct from material that is not so prepared and incorporated by reference). (b) Consist only of material that substantiates any analysis fundamental to an impact statement. (c) Be analytic and relevant to the decision to be made. (d) Be circulated with the EIS or readily available upon request. Appendix E-Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508)Appendix F-Implementing a Monitoring and Methodology Program 1 F-I. Mitigation .... (a) The 1978 CEQ regulations for implementing NEPA recognizes the following five means of mitigating an environmental impact: (1) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action. (2) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and Its implementation. (3) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the effect on the environment. (4) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the* action. (5) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments (40 CFR 1508.20). (b) The intention of mitigation is to reduce the effects of the action on the environment. The five means of mitigation (see (a), above) are discussed in (1) through (5) below. (1) Avoidance. This method avoids environmental impact by not performing certain activities; for example, allowing tracked vehicles to cross only at designated improved stream crossings. This restriction would reduce the effects on a stream resulting from random access, such as increased turbidity caused by bank erosion and bottom disturbance caused by the tracks. (2) Limitation of action. The extent of an impact can be reduced by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action; for example, changing the fring time or the number of rounds fired on artillery ranges to reduce the noise impact on nearby residents. In the example n (a) above, the number of authorized stream crossings would have been limited or minimized. (3) Restoration of the environment. This method restores the environment to its previous condition or better. Movement of troops and vehicles across vegetated areas often destroys vegetation. This impact can be mitigated by either reseeding or replanting the areas with native plants after the exercise. (4) Preservation and maintenance operations. This method designs the action so as to reduce adverse environmental effects. Examples include maintaining erosion control structures, using air pollution control devices, and encouraging car pools in order to reduce transporation effects such as air pollution. energy consumption, and traffic congestion. (5) Replacement. This method replaces the resource or environment that will be impacted by the action. Replacement can occur in-kind or otherwise; for example, replace deer habitat In the project area with deer habitat in another area; or, replace fisheries habitat with deer habitat. This replacement can occur either on the site of impact or at another location. This type of mitigation is often used in water resources I From: John Fittipaldi, at al.. Handbook for Environmental Impact Analysts and Planning, Technical Report N-130, U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA-CERL), October 1982, pp. 133-143.projects. For example, if an action were destroying some of the installation's best deer habitat, a potential mitigation would be developing another section of the installation into deer habitat. This is an example of an in- kind replacement at a different site. F-2. Identification of Mitigation Techniques (a) Introduction. Identifying and evaluating mitigation techniques involves using experts familiar with the predicted environmental impacts. A single mitigation measure will often alleviate several different impact. (b) Sources of information. Many potential sources of information exist concerning the mitigation of various environmental effects. The following sources of information are available on post: Other sources are as follows: (1) Within the DA, there are sources such as the Army Environmental Hygiene Agency (AEHA), the major Army command (MACOM) environmental office, the Army Environmental Office, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) research laboratories (for example, U.S. Construction Engineering Research Laboratory [USA-CERL, U.S. Army Waterways Experiment Station, and U.S. Cold Regions Research Laboratory), USACE Huntsville Division, and the military assistance offices In certain districts. (2) State agencies are another potential source of information. The appropriate POC within these agencies may be obtained from the installation environmental office. (3) Another source is directories such as USA-CERL Technical Report N-40,2 as discussed in Engineering Technical Note 79- 8.8 (4) Another source on mitigation procedures is Ramificitions/Mitigation statements from USA-CERL's Environmental Impact Computer System (EICS),* (5) Local interest groups may also be able to help identify potential mitigation measures. (c) Example mitigation techniques. Several different mitigation techniques have been used on military installations for a number of years. The following examples illustrate the variety of possible measures: (1) There are maneuver restrictions in areas used extensively for tracked vehicle training. These restrictions are not designed to infringe on the military mission, but rather to reduce the amount of damage to the training area. (2) Aerial seeding has been done on some installations to reduce erosion problems. (3) Changing the time and/or frequency of operations has been used. This may involve changing the season of the year, the time of day, or even day of the week for various activities. This avoids noise impacts as well I R. Lacey, at al., Compendium of Administrators of Land Use and Related Programs, Technical Report N-40/ADA057226 (USA-CERL July 1978). 3 Coordination with Federal and State Land Use Agencies, Engineer Technical Note 76-4 (Department of the Army (DA), 8 February 1979). 4 L V.

Federal Register I Vol. 53, No. 221 I Wednesday, November 16, 1988 I Rules and Regulations 46355 as qesthetic, transportation, and some ecological problems. (4) Reducing the effects of construction has involved using techniques that keep heavy equipment away from protected trees and quickly reseeding areas after construction. (d) Mitigation alternatives. Consideration of all practical mitigation alternatives are considered. The emphasis is not on what can be theoretically accomplished, but on what can be accomplished for each alternative. (1) Practical mitigations are those that the proponent can accomplish with the project's constraints such as manpower and money. Practical measures must be defined at the installation level; what may be practical on one post or at one time may not be practical on another. A number of items determine what is practical, including military mission, manpower restrictions, cost, institutional barriers, technical feasibility, and public acceptance. Practicality does not necessarily ensure resolution of conflicts among these items, rather it is the degree of conflict that determines practicality. (2) The previous examples involved some amount of conflict in all these areas. Although mission conflicts-are inevitable, they are not insurmountable. Therefore, the proponent should be cautious about declaring all mitigations impracticable and should carefully consider any manpower requirements. This may be a greater restriction than military mission conflicts. (3) There is no standard rule of thumb applicable to mitigation activities. The key point concerning both the manpower and costconstraints is that unless money is actually budgeted and manpower assigned, the mitigation does not exist. This will require coordination by the proponent office early in the process to allow enough time to get the mitigation activities into the budget cycle. If the mitigation is not funded on schedule with the action, the action can be judicially stopped. (4) Mitigations that do not fall directly within the definition of practical must still be considered, including those to be accomplished by other agencies. The proponent must coordinate with these agencies so that they can plan to obtain the necessary manpower and funds. Mitigations that were considered but rejected must be discussed, along with the reason for the rejection, within the EIS. F-3. Monitoring Monitoring is an integral part of any mitigation system and a way to examine an enviromental mitigation. The two basic types of monitoring are as follows: (a) Enforcement monitoring. Enforcement monitoring ensures that mitigation is being performed as described in the environmental document and ensuring that mitigation requirements and penalty clauses are written into any contracts. It also includes ensuring that these provisions are enforced. Before mitigation can take place on-post, it must be budgeted, scheduled, and the necessary manpower must be assigned. Any changes required in post regulations must be completed and enforced. The actualmitigation (for example, aerial seeding of a training area) must be performed. Enforcement monitoring involves the monitoring of all these activities. (b) Effectiveness monitoring. Effectiveness monitoring measures the success of the mitigation effort and/or the environmental effect. This must be a scientifically based quantitative investigation. Generally, qualitative measurements are not acceptable. However, it is not necessary to measure everything that may be affected by the action, only enough information to judge the method's effectiveness. F-4. Establishing a Monitoring System Establishment of a monitoring system must .involve all appropriate offices that will be involved in its implementation. When evaluating several different potential monitoring systems, the ability to perform the monitoring is the most critical factor. This means that manpower-both on post and outside expertise-must be available. Sufficient funds must also be available for the monitoring process. Figures F-1 through F-3 illustrate the steps in establishing a monitoring system. Figure F-1 is designed to help select the type of monitoring system needed. Figure F-2 shows the responsibilities of the lead agency in establishing an enforcement monitoring program. Figure F-3 illustrates the steps necessary to establish an effectiveness monitoring program.

Type of Monitoring Program AR 200-1 and other laws and regulations help determine the types of monitoring program. There are five basic considerations for monitoring programs (Figure F-lit (a) Legal requirements- Permits farsome actions will require that a monitoring system be established, for exampLe, dredge and fill permits from the Corps of Engineer. These will generally require both enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program& (b) Protected resources. These include Federal- or State-listed endangered or threatened species, important historc or archaeological sites (whether or not these are included on the National Register of Histric Places), wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and other public or private protected resources. Private protected resources include areas such as Audubon Societ Refuges, Nature Conservancy lands. or any other land that would be protected by law if it were under Government ownership, but is privately owned. If any of these resources are affected, an effectiveness and enforcement monitoring program must be undertaken int conjunction with the Federal, State, or local agency that manages the type of resource. (c) Major environmental controversy. If a controversy remains regrading the! effect of an action or the effectiveness of a mitigation, an enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program must be undertaken. Controversy includes not only scientific, disagreement about the mitigation's effectiveness, but also public interest or debate. (d) Mitigation outcome. The probability of the mitigation-'s success must be carefilfy considered. The proponent must know if the mitigation has been successful elsewhere. The validity of the outcome should be confirmed by expert opinion. However, the proponent should note that a certain technique, such as artificial' seeding with the natural vegetation, that may' have worked successfully in one area, may not work in another. (e) Changed conditions. The find con3ideration is whether any condition, such as the environmental setting,, have changed (for example a change in local land use around the area, or a change in project activities, such as: increased amount af acreage being used or an increased movement of troops). Such changes will require preparation of a supplemental impact evaluation and additional monitoring, tinone of these conditions are met (that is. requirement by law, protected resources,. no major controversy is involved, effectiveness of the mitigation is known, and the environmental or project conditions have rot changed), then only an enforcement monitoring programlis needed. Othevwise. both an enforcement and effectiveness monitoring program. will be required. F-8. Enforcement Monftoring Proganr Development The development of an enforcement monitoring program is governed by who will actually perform the mitigation (Figure F-2). The following three different groups may actually perform the work: a contractor, a cooperating agency, or a lead, agency (in- house). However, the lead agency is'ultimately responsible for performing any mitigation activities. (a) Contract performance. Several provisions must be made in work to be performed by contract. The lead agency must ensure that contract provisions include the performance of the mitigation activity and that penalty crauses are written, into the contracts. It must' provide. for timely inspection of the mitigation measures and is responsible for enforcing all contract' provisions. (b) Cooperating agency performance, The lead agency must ensure that if a cooperating agency performs the work, it understands its role in the mitigation. T e lead agency must determine and agree upon how the mitigation measures will be funded. It most also ensure that any necessary finma? paperwork such as cooperating agreements are complete. (c) Lead agency performance., If the lead agency performs the mitigation, the proponent has. several responsibilities to- (1) Ensure that needed tasks- are performed. (2) Provide appropriate funding in the project budget. (3) Make arrangements for necessary manpower allocations. (4) Make any necessary changes in the agency (installation) regulations (such as, environmental or range regulations]. (d) Results. In any case, whether tNe mitigation is performed by contract a cooperating agency, or the lead agency, all results will be sent to the Public Affaft Office and the Environmental Office on post. F-7. Effectiveness MonitoringProgram Development Effectiveness monitoring is the most difficult to establish (Figure F-3). The responsible agent, such as the Director of Training, should coordinate the monitoring. with the Environmental Office. (a) Determination of what is to be monitored. The first step in this type of monitoring program is to determine: what must be monitored. This determination should be based an criteria discussed during the establishment of the system; forexample, the legal requirements, protected resources,. area of controversy, known effectiveness, or changed conditions. Initially, this can be a very broad statement, such as reductionaf impacts on a particular stream by a. combination of replanting, erosion control devices, and range regulations.. (b) Finding expertise. The next step is finding the expertise necessary to establish the monitoring system. The expertise may be available on-post; Table F-1 lists potential sources on a military installation. If it is not available, it must be obtained from an outside source. Directories such as USA- CERL Technical Report N-40 s may provide -R. Lacey, et al. Compendium of, Administrators of Land Use and Related Programs, Technica Report N-40/ADA05226 LISA-CERL. 1978l.the needed informatm. In addiicrr,, local univerdties may have spectalists and local interest groups who can identify experts within a particular field. This may e particaarlry hep if a mitigation is considered controversfaf. (c. Establishment of & proignr.. Aftr a source of expertise Is located, the program can be established,, using the foRlowing five technical criteria: (1] Any parameters used must be measurable% for example, the monitor must be quantitative and statistically sound. (2) A baseline study must be completed before the monitoring begins in order to identify the actual state of the system prior to any disturbance. (3 The monitoring system must have a control, so that it can isolate the effects of the mitigation procedures from effects originating outside the action. (41 The system's parameters and means of measuring them must be replicable. (5) Parameter results must be available in a timely manner so that the decisionmaker can take any necessary corrective action before the effects are irreversible. Table F-T.

First, not every mitigation has to be monitored separately. The effectiveness of several mitigation actions can be determined by one measurable parameter. For example, the turbidity measurement from a stream can include the combined effectiveness of mitigation actions such as reseeding, maneuver restrictions, and erosion control devices. However, if a method combines several parameters and a critical change is noted, each mitigation measurement must be examined to determine the problem. (e) Initiation of program. The next step is to initiate the monitoring program, In most cases, a monitor should be established well before the action begins, particularly when biological variables are being measured and investigated. At this stage, any necessary contracts, funding, and manpower assignments must be initiated. (f) Sample collection, data analysis, and coordination. The next step in the monitoring program is sample collection and data analysis. A nontechnical summary of the data analysis should be provided to the Public Affairs Office, which will handle routine information requests related to the program. Technical results from the analysis should be sent to the installation environmental office, which will coordinate them with the proponent. Other related coordination with the concerned public and other agencies, as arranged through development of the mitigation plan, will be handled through the environmental office. (g) Continuation of program. (1) If the mitigations are effective, the monitoring should be continued. However, even if a noneffective result is obtained, a nontechnical summary should still be sent to the Public Affairs Office, The Environmental Office and the responsible group should reexamine the mitigation measures with the experts. The problem may be either inadequacy of the mitigation measure, in the performance, or in the monitoring. (2) Once the problem is identified, the responsible group and the experts shoulddetermine whether more detailed information is needed, whether the monitoring is being implemented incorrectly, or whether the mitigation is inadequate. (3) After the problem is resolved, the group must determine whether a different monitoring system should be established. If the old program is adequate, it should be continued; however, if a different program is required, then a new system must be established.

Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Rules and Regulations 46361 HQDA proponent As the principal planner, implementer, and decision authority for a proposed action, the HQDA proponent is responsible for the substantive review of the environmental documentation and its thorough consideration in the decisionmaking process. Major Federal action Reinforces, but does not have a meaning independent of, \"significantly affecting the environment,\" and will be interpreted in that context. A Federal proposal with \"significant effects\" requires an environmental impact statement, whether it is \"major\" or not. Conversely, a \"major federal action\" without\"significant effects\" does not necessarily require an EIS. Preparers Personnel from a variety of disciplines who write environmental documentation in clear and analytical prose. They are primarily responsible for the accuracy of the document.Proponent Proponent identification is dependent on the nature and scope of a proposed action. as follows: (1) Any Army structure may be a proponent. For instance, the installation/ activity Facility Engineer (FE)/Director of Engineering and Housing becomes the proponent of installation-wide Military Construction Army (MCA) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Activity; Commanding General, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) becomes the proponent of a change in initial entry training. The proponent may or may not be the preparer. (2) In general. the proponent is the lowest level decisionmaker. It is the unit, element, or organization that is responsible for initiating and/or carrying out the proposed action. The proponent has the responsibility to prepareand/or secure funding for preparation of the environmental documentation. Significantly affecting the environment An action, program or project that would violate existing pollution standards; cause water, air, noise, soil or underground pollution; impair visibility for substantial periods of any day; cause Interference with the reasonable peaceful enjoyment of property or use of property; create an interference with visual or auditory amenities; limit multiple use management programs for an area; cause danger to the, health, safety, or welfare of human life; or cause irreparable harm to animal or plant life in an area. Significant beneficial effects also do occur and must be addressed if applicable (See 40 CFR 1508.27.)

ACTION: First six-month update of list of Federal facilities under CERCLA Section 120(c) and revisions to initial list. SUMMARY: Section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and-Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1988 (SARA), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket that contains certain information regarding Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or have potential hazardous waste problems. CERCLA requires that the docket be updated every six months as new facilities are reported to EPA by Federal agencies. The following list identifies the Federal facilities to be included in the first six- month update of the docket. For each Federal facility that appears on the docket, the responsible Federal agency must complete, at a minimum, a Preliminary Assessment (PA) and, if warranted, a Site Inspection (SI) to determine if response actions are necessary. In addition to the update list, this notice includes a section comprising revisions to the initial list published earlier. At the time of publication of this notice, the new total number of Federal facilities listed on the docket is 1,170. DATE: This list is current as of October 3, 1988. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Federal Facilities Docket Hotline, Telephone: (800) 548-1016 toll-free. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Table of Contents 1. Introduction I. Revisions to the Initial Docket Ill. Process for Compiling the Updated Docket IV. Facilities Not Included V. Information Contained on Docket Listing I. Introduction The Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket (\"docket\") was required to be established under Section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9620(c), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986(SARA). The docket contains information on Federal facilities that is submitted by Federal agencies to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\" or \"the Agency\") under sections 3005, 3010, and 3016 of the Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6925, 6930, and 6937, and under Section 103 of CERCLA. The purpose of the docket is three-fold. (1) to identify the universe of Federal facilities that must be evaluated to determine if they pose risk to public health and the environment sufficient to warrant a response action and/or inclusion on the National Priorities List; (2) to compile and maintain the information submitted to EPA on these facilities under the provisions listed in Section 120(c) of CERCLA; and (3) to provide a mechanism to make this information available to the public. The initial list of Federal facilities to be included in the docket was published on February 12, 1988 (53 FR 4280). This list must be updated every six months, beginning with the publication of the February notice, to include new facilities on the docket that are subsequently reported to EPA by Federal agencies. The first six month update of the docket is being published today. The definition of facility for docket purposes remains unchanged from that employed for the initial docket list (see 53 FR 4280 (1988)). Today's notice is divided into two major sections: \"Docket Revisions\" and \"Docket Update\". The Docket Revisions section is a listing of corrections that are being made to the initial docket published on February 12, 1988. The Docket Update section is the list of newly identified facilities that have been reported to EPA since the compilation of the initial docket. The information submitted to EPA on each Federal facility, as required by the above provisions, is contained in docket repositories located in the EPA Regional office where the facility is found. (See 53 FR 4280 (1988) for a description of the information required under these provisions.) All docket repositories are currently operational and available to the public. Each repository contains the documents submitted to EPA under the reporting provisions (and/or correspondence relevant to the reporting provisions) indicated for each facility. A complete national index of the information found in the Regional docket repositories will be maintained at EPA Headquarters in Washington, DC, and made available to the public. This index will also be available for public review at each Regional repository. Contact the Federal Facilities Docket Hotline for information on howto arrange for review and copying of specific documents. II. Revisions to the Initial Docket Revisions to the initial docket can be divided into three overall categories: (1) facilities being removed from the list; (2) facilities being added to the list; and (3) corrections. Each entry in the Revisions section has been labelled with a code indicating the reason for the change. A key to these codes is found below. Necessary revisions to correct the initial docketwere identified by both EPA and Federal agencies. These revisions vary from simple address and spelling changes to facility name changes and ownership corrections. Many are simply typographical or typesetting errors. The affected Federal. agencies have been notified previously of the revisions being published today. Facilities are being removed from the docket for a number of reasons, such as the facility is not Federally owned, incorrect reporting of hazardous waste activity, change in Federal ownership, exemption as a Small Quantity Generator (SQG), etc. Facilities being removed will no longer be required to conduct a Preliminary Assessment (PA) as required by CERCLA Section 120(d) for docket facilities. Some facilities are being added to the docket now because they were inadvertently not included on the initial list. In most cases, the additions are the result of new information obtained by EPA indicating that a facility should have been listed in the February notice. For all facilities being added in this section, the responsible agency will have 18 months from the date of this publication to complete the required PA and Site Inspection (SI), if warranted. EPA is today clarifying its policy of not listing SQGs under RCRA on the docket. The intent of the original policy was to exempt facilities from docket listing that were solely SQGs and had never produced more than 1,000 kg in any month. EPA did not include on the initial docket a number of SQGs that had also reported under RCRA Section 3016 or CERCLA Section 103. The Agency believes that if a facility reports a release under Section 103 or other hazardous waste activity, it is no longer considered to be solely a SQG. EPA believes that these facilities must be assessed to determine if cleanup actions are necessary. Therefore, today the Agency is adding to the docket SQGs that had previously reported to EPA under other reporting provisions. Again, these facilities will have 18 months to complete the appropriate assessment.46364 Federal Reeister I/Vol. 53. No. 221 I Wednesday, November 16, 1988 I Notices466 The corrections subsection is shown in a slightly different format due to the nature of the revisions, which include typographical errors, name and address changes, and changes in the reporting mechanisms. For each facility, the original entry as it appeared in the February notice is shown directly above the corrected entry for easy comparison. These entries are organized alphabetically by state instead of by Federal agency. In the process of compiling the documents for the Regional repositories, EPA identified a number of facilities that had previously submitted a PA report, SI report, or in the case of some Defense facilities, an Installation Restoration Program (IRP) report, yet had not submitted a Section 103 notification form. Section 120(c)(3) of CERCLA requires that EPA include information submitted under Section 103 in the docket. In general, Section 103 requires any person who has knowledge of known, suspected, or likely releases of hazardous substances from a facility to notify EPA. Thus, the Agency believes that information it has received by means of the above-mentioned reports -should be included in the docket regardless of the absence of formal Section 103 notification. Therefore, the docket record for each of these facilities is being corrected to indicate this reporting. III. Process for Compiling the Updated Docket In compiling the newly-reported facilities for the update being published today, EPA extracted the names, addresses, and identification numbers of facilities from the three EPA data bases (the RCRA Section 3016 inventory data base, the Hazardous Waste Data Management System, and the CERCLA data base) that contain Federal facility information submitted'under the four provisions listed in Section 120(c). Extensive computer checks compared the initial docket list with the information obtained from the above data bases to determine which facilities were, in fact, newly reported and qualified for inclusion on the update. The Agency has found it extremely difficult to reconcile the file structures and reporting differences in the various data bases for docket purposes. Consequently, it is possible that some individual sites were included in this update instead of, or in addition to, the overall facility as required. It is also possible that state-owned or privately- owned facilities have been included in spite of the quality assurance efforts that EPA has undertaken. These potential problems are the result ofhistorical procedures used to report and track Federal facility data and the Agency is working to resolve them. Federal agencies are requested to contact EPA's Docket Coordinator in writing at the following address if revisions to the update information being published are necessary: Federal Facilities Docket Coordinator, US EPA, 401 M Street SW. (OS-503), Washington, DC 20460. IV. Facilities Not Included EPA is not including the following categories of facilities in the docket at this time: 1. Facilities formerly owned by a Federal agency and now privately owned. However, facilities that are now owned by another Federal agency will remain on the docket with the responsibility resting with the current owner. The agency is still considering listing formerly-owned DOD facilities on the docket at a later time. However, a number of related policy issues have not yet been resolved. Therefore, formerly- owned facilities will not be listed on this update. 2. Any facilities not currently owned by a Federal agency. For example, facilities that are operated by the Federal government under state or private ownership will not be listed on the docket. 3. Small Quantity Generators that have never produced more than 1,000 kg in any month and have not reported spills under Section 103 or other hazardous waste activities under Section 3016. 4. Facilities that are solely transporters as reported under RCRA Section 3010. 5. Any facilities not reported by a Federal agency. The agency will be collecting additional information in the coming months on whether or not to include one or more of these categories in future updates to the docket, and may solicit public comment on the issues at a later date. V. Information Contained on Docket Listing As discussed above, the information below is divided into two separate sections. The first section is comprised of revisions to the list published on February 12, 1986,. The revisions Section Is broken into the following categories: facility removals, facility additions, ' corrections, and miscellaneous. Each facility on the revisions list is coded. This code refers to the code key preceding the lists, and indicates the specific reason(s) for revision. The second section is the list of newfacilities (not facilities added as corrections) that are being added at this six month update. All facilities added to the docket today, either as revisions or newly added facilities have a \"date of listing\" indicator, shown as \"* *\" In this column. All facilities with \" .\" in the date of listing column must submit PAs and SIs, if warranted, to EPA within 18 months of the date of this publication. This includes any facility changing responsible agencies (codes 21 and 22). These reports should be submitted to the CERCLA Federal Facility Coordinator in the appropriate EPA Regional office. Facilities listed in the corrections subsection do not have a date of listing column since the correction(s) for these facilities as shown in this notice do not affect the statutory assessment deadline; these facilities should have already 'submitted the required assessment(s) to EPA by April 17, 1988. Facilities in both the revisions section and the update section are organized by State and then grouped alphabetically within each State by the Federal agency responsible for the facility, except for the corrections. As mentioned before, these entries are organized alphabetically by state. This information is then followed by the facility name and address, the statutory provision(s) under which the facility was reported to EPA (indicated by an \"x\" in the appropriate column(s)), the EPA Region where the facility is located, the correction code, and date of listing if appropriate. The complete list of Federal facilities that now comprises the docket is not being published today. However, the list is available to interested parties and can be obtained by calling the Federal Facilities Docket Hotline. As today, the total number of Federal facilities that appear on the docket is 1,170. J. Winston Porter, Assistant Administrator.

Indian Education General Provisions and Discretionary Grants; Notice of Proposed RulemakingI 46404 Federal Register / Vol. 53, No. 221 / Wednesday, November 16, 1988 / Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Parts 250, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, and 258 Indian Education General Provisions and Discretionary Grants AGENCY. Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend regulations governing the Indian Education Act general provisions and the Indian Education discretionary grant programs to incorporate new provisions of the Indian Education Act of 1988. The proposed regulations include amended definitions and requirements for grants under a new gifted and talented program. Regulations governing Indian- Controlled Schools--Establishment Grants have been deleted because the program is unfunded. DATE: Comments must be received on or before January 17, 1989. ADDRESS: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to Mr. Brian Stacey, Acting Directoi, Indian Education Programs, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW.. Room 2177 (Mail Stop 6267), Washington, DC 20202. A copy of any comments that concern information collection requirements should also be sent to the Office of Management and Budget at the address listed in the Paperwork Reduction Act section of this preamble. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Sylvia Wright, Indian Education Programs, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Room 2177 (Mail Stop 6267), Washington, DC 20202. Telephone (202) 732-1938. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Indian Educalion Act (The Act) was amended and reauthorized by Part C of Title V of Pub. L 100-297 (Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Siafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988). The Act subsequently was amended by Pub. L. 100-427. These proposed regulations incorporate technical amendments to the Act. Changes to Inzpement Amendments to the ActI -er. .. .....- --2 .. .1 :. ......tJorganizations as eligible applicants for special programs to encourage Indian students to acquire a higher education and to reduce the dropout rate among elementary and secondary school students. a Under section 5324(c) of the Act, the Secretary is authorized to provide five grants to schools fudned or operated by BIA for program research, development and dissemination in several areas, including programs for gifted and talented students. The proposed regulations establish requirements and funding criteria for this small discretionary program. The regulations also clarify the extent to which recipients must coordinate certain activities with other recipients of funds under section 5324 of the Act. In addition, as required by section 5324(c)(4)(B) of the Act, the Secretary proposes a definition of the term \"gifted and talented students.\" For the purpose of this program, the Secretary proposes to define that term as that term is defined in section 4103 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by section 1001 of Pub. L. 100-297. That definition includes children and youth who give evidence of high performance capabilities in a variety of areas and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school, in order to develop those capabilities fully. This definition is inclusive and should accommodate any special requirements or criteria needed to serve gifted and talented Indian children. Other Changes 9 The proposed regulations would delete the current Part 252, governing the Indian-Controlled Schools- Establishment Program which is unfunded. * The proposed regulations would delete the regulations governing what information an applicant must include in an application. These deletions would be consistent with the Department's policy that this information is not regulatory and more appropriately belongs in each program's application package. Executive Order 12291 These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteria for major regulations established in the order. -Inese prupusu reguiwns wuuFtrevise Part 250, General Provisions, and Regulatbry Flexibility Act Certification would include consortia of higher The Secretary certifies that these education institutions, local educational proposed regulations would not have a agencies, and Indian tribes and 'significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are small school districts, tribal schools, schools operated by BIA, Indian tribes, and Indian organizations receiving Federal financial assistance under these programs. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on these small entitites because the regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds, and would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision.. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Section 255.31 contains information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of this section to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend regulations governing the Indian Education formula grant program to incorporate new provisions of the Indian Education Act of 1988. The proposed regulations include as eligible applicants (under certain circumstances) schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and clarify the requirements for including children in the applicant's count of Indian students to generate funds under the program. DATE: Comments must be received on or before January 17, 1989. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to Mr. Brian Stacey, Acting Director, Indian Education Programs, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Room 2177, Washington, DC 20202-6139. A copy of any comments that concern information collection requirements should also be sent to the Office of Management and Budget at the address listed in the Paperwork Reduction Act section of this preamble. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Sylvia Wright, Indian Education Programs, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Room 2177, Washington, DC 20202-6139. Telephone (202] 732-1938. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Indian Education formula grant program was amended and reauthorized by Part C of Title V of Pub. L. 100-297 (Indian Education Act of 1988; the Act). The Act subsequently was amended again by Pub. L 100-427. Under Section 5312(b) of the Act, formula grants may be awarded to local educational agencies, certain tribal schools and, under certain circumstances, schools operated by the BIA. Except where noted, the term \"LEA\" includes tribal schools and schools operated by BIA. Student Eligibility The Act also directs the Secretary to require that each application for a grant be supported by a student certification form, maintained in the applicant's files, for each eligible Indian child included in the applicant's count of children to generate formula grant funds. In orderfor a child to be counted to generate formula grant funds, the form must contain the name of the child, the name of the tribe, band or other organized group of Indians in which membership is claimed, and the parent's dated signature. The proposed regulations would permit LEAs to obtain the parent's signature and date as late as 90 days after the beginning of the relevant grant period if the signature and date cannot be obtained by the date the LEA compiles its Indian student count. Other clarifications of the requirements for including students in the Indian student count are provided to assist LEAs in complying with the requirements. The proposed regulations would require each applicant to establish a specific date or period, not to exceed 30 days, to conduct its Indian student count, and would require that only students who are enrolled in the LEA and receiving a free public education from the LEA on the count date or during the count period be counted. The proposed regulations also describe the effect that failure to meet the minimum certification requirements would have on the grantee. Section 251.22 has been removed because the information collection requirements described in that section are adequately prescribed in the authorizing statute and application package. Program Improvement A new \u00a7 251.43 is proposed to encourage program improvement through the use of a grantee's self- evaluation of its project, in order to provide the best possible educational services to Indian children. Executive Order 12291 These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteria for major regulations established in the order. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are small school districts, tribal schools, and schools operated by the BIA receiving Federal financial assistance under this program. The regulations clarify current recordkeeping requirements and impose penalties for failure to maintain proper records. The recordkeeping requirements are not excessively burdensome or expensive, and thepenalties will affect only the limited number of entities found not to be in compliance with the regulations. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 251.23, 251.50, 251.51, and 251.52(a)(2) contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: James D. Houser. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) Intergovernmental Review This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance, In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program. Invitation to Comment Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment period, in Room 2177, FOB #6 (Mail stop 6267), 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20202 between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays. To assist the Department in complying with specific requirements of Executive Order 12291 and the Paperwork Reduction Aci of 1980 and their overall requirement of reducing regulatory burden, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any regulatory burdens found in these proposed regulations.
