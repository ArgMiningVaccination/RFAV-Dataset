Programs presented at the Annual Meeting are for the education of attendees and purchasers of livestreamed and recorded presentations as authorized by the AAAAI. Any use of program content, the name of a speaker and/or program title, or the name of the AAAAI without the written consent of the AAAAI is prohibited. The \"program content\" includes, but is not limited to, oral presentations, audio visual materials used by the speakers and program handouts. This rule applies before, during and/or after the meeting. The AAAAI endorses only those activities described in this printed program. Any other events occurring in the city of San Antonio, Texas during the AAAAI Annual Meeting are not sanctioned by the AAAAI.Dear Colleagues, Welcome to the 2023 AAAAI Annual Meeting. This is the A/I event of the year where you will experience interactive training stations, dedicated networking lounges, highly anticipated research highlights and of course, transformative educational sessions. Over 400 faculty members will be speaking, and they are ready to answer questions and engage in discussion with you. You are a part of the community of thousands of A/I clinicians from around the world who have gathered together to learn from top experts in the field, exchange ideas and best practices, make new connections and access cutting-edge research. We thank you in advance for following our health and safety protocols that will ensure a safe, informative and successful Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting Program Committee has again constructed an impressive program, including a wide variety of content-rich sessions covering the latest in A/I, with many built around our \"Optimizing Scope of Practice\" theme. While the theme covers about 20% of our sessions, the remaining 80% were developed through member submissions and include a robust selection of basic and clinical science programming. The labels and key inside this program will help you determine which sessions relate to the theme and to our other session tracks, and which sessions are being livestreamed for those who opted to attend the 2023 Annual Meeting virtually. Other virtual components include a set of pre-recorded sessions to be viewed at your convenience, the recording of a select number of live sessions that will be uploaded online and a virtual Poster Hall. Add These High-Impact Sessions to Your Meeting Schedule Friday at 1:45 pm is the Presidential Plenary: Paradigm Shifts in Drug Allergy, which will serve as a major update to the field of drug allergy. You will hear about new insights into the immunopathology of Aspirin- exacerbated Respiratory Disease, advances in the diagnosis and management of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction and practice changers from Drug Allergy: A 2022 Practice Parameter Update. Our plenary sessions continue at 8:15 am on Saturday and Sunday, and at 9:30 am on Monday. These plenaries will cover the impact of climate change and environmental hazards on allergic disease, new insights on atopic dermatitis and the latest on the diagnosis and management of food allergy. For the Keynote Saturday at 3:30 pm, Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, DSc, an internationally-recognized physician- scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine development, will lead a timely discussion on how we address both vaccine equity and a rising and aggressive antiscience empire. We are also excited to announce that on Monday after the Business Meeting, which is now from 8:15 to 9:15 am, and before the plenary session at 9:30 am, there will be a special virtual presentation from CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH.
