Get relief from your pain the natural way, right in downtown Everett. Our Story Balance Acupuncture opened in Woodinville in 2006. We served the Woodinville community for 10 years. Having moved to Everett in 2009 and really loving the community here, we often considered moving our business here. Then, in 2017, fate pushed us in the right direction, when a developer bought up much of the property in Downtown Woodinville (including our office building). It was time to make the move. Since then, we have enjoyed living and working Everett. Our services - Acupuncture - Frequency Specific Microcurrent - Herbal Medicine Our Reviews - V.
