VCSE Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 10 Foreword From the moment we are born, through to old age, the environments we live in shape our lives and our wellbeing. Having a safe home, a sufficient income and support networks around us make a substantial contribution to a life in good health. And the importance of our surroundings also extends to our natural environment. The COVI D-19 pandemic has made many of us all the more aware of how much we value and rely on our outdoor spaces to support our health and wellbeing . There is increasingly compelling evidence showing that access to greenspaces really matters for our health. Anyone who loves being outdoors might instinctively feel a boost from spending some time in our parks or woodlands, but it is now formally recognised that green environments are associated with reduce d levels of depression, anxiety and fatigue and can enhan ce quality of life for both children and adults. We gain physically too. People with better access to greenspace enjoy a wide range of health benefits from lower levels of cardiovascular disease through to maintaining a healthier weight. It should be a concern for all of us, however , that evidence also shows access to good quality greenspaces such as parks, woodlands, fields or allotments varies greatly depending on where we live. The most economically deprived areas often have less available public green space, meaning people in those communities have fewer opportunities to reap the benefits. But there is much we can and must do, and Improving Access to Greenspace - A new review for 2020 builds on our 2014 briefing on this topic , highlighting new evidence and actions to help local areas consider how good -quality greenspace can support the delivery of health, social, environmental and economic priorities, at a relatively low cost. We hope this report will help you identify levers that are relevant to you locally and that can be used to build and support a case for creating and maintaining quality greenspaces, ultimately improving the wellbeing of local communities and helping to reduce health inequalities. \u00a9 Guzelian Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 11 Executive summary Greenspace , such as parks, woodland, fields and allotments as well as natural elements including green walls, roofs and incidental vegetation, are increasingly being recognised as an important asset for supporting health and wellbeing. This 'natural capital' can help local authorities address local issues that they face, including improving health and wellbeing, managing health and social care costs, reducing health inequalities, improving social cohesion and taking positive action to addres s climate change. Evidence shows that living in a greener environment can promote and protect good health, and aid in recovery from illness and help with managing poor health. People who have greater exposure to greenspace have a range of more favourable physiological outcomes . Greener environments are also associated with better mental health and wellbeing outcomes including reduced levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigue, and enhanced quality of life for both children and adults. Greenspace can help t o bind communities together, reduce loneliness, and mitigate the negative effects of air pollution, excessive noise , heat and flooding. Disadvantaged groups appear to gain a larger health benefit and have reduced socioeconomic -related inequalities in healt h when living in greener communities, so greenspace and a greener urban environment can also be used as an important tool in the drive to build a fairer society. However , population growth and consequent urbanisation combined with competing demands for la nd use and budgetary constraints , are putting much of our existing local, accessible greenspace under threat. This report makes the case that we must not lose sight of our growing population's need for it. It is intended to provide Local Authorities, particularly public health teams, with the tools to make the case for maintaining or even increasing provision of and equitable access to greenspace and growing the wider network of green infrastructure , especially through the planning system. In supporting th e delivery of local health, social, environmental and economic priorities, good quality greenspace has the potential to deliver substantial benefits for public health and for wider local priorities at a relatively low cost. Despite this, it can be challeng ing to make a compelling case, and often greenspace is still seen as a liability rather than an asset. The full extent of the benefits can be unrealised because they are difficult to measure, cross local authority boundaries, or are accumulated over an extended time period. Natural capital accounting methodology and tools have now evolved to support local government to understand the true value of their green estate. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 12 Some recent valuations have estimated that: \u00a32.1 billion per year could be saved in heal th costs if everyone in England had good access to greenspace, due to increased physical activity in those spaces in Birmingham, the annual net benefit to society of their parks and greenspace is nearly \u00a3600 million, which includes \u00a3192 million in health b enefits in Sheffield, for every \u00a31 spent on maintaining parks, there is a benefit of \u00a334 in health costs saved, with local residents being the primary beneficiaries in England and Wales, houses and flats within 100 metres of public greenspace are an averag e of \u00a32,500 more expensive than they would be if they were more than 500 metres away - an average premium of 1.1% in 2016 , suggesting that the public places a value on being near to greenspace Local authorities play a vital role in: providing new, good q uality greenspace that is inclusive and equitable improving, maintaining and protecting existing greenspace increasing green infrastructure within public spaces and promoting healthy streets improving transport links, pathways and other means of access to greenspace, and providing imaginative routes linking areas of greenspace for active travel Achieving these outcomes requires concerted effort and close partnership with other agencies, bringing public health and local healthcare and social care providers together with planning departments, parks and leisure management, transport providers, architects , developers, and the communities who will be using these spaces. Local policies and strategies that include requirements for greenspace based on local needs , will help councils and the local NHS deliver on ambitions for healthy communities , whilst contributing to wider local priorities such as tackling climate change, reducing social isolation and improving the local economy. This report offers policy, practic e and research recommendations for local government and those working in partnership with it . Policy Consider local green (and blue) space to be critical assets for maintaining and supporting health and wellbeing in local communities. The evidence base l inking health and greenspace is compelling and encourages fresh thinking about the way these spaces can help meet local priorities. Ensure that local policies and strategies are informed by evidence of need for sufficient access to greenspace . Local str ategies, such as the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) and the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy (JHWS) can define Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 13 how greenspace can be used to meet the current and future health needs of the population , and the part green infrastructure can play in wider health and wellbeing strategies. It is crucial that health priorities laid out in the JSNA and JHWS are reflected in local planning strategies, especially the Local Plan, which sets out the strategic priorities for development of an area . This wil l support the case for specific planning standards to be implemented to address health needs, or help to defend planning decisions based on health and wellbeing grounds. Developing a green infrastructure strategy and supplementary planning documents (SPDs) , if appropriate, will also support the protection and enhancement of green infrastructure. Prioritise improving access to greenspace and creating greener communities especially in areas of deprivation or where there is poor or unequal access , as an important part of the wider plan to reduce health inequalities locally. Greener neighbourhoods benefit everyone, but appear to disproportionately benefit disadvantaged groups, and socioeconomic -related inequalities in health are lower in areas with greater ac cess to greenspace . Improvements must be carefully planned and purposeful consultation must occur at all stages in order to provide equitable, sustainable benefits and to ensure health inequalities are not inadvertently exacerbated. Local p ractice Suppor t meaningful engagement across local government functions and the community to understand the actual and potential local benefits of greenspace and reveal the complex and diverse ways greenspace is thought about and used. This knowledge will lay the ground work for conducting a valuation exercise. Consider whether a formal valuation of benefits is necessary to strengthen the case for the creation, revitalisation and maintenance of greenspace. This may be done using monetary, non -monetary or a combination of valuation techniques. Being able to demonstrate the value of greenspaces will help to ensure they are taken into account when difficult local finance decisions must be made Identify and factor in resilient funding arrangements for the maintenance of greenspace as early as possible , so that it can continue to provide benefits in the long term. Spending or investment decisions need to take account of the potential impact on health and wellbeing as well as future financial sustainability, and this gives local public health teams and the NHS an opportunity to engage in the decision - making process. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 14 Establish interventions, such as green social prescribing initiatives, that will support people who do not use greenspace to begin using it. Programmes to support social engagement or to facilitate participation in activities coupled with improvements to the physical environment , are an effective approach to enabl e people to start using these spaces and to continue to use them. Work with local NHS systems and prof essionals, including Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships and Integrated Care Systems, to promote the role greenspace plays in both individual and population health outcomes. This will support the health service's ambition to take more action to prevent poor health and to use green assets , through initiatives such as social prescribing, as part of the overall plan to achieve this aim. Local r esearch Develop persuasive, evidence -informed case studies that highlight the impact that accessible green space has on local health outcomes , especially for disadvantaged groups. Monitoring and evaluating local changes in access to greenspace, in conjunction with health data over time, will cultivate a better understanding of the benefits and value of greenspa ce for health . . This information can be developed into useful case studies to highlight what works, for whom and how. Support robust evaluation of local greenspace interventions to help build a broader evidence base. It is vital to use valid and reliable measures of data collection . This will help to reduce the heterogeneity of research on health inequality and access to greenspace . Wherever possible, e mbed a thorough evaluation from the inception of new schemes . Improving access to greenspace: A new r eview for 2020 was undertaken in 2019, prior to the COVID -19 pandemic . Data collected during the lockdown period has captured information about people's ability to access greenspace, inequalities in access, and feelings and values about the natural environ ment. This data continues to be gathered and analysed. PHE intends to collaborate with other governments departments to present the new evidence in a future publication . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 15 1. Introduction \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin .\" - William Shake speare A time of challenge and o pportunity Greenspace can play an important role in our daily experience of life - be it playing, being active, relaxing, or even commuting through a greenspace on the way to work. There is now a substantial body of evidenc e supporting the value of green (and blue) spaces to our health, and these spaces are also important for helping to maintain or enhance the wider environment and to support biodiversity. Although we all use public space every time we step outside our fron t door, much of the public realm comprises streets and communal amenity space that is not designed to promote good public health (1, 2) . Traditionally, there has been a reliance on community parks to underpin many aspects of people's health in urban environments, rather than looking at the t otality of an area's network of multifunctional greenspace - its green infrastructure (GI). As urban areas expand or become denser, the amount of good quality greenspace is likely to decline, unless determined efforts are made to maintain and/or increase it. The Committee on Climate Change found that the total proportion of urban greenspace in England declined by 8 percentage points between 2001 and 2018, from 63% to 55% (3). But this is not just an urban issue. Access to greenspace is also relevant in the rural context, where it might refer to decisions around common land, rights of way, enclosing areas for farming and development of green belt areas. Today we can look at greenspace with a deeper understanding of the wider determinants of health, of which both the built and the natural environment are fundamental pillars. Broadly, it is thought that gr eenspace is linked to health and wellbeing in a number of ways: (4, 5) improving access to greenspace promotes healthy behaviours, such as engaging in physical activity and other recreation, and connecting those spaces together can enco urage active travel greenspace also can improve social contacts and give people a sense of familiarity and belonging - cleaner, greener communities are places where people wish to live and work: they can promote social contact and connectivity, foster a se nse of belonging, reduce isolation and loneliness and encourage a connection to nature greenspace supports the development of skills and capabilities - particularly for young people, there is emerging evidence that spending time in greenspace is Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 16 associated with a range of benefits including improved motor skills, better academic performance and increased concentration nearby greenspace, and green features such as pocket parks, street trees, green walls and roof gardens, also mediate potential harms posed by the local environment - it can help to reduce exposure to air pollution, reduce the urban heat island effect, and mitigate excessive noise and reduce flood risk, all of which can impair both physical and mental health Figure 1: Ways in which greenspace m ay be linked to positive health outcomes For all these reasons, improving access to quality greenspace has the potential to improve health outcomes for the whole population. However this is particularly true for disadvantaged communities, who appear t o accrue an even greater health benefit from living in a greener environment (5). This means that greenspace also can be an important tool in the ambition to increase healthy life expectancy and narrow the gap between the life chances of the richest and poorest in society (6). This report aims t o bring these disparate strands together in one document. It presents a summary of evidence linking greenspace and health that furthers understanding of the benefits greenspace can provide. It looks at ways that greenspace can be formally valued so that fa ir and informed decisions can be made at a local level and considers how local authorities and public health teams can help communities have better access to high quality greenspaces and support everyone to use the green spaces available to Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 17 them. The repor t offers practical advice on levers local authorities and other bodies can use to support the creation of new greenspace or to improve or maintain existing greenspace. It presents case study examples from local areas that have taken imaginative steps to bu ild on the evidence and examines different ways in which high - quality greenspace can both promote public health and wellbeing, save public money and deliver on ambitions for healthy communities while contributing to wider local priorities around climate ch ange, social i solation and the local economy. Greenspace and green infrastructure Definitions of greenspace vary, and similar concepts can be described by different names within the literature, with terms such as 'natural environment', 'open space' and 'green infrastructure' often used interchangeably. For the purpose of this document, the following definitions are used. Greenspace is any area of vegetated land, urban or rural. Green infrastructure is \"a network of multi -functional greenspace, urban and rural, which is capable of delivering a wide range of environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities.\" (7) It can include parks, playing fields, other areas of open space, woodland, allotments, private gardens, sustainable drainage features, and 'blue infrastructure' such as streams, ponds, canals and other water bodies. It also includes 'incidental' fea tures such as green roofs and walls, street trees, and small pockets of vegetation that contribute to a green urban fabric. Types of greenspaces (8, 9) are: public parks and gardens - including urban and country parks, and formal gardens private gardens or grounds - private gardens and school and institutional grounds amenity gree nspace - residential, business and transport amenity space, including communal recreation spaces, domestic gardens, informal recreation space, greenspace around housing, town and village greens play space for children and teenagers sports areas - playing f ields, golf courses, tennis courts, bowling greens and other sports areas green corridors - green access routes including green cycle ways, and routes along canals and rivers natural and semi -natural greenspace - woodland, open semi -natural, open water, beach, foreshore or manmade allotments and community growing spaces burial grounds - churchyards and cemeteries other functional greenspace camping and caravan parks, and areas undergoing land use change Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 18 Blue s pace It is becoming increasingly clear that time spent in 'blue space' - near water - may also improve our mental and physical health (10). Blue space includes the sea, coastlines, rivers , lakes, canals, waterfalls and fountains. This report does not specifically review the evidence for blue space and health and wellbeing, however blue spaces were included in the wider literature review on health equities ( see Appendix C). When designing and planning greenspace and parks and other aspects of the natural environment, blue spaces should be considered as part of the whole. A water feature can help revitalise an urban area and have dramatic impacts on people's behaviour. A good example is the 'Mirror Pool' fountain, which acts as a public forum for Bradford city centre, particularly in summer (11). The fountain is part of a wider, multi -feature landscaped area wh ich inspires physical activity and social connection through its openness and accessibility: interaction with the water, for example, is encouraged. Wider e cosystems There are several benefits greenspace can provide that contribute to health, for example through carbon capture, water purification and improving biodiversity. This report recognises these wider ecosystem services but focusses on the health benefits that result from access to greenspace, which is defined here as proximity to, accessibility or use of greenspace. The national policy c ontext Government policy increasingly recognises the importance of greenspace in people's health and wellbeing for promoting good health, prevention of poor health and treatment and recovery from illness and injury . The Government's 25 Year Environment Plan, 'A green future: Our 25 -year plan to improve the environment ' (25YEP) (12) acknowledges the essential role that the natural environment and greenspace play in people's physical and mental health, and a ims to improve population health and wellbeing by forging a closer connection between people and the natural environment. Commitments to action include those that aim to improve access to greenspace , for instance by creating better green infrastructure, a nd those that encourage people to engage more, for example through structured programmes that link them to greenspace. The NHS has committed to take more action on prevention and sees the use of green assets as part of the overall plan to achieve this goal . The NHS Long -term Plan (LTP) outlines how Integrated Care Systems will increasingly work with local government at 'place' level, focusing on population health, in recognition of the role which the wider determinants of health play in supporting good heal th and preventing illness (13). The NHS LTP describes the intention to expand the use of social Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 19 prescribing including using green social prescriptions, supported by local accessible greenspace . Both the NHS and other government departm ents recognise the crucial importance of access to good quality greenspace as a key factor for health. This is reflected in a wide range of policies across Government including the Childhood Obesity Strategy (14); Everybody Active, Every Day (15); Loneliness Strategy (16); Clean Air Strategy (17); Sporting Future (18); Prevention is Better than Cure (19); Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (20); 5-year F orward View for Mental Health (21); Integrated Communities Action Plan (22) ; and is one of the UN Sustainable Development Goal s (23). It will also be key in achieving the mission laid out in the Industrial Strate gy Grand Challenge to ensure that people can enjoy at least 5 extra healthy, independent years of life by 2035, while narrowing the gap between the experience of the richest and poorest (6). Government has made a commitment to develop a practical frame work of green infrastructure standards that will help deliver more good quality green infrastructure consistently across England to achieve health and other outcomes (12). These standards are expected to be incorporated into national Planning Pra ctice Guidance (PPG) (see Chapter 6). The government is also exploring ways to secure the future of parks, one of the most frequently visited types of greenspace, by examining new approaches to the financing and management of parks now and for the future (24). Recent reso urces include NHS England's Healthy New Towns Putting Health into Place , which gives detailed lessons from NHS England's Healthy New Towns Programme (25). A key component of the programme is to ensure that all major new housing developments have easy access to greenspace to create the right conditions for people to engage in physical activity, healthy play, active travel and to inspire healthy eating. It also puts strong emphasis on connecting and involving communities. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 20 2. Understanding the benefits of greenspace \"Spending time in the natural environment - as a resident or a vi sitor - improves our mental health and feelings of wellbeing. It can reduce stress, fatigue, anxiety and depression. It can help boost immune systems, encourage physical activity and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as asthma. It can combat lon eliness and bind communities together .\" - 25 Year Environment Plan (12) There is general recognition that much of what keeps us healthy lies outside the NHS and social care system, from good housing to well -designed high streets and transport systems that promote active travel. We know that there are a range of 'green' design factors in the built environment which help keep people healthy and can make healthier lifestyles an easier option (25-27). Many of the greatest health challenges in society today have changed since 19th century health campaigners first saw the benefit of securing open spaces to act as the lungs of our cities; creating purer air and giving people places for healthful exercise and social engagement (28, 29) . Our new challenges still include clean air, but now also include physical inactivity and social isolation as well as non -communicable health conditions such as dementia, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular di sease and mental ill -health. (30) The financial costs to the NHS and other agencies is significant . It has been estimated that the cost to the NHS just to manage these conditions is \u00a362 billion per year, with the cost to wider society being \u00a3184 billion pe r year (30, 119 -120). There is also an increasing impact on local authorities' social care budgets to care for those who are affected (121). Since the first publication of Improving Access to Greenspace in 2014, there has been a substantial increase in the quantity of research focused on the linkages between greenspace and health outcomes, as well as on the ways in which the environment can be used, designed or managed to promote health outcomes. The evidence base is now developed enough to allow evidence syntheses and meta -analyses. These have investi gated linkages between exposure to greenspace and both physical and mental health outcomes including mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, maternal outcomes, stress and cognitive function; greenspace and health behaviours such as engaging in physical activity and recreation; the health impact of specific types of greenspace and proximity; factors determining use of greenspace and outcomes of specific types of greenspace interventions. The improved evidence base has extended our understanding of who ben efits and how, to what extent, and in what ways. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 21 As the field matures, there is a greater use of robust study designs, particularly in relation to the health, wellbeing and behavioural outcomes of environmental interventions. However, there are still limi tations within the evidence base including high levels of heterogeneity, poor quality studies, uncertainty about transferability between contexts and populations, inconsistent terminology and lack of evidence relating to certain subgroups. There is a need for greater focus on what works, understanding causal pathways, and clarifying the health associations for different settings and population groups. More information about the evolution of the evidence base can be found in Appendix A. However, despite the limitations, there is still substantial evidence of a range of positive outcomes linked to living in greener communities and having greater exposure to greenspace. Below is a summary highlighting some of these physical and mental health benefits. Within t his report, all associations described are statistically significant. Evidence from systematic reviews was used where possible. Further detail can be found in Appendix B. The physica l health b enefits of greenspace Our findings suggest: there is a small b ody of evidence that has investigated the linkages between greener living environments and mortality - a robust meta -analysis found an association between people living in high versus low greenspace neighbourhoods and all -cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults , with o utcomes found to be strongest for those in the most deprived groups (31, 32) there is generally consistent evidence from good or adequate quality studies, of positive associations between greener living environments and higher self -assessed general health (33, 34) - positive associations were also found between the quality of the greenspace and self -assessed general health an extensive systematic review and meta -analysis found that people who have greater exposure to greenspace have more favourable salivary cortisol (a physiological marker of stress), heart rate and heart rate variability, diastolic blood pressure, high -density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and incidence of type 2 diabetes - the greatest benefit was found for groups with lower socioeconomic status and for those living in the most deprived areas (33) several studies, including two systematic revie ws, have looked at associations between residential greenspace and maternal and birth outcomes - these found that higher levels of greenspace in the living environment are associated with more favourable birth weight (33, 35, 36) a systematic review found that, although there is some variation by demographic factors, greener urban neighbourhoods are associated with maintaining a healthier weight and may improve obesity -related health outcomes (37) Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 22 several systematic reviews have shown that, althoug h evidence is mixed, people living in greener urban environments are more likely to meet the national physical activity recommendations and less likely to be overweight or obese (38, 39) , with the strength of the a ssociation varying across demographic groups and contexts - there is also some evidence that physical activity in greenspace is more beneficial than activity in other settings, with reduced feelings of tension, confusion, anger and depression, and increase d energy and feelings of revitalisation and positive engagement (40) there is evidence from individual studies of a relationship between exposure to natural environments and the maintenance of a healthy immune system and reduction of inflammatory -based diseases (41-43) there is some evidence, though inconsistent, of a positive association between greater exposure to greenspace and attention and working memory in childre n and young people (33, 44, 45) The mental health b enefits of greenspace Our findings indicate: systematic review s have found that greater exposure to greenspace enhances quality of life for both children and adults through multiple social, economic, and environmental means (46-48) several systematic reviews have found positi ve associations between a greener living environment and mental wellbeing outcome s in children and young people, this includes : emotional wellbeing, reduced stress and improved resilience, and higher health -related quality of life - several reviews found e vidence of a link between greater exposure to greenspace and reduced rates of hypera ctivity and inattention (44-46) in adults, several systematic reviews have found an association between nature in the urban enviro nment and positive emotions - evidence also shows links between a greener living environment and higher life satisfaction and reduced mental distress, and strong evidence of improved self -rated mental health a nd reported stress (32, 49, 50) greener environments have been shown to reduce levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigue (4, 5) - the beneficial effects are greatest for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, with inequality in mental well being narrower in deprived groups with good access to greenspace, compared to those with less access (51, 52) for children and young people, the effects of greenspace are influenced by developmental stage and both the type and accessibility of greenspace (5, 44) for adults, factors such as age, gender and physical activity behaviours appear to moderate relationships between greenspace exposures and mental health outcomes (5) Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 23 Mental ill -health The physical health, social and econo mic consequences of poor mental health are substantial. Compared to the general population, people with mental illness are more likely to have physical health conditions, a lower life expectancy, higher rates of health risk factors such as smoking, alcohol and drug misuse, and are more likely to experience social inequalities such as isolation, unemployment and homelessness or poor housing (111) . Poor mental health is estimated to incur an economic and social cost of \u00a3105 billion a year in England, with treatment costs expected to double in the next 20 years (112- 114). In addition to these costs there are incalculable costs to individuals, families and communities due to lost potential and limited life chances. Ways greenspace can p romote positiv e health and wellbeing o utcomes Physical activity Physical activity is one of the cheapest and most effective forms of medicine and has been described as a 'miracle cure' by the UK Chief Medical Officers (53), helping to prevent and manage many common chronic conditions, for example type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitiv e impairment and some cancers. There is strong evidence that regular physical activity supports both individual and community outcomes such as increasing educational attainment, improving self -esteem and reducing social isolation. Physical inactivity is a top 10 cause of the disease burden in England (117) . It is responsible for one in 6 UK death s and is estimated to cost the UK \u00a37.4 billion annually (including \u00a30.9 billion to the NHS alone) (118) . Greensp ace can support higher levels of physical activity, and there are indications that people may enjoy and be more likely to repeat an activity if it takes place in a natural setting (40). The National Institute f or Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggests that greenspace should be used whenever possible to support people of all ages and abilities to move more, improving their health and wellbeing and reducing the need for direct, more costly interventions (54). Particularly for older people, physical activity can support sustained independence through increasing strength, stamina and balance, and by contributing to improved social functioning, reduc ing loneliness and social isolation (55). Improving conditions for walking and cycling, for instance by providing accessible, well designed green infrastructure and 'healthy streets', has been identified as one of the easiest ways - at population leve l - to build health -promoting physical activity into daily life (20). Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 24 Recreational activities The Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey gives an annual snapshot of people's recreational visits to the na tural environment in England (56). The survey, which was undertaken between 2009 to 2019 , identifies a variety of reasons people visit these spaces, with health and exercise, walking the dog, to relax and unwind, or just to enjoy the scenery being most popular (56). Recent analysis of data from the MENE survey indicates that adults who had 2 hours of recreational activity per we ek in greenspace are more likely to have better self -reported health and wellbeing than those who do not (57). Benefits occur regardless of how those 2 hours are achieved (one long, or several short visits), demographic characteristics (urban or rural, high or low deprivation background, age, with or without a long -term condition or disability), or the type of natural environment visited. This positive effect is unlikely to be attributable solely to undertaking physical activity while they are there. The effect on health was s hown as comparable to the effects of (a) living in an area of low vs. high deprivation; (b) being employed in a high vs. low social grade occupation; and (c) achieving vs. not achieving recommended levels of phys ical activity in the last week. Recreationa l opportunities in greenspace are also vital for children. The MENE survey shows that play is the main motivation for younger children's time outdoors, and that this usually takes place in local parks, recreation grounds, and playgrounds, and to a lesser e xtent more natural settings such as woods, nature reserves and the wider countryside (56). Evidence is still evolving, but there are indications of positive impacts of outdoor recreation including improved self -perceived competence, learning and identity, positive wellbeing and increased family cohesion (58). Nature connection 'Nature connection' is not just spending time in nature, but is an individual's subjecti ve sense of their relationship with the natural world and feelings of interconnectedness with nature or a sense of inclusion in nature (59). Evidence indicat es that people who report feeling more 'connected to nature' tend to have a more positive outlook on life (positive affect), increased vitality, life satisfaction, feelings that life is worthwhile and of personal growth compared to those who feel less conn ected. There is also an association with more pro -environmental and pro -conservation behaviours (60-62). Contact with the natural world, childhood experience and socio -cultural status may all be factors influencin g a sense of nature connection (59). Life stage also seems to play a role. Recent analysis of the MENE data shows that reported nature connection is high in young children, dips during adolescence and then slowly rises again through adulthood, though never achieving the same level as is shown in children (60). Further work is being undertaken to understand if this is a consistent trend, and to identify whether there are any actions that can be taken to mitigate the drop in nature connection during the teenage years. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 25 Community and social cohesion Natural spaces improve social cohesion and can help bring communities together. Greenspace, especially in urban settings, can provide places where people can come together to engage in social activities, help people fe el connected to their communities, and help minority groups become better integrated and identify with their new communities. Reviews have shown that greenspace can reduce isolation and loneliness by providing the opportunity to participate in shared socia l activities, again leading to greater social cohesion (63) (64). Research s uggests that social interaction within the neighbourhood environment can help to build familiarity and a sense of commonality, which sets the groundwork for future engagement (65). These spaces also facilitate both formal and informal interactions with people from different cultural backgrounds, and this in turn may lead to increased social cohesion and inclusion. Quality, design and maintenance are important factors in people's perceptions of greenspace and may impact on the extent to which social benefits are realised. Studies show that well designed and maintained greenspace can help to reduce antisoc ial behaviour, while those that are poorly designed or not maintained tend to do the opposite (66). In turn, evidence indicates that the health benefits of greenspace are dependent on people's feelings of safety and the behaviour of other users (39, 67) . When aiming to maximise the potential for community and social ties within a greenspace, location, structure, activities, versatility, maintenance, facilities and access all need to be considered (26, 63) . What does 'quality' mean? Quality of greenspace can be considered in 2 principal ways: 1) The ecological quality, which describes the level of biodiversity within the area. There is some evidence that ecological quality contributes to better mental health, increased health -promoting behaviours and prevalence of good health, while degraded environments appear to have a negative effect on health (4). 2) The condition of the space. This is a measure of how well the site is maintained and the amenities it offers, making it safe, attractive and welc oming to visitors. Studies have shown that inadequate maintenance of sites, such as poor-quality footpaths, vandalism, litter, and issues with cleanliness negatively influence the use of parks. Aesthetics, perceived safety and the social environment found within a site play a key role in people wanting to use it (68). Some quality standards include: Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 26 Green Flag Award and Green Flag Com munity Award - an internationally recognised awards scheme that recognises and rewards well managed parks and greenspace, and sets a quality benchmark and standard for the management of recreational outdoor spaces (69) Building with Nature - a set of standards that promote high quality green infrastructure at each stage of the development process, from planning and design, through to long-term management and maintenance (70) The Place Standard tool - provides a simple framework to holistical ly assess the physical and social aspects of a place, It is supported by the WHO, and it is now being used in up to 18 countries in the WHO European region (71) Building for Life -an initiative created within the home building industry to promote improved standards within the industry. Accreditation requires meeting 12 design conditions, including on the design of public and private spaces (72) Government is also developing a set of national green infrastructure standards to establish a common understanding of what 'good' GI looks like and help local authorities, developers and communities plan and design good quality GI t o meet local needs. Local areas will be able to assess their GI provision against these new standards to drive improvement and enhancement. Developing children's skills and capabilities There is a small body of evidence showing that spending time in green space, often within a school setting, may be associated with improvements in children's skills and development (5). Greener school grounds have been found to be linked to improved motor skills, and better learning processes and outcomes (73). A greener school environment has also been shown to be associated with better behavioural outcomes and attent ion restoration (74). Children learning in natural environments (outdoor learning) have been found to have higher achievement than their peers in reading, mathematics, science and social studies, physical educat ion and drama, with a greater motivation to learn, increased concentration and engagement with their lessons (75). Although there are limitations within the evidence base , it tends to demonstrate that there are a range of positive outcomes for children that come from spending more time in a greener school setting or by learning in natural environments. Thoughtful consideration of how to increase children's exposure to greenspace as part of their school day, as one element of a local government approach, may be valuable in helping to achieve educational and development priorities for children and young people. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 27 Mediating potential harm Air pollution Air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in th e UK. and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity. It can cause and worsen health effects in all individuals, particularly society's most vulnerable populations. Air pollution can exacerbate existing health condi tions, affecting both physical and mental health, and lead to reduced life expectancy over the long -term (17). Conditions caused or exacerbated by air pollution include asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic he art disease (CHD), and stroke. In 2018, PHE estimated that between 2017 and 2025 the total cost to the NHS and social care system due to the health impacts of PM2.5 and NO2 in England will be \u00a31.69 billion. This figure is for where there is robust evidence for an association between exposu re and disease. Where there is less robust evidence for an association, then the estimate is increased to an overall total of \u00a35.5 billion for PM2.5 and NO2 in England between 2017 and 2025 (115) . It is estimated that a 1 \u00b5g/m3 reduction in fine particulate air pollu tion in England could prevent around 50,900 cases of coronary heart disease, 16,500 strokes, 9,300 cases of asthma and 4,200 lung cancers over an 18 -year period (116) . In 2017, urban green and blue space in Great Britain removed 27,900 tonnes of 5 key air pollutants. The avoided health costs were estimated at \u00a3162.6 million, with 70% of the avoided costs due to the positive effects of urban woodland (76). Greenspace can also control the flow and distribution of air pollution (77). People's exposure can be substantially reduced through carefully positioned green infrastructure that incorporates the right type of vegetation, separate s people from pollution by introducing barriers and extends the distance between the pollution source and individuals (78). Redesigning road and pavement layouts, delivering well -designed urban greening schemes, and providing active travel routes through greenspace all help reduce exposure to air pollution and improve health (79). Noise Environmental noise exposure can have a significant effect on health and quality of life(122) . Long -term exposure is linked to sleep disturbance, chronic annoyance (impaired quality of life) and cardiovascular disease (122, 123) . There is also increasing evidence that noise is linked to metabolic health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes, and poorer cognitive outcomes, such as children's reading comprehension and long -term memory (124) . Children, elderly people and those with existing poor physical and mental health are considered to be more vulnerable to the effects of noise (122) . Noise Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 28 is the second worst environmental cause of ill health in Western Europe, with Governme nt estimating the annual social cost of urban road traffic noise in England to be \u00a37 billion to \u00a310 billion (12, 81, 125) . Greenspace has a direct positive effect on health outcomes due to noise attenuation - the UK Urban Natural Capital Accounts estimated the total annual value of noise reduction in England was \u00a314 million in avoided loss of quality -adjusted life years (QALY) during 2017 (80, 81) . People in urban areas value the ability to enjoy areas of quiet or relative quiet, away from the sounds of urban life. There is evidence to suggest that relative quiet has a number of important and often co -related benefits incl uding improved creativity, problem solving, mental health, concentration and undisturbed sleep (82). There is also evidence to suggest that tran quil greenspace can compensate for the adverse health effects of noise in the residential environment. For example, people living in noisy areas appear to have a greater need for areas offering quiet than people not exposed to noise at home, and that perce ived 'better' access to nearby greenspace can reduce the prevalence of noise -related psychosocial symptoms through use of those spaces (83-88). Conversely, emerging evidence suggests that the use of greenspace can decrease as a result of increased noise levels and that the restorative benefits are reduced (89-94). This is thought to be due to the wider behavioural changes that may take place as a result of elevated noise le vels. Increased noise levels may affect the decision to visit a public open space, the length of time spent there, activities, and the qua lity of the relaxation enjoyed. Certain types of green infrastructure reduce exposure to noise through the absorption , dispersal and destructive interference of sound waves (95-97). Greenspace and green features also appear to atten uate people's negative perception of noise, perhaps beyond what the actual vegetation may achieve (98, 99) . Reduced noise is considered an important feature of healthy streets, contributing to improved health, mor e active travel and better human interaction (1, 100) . The Department for Environment, Food and Ru ral Affairs (DEFRA) has published guidance for eligible local authorities applying for the identification of a space as a quiet area under the terms of the Environmental Noise Directive (82). Urban heat i slands The higher temperatures found in built -up areas compared to their rural surroundings is known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The UHI results from changes in land use and human act ivity, such as concentrated areas of asphalt, relatively small areas of greenspace, and heat produced by human activities such as heating buildings, cars and the use of air conditioning. This increase in temperature can exacerbate the adverse health Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 29 impact s of heat exposure and increase the risk of illness and mortality. For example, the heat wave in August 2003 has been associated with around 70,000 excess deaths across Europe and a recent study showed that, during this heat wave, up to half of the heat - related mortality in the West Midlands region could be attributed to UHI (101, 102) . UK climate projections predict that heatwaves are likely to become more intense and more frequent in the future (106) . Heat -related deaths are expected to rise by 257% by 2050, in the absence of any adaptation (126) . Older age groups are more susceptible to the effects of heat, and there are indications that more deprived populations may often be disproportiona tely affected (101, 127 -129). There is strong evidence that in an urban context greenspace is associated with heat reduction (49). Research indicates there is a 'park cool island' effect of between 1.5-3.5\u00b0C, with a stronger cooling effect for larger urban greenspace, and that shade - giving street trees also provide an important means of heat relief (103) . Access to these 'cool islands' can help to offset the detrimental health effects of extreme heat. Greenspace also increase the cooling effect derived from water and wind sources (104) . Other elements of green infrastructure such as roof gardens have demonstrated a reduction in the UHI effect (104, 105) . Flood risk Climate change and urban development are predicted to lead to an increase in flooding events (106) . Assuming no population growth and current levels of adaptation continue, it is estimated that by 2080 there will be a 40% increase in residential properties at risk of flooding (defined as the risk of flooding more frequently than o nce every 75 years on average). This would be an increase from 860,000 to 1.2 million properties based on a 2oC temperature rise, and a 93% increase to 1.7 million properties based on a 4oC increase (107) . Flooding has significant and long -lasting effects on me ntal health caused either by the direct experience of a home being flooded or the disruption caused by a flooding event such as being evacuated. The English flooding and health study found a sustained increase in the prevalence of psychological ill -health amongst those affected by flooding. People who were flooded were approximately 6- to 7-fold more likely to have depression, anxiety or PTSD a year on than those who were not affected by flooding (108) . Green infrastructure can help to prevent floods from occurring and reduce their severity when they do (109) . The evidence base for wider health benefits related to specific forms of 'green stormwater infrastructure' such as rain gardens, bioswales, and green roofs is still developing (110) . However publicly accessible spaces that help to mitigate flooding, for example floodplains or wetlands, may contrib ute to health by providing opportunities for recreation (109) . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 30 3. Inequalities and greenspace \"Why is it that just because I am poor, I have to live in an ugly place?\" - Question asked of Derek Antrobus, Salford City Council by a constituent. Natural England Green Infrastructure Month Atrium event, 28 September 2016 A century ago, p ublic health and spatial planning were statutorily bound together , and health and wellbeing is still a principal consideration within planning (130) . Planning with health in mind seeks to address and reduce health inequalities - avoidable and unfair differences in heal th status between groups - by providing places, including greenspace, that allow everyone to have the same opportunities to lead a healthy life. This is particularly important within the current national context. The report Health equity in England: The Marmot Review 10 years on highlights that for those living in more deprived districts and regions, health is gettin g worse and health inequalities are increasing, with the lives of those at the bottom of the social gradient becoming more challenging across many domains in the past decade (131) . Evidence shows that there continues to be disparities among groups in both t he quality and quantity of greenspace, and differences in the way and frequency that certain groups use greenspace (132) . We know that: the most economically deprived areas have less available good quality public greenspace (133, 134) people exposed to poor qual ity environments are more likely to experience poorer health outcomes than people who enjoy good quality environments (135) unequal provision of good quality greenspace means those who are at greatest risk of poor physical and mental health may have the least opportunity to reap the health benefits of greenspace (132) all demographic groups benefit, but deprived groups appear to gain the most health benefit and socioeconomic inequalit ies in health are lower in greener communities - providing greener environments for deprived groups could help to reduce health inequalities (5) analysis of MENE survey data across multiple years found that infrequent users of greenspace tend to be - people who are female; older; in poor health; of lower socioeconomic status; with a physical disability; ethnic minorities; people living in deprived areas; those with less local access to greenspace; and people living further from the coast (136) The current national policy focus on prevention creates opportunities for ambitious, co-ordinated action across all of government to address health inequalities. Local policies and strategies have the opportunity to reflect a commitment to addressing access to greenspace as a key determinant of health, particularly for the most Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 31 disadvantaged communities, aiming to create the conditions for good health to exist and make reductions in health inequalities possible. Literatur e review - health inequalities and access to greenspace The Marmot Review 'Fair Society Healthy Lives ,'(135) proposed an evidence -based strategy to address the social determinants of health. This included a policy recommendation that to reduce inequalities we need to im prove the availability of good quality open and greenspace across the social gradient (135) . In 2014, PHE worked with the Marmot tea m to explore the implications of their original report to improve access to greenspace and jointly published the evidence and briefing \"Improving Access to Greenspace\". Due to the evolution of the evidence base since that time, PHE conducted a new literatu re search of studies in the UK to explore inequities in access to greenspace and its relationship with health outcomes. Details of the methodology used in this literature review are included in Appendix C. Study findings The study found there was a w ide variety of data collection methods, definitions of 'access' and 'greenspace', and health outcomes. This heterogeneity makes it challenging to compare studies in order to better understand associations and resolve uncertainty. Standardised valid and rel iable measures of data collection should be developed to reduce the heterogeneity of research on this topic (137) . Across the studies identified in the literat ure review, a range of data collection methods were used to assess the outcomes of interest, namely health; inequality; deprivation, types of greenspace ; and access to greenspace. Local area deprivation is a strong predictor for health outcomes (135) . Therefore, to address health inequality, it is necessary to use a valid and reliable measure to inform policy and intervention developm ent. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a widely used measure of relative deprivation in England and was used to explain health inequalities in the Marmot Review. Other measures found in the literature review included socio economic classifica tion and social grading (ABC1). Access to greenspace was measured in a variety of ways, including straight line distance, network distance (brief description); land area (brief description) and perceptions of access (brief description). Furthermore, the type o f greenspace measured was quantified via a range of techniques. Domestic gardens were not always included, some used satellite imagery, and several developed their own databases. The heterogeneity in measurement requires some refinement to allow comparison of data. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 32 Health outcome measurements were also mixed with a variety of data collection measures identified, from a wide range of questionnaires to objective measures of physical activity or analysis of clinical samples. Moreover, the measurements were of ten collected over different time periods. Finally, the literature review also identified that access to greenspace may be influenced by a range of demographic variables including age; gender; education level; employment status; ethnicity and disability. These findings are supported by Natural England's National Survey, the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) (56). Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 33 4. Understanding the value of greenspace \"We cannot continue to invest in the same service models of the past. We will not meet our mission with 'business as usual'... Greater focus, and sp ending, is needed on prevention, not just cure... This includes recognising... how the wider environment we live in determines our health\" - Prevention is better than cure, Department of Health and Social Care (19) An increasing body of evidence dem onstrates a positive relationship between the provision of greenspace and both improvements to population welfare and reduced costs for local areas and health authorities, businesses and central government: Natural England has estimated that \u00a32.1 billion per year could be saved in health costs if everyone in England had good access to greenspace, due to increased physical activity in those spaces (138) people meeting the weekly phy sical activity guidelines in a greenspace setting experienced improvements to quality of life that could be quantified at approximately \u00a32 billion per year (139) for urban greenspace settings in England, a welfare gain (QALY) of \u00a31.2 billion was found for those undertaking one or more 'active ' visits (30 minutes, moderate intensity activity daily) - it is further estimated that in England there would be an annual savings of about \u00a3760 million in avoidable medical c osts if people had one or more ' active ' visits per week to a greenspace (140) in a review of the benefits of London's greenspace, it was found that each year, greenspace save some \u00a3580 million by contributing to better physical health, and \u00a3370 million by contributing to better mental health - health benefits comprised approximately 20% of the total economic value of London's greenspace (141) in a Birmingham valuation it was found that the annual net benefit to society of their parks and greenspace was nearly \u00a3600 million, which includes \u00a3192 million in health benefits (142) a valuation of urban parks in Sheffield showed that, for every \u00a31 spent on maintaining parks, there was a benefit of \u00a334 in health costs saved, with local residents being the primary beneficiaries (143) a study of walking on the Wales Coastal Path found that there was a protective benefit of \u00a318.3 million per year, due to the prevention of premature death (144) estimates of individual benefits include \u00a3135 to 452 per person per year derived from having a view of greenspace from home, and \u00a3171 to 575 per person per year deriv ed from access to a garden (145) in England and Wales, houses and flats within 100 metres of public greenspace are an average of \u00a32,500 more expensive than they would be if they were more than 500 metres away - an average premium of 1.1% in 2016 (146) Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 34 Yet despite these prom ising figures, local government is facing huge challenges in funding the maintenance of their existing green infrastructure, let alone funding the creation of more. Reduced local government budgets are of course one reason investment in green infrastructur e is under pressure. But it is also because greenspace has traditionally been viewed as a liability, with the social, economic, health and environmental contributions to society rarely being acknowledged. Local areas need first to recognise and understand the wide range of benefits people accrue from green infrastructure, and then be able to capture and demonstrate their value so that they are not overlooked or forgotten when difficult local finance decisions must be made. Valuation of greenspace and wider green infrastructure can take either a monetary (assigning a traditional value using money) or a non -monetary (using qualitative and quantitative measures other than money) approach, or a combination of the two. The method selected should match the requir ements needed locally for informed decisions to be made, and the capabilities and skills of those who will undertake the valuation exercise. For any valuation, the approach must be robust and the process es and assumptions transparent. Enabling a Natural C apital Approach DEFRA's suite of resources, Enabling a Natural Capital Approach (ENCA), supports those who want to learn more about natural capital and environmental valuation and need practical guidance (147) . It presents evidence, guidance, cas e studies and tools that will help people to understand natural capital and learn how to take it into account during decision making. ENCA includes information on different natural capital valuation approaches. Public health teams may be called upon to he lp assess the suitability and impact of adding, removing or changing green infrastructure within a community. In order to do this, it can be helpful to know: where existing greenspace assets are how a change will impact health benefits what further poten tial a particular area may provide the value of the plurality of benefits to make a business case (148) Combining this knowledge with evidence of local health needs and inequalities will help public health to strengthen the case for greenspace in local policies and strategies (see chapter 6), and also during consultation on development proposals. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 35 Bicester tools for planning and evaluating urban green i nfrastructure Recent work undertaken for Cherwell District Council (Bicester) aimed to identify relatively quick and simple asset and opportunity mapping, design and valuation tools that could be applied by local councils with limited time and res ources, either with in - house expertise or using third party consultants (148) . The tools that were identified , both free and at cost, can support a deeper exploration of greenspace assets, look at the impact of land use changes and help a local area to conduct a valuation of their green estate. As part of th e Healthy New Towns Programme, Bicester has shown how taking an approach like this can support the development of green infrastructure to support the health and wellbeing of its population. A fundamental c hange in thinking about greenspace is now required. Greenspace needs to be planned for , provided and sustained for the value it delivers. This will require a clear vision of greenspace as natural capital, and for local government to work together with the health, voluntary and community sector to develop strategies for effectively financing and managing their greenspace. Alternative models of delivery, rather than exclusively local government -led initiatives, are now being suggested and trialled around the country. Examples can be found through the NESTA Rethinking Parks project, the National Trust/National Lottery Heritage Fund Future Parks initiative, and within the work undertaken by the Parks Action Group, all of which look at innovative ways of sustain ing parks and greenspace and ensuring they meet the needs of the local community (150, 151) . Some case studies featuring this i nnovative work can be found in Appendix D. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 36 5. Engagement with greenspace \"The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity... and some scarce see nature at all.\" - William Blake Increasing access to greenspace can give people more opportunities to engage with the natural environment, however there may still be barriers to engagement for some populations. For instance, there may be local circumstances, cult ural beliefs, or deeply held values that discourage or stop people from interacting with greenspace, which in turn can impact on health and wellbeing. Meaningful consultation with target populations can provide particular insight into what is most needed t o initiate engagement with the natural environment and can guide the development of interventions. Barriers to using greenspace There is a growing body of evidence aiming to understand why certain groups are less likely to use greenspace. There is variati on in who visits greenspace that may be a result of different factors such as physical barriers including lack of proximity, personal values, cultural norms, perceptions of safety, awareness or interest. Studies have shown that some of the key barriers to using greenspace include the following. (4, 5, 136, 152 -156) Physical barriers Physical barriers include: proximity - lack of good quality greenspace near to home ; MENE data shows that two-thirds of visits to gr eenspace are within 2 miles of home physical obstacles - lack of or poorly maintained road or path networks, challenging topography transport - lack of public transportation or private vehicle, cost of parking at a site lack of facilities - toilets, bench es, cafes ; this particularly applies to older groups and those living with disability Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 37 Social and cultural barriers Social and cultural barrier s include: social experiences - being out in a natural setting is not part of social expectations or backgroun d; discomfort over perceptions of what is seen as 'appropriate' behaviour in such spaces; feeling unwelcome or out of place cultural experiences - experiences of racism; fear of bullying; presence of dogs; failure to provide for the needs of a mixed commun ity, for example , areas where Muslim women can meet away from men different values - differences in the way people perceive greenspace as a contributing factor to health Perceptions, awareness, self -efficacy and interest Perceptions, awareness, self -efficacy and interest include : perception of safety - antisocial behaviour, vandalism, litter, poor maintenance, lack of lighting lack of awareness - limited awareness of opportunities to visit greenspace, particularly for low income groups low confidence - lack of experience and confidence in being in a natural setting time constraints - multiple, competing time pressures and interests ; MENE data shows that for those who tend not to visit the natural environment, being either \"too busy at work\" or \"too busy at home\" comprised a combined 36% of responses lack of interest - MENE data again shows that for those not visiting regularly, \"not interested\" and \"no particular reason\" together comprise 21% of responses Although there is now a well -evidenced list of b arriers to accessing greenspace, there is a need for further research to investigate the deeply held personal values and perceptions that influence both motivations and self -reported barriers to visiting greenspace (157) . Facilitating engagement with greenspace To help people get out into greenspace, they need to have the opportunity to use it, feel they have the capability to do so, and see a benefit to their lives. This may be through thoughtful and purposeful physical design, for example, to support more active lifestyles, to have enriched experiences or simply to normalise greenspace within the community. Or it may be through well-planned interventions to raise awareness or raise confidence in using their local greenspace. Well -designed greenspace will appeal to different groups. It is inclusive and accommodates people with a range of needs, offering opportunities for play, rel axation, social interaction and stimulation (26). Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 38 Some general approaches that have had success are outline d below, and further practical examples can be found in the case studies in Appendix D. Physical d esign Design to normalise greenspace Much of the evidence on the health and wellbeing benefits of greenspace considers the overall greenness of the living e nvironment or community, and there is emerging evidence of the role that incidental greenspace might play. Incidental greenspace can take many forms, ranging from street trees, to pocket parks, to green walls and roofs and other planting in public places (26). There is some evidence that groups who do not access parks or where parks cannot be provided (in dense ly developed parts of towns and cities, for example) may benefit from increasing the amount of incidental greenspace as part of an overall plan to have a greener urban environment (64). These features, if well -designed, may also help to reduce the health impacts of air pollution, the urban heat island and excess noise (7, 26) . Design for inclusivity Greenspace should be designed for a variety of user interest s and capabilities. Engaging the community in the design process is important. Often small details can make a big difference to those with health or mobility needs, and these groups can provide valuable insights that might be overlooked by those not direct ly affected (152) . These groups will also be able to advise on what is needed to enhance the potential for social interactions within the space. Commun ity insight can improve opportunities for future engagement and help in the delivery of any interventions. Brief principles of inclusive design The goal of inclusive design is to create places where everyone can participate equally, independently and with confidence and dignity. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) (158) developed 5 principles of inclusive design which are: place people at the heart of the design process - involve as many people as possible in the design so that it meets the local needs and promotes social cohesion acknowledge diversity and difference - understand the range of needs and design to overcome barriers offer choice, rather than a single design solution that cannot accommodate all users - it's not possible to me et every need, but provide solutions that welcome everyone on equal terms Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 39 provide for flexibility in use - understand how the space will be used, and ensure it is adaptable according to changing needs provide environments that are convenient and enjoyable to use for everyone - ensure people have appropriate signage, lighting, walkways, transport routes, and can access sufficient information to make them feel confident using the space Designing according to these principles will help all people to be able t o participate and experience a place equally and with confidence. Design for enriched experiences Sensory pleasures - experiencing the natural environment not only through sight but also through sounds, smells, and touch - have been linked to improvement s in positive emotions and feelings of physical and mental relief. Different types of sensory gardens, for example tactile planting, scented trails or acoustic or seasonal gardens can enhance people's enjoyment and give them the opportunity to interact wit h nature in a different way (152) . Greenspace can also be designed to facilitate different opportunities for social interaction, or for a sense of purp ose and achievement gained from activities such as volunteer gardening o r physical activity challenges. Designing and managing greenspace for this diverse range of needs and preferences can be a challenge, especially if there is restricted space. Conflict s over preferences can be minimised by separating areas as much as possible, for instance, providing some areas where dogs are not allowed can encourage use by those people and cultures that are not comfortable around dogs. Creating a welcoming and accessi ble space with a range of different environments allows for both tranquil areas, and areas where more lively activity can take place (159) . Design for more active lifestyles Good design makes it easy and attractive to be active, and creates opportunities with in our communities to have active and healthy lifestyles, providing enticing open spaces in locations that are easy to access, with activities for all to enjoy, such as play, gardening, recreation and sport (1). Sport England developed 3 active-design high level objectives tha t aim to ensure the physical environment is planned to give more opportunities to be active (160) . These spaces should: be accessible - provide greenspace that is sa fe, easy and convenient to access for the whole community enhance amenity - greenspace is of good quality, appropriate to local need and allows a range of activities Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 40 increase awareness - the design and layout raise prominence and awareness of opportunities to be active A key part of active design is creating routes for active travel. Green infrastructure should prioritise and encourage active travel by making walking and cycling more pleasant. Both incidental and specific areas of greenspace should be plan ned along routes people commonly use to get to their jobs, schools and local facilities such as GP surgeries, leisure centres or shops (25, 27) . Green gentrification Although we have evidence for general approaches to encourage use of greenspace, there is still a need f or further research to understand the variation in outcomes and identify what is effective for different demographic groups (see Appendix C). It is important not to assume that the health benefits of greenspace will be the same across all population groups (37, 39, 161) . Any action needs to be carefully planned and evaluated to make sure the benefits are maximised while not increasing the health inequalities it is trying to eliminate (4, 162) . One potential risk is of 'green gentrification'. This unintended consequence of improvements to greenspace, leads to change s in the social environment, local culture and demographics (163) . While new or improved greenspac e provide opportunities for a range of social and health benefits, gentrification may result in contentious local social relations and displacement of long -term residents, particularly among the most vulnerable urban residents, and may actually worsen heal th and other inequalities (164) . This 'green paradox' complicates the nature of greening as a ' win-win' intervention. Policy makers need to consider the complex and dynamic social and political contexts in which improving greenspace takes place, understand who will benefit in the short - and long-term, and try to anticipate and reduce or eliminate u nintended consequences so that greenspace provide equitable, sustainable benefits for the whole population (163) . Ensuring equitable greenspace The World Health Organiz ation suggests the following steps should be taken to ensure all population groups have access to and benefit equally from urban greenspace and that unintended effects are minimised (162) . In brief they are to: develop a common understanding of equity among the stakeholders define the objectives of the greenspace, in terms of equity, and compile su pporting data understand the population profile using the smallest possible spatial unit look at distribution of local benefits and resources, as well as disadvantages and deprivation levels Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 41 use data on greenspace availability and accessibility, if availab le, to assess any potential changes to equity involve the community, particularly vulnerable or disadvantaged groups, from the start - during the planning phase, this may help to ensure benefits are realised and avoid social conflicts about future use of t he greenspace; during the implementation phase, this may help with increasing feelings of ownership and responsibility (using local champions should be considered Interventions Greenspace interventions can help people realise a wide variety of social and health benefits. There are 3 basic types of interventions, those that: 1. increase the amount, quality or impro ve accessibility to greenspace 2. increase use of or engagement with the natural environment 3. use targeted health interventions based in greenspace (4) Greenspace interventions are context -specific, and the outcomes can vary depending on the setting and the population, leading t o the question, \"what works, in which circumstances and for whom\"? Interventions that increase the amount and quality of greenspace and improve accessibility This type of intervention modifies the physical environment. Examples of interventions of this ty pe are: adding a new greenway, improving a park, planting new street trees and vegetation, adding benches or lighting, improving facilities, improving parking or adding bus routes. There is mixed evidence of positive impact on health or usage associated with creating, modifying or improving the physical environment alone (5). The WHO suggests that a dual approach, where improvements to the physical environment are coupled with social engagement and participation, is most effective (162) . Interventions that increase use/engagement These can be particularly useful for those who have little experience accessing greenspace, or for whom its use is not part of their cultural norm. Simply providing a natural setting will not necessarily lead to increased use - it may be necessary to provide programmes that encourage people both to start using these spaces, and to maintain them lo ng-term. Evidence suggests that 'facilitated access', that is organised transport to a si te, followed by a supported led activity, can be successful in reaching underrepresented groups. The social value of regularly scheduled group activities can be a strong motivator for participation and encourage continued involvement. Facilitated access wa s seen to be Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 42 particularly effective for enabling use amongst Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups (especially women in these groups), older adults (particularly those coping with recent bereavement) and those with no previous experience of visiting wood lands (165, 166) . Targeted health interventions based in gre enspace Nature -based interventions encompass a wide variety of activities, from therapeutic horticulture, wilderness therapy and conservation activities, to walking in the park or spending time in your own garden. A systematic review of nature -based interv entions found participation in these programmes was associated with a significant positive effect on psychological, social, physical, and intellectual outcomes and suggest these are a valuable resource for public health (167) . This evidence is reflected in the commitments the 25YEP, which aims to explore how 'green prescribing', a type of social prescribing using nature -based interventions, can be used within mental health services. It will also be important in achieving the NHS LTP aim to extend social prescribing to 2.5 million more peo ple within the next 5 years. Tailored information sources Care should be taken in creatin g sensitively designed materials used to promote and encourage access to greenspace. Visual imagery and wording should aim to be inclusive, resonate with the target groups' views of who they are in the outdoors, and allow them to 'see themselves' in the im ages provided. The clothing, gender and ethnicities of the people in photos should be carefully considered, as well as testing wording so that it is not perceived as being intimidating or condescending (168) . There is some evidence that persuasive messaging techniques may be effective in changing the way people think about activities in greenspace, and help to build their confidence to undertake these (169) . When planning interventions that aim to increase access for disadvantaged groups, it is critical to have a detailed knowledge of local needs, cul tural contexts and attitudes, with clear objectives and strong targeting. Without this, there is a risk that the intervention could negatively impact those it is trying to help. For example, a scheme to increase community participation in Derbyshire's fore sts led to a large increase in visitor numbers, but not by the intended groups who were most in need (170) . There is now a good understanding of the barriers people may face in accessing and using their local greenspaces. Through ongoing engagement with targeted communities, thoughtful planning and design, and sensitively devel oped interventions, local government can help people to overcome these barriers. Below are the guiding principles set out within this chapter that have been shown to help people engage more with local greenspace. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 43 Guiding principles to encourage engageme nt with greenspace These inlude to: have ongoing and meaningful consultation with target populations to understand the barriers that are preventing them from using greenspace, such as physical barriers, social and cultural issues, perceptions of safety, aw areness or interest in greenspace - work systematically and jointly to identify solutions to these barriers consider the range of factors which have been shown to improve use of local greenspace, such as using inclusive design principles that make it easy and attractive for people to be in these spaces, and how design can help to achieve wider health and wellbeing priorities work with the target populations to identify the types of interventions that would be most likely to help them start or increase their engagement with greenspace, for example through facilitated access schemes, and use their expertise to understand how to promote them effectively and sensitively within the community consider taking a dual approach to get people out into greenspace - maki ng improvements to the physical environment to address barriers, along with providing interventions that promote social engagement and participation - as evidence suggests this is an effective approach carefully plan and evaluate any proposed changes to gr eenspace to make sure the benefits are equitable and do not increase the health inequalities they are trying to eliminate Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 44 6. A practical call to action \"Public health needs to make connections with planners by understanding what is important to them. We need to relate the planning applications to local data and explain how improving access to greenspace contributes to the wider council's agenda like physical activity, obesity and mental health.\" - Local government public health specialist \"The planners were talking about developi ng a green infrastructure SPD (supplementary planning d ocument), so I contacted them directly. I said that greenspace is a real public health issue, please can we comment. That's how it started. You just have to be brave enough t o pick up the phone and ask how to feed into the planning process.\" - Local government public health specialist In light of the evidence, government strategies are now supporting a longer -term focus on the prevention of illness, supported by planning and investment that makes population health a priority (171) . The challenge now is to put this into practi ce both locally and nationally. Local authorities play a vital role in: providing new, good quality greenspace that is inclusive and equitable improving, maintaining and protecting existing greenspace increasing green infrastructure within public spaces and promoting healthy streets improving transport links, pathways an d other means of access to greenspace, and providing imaginative routes linking areas of greenspace for active travel Working to improve access to green and bluespace involves many complex and inextricably linked problems that require extensive collaborat ion between national and local government and a range of stakeholders in order to achieve an impact. Public health teams, as part of local government, need to be essential partners in the planning and development of their local greenspace. Their specialist knowledge is essential for a whole -systems approach to developing healthy communities (25). Public health teams can provide context and evidence about the needs of the community, make sure that reducing health inequalities is high on the agenda and support councillors to understand local health and social care issues. A strategic approach will help teams integrate local health needs and health and wellb eing strategy aims into local plans and planning policies, which in turn will support masterplans, major developments, planning negotiations and decision -making processes. Access to good quality greenspace and a greener public realm need to be Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 45 specified in both local plans and strategies in order for this to be a consideration in planning authority decisions. Understanding national policy levers, as well as the purpose and contents of local policies and strategies is critical in order to address provision of sufficient access to greenspace and its longer -term sustainability. Local documents should reflect how greenspace is integral to meeting health and wider priorities, and support the protection and enhancement of them. Because of the many factors involv ed, local authorities may consider taking a Health in all Policies (HiAP) approach (172) . HiAP is designed to ensure that health improvement and the reduction of health inequalities are built into the assessment of all new policies. Making health an explicit criterion within policies helps to ensure there is a common understanding an d consideration of health and health inequalities, an agreed way of analysing the health impact of local actions, policies and strategies, and a common commitment to identifying and using greenspace for the greatest health and wellbeing impact through poli cy. Using such an approach can help local government and partners bring together individuals, organisations and communities to identify and pool their capacity, skills, knowledge, connections, assets and resources to improve population health. Below is a brief overview of some of the levers and partnerships that can be used to build and support a case for creating and maintaining greenspace. These include: 1. National planning policy levers 2. Local planning policy and strategy levers 3. Developer contributions toward greenspace 4. Key partnerships Public health teams can work together with local planning au thorities to learn more about local greenspace plans and strategies. This will allow them to engage at the most appropriate point in the process. 1. National planning policy National Planning Policy Framework The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out government planning policy for England and how this is expected to be applied. It provides a framework within which locally prepared plans for develop ment can be produced. The NPPF is a material consideration in deciding planning applications and supports positive development of greenspace and green infrastructure. The heart of the framework is a presumption in favou r of 'sustainable development'. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 46 The k ey policies around greenspace for health, community cohesion and recreation are: para 91 c para 92 b para 96 Planning Practice Guidance Since the first publication of th e NPPF, a series of Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) documents have also been published to support local authorities as they use the Framework. Relevant PPGs include: healthy and safe communities design natural environment open space, sports and recreatio n facilities, public rights of way and local greenspace climate change Access standards Access standards for greenspace can help with understanding current provision, which in turn can help to identify the need/demand within an area and gaps that may exis t. Access standards can include guidance on greenspace size, proximity/opportunity and quality. They may also take services and amenities into account. Evidence shows that having opportunities for both direct and indirect contact with different sized gree nspace at different distances, called \"cumulative opportunity\", is a stronger and more consistent measure linking greenspace with health and wellbeing, compared to residential proximity alone (173) . Quality is also an important part of people's perceptions of greenspace. Areas that are well designed, maintained and feel safe are associated with better health and social outcomes (66). Several organisations have produced access standards, for example, Natural England's Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard (ANGSt), Fields in Trust's Guidance for Outdoor Sport and Play, The Woo dland Trust's Woodland Access Standards and the London Plan (174-177). These all present a cumulative opportunity approach to access. Fields in Trust further includes standards for quality. ANGSt is the most compre hensive, not only setting standards for access, quantity and quality, but for services as well. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 47 2. Local planning policy and strategies as drivers of greenspace Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy and Joint Strategic Needs Assessment Health and Wellbeing Boards are responsible for producing both the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA), and the Joint Health and Wellbein g Strategy (JHWS) for their area. The outputs of JSNA and JHWSs are statutory requirements that help to determine the actions local authorities need to take to address th e wider determinants of health. The JHWS sets out the vision, priorities and actions to improve the health, care and wellbeing of local communities and reduce inequalities. The JHWS usually provides the strategic context for how a local area will implement the NHS Long Term Plan (178) . The JHWS can specify how access to greenspace can help to achieve the wider ambitions for the locality, for example reducing health inequalities or implementing green so cial prescribing. Local Plan The policies in a Local Plan are one of the key ways to create a healthier natural environment in a locality. Local Plans set out the priorities for development of an are a including residential, commercial, educational and industrial uses, including transport infrastructure, along with protection for the local environment. The Local Plan is a powerful and important influence on new development in an area, so it is critical that it states clearly that all sections of the population should have access to good quality greenspace near where they live, work and play. The NPPF provides the structure for producing Local Plans and must be in accordance with it. The Local Plan must include strategic policies to address priorities for the development and use of land in its area. The NPPF states these strategic policies should set out an overall strategy for the pattern, scale and quality of development. These strategic policies shoul d address 'sufficient provision for conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and historic environment'. This includes landscapes and green infrastructure (paragraph 20d): note that factors such as health service provisio n are also required (para 20c). The Local Plan should be underpinned by relevant health evidence, which Directors of Public Health have a role to play in providing. Future health needs, including access to greenspace and use of outdoor space for exercise/ health reasons (see Publi c Health Outcomes Framework Indicator B16), should be embedded within it. If the community's' health priorities are not reflected within the plan, it is likely to be difficult to ensure new development can pr operly support wellbeing needs. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 48 Local Plans mus t be updated every 5 years, giving regular opportunities to review and strengthen policies on greenspace and health. The Local Plans' importance as a statutory document is reflected in the time and level of resource devoted to preparing it. Local authority planners and Directors of Public Health can work together to make sure that local health priorities and evidence on health and greenspace are put into practice through statutory planning policy. Is health reflected in your Local Plan? In 2018 the Town an d Country Planning Association (TCPA) undertook a high -level review of all Local Plans/Local Development Plans in England and Wales to assess whether they reflect local health policies and strategies (179) . This review found that, for England, the majority of Plans recognised the importance of open spaces, play and recreational opportunities for health and wellbeing. However, there were some significant opportunities that are being missed which were: 77% of Local Plans did not take local health strategies into account, that is the statutory JHWS, despite this being a NPPF requirement 73% did not refer to local health needs assessments such as the JSNA, or highlight them as part of their evidence base 55% refer to the health and wellbeing benefits of good design in developments, but 45% have a dopted design policies that do not mention health and wellbeing When local health priorities are not reflected within the Local Plan, it can be difficult to make the case for specific planning standards to be implemented to address health needs, or to def end planning decisions made on health grounds. Public health teams can work with the planning authority to ensure the Local Plan reflects how greenspace can help meet local health objectives. Suppleme ntary planning documents (SPD) SPDs build upon and provide more detailed advice or guidance on the policies in the Local Plan and are a material consideration when determining planning applications. Following the adoption of the Local Plan by a local plan ning authority, the next stage of planning policy is, where appropriate, to develop suppleme ntary planning documents (SPD). Greenspace strategy To support positive development of greenspace a nd green infrastructure, the NPPF suggests local planning authorities prepare an authority -wide, evidence -based greenspace strategy that includes an assessment of current greenspace provision. This will help identify gaps in the network and opportunities f or improvement. This Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 49 strategy can go by other titles, for example, open space or green infrastructure strategy. This strategy can inform other plan policies and infrastructure delivery requirements, so authorities need to collaborate with neighbouring auth orities and stakeholders such as Local Nature Partnerships and Health and Wellbeing Boards when developing green infrastructure strategies. Some local planning authorities choose to use their greenspace strategy to develop a SPD that will guide future dev elopment. A greenspace/green infrastructure SPD can set out how the planning, design and management components of the area strategy will be delivered. Local gr eenspace designation The NPPF includes a Local Greenspace designation (LGS) to protect local green areas that are of particular importance to local communities. This will enable communities, in certain circumstances, to identify and protect those areas th at are of special value to them through local and neighbourhood plans. Neighbourhood p lans As part of the development plan for the local area, the neighbourhood development plan provide s further opportunities for specific planning for the creation and management of local green spaces. The Localism Act 2011 provides further powers for local communities (parish an d town councils, or in areas with them designated neighbourhood forums) to develop a plan for their area for sustainable development. These neighbourhood groups, especially those in areas with poorer outcomes in terms of access to quality green spaces, can bring forward planning policies and standards to secure better provision and access for health and wellbeing benefit of local people. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 50 Figure 3: The role of public health in developing the Local Plan and other greenspace strategies Improved a ccess to g reenspace within proposed new developments Supplementary Planning Document or Greenspace Strategy developed Local Plan Adoption by local authority Local Plan Found Sound Local Plan Submission to the Secretary of State Local Plan Publication draf t (consultation) Local Plan Evidence gathering Directors of Public Health may wish to provide data on local health needs to those developing the Local Plan.

This may be from JSNAs, the Public Health Outcomes Framework or other local data sources Health and wellbeing, and health inequalities are embedded into planning policy for improving access to greenspace. Public health can monitor new planning applications to ensure the policies are implemented. Consideration can also be given to evaluating the health impact. Once the Secretary of State finds the Local Plan sound and the plan is formally adopted by the local planning authority, public health can continue building relationships for future planning policy on access to greenspace. This does not usually require any support from public health. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 51 3. Developer contributions toward greenspace Developers may be asked to provide contributions for infrastructure, and this can provide an opportunity to channel funding to support local greenspace. There are 2 types of developer contributions, b oth of which are administered by the local authority as part of their regulatory role . These are : Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) planning obligations through Section 106 agreements Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) Local authorities can apply the CIL on certain types of new development in their area. The levy can be used to fund a broad range of infrastructure such as play areas, open spaces, parks and greenspace and cultura l and sports facilities, or to maintain or upgrade existing spaces. This can be used as a long -term planning opportunity to link up with the local authority's greenspace or parks strategy, giving more certainty over what infrastructure can be funded. Howev er, not all planning authorities use CIL. Section 106 agreements When a development proposal fails to meet local criteria, the local authorities may consider whether the development could b e made acceptable through the use of planning obligations. Planning obligations are legal obligations entered into to mitigate the impacts of a development proposal and are commonly referred to as 'section 106', 's106', as well as 'developer contributions' . Funding from s106 agreements can provide financial support to develop public greenspace and recreation projects. 4. Partnerships Health and Wellbeing Boards The Health and Wellbeing Board (HWB) is responsible for addressing the health needs of their population. HWBs are constituted within local authorities, and their purpose is to establish collaborative decision making, planning and commissioning across councils and the NHS to address health needs in an integrated manner. Many are using this opportunity to work with partners in public services and the voluntary and community sector to tackle the wider determinants of health (25). Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 52 Local Nature Partnerships Local Nature Partnerships (LNPs) are partnerships of a broad range of local organisations, businesses and people who aim to help bring about improvements in their local natural environment. Directors of Public Health can eng age with and contribute to discussions with the Local Nature Partnership in their area. Strategic policy -making authorities, which include both LNPs and local planning authorities, are required to cooperate with each other, and other bodies, when preparing , or supporting the preparation of policies which address strategic matters (the Duty to Cooperate). This includes those policies contained in the Local Plan. The NPPF states that planning policies and decisions should plan for the \"enhancement of natural capital... across local authority boundaries \". Therefore, neighbouring authorities may wish to consider how wider strategies for their areas can help address cross -boundary issues. This could be done by working collaboratively through LNPs. The LNP also sho uld work closely with Health and Wellbeing Boards and Directors of Public Health to contribute to enhancing green infrastructure in their area. Working with the Local Nature Partnership A Director of Public Health in the north east is successfully eng aging with the North East Local Nature Partnership. The introduction was made through the local planning authority and has led to collaboration on healthy weight workshops and creating a joint evidence base. The LNP supported the DPH annual report on local action to reduce obesity using a complex systems approach, which included access to greenspace with a focus on health inequalities. In summary, factors to consider within the local context that support planning, creating and maintaining greenspace are: learn ing about how greenspace and green infrastructure issues are addressed in national planning policy and how these can apply locally understand ing how greenspace is reflected in local policies and strategies, especially the Local Plan, and consider how this might be strengthened ensur ing that public health, spatial planning and others ( for example urban designers, landscape architects) work together to better understand where and when changes in policy and strategy can most effectively take place, and th e expertise each can put forward to support this being familiar with other elements of the planning system such as developer contributions and how these can be maximised to improve health through greenspace engag ing with other local stakeholder and commun ity groups such as Local Nature Partnerships and neighbourhood planning groups Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 53 NHS Healthy New Towns The NHS Healthy New Towns initiative (25) found th at: the public sector needs to work with both private and community sectors to address local health and wellbeing needs with appropriate design - it may be useful to build on partnerships and groups that are already in place; each should have a specific defined role and contribution leadership should be established early on, and remain as consistent as possible throughout partners need to develop a shared understanding of one another's processes and requirements, and agree a common language partners should commit to a shared vision and goals, and to delivering them Further resources Plain English guide to the planning system Planning Portal Healthy New Towns Spatial planning for health: evidence review PHE's Healthy Places team has produced a range of advice and guidance on the built and natural environment on health and wellbeing. These can be found on their website . To support local decision -making, a wide range of health and wellbeing -related data at local authority level is available through PHE's Fingertips tool , giving detailed local indicators on factors that protect and create health. These include: local authority health profiles local health (neighbourhood) profiles public health outcomes framework data PHE also provides several tools that can be used to understand local health data and assets: wider determinants of health tool strategic health asset planning and evaluation (SHAPE) tool Health Inequalities Dashboard and Segment Tool The Local Government Association (LGA), in association with PHE and the Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH), provides support for sector -led improvement in public health, prevention and health improvement.

Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 55 7. Conclusion and recommendations In 2014, PHE publi shed guidance on 'Improving Access to Greenspace'. It found that access to greenspace is associated with a range of positive health and social outcomes, but that benefits were unequally distributed, with more deprived communities having less access to gree nspace and with less opportunity to gain the associated health benefits. The guidance called for joint working between the local authority functions of public health, spatial planning, transport, and parks and leisure to improve the use of good quality gre enspace for all social groups to achieve better health outcomes and to reduce health inequalities. Since that time the evidence base for the links between health and greenspace has grown and our understanding of who benefits, how and to what extent has im proved. There is also a greater recognition in national policy of the importance of greenspace in meeting multiple objectives, from connecting people to the environment for their mental health and wellbeing, to reducing loneliness, to creating healthier hi gh streets, and addressing air quality - all of which contribute to the aim of preventing poor health an d reducing health inequalities. Inequalities in the distribution, quality, quantity and use of greenspace remain . Some of the groups that have the grea test challenges - older people, those in poor health, with a physical disability, of lower socioeconomic status, ethnic minorities, and those who live in deprived areas - continue to use greenspace less often and so continue to have less opportunity to ben efit from it. Recognising that greener neighbourhood environments convey a disproportionate health benefit to disadvantaged groups, well -planned green infrastructure can be one approach toward reducing health inequalities. This is particularly salient in t he context of widening health inequalities in England. However, the financial climate continues to present a challenge and has found local government struggling to maintain their greenspace. To sustain it requires new thinking about greenspace as critica l infrastructure to achieve wider local priorities, and creativity in how it will be funded, managed and delivered to meet the needs of the population. These times require strong local leadership and political wi ll that recognises the true value of loc al greenspace as essential assets in the delivery of health, social, environment and economic outcomes to ensure greenspace survive and thrive. Public health, along with other local authority teams, can work collaboratively on the work they have started - understanding their green infrastructure, exploring the full range of benefits and then methodically valuing them. This will enable a stronger case to be made for greenspace, and ensure it is not left out or forgotten, but rather is a vital part of the ove rall decision -making process. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 56 This report has discussed ways that local authorities, and local authority public health teams in particular, can reconsider the wider purpose of, and make the case for, high quality, accessible greenspace. In many places, public health and spatial planning teams are already working together and have developed a shared understanding of one another's processes and requirements to achieve common objectives. It is essential that these professions, together with landscape archit ects, recreation and leisure managers and others in local authorities, create opportunities to work together. This can help to ensure that health improvement underpins local decision -making processes and that new and existing communities have good quality green infrastructure at their heart. Good design integrates green infrastructure into the holistic masterplan in ways that promote active travel, recreation and leisure, and support community and social engagement. Greenspace must be recognised as critica l infrastructure that will help meet a range of local priorities and is not just something 'nice to have'. It is vital that the local plan and greenspace/green infrastructure strategy are informed by local health data, the Joint Strategic Needs Assessme nt and the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy and take a wider view of the multifaceted benefits of greenspace. Without reference to health policies and strategies within these documents, it becomes very difficult to support the development of planning st andards for health, or to defend planning decisions made on health grounds. When public health teams are conversant with the planning system, they can use the levers that are available to them. Over time, the evidence base for greenspace and local health outcomes will develop as the planning system is used as an intervention to improve access. Local authorities will then be able to develop robust evidence -informed cases of how greenspace has led to measurable differences. In many urban environments, it ma y not be feasible to create large new areas of greenspace. Fortunately, it is not only distinct greenspace that are associated with health benefits, but more generally by having greener neighbourhoods through threading different types of green - and blue - infrastructure throughout our communities including schools, our hospitals, our workplaces and our homes. This greener urban fabric would benefit everyone but may be most valuable to those who do not normally engage with greenspace . Providing ac cessible, good quality greenspace tends to attract people to use it, but this may not be enough. There will always be people who, for personal or cultural reasons, are unlikely to use greenspace, and these may be those who could benefit the most. Thoughtful a nd inclusive physical design, coupled with programmes of social engagement and participation, have been shown to be most effective at delivering on multiple outcomes and attracting different p opulation groups. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 57 The spatial planning process is being used to improve access to greenspace, however there is a gap in the evidence on how access to greenspace affects different population groups and consequently the impact on health inequalities for specific groups. This would be greatly aided by using consistent de finitions and standardised valid and reliable measures of data collection. Robust design and evaluation are needed to examine the health outcomes of interventions to promote individual behaviour change, especially with regard to demographic characteristics . This will help to better understand what works, in which circumstances, and for whom. This report offers the following policy, practice and research recommendations for local government and those working in partnership with it . Policy Consider local green (and blue) space to be critical assets for maintaining and supporting health and wellbeing in local communities. The evidence base linking health and greenspace is compelling, and supports innovative thinking about its potential to help achieve local priorities . Ensure that local policies and strategies are informed by evidence of need for sufficient access to greenspace . This can be done by: ensuring the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) and Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy (JHWS) define how local greenspace can be used to meet the current and future health needs of the population - JHWSs can reflect the part green infrastructure has to pla y in wider health and wellbeing strategies and how local stakeholders can contribute to improving acc ess to, and use of, such greenspaces ensuring the Local Plan reflects the health priorities laid out in the JSNA and JHWS - if local health prioritie s are not included within the Plan, it can be difficult to make the case for specific planning standards to be implemented to address health needs, or to defend planning decisions based on health and wellbeing grounds develop ing a green infrastructure st rategy and, as appropriate, supplementary planning documents (SPDs) to support policies for the protection an d enhancement of green infrastructure Prioritise improving access to greenspace and creating greener communities especially in areas of deprivation or where there is poor or unequal access, as part of the wider plan to reduce health inequalities locally . Disadvantaged groups appear to gain the most health benefit and socioeconomic inequalities in health are lower in greener neighbourhoods. Improvements must be carefully planned and purposeful consultation must occur at all stages in order to provide equita ble, sustainable benefits and ensure health inequalities are not inadvertently exacerbated. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 58 Local practice Support meaningful engagement across local government functions and the community to understand the actual and potential local benefits of greenspa ce and reveal the complex and diverse ways greenspace is thought about and used. Understanding the range of benefits greenspace delivers to the community lays the groundwork for conducting a valuation exercise. Consider whether a formal valuation of benef its is necessary to strengthen the case for the creation, revitalisation and maintenance of greenspace. This may be done using monetary, non -monetary or a combination of valuation techniques. Natural capital accounting is one approach supported by Governme nt. Identify and factor in resilient funding arrangements for the maintenance of greenspace as early as possible , so that it can continue to provide benefits in the long term. Any decision on spending or investment in local areas needs to take account of the potential impact on health and wellbeing as well as future financial sustainability, giving local public health teams and the NHS an opportunity to engage in the decision - making process. Establish interventions, such as green social prescribing initia tives, that will support people who do not use greenspace to begin using it. Programmes to support social engagement or to facilitate participation in activities, which may be jointly provided by local authorities, the NHS and /or VCSE organisations, couple d with improvements to the physical environment are most effective in enabling people to start using these spaces and to continue to use them. Work with local NHS systems and professionals , including Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships and Inte grated Care Systems, to promote the role greenspace plays in both individual and population health outcomes. This aligns with the health service's aim to take more action on prevention and use green assets , through initiatives such as social prescribing, as part of the overall plan to achieve this aim. Local research Develop persuasive, evidence -informed case studies that highlight the impact that accessible greenspace has on local health outcomes, especially for disadvantaged groups. Monitoring and eva luating local changes in access to greenspace, in conjunction with health data over time, will improve understanding of what works, for whom and how. This information can be developed into useful case studies that explore and highlight the benefits and val ue of greenspace for health. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 59 Support robust evaluation of local greenspace interventions to help build a broader evidence base . This can be done by: using valid and reliable measures of data collection to reduce the heterogeneity of research on health in equality and access to greenspace embed ding thorough evaluation in costings and plans from the inception of new schemes wherever possible The recommendations above are for local areas including local government, local NHS bodies and their system partners to consider based on current and future health needs of populations and i n the context of local systems. In the PHE Strategic Plan, 2020 -25, there is a commitment to supporting the creation of healthy communities by supporting local areas through work at a national level. This includes influencing agendas across government, shaping development of new national policy, promoting effective evidence -based solutions, and fos tering research and innovation. Improving access to greenspace for all communitie s requires leadership, partnership and development of shared agendas across organisational boundaries and between professions in the public and private sector. To enable healthier, more equitable and sustainable communities, we need to develop a shared vis ion for improved access to greenspace. In turn this will lead to improved local spaces, better health outcomes and reduced health inequalities. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 60 Appendix A : Evolution of evidence on health and greenspace A maturing evidenc e base The evidence reviews cited in Appendix B identified that, since the publication of PHE's 2014 Improving Access to Green Spaces report (181) , there has been a subst antial increase in the quantity of research which has focused on the linkages between greenspaces and health outcomes, as well as on the ways in which the environment can be used, designed or manged to promote health outcomes. Web of Science searches on ke y terminology such as 'greenspace' show year on year increases in volume of research findings produced and the recent investment in the topic by UK research councils and Europe Horizon 2020 (H2020) framework will result in further high-quality evidence, for example National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ), and Natural Environment Research Counci l (NERC ). The improved evidence base has extended our understanding of who benefits and how, to what extent, and in what ways. Pooling the evidence base The expansion in the quantity of available research has meant that are now a number of good quality evidence syntheses (including one which was carried out through the Cochrane Collaboration (182) ), and, w here there is sui table evidence, meta -analyses. Evidence syntheses have, or are considering the linkages between greenspace exposures and use, and outcomes such as: mortality (31-33, 36, 49) ; stroke (33); coronary heart disease (33); diabetes type 2 (33); maternal outcomes (35, 36) ; cancer (183); mental health (32, 44 -46, 49, 51, 63, 184 -186); stress and psychological restoration (187, 188) ; cognitive function (189, 190 ) and neurological disability (191) ; self-perceived general health (32, 33) ; and on recuperation fr om poor health (192) and quality of life (48). Reviews have also been produced on the linkages between greenspace and health behaviours, most notably on physical activity and recreatio n (63, 193 -197). Reviews have considered the value of greenspace to the health of specific demographic sub - groups including those with mobility impairment (198) , children and young people (44- 46), older people (190, 199, 200) , and in relation to gender (201) . Syntheses of the benefits of specific types of greenspaces have also been produced (185) . Types considered include green infrastructure (98, 110, 202, 203) , urban forests Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 61 (204) , and in relation to the ecological state (205, 2 06). Further reviews have considered questions relating to necessary proximity to greenspace for benefit (173, 207) . Finally, there are also a number of syntheses of the determinants of greenspace use (39, 58, 208, 209) , and in relation to the outcomes of health -focused greenspace actions and interventions (182, 190, 199, 209 -217). An improved understanding of the relationships b etween greenspace and health The expansion of the number of studies produced, and efforts to synthesise across the evidence base is to be welcomed. The linkages between greenspace and health outcomes are complex with indications of high levels of heterogen eity in the relationships according to a multitude of factors such as environmental, social and cultural context, the type, frequency and duration of exposure, and in relation to interactions with other health determinants. There is a greater use of robus t study designs, particularly in relation to the health, wellbeing and behavioural outcomes of environmental interventions (218-220). These studies are helping inform what works, where, how and why, and are reveali ng the active ingredients of interventions. Analysis of longitudinal and cohort data is helping to unpick the causal relationships between greenspace and health (221-231). Studies are also critically questioning th e explanatory potential of pathways such as attention restoration theory (188) , as well as addressing questions of equity and the distribution of resource and benefit (221, 232 -234). Qualitative studies are revealing the meanings of greenspace to individuals and communities (192, 200, 232, 235) and adding depth to intervention evaluations (220) . New explanatory theories, such as the role of biodiverse environmental microbiomes in promoting positive human health, are being explored (236-239). Involveme nt of ecological specialists is improving the ways in which we consider the types and states of environments to which people are exposed, clarifying the role of biodiversity and environmental complexity (240) . Finally, our understanding of the dis -benefits of exposure to greenspace is impro ving. For instance, new studies are clarifying the interactions between urban vegetation and form and air pollution on outcomes such as asthma (241, 242) , and the potential for urban greenspaces to provide habitats for zoonotic disease vectors (243) . We now have 10 years of Natural England's Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) data (56). This is an important resource and has been used to clarify who does and does not visit greenspace and why (136) , interactions between use type and benefit (139, 244) , and the impacts of different types and availabilities of environments (245-247). MENE data has be en used to build tools, such as the Outdoor Recreation Valuation Tool (ORVal). ORVal provides economic values and visit estimates fo r existing and new greenspaces. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 62 Challenges in the evidence base Many of the reviews listed above conclude that whilst there is a substantial body of useful evidence, there are certain limitations (see section 11). These include high levels of heterogeneity, poor quality studies and the patchy nature of the evidence base, with a lack of evidence relating to certain sub -groups an d pathways. This is not surprising in a relatively young research area but does limit the potential applicability of the evidence. One of the most pressing issues is the lack of clarity in terminology and of the 'exposure'. One review found that only abou t half of the studies included in the synthesis provided a definition of how 'greenspace' was conceptualised (248) . Typically greenspace has been considered in one of 6 key ways 1) amount of local area greenspace, 2) greenspace type, 3) visits to greenspace, 4) views of green space, 5) greenspace proximity and accessibility, and 6) 'connection to nature' (184) . Within each of these categories are numbers approaches to measurement and assessment. Clarity in how the environmental exposure is understood a nd measured is important as there some evidence that different conceptions of greenspace affect the nature of outcomes observed (249) . A further issue relates to how transferable evidence is between contexts and whether outcomes relating to one population o r setting will be consistent with and applicable to another population or setting. It is currently not clear, for example, whether the associations between residential greenspace exposure and psychiatric outcomes in a Danish population demonstrated in a re cent study (250) can be applied to the British context. Differences in urban form, socio -cultural norms in greenspace use throughout the life course, and the availability of health care between the 2 nations mean that we must be cautious. Replication of studies between nations is limited by fact ors su ch as data availability. There is a need for a greater focus on what works, unpicking causal pathways, clarifying how consistent relationships are between settings/populations etc., critical modes, times (for example childhood) and durations of exposures for benefit. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 63 Appendix B: Health benefits associated with access to and use of green spaces This review of evidence is a summary of the evidence presented in 2 reports: 1. Health and the natural environment: A review of evidence, policy, practice and opportunities for the future (4) 2. A rapid scoping review of health and wellbeing evidence for the Green Infrastructure Standards (5). The methods used to develop th ose reports are detailed within those documents. All associations are statistically sign ificant unless otherwise noted. Mortality There is a small body of evidence which has investigated the linkages between exposure to greenspaces in the living environm ent and mortality (31-33, 49) . The robust meta -analysis by Twohig -Bennett and Jones (33) found associations between living in high versus low greenspace neighbourhoods and all cause and cardiovascular mortality in adulthood. A higher quantity of objectively assessed greenspace in the living environment was also found to be positively associated with reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in earlier reviews, with the strongest associations for more deprived groups (31, 32) . No association with lung cancer mortality was found in the review by Gascon, Triguero -Mas (31) . Analysis of a cohort of women in the US found that living in the greenest neighbourhoods (the highest q uartile) was associated with reduced incidence of overall cancer mortality and respiratory mortality (33, 251) . Two studies found associations between environmental conditions, including higher levels of greenspace , and reduced mortality in neonates and infants (252, 253) . van den Berg, Wendel -Vos (32) found no studies that had investigated the impact of the quality of greenspace on all -cause mortality. One study found increased rates of cardiovascular mortality in women was associated with the loss of urban trees due to an invasive pest in the US (254) . Gascon, Triguero -Mas (31) found no evidence which clarified the necessary proximity or size of gree nspaces for reduced mortality. Analysis of US mortality data by James, Hart (251) indicated that the association between greenness and all -cause non -accidental morta lity was partly mediated by physical activity, particulate matter < 2.5m, soc ial engagement, and depression. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 64 Morbidity and physical state or function A substantial body of evidence has investigated the impacts of the amount of local -area greenspace and greenspace accessibility on a range of outcomes and risk factors (33, 183) . The most extensive and recent review and meta -analysis was carried out by Twohig - Bennett and Jones (33) , who reviewed 143 studies. The review combined the associations between a range of different types of exposures to greenspaces and 'health -denoting' levels of salivary cortisol, heart rate and heart ra te variability, diastolic blood pressure, and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol. The authors also found reduced incidences of type 2 diabetes. Although reductions in the incidences of stroke, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, asthma and coronary heart diseas e were found, these were not significant in the pooled analysis (33). Outcomes were found to be strongest for groups with lower socioeconomic status and for those living in the most deprived areas (33). Individual studies have found associations between increased greenness or biodiversity of the living environment and immune -regulatory related health outcomes such as reduced rates of atopic conditions (allergies) a nd 'healthier' microbiomes post mortem (238, 255) . Mental health There is a relatively robust and extensive body of evidence regarding the relationships between exposure to, use of, and perceptions of greenspace a nd a number of mental health outcomes (32, 44 -46, 49, 51, 63, 184 -186). The most comprehensive review of the effect of greenspace on positive mental health in adults (over the age of 16) was carried out by Houlden, Weich (184) . Their systematic narrative synthesis (meaning they were unable to carry out a formal meta -analysis) of 50 studies (majority of evidence was good or of moderate quality) found: some evi dence of a positive association between greater amounts of local area greenspace (in relation to the home) and higher life satisfaction and reduced mental distress limited evidence of the impact of different types of greenspace on mental health and wellbei ng limited evidence that more frequent visits to greenspaces are associated with mental health and wellbeing greenspace closer to the home 'may be most strongly' associated with mental health but the evidence is currently limited while views of nature and subjective connection to nature may be associated with mental wellbeing the evidence was rated as inadequate Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 65 The review by Gascon, Triguero -Mas (51) , which went beyond positive mental health and wellbeing to also consider poor mental health, found some ev idence that greenspace in the local area is associated with mental health in adults, but that the evidence linking 'access' to greenspace and mental health was inadequate and insufficient to draw conclusions. Further reviews have found evidence for links b etween nature in the urban environment and positive emotions (affect) and strong evidence of positive associations between the quantity of greenspace in the living environment and self-rated mental health and reduced rates of reported stress (32, 49, 50) . Factors such as age, gender and physical activity behaviours appear to moderate relationships between greenspace exposures and mental health outcomes in adulthood (32). There is some evidence from controlled trials to indicate that physical activity in greenspace is m ore beneficial than activity in other settings, with reduced feelings of tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy and feelings of revitalization and positive engagement (40). Several sys tematic reviews have found positive associations between the presence of greenspaces in the living environment and mental wellbeing (self - and parent -rated) outcomes in children and young people (44-46). Tillmann, Tobin (46) found positive associations with emotional wellbeing, reduced stress and improved resilience (resulting from adventure activities) and higher health -related quality of life. Several reviews found evidenc e of positive associations between greater exposure to, or accessibility of greenspace and reduced rates of hyperactivity and inattention (44-46). Vanaken and Danckaerts (44) found that the effects of greenspace on children and young people's mental health and wellbeing appears to vary according to developmental stage and in relation to the type and accessibility of greenspaces. Maternal outcomes There are a number of studies, including 2 systematic reviews, which have investigated the associations between residential greenspace and a number of maternal and birth outcomes (33, 35, 36) . Two systematic reviews and meta -analyses found positive and relatively consistent associations between higher levels of greenspace in the living environment and more favourable birth weight (33, 35) . Dzhambov, Dimitrova (35) found that greenspace within 100 metres of the home was associated with higher birth wei ght and Twohig - Bennett and Jones (33) found lower rates of pre -term birth in greener areas. The review by Banay, Bezol d (36) found relatively inconsistent evidence of an association between greenspace and gestational length and no consistent association with pre -term birth. There was inadequate evidence to draw any conclusions about associations with maternal outcomes su ch as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes (36). Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 66 The review by Banay, Bezold (36) found that the associations between greenspace exposures and birth outcomes were lower in groups w ith lower socioeconomic status and educational levels. Physical activity was found to be a mediator of the effect of the amount of greenspace on post -partum depression in one UK study (227) . Other potential mediators include traffic, air quality and environmental conditions such as walkability (36). Self-rated general health and wellbeing and quality of life A small number of studies have considered the impac ts of greenspaces on self -rated general health (32, 33) . The review by van den Berg, Wendel -Vos (32) found moderate, generally consistent evidence, from good or adequate quality studies, of positive associations between the quan tity of greenspace in the living environment and self -rated health. Positive associations were also consistently (though only from moderate quality studies) found between the quality of greenspaces, whether objectively assessed or perceived, and self-rated general health by van den Berg, Wendel -Vos (32) . Most studies found some variation according to socio -demographics. Although people with lower levels of educational achievement appeared to benefit more from greenspace in the living environment than people with higher l evels of education, the effects of socio -economic status, gender and age were less consistent (49). Devel opmental and cognitive outcomes A small body of research has considered the impacts of greenspace exposure on cognitive function and developmental indicators (33, 189 -191). There is some, inconsistent, evidence of a positive association between greater exposure to greenspace and neuropsychological development of attention and working memory in children and young people (33, 44, 45) . Analysis of German data found that children living in areas with the lowest percentage of natural area were significantly more likely to have deficits in motor development in comparison to children living in greener areas (33, 256) . Dis-benef its There is a small body of research which has sought to clarify the potential dis -benefits of exposure to greensp ace on various health outcomes. Greenspaces may provide a habitat for zoonotic vector species (such as ticks and Lyme disease) (243) or allergenic p lants. Urban trees have been associated with increase in air pollutant concentrations in certain types of urban form (particularly 'urban canyons') Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 67 (242) . There is some evidence that suggest s that air pollutants and pollen interact exacerbating the negative effect to health (257) . An individual study linked greenspace to increased rates of skin cancer risk via greater sun exposure (Australian study) (258) . There is some evidence to suggest that feelings of insecurity and fear are associated with presence of dense urban greenspaces in the living environment for some populations (259, 260) . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 68 Appen dix C : Literature review on inequalities and access to greenspace in the UK A literature review was conducted to scope out the current state of evidence in the UK on inequities and inequalities in access to greenspace. This section provides the findings of this review. The quality of individual studies was not assessed. Methods This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (261) . Search strategy The search strategy comprised combinations of synonyms for green/blue space, health and wellbeing, inequality, population and place as shown below. Search strategy for the literature review Green* OR *env OR park OR natur* OR blue AND Health OR wellbeing OR well being AND Inequal* OR equal* OR depriv* OR SES OR socio* AND Spatial OR space OR place AND Population Searches were conducted in 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, HMIC and PsychInfo) , and reference lists were checked for the purpose of locating other suitable studies. The searches were undertaken of studies published between 1 January 2008 and 21 December 2018. The year 2008 was selected as the start date because it was the year the W orld Health Organisation's Commission on Social Determinants of Health was published (262) . This report was recognised as leading to the publication of England's first evidence -based strategy on addressing the social determinants of health (135) . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 69 Inclusion and exclusion c riteria The PICO format was used to define inclusion criteria. To be included in the review, the population of interest (P) had to be people i n the UK, disengaged with the natural environment as defined by Natural England (154) ; include at least one aspect of green infrastructure (I), that is greenspace, blue space, parks and gardens; and any measure of health inequality from access to green infrastructure (O). Comparator studies (C) were classed as any other study examining green infrastructure. All empirical qualitative and quantitative studies investigating access to greenspace, health inequality and health outcomes were eligible for inclusion in the review. This includes, cohort, case - control, cro ss-sectional, observational, RCTs and quasi -experimental studies. Only peer-reviewed published empirical data was included. Only literature in English and conducted in the UK was included. Study s election Screening was com pleted using EndNote X8 (Clarivat e Analytics, Philadelphia, USA). After deduplicating references, title and abstract screening was completed, f ollowed by full text screening. Data extraction Study characteristics from included publications were extracted by one author (AH) including stud y design; location; population (sample size, gender, ethnicity and child age); health outcome measure; type of green infrastructure; statistical measure of association where appropriate. Results 4412 references were identified through searching the databa ses. After deduplication (n=970), 3441 titles and abstracts were screened against the inclusion criteria and 3320 excluded. Full text articles of 122 studies were screened for inclusion, with 71 papers being included in the review. These were all written i n English. This process is shown in Figure 4 (261) . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 70 Figure 4 : PRISMA Flow Chart Records identified through database searching (n=4412) Additional records identified through other sources (n=1) Records after duplicates removed (n=970) Records screened (n=3442) Records excluded (n=3320 ) Full-text articles excluded (n=98) Studies included in qualitiative synthesis (n=2) Studies included in quantitative synthesis (n=22) Identification Screening Eligibility Included Full-text articles assessed for eligability (n=122) Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 71 Data collection measures Deprivation The most popular measure of deprivation was the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (136, 168, 263 -270). Others used the Carstairs Index (271-273); the Townsend Score (274-276); National Statistics Socio -Economic Classification (NS - SEC) (277, 278) ; the Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) (279) ; ONS household deprivation (233) and the Market Research Society Social Grade (ABC1) (233) . Furthermore, income was also used as a prox y for socio -economic position (280) . Health outcomes Across the studies identified i n this review, many different health outcomes were examined. The most common health outcome assessed was mental health, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was the most popular measure, along with salivary cortisol (271-273) followed by the Warwick and Edinburgh Well -Being Scale (WEMWBS) (266, 273) . Other measures of mental health used in the research included cognitive function (264) ; the 5 question Mental Health Inventory (MHI -5) (270) ; the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) (275) ; the UCLA loneliness scale (269) ; social wellbeing and anxiety disorders (263) . Physical activity was the next most popular health outcome studied. To investigate associations between physical activity and green infrastructure in different populations, the most common measures were those developed by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) (269, 273) , and International Physical Acti vity Questionnaire (264, 277) . The BHF methodology comprised the number of days over the last 4 weeks that the participant reported over 30 minutes of physical activity, whereas the IPAQ questionnaire examin ed the number of MET hours per week. Similarly, the Scottish Physical Activity Questionnaire was also used ( 22). Other objective measures of physical activity were collected by assessing the number of days per week participants were active (276) ; and b y the results of the Active People Survey (268) . Furthermore, the provision of green infrastructure for physical activity was also examined (278) . Further health outcomes examined included various measures of self -reported health (269, 271, 279) , with some explaining that they used self -report data as provided by the ONS Census (274, 280) . Some studies looked at whether health was a facilitator for access to greenspace (281) , or similarly , poor health a barrier for access (136) . Mortality (267) , morbidity, years of life lost (YLL), and illness & disability ratio (263) were also investigated. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 72 Green infrastructure A number of different measures of green infrastructure were identified across the UK literature. The most common measure of green infrastructure in this review was the Generalised Land Use Database (GLUD) (263, 266, 267, 269) which classifies all land use in England into 9 categories. One of the se categories is greenspace, and includes parks, open spaces and agricultural land, but excludes domestic gardens. Several studies from Scotland used publicly accessible greenspace as their measure, including parks, woodlands, scrubs and other natural envi ronments and excluding public gardens (271-273). The next most popular measure was the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (263, 275) , an indicator of greenness based on land surface reflectance of visible (red) and near infrared parts of the spectrum. Others measures of green infrastructure used by studies in this review include the Urban Atlas (268, 270) ; Residential Env ironment Assessment Tool (REAT) (279) ; and local authority greenspace databases. Some studies used their own measures including natural areas defined as parks, beaches and agricultural land (274) ; play areas and allotments (278) ; or areas of land open to public access (168, 267) greenspace (263) , a relative proportion of greenspac e between 0 and 1 (266) . In Scotland the percentage of greenspace per Census Area Statistic (CAS) ward was used as a measure of accessibility (271, 272, 274) . Means of access Means of access to green infrastructure was measured in a variety of ways across studies. The majority of studies measured access by using a straight -line distance (Euclidean) (265, 267, 268, 275 -278, 280) . Others used network distances (266, 269, 276, 277) . Furthermore, some used different calculations derived from lower level super output areas (LSOA), including percentage of land area classified as greenspace (267) , total greenspace (263) , and a relative proportion of gre enspace between 0 and 1 (168) . In Scotland, the percentage of greenspace per Census Area Statistic (CAS) ward was used to measure me ans of access (271, 272) . Demographic i nequalities Gender Women are less likely to report that they are infrequent visitors to greenspace, and less likely to report that they are not interested in visiting greens pace (136) . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 73 Residential surrounding greenness was positively associated with global cognition in men but not women. Conversely, there was a positive association betw een the NDVI and a change in cognition for women, but not men (264) . The association between Residential Environment Assessment Tool (REAT ) score and poor health was not affected by gender (279) . Furthermore, the association between the availability of greenspace and physical activity was not significantly different between males and females (280) . Additionally, there was no significant difference between exposure to greenspace and either mental h ealth or physical health for both men and women (270) . Likewise, although the percentage greenspace in the ward of residence was associated with self -reported stress and physical activity, there was no signi ficant difference between males and females (273) . Both men and women's levels of perceived stress was higher in low greenspace areas. However, women's perceive d stress was significantly higher in low greenspace areas compared to men. Furthermore, not having a garden was associated with higher (perceived?) stress for men, but not women (272) . When an objective measurement of blood cortisol was taken, there was no significant overall association between neighbourhood greenspace and average blood cortisol levels. However, where there was a higher percent age of neighbourhood greenspace, this was associated with higher average blood cortisol levels among females, but not males. This may indicate higher stress amongst females (272) . The association between residential greenness and major depressive disorder was only seen amongst females (282) . Visits to beach environments for sunbathing and paddling were more popular amongst females than males. Women also preferred recreational walking in all types of green infrastructure, includi ng rivers, lakes and canals; urban spaces and woodlands or forests. Other coastline environments were more popular amongst males. Furthermore, males were more common visitors to rivers, lakes or canals, particularly for fishing and water sports (282) . Age Older adults were more likely to report that they are infrequent visitors to greensp ace, with no particular reason given as their motivation (136) . However, older adults were less likely to report that they were not interested in visiting greenspace (136) . One reason given for infrequent visits by people living near the coast was poor health (136) . It could be argued that this is due to older people being more likely to live near the coast. The association between poor health and the REAT score became stronger with age for women (279) . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 74 Different types and uses of green infrastructure were more popular at different points across the li fe course. Visits to rivers, lakes or canals and the beach environment were more popular for those aged 35 -64 years compared to 16 -34 year olds, yet visits to other coastline environments were more popular for older people. Furthermore, woodlands and fores ts were more popular amongst 35 -64 year olds compared to those aged 16 -34 and over 65 (282). Fishing in coastal environments and recreational walking along rivers, lakes and canals was more popular amongst 35 -64 year olds compared to 16 -34 year olds. However, recreational walking in urban spaces was more likely amongst younger adults, and walking in woodlands and forests was preferred by 35 -64 year olds. Also, sunbathing and paddling, and water sports in coastal environments were more popular amongst 35 -64 year olds compared to those older than 65. On the other hand, swimming in marine and coastal environments was more popular amongst 16 - 34 year olds, and less popular amongst people aged 65 and over (282) . As age increases, a higher level of greenspace was associated with a greater diurnal cortisol decline ( that is less stress) (272) . A different study looked at why people do different things to relive stress depending upon their age and associations with their access to and satisfaction with greenspace. They found that despite having good access to greenspace, high stress - mid aged people (25 -47 years) expressed poor satisfaction with local greenspace and were less likely to visit for exercise, relaxation or social reasons (271) . Conversely, low stress - youth with good access and reasonable satisfaction levels reported that they used urban greenspace for exercise, relaxation or social reasons. Low stress - seniors with good access, used the greenspace for relaxation (271) . One s tudy found no differences between health and neighbourhood greenspace when comparing the elderly and younger age group (270) . A protective effect was seen for residential greenness on major depressive disor der amongst people aged less than 60 years. Those with greater accessibility to greenness were significantly less likely to experience a major depressive disorder (275) . Education Residential greenness was negatively associated with a series of cognitive scores at baseline and over time became positively associated with a University education. Those with a secondary education saw a positive association with cognitive scores at baseline and over time. Those with low education also saw a positive association with cognitive scores at baseline, however no association was seen over time (264) . The effect of neighbourhood greenspace varied between population groups of different educational levels. Low educated residents reported poor general health significantly more when living in neighbourhoods where there was objectively better quality greenspace, but no differences were found for the amount of greenspace in the Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 75 neighbourhood (270) . However, there was some evidence that low education residents benefit more from greenspace in their neighbourhood compared to high educated residents (270). Employment When compared to full time employment, all other categories were less likely to report being an infrequent visitor to greenspace and were less likely to report they are too busy at work to visit greenspace. Therefore, full time employmen t may be a barrier. However, those not in full time employment were more likely to report they are not interested in visiting greenspace (136) . Those in part time emp loyment were more likely to report other barriers including being too busy at home, or poor health (136) . When comparing women who were not working to those who are working, there was a weaker association between poor health and REAT score (279) . However, one study found no difference in the association between neighbourhood greenspace and health by employment status (270) . Ethnicity Access to greenspace may be shaped by many dy namics, including broader socio - cultural influences on people's awareness of nature connection. There may also be varying priorities to the extent that time is spent in nature (136) . Those of white British ethnicity were less likely to report visiting greenspace less than once per month, and less likely to report time as a barrier (136) . Following an equity analysis of the UK Healthy Towns project, good access to new infrastructure including green infrastructure was not available in areas with high non-white British populations (Black Minority Ethnic)(BME). This was despite BME populations being a target group, meaning they were spatially disadvantaged by the project (278) . One study examined the association between expected deaths and access to greenspace. This study found that residents of more ethnically diverse LSOAs were at a higher risk of poor access to greenspace, predicting 8 -11 deaths per 100,000 persons. When compared to White populations, there were 1 -2 expected deaths per 100,000 population (268) . However, a different study found that the relationshi p between higher residential surrounding greenness and cognitive decline was not affected by ethnicity (264) . The quality of, access to and use of greenspace was a significant predictor of general health in a mixed BME population (non -Indian/ White British) , that is if people from a mixed BME populatio n were more satisfied with their local greenspace, this was Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 76 associated with better health. People from a mixed BME population have significantly more negative perceptions and are less satisfied with urban greenspace quality, particularly those from a Bangl adeshi origin. People of White British and people of Indian origin rate their neighbourhood more positively than mixed BME. However, perceived quality of greenspace predicts health across all ethnicities. Easy access to greenspace by walking was associated with very good health for people of Indian origin and good health for White British populations (269) . In one study, the LSOAs with above median street tree density were characterised by a higher proportion of Asian/Asian British populations livin g nearby and a lower proportion of White British. Conversely, LSOAs with higher accessibility to greenspace had more white residents than those with low accessibility (233) . However, when population density was taken into account the association was no longer significant, which suggests ethnicity does not play a part, only population density. Furthermore, greenspace quality was positively associated wit h the proportion of Asian/Asian British population, and a limited negative association was found with the proportion of White British population (233) . Some non -White populations felt excluded from marketing material, as they felt it was not ethnically diverse. This may be a barrier to some populations accessing and using greenspace (168) . Housing tenure Two studies considered housing tenure. An equity analysis of the Heathy Towns Project identified that new infrastructure such as greenspace tended to be located in areas with a greater amount of social housing (278) . However, the association between a poorer residential environment assessment tool (REAT) score, and self -reported poor health was not influenced by housing tenure (279) (19). Disability Research examining the reasons why people have infrequent c ontact with greenspace found that those with long term illness or disability, were more likely to report being infrequent visitors, and more likely to report their reasons as poor health; they were not interested; or they had no particular reason. On the o ther hand, this population were less likely to report their reasons for not visiting greenspace as being too busy at work or home (136) . Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 77 Summary Whilst there is st rong evidence showing the links between health and exposure to/use of greenspace, as presented in Appendix B, the evidence from this literature review on associations between access to greenspace and health inequ ality in the UK is less robust. The review found that most studies identified do suggest associations between access to greenspace and health inequality, yet some found no clear relationship. This may be due to measurement variability and the cro ss-sectional nature of studies. Therefore, to improv e the quality of evidence in this area, we suggest : develop ing consistency in measurement for health inequality, access to greenspace and health outcomes to allow comparison of project outcomes across the UK conducting robust evaluations of spatial plan ning policy and implementation that include health inequality and access to greenspace includ ing variables to measure health inequality as well as health outcomes when assessing the influence of individual behaviour change interventions, collect ing data t o assess the impact of interventions over longer periods of time , for example at least 1 -2 years encourag ing the publication of evidence on associations between improving access to greenspace and health inequality This will influence and inform UK policy makers and practitioners to promote equitable usage of green spaces; and overcome barriers for target populations which may face difficulties in accessing or using the natural environment. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 78 Appendix D : Case studies The following case studies are presented in this appendix : Focus: Targeting communities to reduce health inequalities Study 1: The Mersey Forest Nature4Health Study 2: Dorset Stepping into Nature Focus: Rethinking parks as a health asset Study 3: Camden and Islington Parks for Health Study 4: Naturally Birmingham Focus: Joint working across local government and the health service Study 5: Norfolk Planning in Health Protocol Focus: Targeting communities to reduce health inequalities Study 1: The Mersey Forest: Nature4Health Nature4Health, a 3 -year \u00a3420,000 project funded by the Big Lottery's Reaching Communities programme, was delivered by The Mersey Forest. What is 'The Mersey Forest'? The Mersey Forest is both a Place and a Partnership. It is a network of woodlands and green spaces across Cheshire and Merseyside, and a wide-ranging partnership of different organisations including local authorities, community groups, landowners and businesses. For 25 years, the partnership has been taking every opportunity it can to create 'woodlands on you r doorstep', planting over 9 million trees. The Forest is made up of post -industrial land such as Collier's Moss, as well as traditional parks and outdoor community spaces. The Mersey Forest actively promotes itself as a reason to invest in the area, and is quick to say it is improving the image of the region's towns and cities. Rather than a traditional funding mod el, it uses an investment model which may be of interest to other organisations (see link below). Nature4Health was a Lottery funded project within the remit of the wider 'Natural Health Service', targeting specific communities with the aim of reducing health inequalities through 5 different evidence -based activities, all taking place in a green, therapeutic environment. This broad -ranging intervention included forest schools (allowing children time and scope to explore the natural environment), woodland walks, therapeutic gardening and practical conservation sessions to get the heart pumping. Participants were also offered the opportunity t o learn mindfulness techniques in a natural setting. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 79 The activities were provided in 8 to 12-week blocks, with highly targeted, tailored sessions. Some focused on particular groups ( for example, children) or health conditions ( for examp le, adults with dementia). Evaluation shows the programme brought a significant increase in levels of physical activity and positive mental wellbeing, and had a major impact on a positive sense of community. Says project manager Clare Olver: 'We found t hat if we did things right, we might do much more to help people move on with their lives. They might make the project sustainable by managing it themselves, boosting their experience for the job market.' According to Olver, it's important not to simply 'helicopter in' interventions. 'We learnt to tailor activities to fit in with the local culture, and according to local need. In St.Helens, for instance, we had to reach some groups we know are difficult. Bespoke men's walks with Saints RFL were a big succ ess: dubbed 'walking rugby' they attracted this hard -to- reach group in a way that a 'health walk' wouldn't. 'Effective monitoring and evaluation is vital. We learnt to listen and adapt as we developed, so we could be both proactive and flexible in deliver y.' IPAQ questionnaires assessed levels of self -reported physical activity. The overall increase in 'MET -minutes' per week was 31.1%. All participants were also asked to complete WEMWBS questionnaires, and showed a marked improvement in scores of mental wellbeing of over 6 points. According to Olver, their data showed that a physical health focus wasn't enough. 'Social interaction is what is critical to success.' This is a theme that emerges time and again in the case studies made for this report. Whe n it comes to evaluation compliance, she says: 'There is absolutely nothing better than encouraging people to sit down with a cup of tea. And put the pencil in their hand...' Top Tips These factors were key: safe, welcoming and easy to access venues in the natural environment identifying local need and responding in a localised way taking a holistic approach engaging the target group and understanding barriers to participants' involvement. the right project staff, empathetic and enthusiastic, are crucial. Th ey also need to be right for specific groups your current participants may become your future volunteers participants are more likely to re -attend when the group is close to where they live Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 80 Further resources Project website: www.nature4health.org.uk/ Online evaluation report: http://nature4health.impacts.report/ and the opportunity to see short videos that give fuller context The investment model: www.merseyforest.org.uk/about/who -funds -the-forest/ Cheshire's Natural Health Service Study 2: Dorset Stepping into Nature Stepping into Nature is a project led by Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is funded by The National Lottery Community Fund, Dorset AONB & Dorset Council. The project aims to improve engagement opportunities with nature for Dorset's older adults, including people living with dementia and their carers. In addition, the project delivers a community dementia -friendly greenspace grant which has supported 19 projects with \u00a328k in funding, matched by \u00a343k in kind or mat ch, including 672 volunteer hours. They live in an 'Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty'. Yet for the 13,400 people in Dorset who are living with dementia*, or for those isolated older people who can't drive or don't have transport, living in this public t ransport -light part of the world can be tough. In Dorset, 1 in 5 older adults are vulnerable to social isolation*. This can cause physical or psychosocial stress resulting in damage to people's physical and mental health. Stepping into Nature is a project that has recognised these problems and taken active steps to reconnect people living with dementia to nature. With guided activities, Dorset's older adults are supported to access and enjoy the sensory -rich places in the surrounding landscape, wildlife an d local historic culture. This multi -platform project funds community groups, small activity providers and local organisations to improve inclusivity of nature - based activities and publicise inclusive green spaces. Since April 2017, over 500 dementia friendly nature -based activities have been delivered through a range of partners. Marketing the project proved a challenge, but one where new tools of engagement are effective. It was a matter of reaching not just those living with dementia, but their carers and those in the wider community who would pass the message on. Using highly local providers with strong local networks helped; they would circulate local pamphlets, leaflets and community board messages. The project has improved the wellbeing of not just the people affected by the condition, but of their carers and families. It takes, says Julie Hammon project officer at Dorset AONB, 'a philosophy of positive risk taking'. Longer term aims include forging new partnerships with the health sector in Dorset and linking more closely with social prescribing. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 81 Top tips Julie Hammon says, 'early, on -going evaluation will help you adjust the things you need to, fast. For instance, we found that headlining something as 'a dementia walk' was a turn-off. People didn' t like being labelled - and it made it less inclusive. The activity itself has to be the draw, and in your marketing, you can just add subtle reminders that the activity is dementia -friendly. 'We found that this project has been a great opportunity to up -skill some of our providers, who weren't quite sure how to engage with this audience. Also, it helps if everyone is ready to be flexible. Work with your providers on the evaluation side from the very beginning. They may be reluctant at first, but they soon see that the quicker they gather robust data, the quicker they can adjust their offer and the more effective they can be. 'With dementia it takes a while to overcome barriers, and to build an audience. Once you have done that, it all gets a bit easier. Y ou can use what you learn to improve your offer, making it more inclusive for all.'

This 2-year programme, which began in 2019, is enabling 8 areas to explore new ways to fund and manage local parks sustainably. It draws upon expertise in local government, conservation, fundraising, volunteering and greenspace management to find creative solutions that can be shared with other councils to ensure green spaces are able to be managed eff ectively now and in the future. Parks for Health, in the London boroughs of Camden and Islington, and Naturally Birmingham are 2 of the projects looking specifically at how their local parks can be used as a health asset for the community. At the time of publication, these projects were within their first year, and these case studies reflec t what has been learned so far. Information: National Lottery Heritage Fund - Future Parks Initiative Study 3: Camden and Islington Parks for Health Parks for Health is being led by Camden and Islington Councils and is funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, National Trust, Ministry of Housing, Communities an d Local Government, Camden and Islington Councils, Camden and Islington Public Health, Greater London Authority and London Sport Camden and Islington Councils' Parks for Health project was developed to address local health priorities including high leves of mental ill -health, physical inactivity and health inequalities, and to increase social cohesion and respond to social isolation. The community's parks were well -used and enjoyed, however the vision is to shift the thinking about these spaces as passive enablers of positive physical and mental health outcomes to playing a central role in achieving better health for the local population. The project aims to: develop a new infrastructure to deliver health -focused green space provision develop closer li nks to the NHS, health providers and doctors build a strong understanding of community infrastructure to enable engagement with, and pathways into, social networks produce a baseline assessment of the current health opportunities of our green spaces identi fy and test innovative opportunities in the active use of green spaces for wellbeing Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 83 Securing senior -level and political buy -in has been important for the project to proceed and the project board, as the decision -making body, includes senior councillors an d officers from both boroughs. This is supported by a project steering group, which includes heads of greenspace for the 2 boroughs. The project is managed by a dedicated project team. There are 5 workstreams that are key to the delivery of programme acti vities: strategy, communication and marketing, networks and partnerships, insight and innovation and workforce transformation. Each has officers representing different areas of expertise within the councils, including parks, public health, sports and commu nications teams. Each workstream is co -designing an action plan that identifies what will be done to engage the target groups and achieve the vision as it relates to that workstream. Engagement with both the workforce and communities is key to this work. T he project will also be complemented by a valuation of the social and economic value of local green infrastructure. Engaging stakeholders across both boroughs is a critically important part of the work in order to demonstrate how the project can help to a chieve health and wider priorities. Internal and external partners have been willing to give their time and commitment to the project. The National Lottery Heritage Fund and the National Trust have provided support and insight to the project that is very valuable. For example, in a project called Parks Challenge, National Trust officers visited 40 parks across Camden and Islington and talked to officers and external partners. Their findings were fed back and will help influence the action plans that are be ing designed.

Birmingham is the UK's largest authority, with 1.1 million people and diverse communities spea king 108 languages. This is a city of complex needs that requires joined -up working and innovative solutions to local challenges. The Naturally Birmingham programme aims to show how cities can move the environment to the centre of their decision -making, to ensure parks have a sustainable future. It is being Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 84 run as an early exemplar for how cross -council working can happen, with the broader health and wellbeing offer that parks can provide at its core. Birmingham has built up a good knowledge of its parks a nd green spaces but has struggled to engage the rest of the council, or to provide a sufficiently clear picture to local politicians of the wide -ranging opportunities for parks to meet multiple local objectives. The Naturally Birmingham project intends to achieve corporate and political recognition by identifying and promoting both the well -known and hidden benefits of parks and the value of these, allowing the true worth of the city's green estate to be better understood and communicated. It is expected th at this will provide an opportunity to build much broader partnerships and identify new income and investment streams. The programme is working in 4 neighbourhoods, focussing on 4 city council strategic themes - Children, Housing, Employment and Skills an d Public Health - all to develop a new approach on how greenspace can become an integral part of how they work and what they provide. This includes how greenspace can support children through their early development, engaging young and vulnerable people an d empowering them to influence the future direction of the city, achieving good quality greenspace in housing developments, connecting skills and employment programmes to environmental programmes, and embedding green interventions into the local social pre scribing offer. The work done through Naturally Birmingham will also support the public health team to create a new joint o utcomes framework for the city. Foundational to the work is the development of a baselining methodology of local greenspace from mul tiple perspectives, for example physical attributes of the greenspace including ecological diversity, how the community view it, what other needs for the community exist and local health issues. There are many very positive and productive activities happ ening in parks, and this project looks to join these up further to maximise the short and the long -term benefits and outcomes for both the parks and local communities. As the workstreams mature, synergies across the 4 areas will be identified and strengthe ned. Such a broad remit has posed challenges. The organisational effort needed to work across the council's directorates and teams has been significant. Additionally, council departments' culture and ways of working can be very different from one another, and this had to be recognised and negotiated in order to make a joint approach for Naturally Birmingham possible. Having cabinet approval and support of the Chief Executive - recognising the project helps meet high -level strategic priorities - has been f undamental, allowing resources to be secured and encouraging working outside of traditional silos toward this common delivery goal. The National Trust Account Manager has also been instrumental in providing support and guidance to get the project started. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 85 The project is working with the council's finance team to identify a longer -term model of sustainability beyond the 2-year Future Parks funding. One approach could be to secure investment from different parts of the Council. They are also exploring partner ships with alternative financing providers with a focus on social return of investment to help develop alternative business models for greenspace management.

Over three -quarters of the total projected population increase between 2014 and 2036 is expected to be in the over 65s age group . It was important to create an enviro nment that would support extending healthy life expectancy as well as to consider that appropriate provision was made within the health infrastructure to meet the increased demand. Public health recognised the key role that spatial planning plays in popul ation health - the potential for substantial positive impacts if development progressed with health and wellbeing in mind, and conversely, the adverse impacts if it was not adequately considered. There was recognition that through the local plan process, n eighbourhood plans and the processing of planning applications a positive health impact could be achieved by making provision across a range of issues such as street layout and active travel, access to services, access to greenspace, healthy food environme nt, reducing inequalities, climate change, job opportunities and others. Planning and public health had already established a working relationship but there was a growing consensus that a formalised approach would bring better coordination and consistency across the tiers of local government and with the health sector. The Norfolk Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee had recommended producing a protocol in order to improve collaboration and there was support across public health and strategic planners ac ross the districts and at the county council. The protocol aimed to briefly describe: for planners , the health system and the roles of various organisations for public health and the health sector , the local authority planning system, and the process of p lan making and planning decision making the process for public health and health sector engagement in the planning process in Norfolk 1 The 5 CCGs are currently being restructured into one, which will also include the Waveney District of Suffolk, within Suffolk County Council. Improving access to greenspace: A new review for 2020 87 A task and finish group was established to take the work forward, with representation from districts and the county. Three workstreams were identified and taken forward which were : development of the protocol, which provided an agreed standardised procedure outlining the process for public health input into development management by district councils an assessment of future health care needs based on projections for population increases and house -building rates in Norfolk , to enable informed decision -making about future health services commissioning development of a healthy planning checklist that would be a practical tool to assist developers and their agents when prepari ng development proposals, local planning authorities in planning policy making and in the application process, and for public health when responding on the health and wellbeing impact of development plans and planning applicati ons The protocol was developed and tested over time with input from all parties. This consultation included discussions with development managers to explore the practical application within the development management setting . The publi c health intelligence team at Norfolk County Council provided an analysis of population growth data adapting the London Healthy Urban Development Unit (HUDU) planning contribution model for Norfolk. The healthy planning checklist was based on an adaptatio n of the London HUDU Rapid Health Impact Assessment Toolkit and the Royal Town Planning Institute's (RTPI) Planning Principles for Healthy Communities, and from similar approac hes in other local authorities. It was developed in consultation with public hea lth and planning colleagues. To support the process, planning authorities were asked to formally adopt the protocol. At the same time the CCGs were also asked t o formally adopt the approach. With 7 districts and 5 CCGs it took some time for this to be com pleted. The protocol has been updated twice, most recently to reflect the new structures within the NHS and the increased opportunity for engagement with the planning system that this has provided. The Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) n ow takes the lead in updating and revising the data analysis tools to better reflect the health infrastructure needs, and coordinates responses to proposals across the local health system. The protocol provides a process for engagement, and the protocol i s kept alive by planning and healt h continuing to work together.
