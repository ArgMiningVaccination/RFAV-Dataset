Presently, there are three leading theories for what causes post-Covid cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, according to Silva, who detailed these theories in an August 2021 blog post, \"Long-Haul Covid-19: What We Know, and What We Don't,\" on her [practice's website](http://www.neuropacific.com). The first is cerebrovascular ischemia, which occurs when the brain doesn't receive adequate blood flow and is a precursor to a stroke. This could largely explain why patients who had severe acute disease display the most serious deficits. For those with moderate or mild acute disease, a second theory is that direct viral infection of the brain causes cognitive dysfunction and neurological problems, such as the hallmark loss of taste and smell experienced by many people with Covid. There is limited evidence for this theory, Silva wrote. A third theory involves neuroinflammation, which scientists theorize is the result of an immune system in overdrive. Scientists have linked Covid infection (even mild infection) with inflammatory processes in the brain in both animal and human models (Nature Reviews Neurology, Vol. 18, No. 453, June 2022, and Nature, Vol. 595, June 2021). Samton, who is also affiliated with New York-Presbyterian Hospital, explained that this neuroinflammation could be caused by malfunctioning mast cells, a type of white blood cell found in the body's connective tissue. \"These cells release chemicals that lead to even more inflammation in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which is basically the coordinator of many functions of the nervous system,\" she said. This process could lead to the brain fog and fatigue experienced by many people with long Covid. However, in May 2022, a longitudinal study led by Michael Sneller, MD, of the National Institutes of Health, failed to identify a definitive cause of long Covid, and did not find evidence to support these theories. The study did, however, find that women with a history of anxiety were at greater risk for developing long Covid, a conclusion that many patient advocates (and even Sneller himself) were concerned would lead to further marginalization of post-Covid patients by the medical and scientific establishment (Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. 175, No. 7, 2022). Nonetheless, \"emotional trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder may play a role in creating or worsening symptoms,\" Samton said. Samton also pointed out that researchers have identified some additional possible risk factors for developing long Covid, including Type 2 diabetes, fragments of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in the blood, evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the blood, and an increase in autoimmune antibodies (Cell, Vol. 185, No. 5, 2022). There is also some evidence regarding the protective factor of vaccines, which provides some clues, although the results have been mixed. One study suggested vaccination lowered the risk of developing long Covid by half. But a later study concluded that vaccines had a much more limited effect, and only reduced risk by 15%. Clearly, much remains to be discovered about why some people develop long Covid, and why it causes cognitive and neuropsychological dysfunction. However, scientists and clinicians have known for a long time that viral infections can lead to long-term sequelae. \"Viruses vary in the extent to which they affect brain health,\" said Vannorsdall, and she added that on the whole, the cognitive impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain is less severe relative to viruses that more often cause encephalitis, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV). But while this particular virus is a novel one, its potential to cause chronic illness and other sequelae is not unique. There are many examples, but a significant one is the relationship between EBV infection and multiple sclerosis, which was strengthened by a study published earlier this year (Science, Vol. 375, No. 6578, 2022). Additionally, some researchers and many patients have noted similarities between long Covid and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is theorized to be a postviral illness. Particularly relevant is the fact that some survivors of the first SARS epidemic became ill with a similar postacute condition in 2002 (which Voruz said was a significant motivator for the Covid-COG project). Altogether, though, this existing body of knowledge and new research have not yet added up to definitive answers. \"The variability in outcomes across patients has been marked, particularly as it relates to cognition and mental health,\" said Vannorsdall. \"I suspect that as our mechanistic studies evolve, we will begin to appreciate that there are multiple etiologic pathways contributing to persistent post-Covid symptoms, with vascular, inflammatory, and psychological pathways contributing to "}
