New Offerings by Established Practitioners and Businesses Natural Body Health & Wellness (formerly known as Migun of Ann Arbor) moved in January to a new location down the road from Briarwood Mall and has expanded their services beyond the Migun Thermal Massage Bed System, adding many other wellness modalities. They are planning a Grand Opening in September that will offer free services, promotions, drawings for giveaways, and healthy snacks to eat. Owner Kevin Harrigan said their main product has always been the Migun Bed that uses jade rollers that run up and down the spine and incorporates the therapies of chiropractic, acupuncture, acupressure, far-infrared heat therapy and massage. Studies have shown this bed to benefit gastrointestinal disorders, relieve headaches and stimulate circulation. \"Everything we have here compliments one another,\" said Harrigan. Some of the other services they have added include a Dr. Mercola Tanning Bed for Vitamin D production, a three seated full-spectrum infrared sauna for healing and detoxification, a ROM (Range of Motion) four minute cross-trainer equivalent to 20 minutes of aerobic exercise, an inversion table for circulation, a Rife machine for a multitude of energy treatments, oxygen treatment for a boost, a Turbo-Sonic ionizing alkalizing water filter, and a patented sound vibration system for weight loss and clearing other ailments. Harrigan said the type of infrared sauna they have was featured on TV shows such as Oprah, Dr. Oz, Ellen , and The Doctors. The sauna can be programmed for its wavelengths to target various items like weight loss, relaxation, skin health and pain relief. Their Rife machine employs a technology from the 1930s that Dr. Rife used while researching the specific frequencies of particular viruses, bacteria and parasites. He discovered that if you target a resonance frequency of the undesirable organism, it would explode and be killed. Many people use this machine today to reduce infections of various types, however Harrigan stressed that people should always seek treatment from a doctor first. According to the show Dr. Oz, the inversion table is one of the two best wellness products people should invest in. It is used for traction and decompression of the spine. I, myself, had a chance to try the inversion table and loved it. I had a headache, and after lying upside down on it for five minutes, the headache was gone. I have also been on the Migun Bed before. It was very relaxing and helped me with sore areas on my back, perhaps even re-aligning my spine. Natural Body Health & Wellness offers many holistic supplements, personal care products, and a Himalayan salt crystal inhaler Dr. Oz has also recommended for anyone with breathing problems.

New Books by Area Authors Author Lorna Brown, ordained minister and spiritual teacher, completed her spiritual memoir late this summer entitled Dragonfly Dialogues - The Memoir of an Awakening Spirit and copies are available at the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore and on her website. \"When we listen to our hearts instead of our heads we begin to move into a higher level of awareness. As we have fun, play, enjoy, be, we begin to embody our Divine Purpose,\" said Brown, who also has performed wedding ceremonies for ten years across Southeast Michigan. Dragonfly Dialogues is a memoir recounting Brown's life-long process of awakening that she hopes will help others. She asks readers to consider the possibility that they are here on a Divine mission and they may have forgotten what that is. She stresses learning to look at life from a perspective that considers all of one' s experiences, the comedies and the tragedies, and that brings awareness to the ups and downs that create a complete picture, and all of it is perfect. \"From there comes the ability to honor ourselves for who we are and the unique roles each of us plays,\" said Brown.What's New in the Community Continued on page 8 People's Choice Alternative Medicine Clinic , a medical marijuana clinic, opened in July of 2010 in Ann Arbor and sees about 75 patients per day. The non-profit \"compassion membership club\" currently has over 2,600 members and is carrying about 17 different strains of marijuana, each being used for different medical situations. See article on page 11 Natural Body Health & Wellness (formerly known as Migun of Ann Arbor) moved in January to a new location down the road from Briarwood Mall and has expanded their services. They've added wellness modalities including a full-spectrum infrared sauna, a Range of Motion four minute cross-trainer, an inversion table for circulation, and a Rife machine for a multitude of energy treatments. \"Drama is a necessary part of life. Running from drama is not engaging in life, and all of our stories have meaning and every perspective helps us to see ourselves clearly. Let us not linger in the drama so we can start to move on to our always greater personal callings,\" added Brown. In her book, Spirit is represented by a dragonfly, an animal that often came to her during significant times in her life when she was receiving messages. Brown is ordained as a Melchizedek Priestess through the Sanctuary of the Beloved in New York State, a legal church. She has been teaching workshops in Sacred Geometry for 18 years, which uses meditation with various geometric figures to activate the \"light body field,\" or Merkaba, to balance the integration of left and right sides of the brain. Brown also does Soul Retrieval (putting disconnected pieces of ourselves back together) and Munay-Ki workshops, which are initiatory rights of energy transmission that bring people into who they are becoming. Brown explained that the planet is shifting from Homo sapiens to Homo luminous , which means we are raising our consciousness and experiencing a \"download\" that is bringing us into a different resonance. Brown has created a variety of new guided relaxation meditation CD's available in early fall. To pick up a copy of the book, CD, or to take a workshop, please visit www. revlornabrown.com, email starlab6@aol.com or call Brown at 734-428-8748. Local author Kelly Hagen and local artist/ illustrator Maria Rodriguez published their children's book, Belly Button Love , in November 2010. The book captures the mother/child connection through the simplicity of the belly button, the place where each one of us was once connected to our mother. Spirited artwork and poetic rhymes make it a wonderful book journey for both mother and child. \"It is a very intimate thing for a mother to read the book because a mother's love is so enduring, devoted and eternal,\" said Hagen. \"But this book takes people back to their own mothers as well.\" Hagen was inspired to write the book after she had an abdominal surgery where they had to reconstruct her belly button. She noticed she was upset afterwards and didn't know why at first. After some reflection, she felt it had to do with the recent loss of her mother and a subconscious awareness that the belly button is the place where she and her mom were once one. She began to write about the significance of the belly button, and her son, who was seven at the time, helped her with the book. Once she was done, she shared it with various groups and was so surprised that men and women alike became so emotionally moved they would sob. She has come to realize this is a very powerful book for people. Hagen learned of the book's illustrator, Maria Rodriguez, originally through craigslist. She described their first in-person meeting on Thanksgiving Day as having explosive creative energy. Rodriguez had been painting mother and child canvases for years and Hagen knew she had found her artist. It took them three years to finish the book. Wishing to continue their journey together, Hagen and Rodriguez formed a publishing company and have become a mom team. They plan on creating other books together. \"My job as a mother is the biggest blessing and the most precious thing in my life,\" said Rodriguez, whose passion for painting and design has helped her express these sentiments in the book. Rodriguez once owned Zeus Gallery in Chicago, where she sold art in all media, representing herself and many other artists from around the world. Rodriguez's illustrations from Belly Button Love are available online at www.bellybuttonlove.com and are also on display at the Gallery Mariposa on Mack Ave. in Grosse Pointe Woods. Hagen has completed work a miscarriage handbook called Miscarriage: The Recovery Process and One Woman's Journey, which she is getting ready to publish as well. To purchase Belly Button Love , visit Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, or go to www.bellybuttonlove.com, or call 248-343-2906. Events Healthy Edge, United Way of Washtenaw County, and Be Happier Today are sponsoring a \"What About You Walk\" on September 24 at Gallop Park starting at 9 a.m. and continuing with activities throughout the afternoon. Participants can choose to walk or run 5k or 1-mile trails in the park. Participants in the walk have the choice of what charity their money should go to. The event features a free lunch offered by Damon's Grill in Ann Arbor, live music by Solar Soundscapes and by Ken Kozora, a charity expo, presentations, family fun activities, prize giveaways and a health and wellness fair sponsored by UM Taubman Center. Christine Clipper, owner of Healthy Edge and a wellness coach and healthcare facility consultant, explains that she created the walk because she wanted people to have an opportunity to live their best life. \"Being in healthcare for so many years, I have seen how patients have entered our system only to re-enter again. In a bigger picture, I want to do something in business that is going to pick up people once they have been discharged from a formal treatment program. So the walk came about to draw awareness and seek out what is most important to people,\" she added. Among the charities participants are walking to raise money for is Autism Alliance of Michigan. AAM works towards improving the quality of life for individuals with autism and their loved ones through education, comprehensive services, coordinated advocacy, and cutting-edge research. Another big group this year is North Star Reach, breaking ground in Pinckney , Michigan, in 2012, a 105-acre camp for enriching the lives of children with serious medical challenges within a 500-mile radius. Also on board is The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 8 What's New in the Community Continued from page 7 Stiggy's Dogs, a fairly new non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Military Veterans by rescuing dogs and training them for veterans suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury. And we have to mention Grass Lake Sanctuary, whose mission is to provide retreat experiences focused on nature, relationship building, creativity from the heart, foods for health, de-stressing and rejuvenation. Individuals, families and teams are welcome to be a part of this special event. Please visit the website and register before September 21 to participate or just come out to watch and enjoy the activities for the day . \"I just love doing this event. If I can help put something out there that will increase awareness to their cause and raise money in support of their cause, that's just the biggest reward,\" said Clipper.

New Classes Family and child therapist Violet Martin, LMSW, of Mindful Heart Counseling will be holding mindfulness classes this fall in Pinckney. One of Martin's passions is teaching all people, and especially young people, how to effectively cope with stress, disappointments, or intense feelings by developing skills in her workshops. Her introduction to mindfulness for mothers and young children class is structured to help mothers teach children, beginning at age four , what mindfulness is and how to calm themselves when they are upset. \"Self-soothing techniques are really important for kids to learn, and the earlier the better,\" said Martin. In her \"Stress Reduction for Students\" class, middle school through high school aged students learn practical and concrete ways to cope with unique situations that bring stress to that individual person. \"Each person discovers their own skill that works best for them out of a set of techniques they learn from the class,\" she added. Martin also often uses art, music, and writing in journals to help students find creative ways to express feelings. Martin described \"mindfulness\" as a state of mind where you remove the \"chatter\" so that the mind experiences peace, clarity and acute awareness of being present in the moment and being connected to the body, heart and mind. \"It is the stillness that produces the deep awareness of your experience in the moment and that can carry over into your life in your daily life experience,\" she added. Meditation is not mindfulness, but it is the key to the doorway of mindfulness. \"You need your cognitive skills and your heart skills,\" she added. Martin has been practicing mindfulness for ten years and is a student of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Zen monk who is a renowned author, peace activist, and poet who has taught mindfulness for several decades. \"He is the most inspiring influence in my work and passion in my life,\" said Martin. Mindful Heart Counseling is located in Pinckney and has a weekly mindfulness group that meets on Tuesday evenings for all ages and also a group at The Brighton Natural Wellness Center in Brighton on Monday evenings. Martin is available for private therapy, coaching, advising and wisdom counseling.

Cynthia Haas, aroma-therapist and instructor of \"Raindrop Therapy\" at the Ann Arbor School of Massage, is offering a new class, Introduction to Emotional Healing with Young Living Essential Oils , this September at The Brighton Natural Wellness Center. There will be a longer workshop to follow later in the year. \"These essential oils work on four levels: the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual. In my research and in everything I hear, at least 75% of all illness is emotionally based, and some think it is even higher,\" Haas said. She uses the oils to teach Raindrop Therapy, a physical therapy that uses specific oils applied along the spine to detox and eliminate viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi that live in the spinal column because these therapeutic oils penetrate two inches into the body. For this new class, Haas will be using a book called Releasing Emotional Patterns with Essential Oils by Carolyn Mein, DC. The book pairs negative emotions, such as fear, depression, and anxiety, with specific oils that can clear them when they are rubbed into the corresponding acupuncture reflex point on the body. \"For depression, we use the peace and calming oil blend and apply it on the depression point behind the ear while repeating a positive affirmation,\" said Haas. In this class Haas will be teaching a modality called \"muscle testing\" that will help indicate how often a person needs to apply the oil to the point on the body to clear the emotion. Haas got involved with the oils while she was in massage school. She then read an article in Psychology Today that mentioned the healing of emotions with essential oils. The article said the best way to release trauma or negative emotions is with essential oils because emotions are catalogued in the amygdala of the brain, where the sense of smell is processed, and stored throughout the body almost like a library. It said the best way to release emotions was by using the sense of smell that goes right into the olfactory nerves and directly to the amygdala. \"So essentially, even just smelling oil gives you a treatment,\" added Haas. \"One of the reasons I know I am here is to help people clear emotions and I have a passion to help people with trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and, specifically, veterans,\" Haas said. She explained that the body has a filing system for every emotional experience a person has had and the oils are a gift to release some of the negative emotions. Call 313-271-7326 to sign up for the class with Cynthia, email her at cjhaas9@comcast.net, or visit her website www.yleoconnect.com/yl/cynthia.

She is asking that participants have both a webcam and a microphone. Sweeney said the Skype class is ideal in that the Internet helps people feel less \"exposed\" when sharing deep and hard truths about themselves and is designed to help people understand and embrace who they honestly are. \"We carry so many voices in our heads; beliefs that we think are our own that have come from somewhere else: our parents, churches, teachers, families, or even media. The things that you believe about yourself, are those really your beliefs?\" said Sweeney. By taking her workshops, \"we get to learn who we really are in asking those questions.\" She tells her story, \"Beginning in 2000 with a beautiful illness that nearly ended my life...In the six months it took me to heal my body and in the years-long process of writing my book, Three Sides to a Circle: A Memoir, I faced myself and I did not hold back: I learned to admit when I behaved poorly, when I overreacted or when I allowed drama or the agenda of others to control my emotions, actions and consequently my well-being. It has been a gut-wrenching exploration of who I truly am. The process was hell. I excavated my life, my beliefs and my soul...and I survived.\" Out of her journey she developed and wrote the workshop series with versions for both men and women. By using specific questions, guided journaling and uncensored, non-judgmental discussions, she helps participants focus on taking responsibility for their identity and well-being. The series reflects the seasons of life. The first part explores first relationships, the ones shared with our parents. The second part symbolizes adolescence, the time when friendships begin to change. Adult identity is challenged in the third part, and for the last part, the topics of death, spirituality and religion are covered. Besides the virtual Skype classes, Sweeney will be teaching in person at The Leaven Center about two hours away from Ann Arbor in Lyons, Michigan, November 4-6, presenting the first two workshops to her series, The Legacy of Our Mothers and the Woman to Woman workshops, at a women's weekend retreat center.

Spiritual teacher, Eve Wilson, who has been training healers for 26 years, is offering a 13-week course called The Healer Ascension Certification Course starting in October. The course meets every other week for three hours and includes five personal sessions with Wilson. This certification course is the expanded version of her original class called Accelerated Healer Development Course that she taught over the last decade. Course work is experiential and transformative and includes a comprehensive manual with exercise CD's. Once the Healer Ascension course is completed, the student can be certified through the Universal Church of the Master Healer as a Healer Practitioner, which makes the student legally certified to practice healing throughout the US and Canada and, according to Wilson, is a profession listed in the IRS book of job titles. \"This is sort of like a Ph.D. in healing where we start with developing the healer's integrity and how to discern who you are working with in spirit, so that the person is working with beings of unconditional love. Then from there they can work with those beings to accomplish the healing,\" said Wilson. Healing work is done on themselves, each other and outside the classroom. \"I start by screening for intuitive people who are naturally discerning, have awareness of God in them, and a strong desire to work from a pure place or have a passion for truth and serving others,\" said Wilson. The course is held in Ann Arbor at Wilson's home every two weeks and people may attend in person or via a Skype conference call during class. Wilson said that healing the planet and social patterns in the world is accomplished through working on an individual's problems. Wilson works with healer trainees as she traces their issues through the ancestral line, through the soul group and through all of their lifetimes. \"We work with it [the issue] at the place where it connects to others on the planet who are also working with the same issues or patterns. It is called the 'collective consciousness' for that soul group,\" said Wilson. As a comprehensive course for healers, Wilson covers an impressive spectrum of topics: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual healing, healing partnership with Archangels, Ascended Masters and etheric surgeons, aura reading, clearing and repairs, soul contracts (understanding, fulfilling and revising them), present and past life healing, the healing Kabbalah or Tree of Life, inner child work, power animals, soul retrieval, chakra tuning and balancing, psychic boundaries and protection, identification of spirit beings, psychic anatomy, healing children and animals with distance-healing, world healing, and clinical practice. Wilson also helps her clients go back through time to resolve traumas as they happened, healing them completely and bringing that healing forward in time so it's no longer an issue. She says that through these healings, the situation can be corrected, making it better than if it never happened: the lesson is learned without the memory of the pain. One of the tools she uses for these healings is the Kabbalah or Tree of Life. \"The Kabbalah is the underlying structure and platform that God built reality on as we know it and the Kabbalah is the DNA of the cosmos. The macrocosm of the microcosm. So if we work with the Kabbalah, we can actually go to those places where things originated and work with the contracts that are no longer needed and connect God into those places. We then re-direct the energies to wherever they need to go next. It's a very useful system,\" said Wilson. Wilson feels her work has really evolved and what she is doing now is the \"high-speed, rapid, effective version\" to what she was doing 26 years ago. Wilson has a spiritual blog www.spiritualhealers.com/blog and website www.spiritualhealers.com. You can reach her by email, evew@spiritualhealers.com, or you can call her at 734-780-7635.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 10 What's New in the Community Continued from page 9 Syndy Sweeney Now teaching a new comprehensive 13-week course called The Healer Ascension Certification Course , Eve Wilson feels her work has really evolved and what she is doing now is the \"high-speed, rapid, effective version\" to what she was doing 26 years ago.Continued on page 12 Soul Essence Expanding, a group housed out of The Center for Integrative Well-Being in Plymouth, is hosting a number of Constellation workshops this fall that will feature additional well-known Constellation facilitators from out-of-state and the U.K. the basis of Constellation work stems from blocks in the unconscious that individuals are unaware of that can be brought into the light and healed. \"It's a great tool that enhances your ability to understand what is going on in a field of a person, from the unconscious through to the conscious, enabling them to recognize that from their own perspective, rather than somebody else telling them, 'here's your challenge,'\" said Deb Foggio, owner of The Center of Integrative Well-Being and a facilitator of Constellation work. \"It's what's invisible to us that creates the challenges that we experience in life - our beliefs, our emotions, and thoughts - because we are making decisions based on those things and yet we are not conscious of them and it can make our lives feel out of control, which keeps us stuck,\" added Foggio. Jane McLaren originally brought awareness of Constellation work to Michigan when she created a training class taught by Dr. Ed Lynch in 2006. McLaren and Foggio are the local co-facilitators for Soul Essence Evolving, a systemic Constellation approach to healing that removes emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual blocks that keep people stuck from moving forward. ( The Crazy Wisdom Journal featured their work on page 68 of the May thru August 2010 issue, which is available in the archive of articles at crazywisdom.net.) They are offering open-house workshops for the public every 2nd and 4th Friday of the month from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. for people to come and experience Constellation healing in a friendly, non-threatening environment. From September 16-18, Christina and Dale Wright-Lonheim from Seattle, Washington, will teach Shamanic Constellation Soul Work Series , an introduction to finding belonging through connection with one's ancestral past. There will also be an additional special advanced training offered that covers a year's worth of instruction for facilitators in January, March and September of 2012. On October 15 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. there will be an Introduction to the Fundamentals of Systemic Family Constellation class facilitated by Foggio and McLaren. The class will train healers on how to use Constellation work as an additional tool in their own healing career paths. From November 11-13, Vivian Broughton from the U.K. will facilitate Freeing the Self from Entanglement: Working with Trauma Constellation , which is focused on recovery from the idea that a child takes on the mother 's trauma from their early bond and that trauma splits the soul. The trauma needs to be removed so the person can be fully present in their lives and for others. Broughton has written a book entitled In the Presence of Many - Reflections on Constellations Emphasizing the Individual Context . From December 2-4, there will be a Sisters of the Soul Moon Lodge Retreat held at Lake Huron Retreat Center with facilitators Foggio and McLaren. The purpose of the retreat is to embrace bonding and incorporate systemic Constellation work with other women. For updated information, please visit www.integrativewellbeing.com, email lightworkscenter@att.net or call 248-702-7064.New Businesses and Practitioners Massage therapist, body worker and business owner Sharon Lawlor opened Tranquil Being and Healing Arts Center in November 2010 in Ann Arbor. Lawlor, whose background is in environmental science, has been practicing massage on clients for over six years in various other locations. Tranquil Being services include Thai herbal poultice massage and wraps to help detox the body, lymphatic drainage therapy, cupping, reflexology, chakra balancing, cranial/sacral balancing, Reiki and energy work, as well as services specifically designed for moms-to-be and new moms. \"People say that I am different than what they have experienced before. First, it's my love and passion for what I do and for the people, but I also feel intuitively where my clients need work and how, and my hands are drawn to a certain area,\" said Lawlor. Lawlor is really excited about the newest addition to her services, a full- spectrum infrared sauna, which is brand new technology that occurred in late 2010 and was featured on the TV show, The Doctors. \"I'm totally elated for its arrival and the benefits that it's going to provide for my clients,\" exclaimed Lawlor. This sauna is not typical in that it has far, near and mid infrared rays which contain the most beneficial rays of the sun. The wavelength of the ray that penetrates goes several inches into the body to detox out seven to ten times more toxins than a regular sauna, even at a lower temperature. Lawlor explained that the sauna can be programmed for its wavelengths to target various things like weight loss, relaxation, and pain relief. She custom-ordered it to be constructed with basswood, which is more hypo-allergenic. Tranquil Being's Thai foot massage, as well as other body wraps, utilize the brand Ytsara, whose Thai organic herbs are used in high-end resorts and spas throughout the world and consist of ginger, lemongrass, turmeric, bergamot and cinnamon. The herbs are wrapped in a muslin cloth ball that is steamed and then pressed and rolled on the body on acupressure points. This is followed up with an aromatherapy massage. Being that I have sore and tired feet often, I've had a chance to try the Thai Foot massage and my feet felt completely fantastic afterwards. Moms-to-be are very dear to Lawlor's heart. She learned cranial and lymphatic work during pre-conception, pregnancy and post natal at an advanced cranial-sacral obstetrics class out of state. Cranial-sacral work can include light myofascial work over the belly button area. It works with healing emotions of your own birth, clearing karma before you give birth, or dealing with the emotions of a traumatic birth of your own baby. Many times the practitioner can work on the cranial rhythms of the baby in utero. Lawlor has a love for the earth that started in high school and she tries to carry only organic products and natural products. \"I try to offer and research things for my clients that are very helpful and very eco-conscious.\" For more information, please visit www.tranquilbeing.com, email Sharon at info@tranquilbeing.com or call 734-718-5000. People's Choice Alternative Medicine Clinic, a medical marijuana clinic, opened in July of 2010 in Ann Arbor and is nestled across the street from the Michigan Stadium. The clinic sees about 75 patients per day. The non-profit \"compassion membership club\" currently has over 2,600 members and is carrying about 17 different strains of marijuana, each being used for different medical situations. \"We really stand behind the alternative medicine side of it. We feel there are a lot of alternatives to things that people are getting prescribed for that are just as effective and better for your body. Something that is grown naturally is going to work better with your body than something that was made in a laboratory somewhere,\" said Daryl Mynes, one of three co-directors of the clinic. According to Harry Cayce, also a co-director of the clinic and a distant cousin of Edgar Cayce, the famous medical intuitive from the 1920s, there are three main substances that testing companies are looking at in marijuana. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 11 Soul Essence Expanding, a group housed out of The Center for Integrative Well-Being in Plymouth, is hosting a number of Constellation workshops this fall that will feature well-known Constellation facilitators from out-of-state and the United Kingdom.Jane McLaren and Deborah Foggio Sharon Lawlor , owner of Tranquil Being and Healing Arts Center , is excited about the newest addition to her services, a full-spectrum infrared sauna, which is brand new technology that occurred in late 2010. This sauna is not typical in that it has far, near and mid infrared rays and can detox out seven to ten times more toxins than a regular sauna, even at a lower temperature.One is THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol), which many know as one of the \"active\" components of weed that gives the euphoric high. However, Cayce said, \"CBD (cannabidiol) and CBN (cannabinol) are two other substances found in certain marijuana strains that seem to be even better at relieving pain in the body and for the nervous system.\" At People's Choice, all the strains are grown in-house and naturally without synthetic herbicides or pesticides. \"We are medicine guys, so we don't want to give you medicine that makes you sick,\" said Cayce, who implied other cottage industries may be using concentrates with synthetic pesticides in their medicines, which is a growing concern among the holistic community . Cayce went on to explain that there are some natural treatments like cayenne pepper or peppermint oil that will do some damage to bugs. The clinic's marijuana strains all have different uses and potencies. The two basic strains are Sativa and Indica. Romulan is a strain that is more concentrated in CBD, which is better for pain and has less THC in it. \"Instead of them [patients] going to a street corner to try to get their medicine, it's a much safer, cleaner and friendlier environment for them to come to a place like here,\" said Mynes, in reference to what inspired the directors to start the non-profit. Cayce agreed and added, \"It was just time, it's holistic medicine put on earth by God and it's time to quit screwing around and putting people in cages just because they use it.\" To join the club, a potential member must get an attestation, a recommendation, from his/her doctor about one's medical condition and need for marijuana. This paper is to be sent to the state for approval or denial. Once approved, the person can join People's Choice for $10 for the year as a member of the club. Each patient's credentials are checked with the state to make sure his/her papers are in order. Patients that come to the clinic say they are sick of taking prescriptions that have too many horrible side effects. Many patients have taken Vicodin for pain and were getting sick from it and needed an alternative that was safer for their liver. Because People's Choice is holistic, each new patient/member is required to fill out an intake evaluation form with the massage therapist. The therapist informs the patient about different uses of the strains of marijuana and/or delivery systems available for the administration of the medicine. She also makes additional recommendations, such as holistic modalities and supplements based on the individual's needs. The clinic carries vitamins, herbs, phytonutrients, and essential oils in addition to marijuana, utilizing many tools to help their patients and members with their health. \"I think our clinic stands out from others because we use 'muscle testing' to see what strain is better for you,\" said Cayce in reference to which medicine strain will strengthen that person's body and also testing for which delivery method is best for someone. The medicine can be ingested, smoked, used topically or inhaled with a vaporizer. \"Most doctors recommend a vaporizer, as it is easier on the lungs,\" he added. \"A good portion of people don't want to smoke it, so the clinic offers 'medibles,' which are medicated edibles like brownies, ice cream, caramel popcorn, cookies, pizza, and rice crispy treats,\" said Mary Dettling, the clinic' s massage therapist. \"It takes longer for medibles to take effect but it lasts longer in the system.\" The clinic is looking to expand their services but they are limited on space until zoning issues are resolved with the city. Once that is taken care of, they plan on bringing in chiropractors, acupuncturists and other adjunctive therapists to add to the holistic atmosphere. The clinic also showcases local artwork and is involved in charity food drives with Zingerman' s Food Gatherers. People's Choice is a member of the Ann Arbor Cannabis Guild that formed among the dispensaries in late 2010 to set standards, in terms of security and maintaining the integrity, quality and purity of the medicine.

Grief Evolution opened in January in Ann Arbor and offers coaching to help people go from heartbreak to happiness after a loss. There will be a free and interactive seminar on Thursday, November 10 from 6:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore and Tea Room about the myths surrounding grieving. Topics will include shifting consciousness about grief, how to accelerate healing and the best/worst comments to say to a grieving person. \"After completing three years of grief healing study and performing as an intern doing coaching, I became a Certified Master FHHC (From Heartbreak to Happiness Coach) in April 2011,\" said Grief Evolution owner, Robin Connell, M.Ed. Her training was through the Grief Coach Academy in San Diego. Connell's personal tragic story is what led her into grief coaching. After experiencing the sudden death of her young husband while she was expecting their first child, and not recovering from it well, she received news of a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis within three years. The \"experts\" and therapists told her she might never get out of the grief. Beyond this, her experience with grief support groups was that everyone just stayed stuck in perpetual grief. As she was searching for a way to relieve her grief and find a cause behind her diagnosis, she finally one day fell upon the \"blueprint and recipe to heal herself\" and now enjoys helping others out of their needless suf fering as well. \"I was devastated for a long time and tried every which way to get out of my grief. I kept thinking, I'm a smart woman, I can do this, but nothing was working to get rid of the boulder I was carrying around,\" said Connell. Within four months of participating at the Grief Coach Academy, she felt she finally set down that boulder she was carrying. \"I just didn't want to feel better for a short time. I just really wanted to get better, and I felt lighter than air when I finished my training,\" added Connell. Connell feels that grief is cumulative, and if it's not dealt with, it can pile up on a person, so they need a vehicle to get through it. Connell also said grief coaching isn't just for a close death; it can be about losing one' s dreams, health, or a pet, too. She is hoping to help shift society's consciousness, perspective, and habits about how grief is handled in our culture, including \"when devastating things like Hurricane Katrina happen.\" She added, \"People are expected to be at work within ten days or two weeks, but everyone is so different when a tragedy happens, you can't really say when you'd be back.\" Grief Evolution is offering a workbook in early fall, which is designed to help people to experience some peace of mind. It includes techniques for grounding, meditation, affirmations and asking for help. Connell has been a consultant and coach in the business community for more than 20 years for companies such as Pfizer, Wachovia, University of Michigan, and Fermi Nuclear Facility, where she helped corporations and individuals define their missions, achieve their goals, and improve performance. The work prepared her for the very clear 'niche' of grief coaching.

Kim Phillips-Knope and Leigh Ann Phillips-Knope, the co-directors, have partnered both personally and professionally, and will offer a unique range of holistic programs and consulting services. They formed Roots of Change as an umbrella organization that unites their passions for community development, social work, ceremony and healing arts, education and activism. Their mission is to bridge individual, organizational and social change, and work toward a more just and loving world that honors the interconnectedness of all beings. \"We are really excited to be able to provide any resources and support we can to the community . It feels like a real honor to have a business like this and connect with folks,\" said Kim. Kim and Leigh Ann have 30 years combined experience in the non-profit, program management, community development and education sectors. Kim specializes in training schools and organizations on all issues impacting gay and transgender youth. She currently works for the Michigan Department of Education and is the lead editor for a 175-page resource guide , A Silent Crisis: Creating Safe Schools for Sexual Minority Youth, that is in its 5th edition as a supplement (or stand alone guide) for a training on youth safety , gay/transgender students, and bullying prevention. Through Roots of Change she will continue to reach out to school districts nationally. She and Leigh Ann will also consult with community organizations, groups. and small businesses, offering a full evaluation process that includes recommendations on program planning, design, clarifying vision and purpose, and needs assessments. \"Our goal is to merge larger-level social change with holistic programs to support the growth of individuals and families,\" said Leigh Ann. As for ceremonies and healing arts, Leigh Ann is certified as a Life-Cycle Celebrant in Michigan, a non-judgmental ceremony specialist who creates original ceremonies for all stages of life - from the beginnings of life, parent blessings, coming of age, weddings, and end-of-life celebrations. She is committed to serving all individuals and couples, in all communities, including interfaith, LGBT and multi-cultural communities. Leigh Ann and Kim are in a same sex marriage that is legal in Canada and Massachusetts. Their third real but not legal wedding ceremony was a three-day celebration at Drummond Island in 2004. An article was featured in February 2011 in The Ann Arbor Observer about the couple's legal struggles and triumphs, and their love story. In the next phase of Roots of Change, they are planning on opening a yoga barn and education center off Pontiac Trail in the fall of 2012. This will incorporate Leigh Ann's work as a yoga teacher for the past 10 years, specializing in reaching underserved populations, including older adults, survivors of violence, low-income residents and people living with serious health challenges. \"This is a dream come true for us. Kim and I have been together for eight years and we have been envisioning Roots of Change for a very long time. It's been a pretty special journey to be in together to really connect both of our passions into this life's work,\" said Leigh Ann.

Will that affect his chances of getting into the U?Breathe. Why is she having another stomachache? Is she sick, allergic or upset? Breathe.How do I even begin to answer their questions about who caused the tsunami and why? Or what happens to people when they die? Breathe. . . Maybe this time I can go back to sleep . . . The list of things we worry about for our children - related to body, mind and spirit - is never ending. Helping our kids handle stress and become whole human beings is complex - especially considering the intoxicating speed of our American culture in the 21 st century. The problem of stress, which most easily can be defined as a feeling of mental, emotional or physical tension, can take on countless forms, ranging from being too anxious to sit down or too apathetic to get up. This epidemic transcends all boundaries and is affecting quality of life for many families in Ann Arbor. As a mother of three elementary-aged children living just outside of the city, I am acutely aware that every day can be an exercise in managing stress and keeping harmony in the house. That is the impetus of this article. While \"kids and stress\" is an expansive topic, an array of 18 local experts and parents talked to me so that I could create a composite of how it has manifested locally for kids of assorted ages. Before setting out, I wondered, do the high levels of education here put a greater strain on kids to excel? Or is Ann Arbor a place where parents are more conscious of their children's feelings of anxiety?In my quest for wrapping my arms around the subject, I was able to assemble short stories full of what I believe are sizeable truths for parents to contemplate. While sifting through this information may take time, it may also change the way you parent your family. So take a deep breath, and read on, for a broader perspective on managing the pressure we all feel . . . Cultivating a Beautiful Mind \u2014 Truth: Cultivating curious and beautiful minds comes from giving kids a chance to play . . . Ann Arborite Diane Tamblyn remembers the day when she sat in the audience and listened to her oldest son's orientation to the University of Michigan. Ironically, Diane, who has been a kindergarten teacher for 26 years, said on that day she felt like a kindergarten parent coming into the start of a new world. While she took it all in, she heard a message that resonated with her . \"The profs were saying, we have plenty of smart kids here. They all can raise their hands, answer the question and get the A if they want to. What we don't have are people who are asking the questions - the new questions. Looking at it from a different perspective and having a voice and an opinion about the thinking. And that is the thing that is going to move us forward,\" Diane said. Diane is a passionate proponent of unstructured play - where the child creates how they are going to spend their free time. Conversely, with structured play, Diane feels that the kids aren't designing their time together or making up the rules; they are being told what to do - \"it is group think.\" \"I think we need to get some play back into the adult's life. And understanding what play is . . . What it is not. Lots of times, when Kids, Stress and Conversations around Town Chasing Answers for 21st Century Parents \"When we allow the children to play, what we are allowing them to do is be their own thinkers. The initiation, the motivation and the unique view they have to act out on the world comes through the play.\" - Kindergarten Teacher Diane Tamblyn and her children The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 15 we talk to parents they think play means when they disengage from the child,\" Diane said. \"What we're saying is quite the opposite, where play can be this rich, connecting experience, not only between the parent and the child, but between families and a neighborhood or community members. It can be something that connects to a larger group.\" A strong advocate for play-based education, Diane sent her three children to Ann Arbor's Rudolf Steiner School for pre-school and kindergarten before they entered Ann Arbor Public Schools. In her opinion, play is the most crucial link that cultivates the young minds of today to be the great thinkers of tomorrow. \"When we allow the children to play, what we are allowing them to do is be their own thinkers. The initiation, the motivation and the unique view they have to act out on the world comes through the play. . . So I think that if we take the play out, we take out their unique way of acting on the world,\" Diane said. In the school arena, Diane believes that the protective bubble that used to be around giving kindergarteners time to play and explore is fading fast as teachers are being pressured to use more measurable performance standards. As a result, she sees kids becoming stressed and less inclined to learn. Yet Diane is hopeful that parents will wake up and become part of the momentum that is building around the play movement. \"I'm starting to see it more in popular print . . . it is coming out in communities where parents are really hyper vigilant - actually like Ann Arbor. . . I see it in Manhattan where there is a lot of pressure and competition so now those parents are reading the research and seeing about play-based education. And oh, 'how do you get your kid into Harvard? It is play-based kindergarten, okay sign them up' - whether they believe it or not. They are starting to see some science connected to this behavior and now they are going to buy into it,\" Diane said. Keeping the Mind and Body Strong Truth: Unconditional love is the best remedy . . . When Dr. Lev Linkner, MD, ABIHM, sees all of the newborn babies in his holistic medicine practice on Huron Parkway, he gives all of the parents the same advice: let the kids climb all over you, hug them and touch them in a calm, supporting and loving way. Lev, who slightly resembles the John Lennon picture that peeks out from the multitude of hard covered books in his historic office, has been in practicing in town for 33 years. \"I've taken care of multiple generations . . . It's lovely,\" Lev said. \"Being a doc in Ann Arbor is wonderful and I love it, but you have to realize that a lot of the people I see, the parents are super high achievers, and it can be quite scary for kids, because they are expected to at a very young age make choices that are not age appropriate.\" When asked about whether or not there has been an increase in stress in town, he agreed that he is seeing more low level stress related to divorce and verbal abuse. Some of the most common signs of stress in kids that he sees are headaches, stomachaches, acting out behaviors, or the exact opposite, when kids become very reclusive. When asked how kids can withstand the intense pressure on them today, Lev's answer had to do with building resilience. \"It's just like building muscles. If you exercise every day, you're going to have strong muscles and not injure yourself.\" For those kids who appear to be suffering from a stress-related illness, Lev first does a differential diagnosis in order to figure out the root of the problem. According to the holistic practitioner, sometimes the problems need to be referred to a good psychologist. Other anxiety-related issues can be solved in his office with a safe and appropriate dialogue or through easy fixes like a change in avoiding foods that are stressors. He has also prescribed natural remedies to combat stress. \"Sleep is problematic in kids that are stressed. There are natural remedies that can be helpful. . . For example, stress will make it so your melatonin levels go down. So giving a little melatonin, which is extremely safe will help [with sleep],\" Lev said. \"I've never given St. John's Wort to little kids, but I've given it to teenagers with good success for mild to moderate depression.\" Lev also believes in prescribing some common sense advice to combat stress like eating dinner together as a family. \"Now, you're not always going to be able to get a 14-year-old boy to open his mouth that much, but at least there is that bond that says - I care about you as a human being,\" Lev said. \"These are not expensive or difficult things.\" \"It is okay if my kids didn't achieve at their highest potential in the 7th grade. They had other things to do . . . They were discovering. You're also discovering what happens when you don't do your homework. I wanted them to figure that out in the 7th grade, not in their first year of college.\" - Psychologist Lane Keleman, PhD Dr. Lev Linkner on kids and screen time: \"Artificial life support. . . Even the energy of that stuff . . .

It Starts with UsTruth: Parents are the first to model how to handle stress to their children . . . Jonny Kest and Carole Kirby both make it their business to keep people healthy. Jonny is the owner and an instructor for Center for Yoga, with four locations, two of which are in Ann Arbor (one on East William Street and one on West Stadium Boulevard). Carole is a marriage and family counselor for her own Therapy4Couples on South Ashley Street downtown. Both agree that before parents can teach their kids to handle stress, they first need to take care of themselves so they can be good role models. Jonny shared his personal story with me sitting on the floor in his dimly lit meditation room where incense wafted through the air. With little break in eye contact between us, he openly discussed his experiences growing up as one of four boys in the Metro Detroit area. His father , who was an oral maxillofacial surgeon, suffered from chronic back pain and became addicted to painkillers, ultimately taking out his frustrations on the family. \"He couldn't keep the pain to himself, so the whole family was suffering with him to some degree because he was so miserable,\" Jonny said. \"Fortunately, he found himself in Hawaii and found yoga. There was a yoga teacher visiting from India . . . and he somehow got connected and that changed his life. He found something that helped him cope with stress.\" Although his parents divorced, Jonny and his brothers spent time with their father in Hawaii, where Jonny learned the yoga practice that would be central to his life. Now a father of four himself, one lesson this former University of Michigan student always makes paramount is that \"kids watch their parents, kids learn what they live.\" \"We watched him [his father] learn a new coping mechanism for his stress and it went away - because he found a new way to deal with stress. He got oxygen to his tissues. He started breathing and dealing with it in a different way,\" Jonny said. \"He is definitely changed.\" A few days prior, I had heard a similar message from inside the walls of Carole's historic 1896 counseling office. Carole pointed out that from her vantage point, it appears many parents aren't taking good care of themselves. They are often stressed out, working long hours and coping with the economic circumstances in Michigan. \"If they can't manage their own stress, how are they going to help their children manage theirs? . . . I don't know that people are handling their stress very well. You know, there's alcohol, there's the Internet, pornography . . . illness, depression, so many things. People aren' t taking very good care of themselves,\" Carole said. The University of California, Berkeley, graduate, who is dedicated to helping couples and individuals develop loving relationships, said it is her professional opinion that beyond taking care of one's self, the quality of a couple's relationship also dramatically impacts the child's ability to manage stress. \"The main thing for me is, if parents have their own lives, if they are calm, if they feel good about themselves, if they are doing work that has meaning to them, if the parents have adequate time together to nurture their relationship, then the kids will have an environment of less stress, and the parents will be able to help them when there is stress,\" Carole said. Carole pointed out that kids feel stressed about their own worlds, as well as global issues, like the tsunami in Japan. As a mother, grandmother, and therapist, Carole believes that parents need to talk to their kids about the heavy list of issues weighing on them while still devoting time to their marriages. \"If you think about it, we have a culture where all you have to do to get married is have a blood test. We teach people to be on the moon and be lawyers and scientists and build buildings - but we don't help people know how to have safe, loving relationships,\" Carole said. Strike the BalanceTruth: Parents need to help kids slow down and stay balanced . . . Not far from the Big House stands the residence of Annie Zirkel. Here, Annie, who is a wife and mother of three sons, manages family life alongside her home business as a relationship consultant, speaker, blogger and author. When asked how she somehow manages, she replied, \"By paying close attention to balance.\" \"We want so much for our children, we want them to be learning well, and have good social skills, and get enough sleep. We want them to eat right, we want them to exercise and we want them to have some sort of extracurricular activities - and to learn to play an instrument while we're at it. . . So we are trying to help them balance all of that, and it is really a pretty packed schedule,\" Annie said. \"It's really just a matter of being in the moment with sort of a third eye looking in, checking in.\" Annie thinks parents need to pay attention to helping their children know and be able to communicate when they are starting to feel overwhelmed. Helping them read the signs of their own internal stress and anxiety mechanisms, and then slowing things down, can be invaluable, according to Annie. She also noted that stress is related to bullying. \"It is interesting because anxiety and stress are both a huge part of bullying on both sides. Kids who express anxiety are the targets. . . The kids who bully, or over-abuse their power, are usually feeling internally stressed. Instead of turning inward to soothe themselves, they look at their environment and they decide that the reason they are feeling this way is because 'you are not what I need you to be' . . . Anyone who bullies looks externally and blames the external world for their inability to stay balanced,\" Annie said. \"Anyone who bullies looks externally and blames the external world for their inability to stay balanced.\" - Relationship Consultant, Speaker, Blogger and Author Annie Zirkel Parents need to have lots of conversations with their children about how there are different paths - and how one fork in the road is not going to make the whole difference in a person's life.Kids, Stress and Conversations around Town Chasing Answers for 21st Century Parents Continued from page 15 Sedge of Cranes Dojo Offering classes in Tai-Ki, a meditative exercise ofbreathing and purposefulmovements, for all ages. 6-7pm indowntown Ann or see our website! http://sedgeofcranes.org Nigel Kerr, Sensei: 734-845-7917The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 17 While bullying and other problems children experience can weigh heavily on families, Robert Martin and Lisa Inoue of the Mindful Parenting Group on Plymouth Road in Ann Arbor believe parents can help their children counteract those stressors. Both therapists advocate regaining balance by practicing mindful moments throughout the day. The serene and experienced Robert, who teaches kids about attending to their breath, feels it is central to teach kids about the importance of down time and of being still. Young and articulate Lisa, who I met at a different time over coffee, reinforced her colleague's message by explaining Mindful Parenting \"is about taking a lot of deep breaths.\" \"It is about helping parents better manage their internal responses to their children and better understanding what those internal responses are about,\" Lisa explained. She recommends that parents learn more formal mindfulness strategies like meditation, and also practice mindful moments throughout the day. \"You can incorporate that into your routine to better parent...It gives you the possibility to have more joy in the process, even if your child is struggling and suffering. You can experience periods of joy that are not wedded to the success of a child. Too often, it is.\" Annie, who also spoke to me about embracing life with all of its imperfections, said she believes having faith that your children are fine already \u2014 not that they won't have challenges or concerns, but that they are fine already \u2014 can be incredibly comforting for parents. The down-to-earth optimist also added that her oldest son, who is severely disabled, is a gift who continually reminds her to keep things in perspective. \"He is the biggest gift . . . If you want some balance, if you want some perspective. He drank from a bottle until he was seven. But here' s the thing, he drank from a bottle and that was an accomplishment because of the motor skills it took to suck. Some kids have to have a tube right away because they can't gather nutrition. They can't swallow food. Now he drinks with a cup with a straw. Without that [perspective gained from helping her son], I would have been a zillion times more uptight,\" Annie said. \"Parents lose their focus. Stress does this. Anxiety does this. The first thing to do is take a step back and ask: 'Does my child have a lot of really good things going on? Okay. Could they be better? Absolutely. Okay, pick one, encourage that'. . . Encouragement is the courage to keep them moving forward.\" Find CommunityTruth: A sense of belonging allows kids to overcome childhood pressures . . . Avid environmentalist and educator Jeannine Palms runs a pre-school and after school care center named Blossom Home out of her house near Buhr Park. When she greeted me, Jeannine was natural from head to toe with the look of having spent the day outdoors. The two of us then set up two tree stumps in her backyard and began to talk about how the isolation in modern families leads to stress in kids. As someone who watched the civil rights movement unfold in front of her own eyes, Jeannine is a keen observer of history. One thing that she has noticed over the years is the decline of the nuclear family. She is quick to point out that people are disconnected from their neighbors, communities and family members, which is stressful on children because they are missing crucial support. To move beyond that, Jeannine said it is important for families to connect with other families that have similar values. \"However you frame what we are here for, it is to do good on the earth. To make the place a better place than when we came. Do our actions match up with that core value? So, if you have families that are working on this together, the children can feel a part of a bigger group and all of the parents have people to be in communication with. If you \"You are seeing the forcing back of academics into preschool - but what you are sacrificing is the play-based learning. When you only are looking at academic intelligence, you are sacrificing all of these other characteristics of intelligence to the one part of intelligence that is easy to measure.\" - Donna Lasinski, Chair of Ann Arbor's PTO Council, and her three sons \"When I was growing up, there wasn't as much stuff. Just in terms of material belongings and acquisitions that people have. I think that distracts families and children from a core value that it seemed families used to have, in terms of what made up the necessities of life.\" - Jeannine Palms, Owner, Blossom Home Pre-SchoolContinued on page 18 A More Conscious Approach Mediation & Resolution Specialist in Ann Arbor for over 25 yearsA More Conscious Approach Mediation & Resolution Specialist in Ann Arbor for over 25 yearsA More Conscious Approach Divorce.

At that moment, I remembered the two parents that I spoke with earlier in the week with children at Community High School. Dwana Jones and Pyper Alpern both said their kids feel a sense of belonging to the school, largely because they are connected with others students in a variety of grades through forums and they feel comfortable with the school's staff. \"It's like a community. . . I think that may be why there isn't as much stress there. Whatever you need. They make it clear that the support is there for you and it doesn't necessarily have to be a teacher,\" Dwana said. Pyper then added that even little things, like having the kids call the teachers by their first names, foster a personal atmosphere where the kids feel the adults are invested in their well being.Another person with the same message was Jonny Kest. During our talk, Jonny was quick to articulate the need for connectedness in blood families or families of choice. \"I think isolation is huge. That is why I think people benefit from third generation grandparents when they live nearby. I'm fortunate that my wife's parents live down the street. They are the first ones in the morning that call or come over. They are the last ones at the end of night. My kids see that. There is community, there is stability,\" Jonny said. \"I also have these yoga centers. The kids come on retreat with us. It is like one big family.\" So with the advice to create, find and cultivate community, I eventually got ready to head out from Blossom Home - grateful for the compilation of insights I was gaining and for the breath of fresh air.Education Today Truth: Learning is more than academic success . . . Lane Keleman, Ph.D., is a successful psychologist in town and mother of two grown children who she believes blossomed because of her and her husband's willingness to respect their developmental needs when they were younger. To Lane, part of the right educational path for her family was to send her kids to Ann Arbor's Rudolph Steiner School through the 6 th and 8th grades. \"They are very respectful for a child's need for play. They would never take recess out of a child's day because they feel it is an important part of what the child is learning and doing,\" Lane said. \"They don't do a lot of organized sports until the kids are in the 5 th grade or so. . . They create their own play experiences.\" Sitting in her office that looks out onto Liberty Street, Lane told me that while their ultimate goal was to have their kids succeed academically, she is glad that they had the time they needed to grow socially and emotionally. On the contrary, Lane has witnessed in some of her children's college mates kids who began heavy-duty academic careers early and are burnt out by the time they pursue higher education. \"It is okay if my kids didn't achieve at their highest potential in the 7 th grade. They had other things to do . . . They were discovering. You're also discovering what happens when you don't do your homework. I wanted them to figure that out in the 7 th grade, not in their first year of college,\" Lane said. Lane, who comes across as both kind and thoughtful, added that it is her opinion that parents need to have lots of conversations with their children about how there are different paths - and how one fork in the road is not going to make the whole difference in a person's life. \"If you choose to stay out of college for a year, go to a small private college, or a high-powered college, it is going to take you in one Tiya Miles is chair of the department of Afro-American and African Studies at U-M and she founded ECO Girls. ECO Girls will focus on getting girls together from assorted backgrounds to help them see connections between their own cultural backgrounds and the importance of taking care of the earth.Kids, Stress and Conversations around Town Chasing Answers for 21st Century Parents Continued from page 17 Tiya Miles with her son The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 19 direction but it is not forever - and it is not like you can't get to other places,\" Lane said. As the Chair of Ann Arbor's PTO Council, Donna Lasinski has a good feel for the academic climate in Ann Arbor. According to the University of Michigan and Northwestern University graduate, the Ann Arbor school district has a higher percentage of college educated adults than any other county in the state - which can lead to additional academic pressure in kids. \"At this point, for our hometown college, for the University of Michigan, the standard to get into the college is so much higher that there is no room for mistakes for your grades. . . So a B in 10 th grade could have a significant impact on where you end up two years from now. . . For me, that is the pressure I am starting to see. . . That, and the students that are trying to fill their calendars with so many extracurriculars to differentiate themselves,\" Donna said. Donna, a mother of three boys, is also a member of the Governor's Panel on Early Learning Advisory Committee where she is also in touch with the types of pressures young children are up against today. \"You are seeing the forcing back of academics into preschool - but what you are sacrificing is the play-based learning. When you only are looking at academic intelligence, you are sacrificing all of these other characteristics of intelligence to the one part of intelligence that is easy to measure,\" Donna said. That message rang true with Michael Singer, child development director and family consultant coordinator with Allen Creek Pre-School, located on Miller on the west side of town, that teaches children from birth to age 6. The school, which integrates early childhood development with modern psychoanalytic knowledge, teaches lessons that foster emotional intelligence, such as: managing conflict and feelings, recognizing other people's feelings, sharing, and how to wait your turn. Michael believes the social and emotional foundations set for young children have both academic and lifelong implications. \"It is not just the research that bears it out, but also from anecdotal evidence from kids who graduated from Allen Creek. We hear back from the schools they go to in kindergarten, first grade and second grade, that they are right up there in terms of academics. And we think it is because - not because of what we do academically here - but because of what we do from a social and emotional development [standpoint] that allows them to have a foundation that allows them to love learning,\" Michael said.Allen Creek parents Kristin McGuire and Constance Colthrop Amrine said the school has strengthened their understanding of the importance of emotional development, which is why they would like to reach out to others in the community to share more about it. Both women encourage parents to attend the school's \"Thoughtful Parenting Series\" which is geared toward early childhood and is open to the public, with dates and topics that can be found on the school's website www.allencreek.org. \"The things that I've learned as a parent from coming to the school and attending the thoughtful parent meetings, is that the social and emotional foundation that kids get prepares them better for academic success than anything. So many parents are like, 'So what are you going to learn? Are you teaching foreign languages? What about yoga? Spanish?' When giving them the foundation is more of an indicator of college success than any other thing. What you do from zero to six,\" Constance said. Social Pressure Truth: Children need positive role models to learn to withstand pressures . . . Ted Braude is passionate about the work he does as a mentor and counselor who has been bringing boys to manhood for 30 years. While Ted has come to Ann Arbor to present on his area of expertise, his office is based in Royal Oak, where I traveled to meet him on a Saturday afternoon to ask if boys' lives are becoming more stressful. As Ted kicked off his shoes in his relaxed attic workspace, he said that in his opinion boys are more stressed today because - to a large extent - they aren't accepted as being boys. The writer and former columnist for The Detroit Free Press explained that typical boy play, \"which is like a bunch of puppies,\" particularly in many school settings, is just not considered acceptable. Ted, who sums up boys in the words of play and strength, went on to say that aggressiveness is often mixed up with violence.\"Little daughters can still look up to teen role models, but they have to be a real person doing cool things. They need to be people you purposefully bring into their lives because they have value and something to offer.\" - Carole Lapidos, Program Director at Raising Strong and Confident Daughters Play is the most crucial link that cultivates the young minds of today to be the great thinkers of tomorrow. Continued on page 20 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 20 \"A lot of what they are doing developmentally, before they hit adolescence, is they are learning about power in relationship to each other. . . In many ways, our world has looked at that in the elementary years for boys and right through the whole school years, as being bad . . . When it is instinctive. . . Aggressiveness isn't going to go away, everyone has it,\" Ted said. Ted, who is also a black belt martial artist, believes it is important to teach boys to understand aggressiveness and to channel it in a peaceful way. He also said that the ultimate goal is to have boys master their own instincts, drive and senses. \"The whole business about nonviolence is a really a misnomer . . . People don't even begin to understand. Nonviolence is a highly attuned, well-developed practice. It doesn't occur by eliminating weapons or by saying don't raise your voice,\" Ted said. \"I'm a therapist. You can talk with a lot of therapists, they deal with conflict. Conflict is part of life. Wives and husbands, parents and teachers, they yell at each other and they raise their voices . . . Anger is real. How are you going to deal with it? . . . When you are in the face of aggressiveness or adversity, how do you go about it in a peaceful way?\" According to Ted, the importance of role models for boys is critical, which is why he is the founder and director of the BoysWork Project that creates cultural paths for boys locally. That is also why he is involved with the national organization Boys to Men, where he acts as the Michigan point man (www.boystomenmichigan.com) who helps bring teenage boys to adulthood. \"I have one operating principle when it comes to boys. There is one truth that has nothing to do with theory. Boys are on the road to becoming men. Everything they are doing now is on the trajectory of their future calling them forward,\" Ted said. Girls were the topic at hand a couple of weeks earlier when I spoke with Carole Lapidos, Program Director at Raising Strong and Confident Daughters, and Tiya Miles, Chair of the Department of Afro-American and African Studies, University of Michigan, at the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room. The three of us all brought our own experiences of raising daughters to the table as we discussed topics that included: the compression of girlhood, mean girl behavior, our consumer driven culture and the heavy emphasis placed on appearance. In order to counteract those challenges, Tiya pointed out the importance of providing girls with substantive opportunities where they can grow , develop friendships and shed some of the stress that surrounds them. \"I think part of the resilience comes from learning things, doing things, creating things, contributing,\" Tiya said. \"That helps to create a sense that they are an active agent in this world.\" Carole also pointed out that girls should be taught early on that they need more than a thin veneer to withstand life's pressures. \"When you build up those tools - awareness, education, sense of self and connection - then all of the sudden you have a full house. You are not going to fall over when somebody says, 'I don't like your hair.'\" Carole, a mother of two grown daughters who is still very involved in her girls' lives, added that, while it's difficult, sometimes parents need to let their daughters find their own ways - even if that means they will be emotionally bruised. Other times, she said, adults need to step in and have a more hands-on approach.\"I just feel like it takes skilled caring adults to sit with girls at a really young age and brain wash - sort of - and talk about how we as girls can form community. It just needs to happen at an early age,\" Carole said. \"Because by the time they get to middle school, a lot of what we're dealing with in our program is behavior management that is related to girls fighting with each other. There's a lot of work to do in that arena.\" Tiya then added that mean girl behavior seems to be happening earlier and earlier. \"Girls need to build positive relationships and relate in ways that aren't about competition.\" \"I think girls need to have caring adults turn their gaze away from the sort of adulation of Miley Cyrus or Beyonc\u00e9 or whoever is the current role model that is not a role model. . . Little daughters can still look up to teen role models, but they have to be a real person doing cool things. They need to be people you purposefully bring into their lives because they have value and something to offer,\" Carole said. To provide girls healthy role models and opportunities to develop self-esteem, Tiya founded ECO Girls (www.environmentforgirls.org), an environmental and cultural project for girls ages 7 - 12 in urban Southeast Michigan. The group (which kicks off this fall) will focus on getting girls together from assorted backgrounds to help them see connections between their own cultural backgrounds and the importance of taking care of the earth. The Techno AgeTruth: Screens are powerful, so parents should choose wisely when making them accessible . . . With all of my interviews completed, I headed out to Ohio with my family for a weekend soccer tournament where we were met with a three-hour rain delay. As a gaggle of boys sat trapped inside of a minivan watching movies and playing video games, I began to feel tinges of guilt for giving them such open reins on electronics. I shared my concern with another mom, who asked, \"Why is all of that stuf f so bad for kids?\" At that point the information started to pour out of me. While I didn't share it with her quite this way, here are some of the views on screens that I remembered: \"It is rewiring their brains in a different way. If they are choosing to be in front of all these screens, it means they are not doing something else. Mostly it means they are not playing outside.\" \u2014 Diane Tamblyn \"Artificial life support. . . Even the energy of that stuff . . . If the TV is on, that means you are not interacting with your kid.\" \u2014 Lev Linkner \"Facebook and Twitter are creating an additional layer of stress. It is a lot to manage.\" \u2014 Carole Kirby \"I think it feeds the whole consumption thing. And you become what you eat, you become what you see. If you have ads going in your head all of the time, that is part of who you are. That is what you exude - that is the energy you give out to the world. Why have it in the first place if that is not who you want to be?\" \u2014 Jeannine Palms \"TV wasn't available except on the weekends because it is so enticing. We didn't want to succumb to it. . . We did different things to get rid of it. We would unplug it, put a sheet over it with a face on the sheet so it had a different presence, or got rid of it completely.\" \u2014 Lane Keleman \"My opinion in terms of screens, before the age of seven, nope. Now , I'm way against the mainstream now, but this has to do with human development. This has to do with how our brains develop over the first seven years. . . With screens, it creates the image for them, their brain doesn't do it. It is taking their imagination away.\" \u2014 Ted BraudePeople are disconnected from their neighbors, communities and family members, which is stressful on children because they are missing crucial support... It is important for families to connect with other families that have similar values.Kids, Stress and Conversations around Town Chasing Answers for 21st Century ParentsContinued from page 19Parting Words Truth: Consumption can distract us from our own core values . . . While this article is expansive, there was one small bit of information that I felt was too important to leave out. When I spoke with Jeannine Palms, owner of Blossom Home Pre-School, and asked her if she feels the world is more stressful today, here is how she responded: \"I think it is greater and it is different. When I was growing up, there wasn't as much stuff. Just in terms of material belongings and acquisitions that people have. I think that distracts families and children from a core value that it seemed families used to have in terms of what made up the necessities of life. Now it is hard for people to even distinguish what are necessities. And I think that is reflected in the way that children function and what they view as their needs and their part in the world. I think children have less a feeling of being needed or having a part of a particular role.\" Jeannine's comments about our abundant world forced me to ask myself two questions: What are the core family values that I want to impart to my children? What exactly am I chasing for myself, and why? Perhaps keeping those answers close will help me better prioritize where I spend my time so that I can cut back on my own stress. Who knows? It may even allow me to sleep more and worry less . . . Final Thoughts Upon concluding this article, you'll notice that my composite of what stress looks like in Ann Arbor turned out to be a collection of stories that show where stress is surfacing in young lives, and how we as adults can better support our children to withstand it. Hopefully you'll find these quick glances reveal truths that will provide insights, raise questions, or start dialogues that will help your kids make their way to adulthood. In terms of whether or not Ann Arbor is a more stressful place to raise kids than elsewhere, I wasn't able to draw a conclusive \"yes\" or \"no\" opinion. I learned about parents taking their kids on college tours as early as the 8 th grade. I also listened as a parent brought up the idea of having kids 'opt out' of tests after a screening of the documentary A Race to Nowhere (www.RaceToNowhere.com) at Clonlara School. Let's just say it is a mixed bag. It is my belief that the education that permeates the city, paired with an abundance of high achieving adults, makes Ann Arbor a place where parents must remain mindful to stay in step with their children' s mental, emotional and physical health. In 2011, the reality of our lives is that they move fast. Yet we as individuals and community members still have the choice to color our own worlds whatever way we see fit. We can also remember to breathe. It's true. How can we possibly expect our kids to be the ones who ask the \"new questions\" if they are too overwhelmed to think? ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 21 September 1 5 October 1 3November 10December 8The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 22 By Rachel Pastiva You may not know Mary Thiefels, but I'm sure you know her art. You've seen it on railroad overpasses, the back walls of downtown businesses, or the hallways of your child's school. As a mural artist and founder of TreeTown Murals, Mary has been commissioned to create murals in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Manchester, and Chelsea, and is currently in the planning stages of one for the City of Whitmore Lake. These projects all make perfect sense, as a key ingredient in Mary's work is creating community. \"I believe a mural is a symbol of our community, home, or business by defining our views, goals, and attitudes. By bringing mural art into our personal spaces and neighborhoods we stand out as a people who make art a part of our daily lives. Like landmarks, murals become a source of pride for families, businesses, and communities alike.\" Always vibrant with color and striking images, the murals Mary paints tell a story of the places in which they are found. For Mary, this is an important element to all murals that helps connect people with their surroundings. \"When we stumble upon a mural, most of us are struck with awe and amazement. What you find in the mural is only a continuation of the story or adventure you are on. What we take from these murals is very personal, some are meant to be purely aesthetic, while others can remark on the history of the site, neighborhood, land or community. Murals can speak of struggles and triumphs, they can be empowering and possibly foreboding at the same time. The connection we make between a mural and its surroundings is entirely subjective.\" ********************* Raised in Ann Arbor, Mary Thiefels was first introduced to drawing and painting as a student at Ann Arbor Public Schools. After graduation, she enrolled at Washtenaw Community College, later transferring to Eastern Michigan University to expand her options for course study. She decided to take a break from school when she found herself becoming more inspired by the people she was meeting outside the classroom. She rented a shared studio space and made friends with a variety of artists, writers and musicians. Sharing a creative space helped solidify Mary's vision of herself as an artist. \"Being able to see these spaces gave me insight into what gives a working artist inspiration to make and create their art. I, too, wanted to respond to the world around me, paint and create. We made art to live and lived to make art. For the first time I identified myself as a working artist. I also learned how to foster the idea of creative collaboration.\" Mary was exploring the idea of creative collaboration when she and a group of friends painted a mural on a railroad overpass on Felch St., one that would get them all arrested for malicious destruction of property . A member of the group collected signatures from people in the neighborhood agreeing that the group had not maliciously destroyed the property, but instead had beautified it, and the charges were dropped. Mary and her friends learned that the overpasses were not public property but owned instead by the Ann Arbor Railroad. They promptly contacted the railroad to gain permission to paint murals on the tresses. That summer, Mary and her friends painted nine murals on various railroad overpasses. \"The reaction from people in the community was 'Thumbs up!' 'Cool!' 'This is amazing!' Of course that feels good. You feel like you're making a difference. The project isn't about you anymore, it's about this gift of transforming a space.\" That summer would end up being the inspiration for Mary's future in art. \"It wasn't until years later, when thinking about that summer, that it occurred to me that that's what I wanted to do...I wanted to [paint murals].\" With her new connection to the Ann Arbor Railroad, Mary sought opportunities to lead Growing Roots and Branching Out ~ How TreeTown Murals Celebrates Our Community's Diversity Through Art \"When we stumble upon a mural, most of us are struck with awe and amazement.

She was hired by the Ann Arbor Art Center to lead a two-week long summer program called StARTwork. Later renamed Art Makers, the program involved working with at-risk teens on finding art related work opportunities, and Mary spent five summers helping the teens paint murals on the railroad overpasses. The overpasses were also used when Mary led a semester long project with students at Community High. After taking a break from her studies to explore her art outside of academia, Mary returned to Eastern Michigan University and graduated in 2007 with a bachelor in fine arts degree. That same year she founded TreeTown Murals. In 2008, Mary was commissioned by the Corner Health Center to create a mural on the back wall of the center, located on N. Huron in downtown Ypsilanti. The project, paid for by the Corner Health Center Capital Improvement Fundraising Initiative, budgeted $15,000 for the mural. Mary's spirit of collaboration and desire to mentor inspired her to contact Ypsilanti high schools to encourage students who excelled in art to participate. She mentored five students from Lincoln and Ypsilanti High Schools on the design and implementation of the mural Together We Solve the Puzzle, which was revealed in the fall of 2008. The work she did with these teens helped further Mary's understanding of where her art was heading. \"It was here that I began to get more organized in my understanding of how to turn mural making into an educational model to teach the process of making public art in our communities. I was eager to do more mural work with students from the local schools.\" Since the Corner Health Center mural, Mary has collaborated with students at Mitchell Elementary and Skyline High to create and implement murals in their schools. Mary was invited to Mitchell Elementary by long time colleague and art educator, Sarah Winter, to facilitate a mural. The students learned about Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas, who became the inspiration for the mural design. The third and fourth graders helped design and implement the mural, which was based on imagery taken from photographs of members of the student council. Mary hopes the experience taught the students the value of making a mural. \"I hope that they see how a simple idea, along with the right persistence and planning, can blossom into a piece of art that will remain in the public trust as a source of pride and accomplishment for all who participated and view it.\" Mary's work at Skyline High, which she completed this spring , was of a different nature. Ann Henderic, a graphic design educator at Skyline, approached Mary to help write a grant for a mural project at Skyline High. They were awarded money from the Ann Arbor Public Schools Educational Fund, and the Skyline PTO matched the grant. Mary worked closely with 2 junior high students enrolled in an independent study on a pilot mural project to empower the students to facilitate future mural projects at Skyline. Though her work mentoring children and teens on the mural making process is an important part of what TreeTown Murals does, it is only one of the branches reaching out to our communities. Mary also paints murals for private homes and a wide variety of businesses and organizations. From A2 Yoga, to Great Oak Cohousing, to Oakwood Annapolis Hospital in Wayne, TreeTown Murals continues to find ways to celebrate the unique identity of the people, places and groups that commission her work. In 2009, Mary was commissioned to paint a mural celebrating Chelsea's 175 th anniversary. \"The cool thing about that mural is that it's an amazing example of a community coming together to fund a project. There was money from the Chelsea DDA and fire department. There was a grant from the Ann Arbor Arts Alliance...There really were a lot of people coming together to make it happen.\" A think tank made up of community members met to collaborate on the project, and Mary spent a great deal of time at the Chelsea Area Historical Society Museum learning about Chelsea's deep history. \"I wanted something that celebrated this rich history, at the same time, a contemporary image. I didn't want to do a town mural with an image of what Chelsea looked like in 1867. I decided to do something a little more symbolic. I wanted to highlight the youth and I also wanted to highlight this rural community. Certainly, what's foremost about Chelsea is the pride in farming.\" The mural, which is located on the side of the Merkel Furniture building on S. Main St. in downtown Chelsea, was unveiled at the final Sounds and Sights on Thursday Nights in September of 2009. It depicts a young girl standing in a field blowing into a dandelion seed making a wish for the future. Thiefels has painted many details of Chelsea's history into her dress, which is blowing in the wind. It is not hard to see that Mary's passion lies not only in creating art, but in making the process of creating all inclusive. Since her early experiences of collaborating with friends, Mary has found ways to include others in all aspects of mural making. While some aspects, like the design phase, are easy for others to be involved in, Mary has come up with an innovative \"I believe a mural is a symbol of our community, home, or business... By bringing mural art into our personal spaces and neighborhoods we stand out as a people who make art a part of our daily lives. Like landmarks, murals become a source of pride.\" ~ Mary Thiefels of TreeTown Murals Photos on next page, and article continued on page 26 \"When you're on site [making a mural], people are watching you: they're engaged, they're curious, they're excited, they repeatedly come back, they honk or just walk by.

In part, the technique involves creating a design that is projected onto the space where the mural will be painted. The design can then be traced onto the wall or panel and numbers designating colors can be inserted. Once this is done and materials are provided, the mural is ready to be painted. Even when she doesn't incorporate help from students or community members in the implementation of a mural, Mary's work still brings people together. \"When you're on site [making a mural], people are watching you: they're engaged, they're curious, they're excited, they repeatedly come back, they honk or just walk by. You draw a crowd...That's where the seed is planted, why this is important for us, to do this in our neighborhood. It brings joy.\" Mary's work with TreeTown Murals is truly a community building gift that brings joy not only to those involved in the creation of the art, but for all those who have the pleasure of viewing it. Luckily for us, Mary's vision of celebrating community through art continues to transform our cities and neighborhoods, schools and businesses. Fortunately for the rest of the world, Mary's vision doesn't end here. \"I hope my business will continue to expand and grow to incorporate more schools and cities, perhaps sending out branches beyond Michigan and even the United States. I would love to travel with my brushes and paints, teaching workshops all over the world: bringing color, collaboration, and tools to teach peace, equality, and self-expression.\" ###It is not hard to see that Mary's passion lies not only in creating art, but in making the process of creating all inclusive.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 27 Inspired by Music - Located at Skyline, Ann Arbor - First Floor Hallway, East Wing a2yoga.netBy Mary Runser Photos by John Fredericks This is the second in a series of articles we're doing on local business owners and their relatively newer businesses. From major corporations to small businesses, business owners all over the state have been downsizing, reorganizing, and out-and-out closing their doors in the last several years. And yet, as the economy in Michigan has steadily declined over those years, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here. What follows are profiles of two local business owners who have left their \u2014 more mainstream \u2014 jobs, not because they were forced out, but because it was time to pursue their dreams. They tell us how they've been faring in this economy, and you'll see that it took courage for each of them to make the leap. Grow With Me Elyssa Mount, owner Grow With Me, a resale boutique envisioned and created by Elyssa Mount, is the culmination of her passion for resale and garage sale shopping transformed into a local business. Organizing her ideas and getting things together for her vision to become a reality (retail space, inventory , business plan, employees) was a process that took about six months, but really had been a dream of Elyssa's for several years. Prior to opening Grow With Me, Elyssa was a consultant in the automotive industry , providing all the main services of a consultant, but specializing in strategic planning and marketing. \"I liked consulting,\" Elyssa said, \"and there was travel involved, which was good. I did a lot of work from home during the last several years that I was with the Automotive Consulting Group, which was really nice. But, after twenty-plus years, it just became less fulfilling. I guess I just wanted more involvement with the community and business owners. I knew I was helping make a change when I was consulting; it was just harder to see that change. I knew that the automotive industry was not doing very well with the economy and I knew that if I was going to make a career change, now was the time to do it.\" After going down to part-time work in consulting, Elyssa spent the rest of the time organizing and developing a business plan for Grow With Me, and six months later opened the doors of her boutique in March 2008. Thankfully, the resale business seems to be \"fairly resistant to the economy ,\" Elyssa said. \"I think it does well in both good and bad times, so I can't really say that the bad economy has affected us negatively. We've been profitable since the beginning, which is nice, and we've been growing; we just recently moved to this location.\" A portion of the store profits and 50 percent of the profits from the Dollar Room goes to autism research. Elyssa's son, Gabe, was diagnosed with autism when he was 17 months old, and part of her personal goal for the boutique was to create an environment that was comfortable for parents of children with autism to shop. The store has a family-friendly atmosphere, with an area for kids to play or watch TV, and to \"have a parent tell me that they feel comfortable shopping here with their autistic child\" lets Elyssa know that she has achieved her goal. Twenty to thirty times a year, Elyssa also makes donations, creates gift baskets, or donates gift certificates to local fundraisers. Being able to of fer a service to the community and help raise funds for the Ann Arbor Autism Foundation and other organizations at the same time has been a bonus for Elyssa. She's had a lot of moral support from her husband, Jeff, and her children, Rachel and Gabe. \"It's true, in many ways, that as a business owner you're never really away from the business, but I'm definitely much happier and more fulfilled doing this.\" Grow With Me, 2521 Jackson Ave.,(inside the website: www.growwithme123.com \"It's true, in many ways, that as a business owner you're never really away from the business, but I'm definitely much happier and more fulfilled doing this.\" --- Elyssa Mount Elyssa Mount of Grow with Me Leaps of Faith: Tales of Newer Local BusinessesThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 28 TeaHaus Lisa McDonald, owner Lisa McDonald, owner of the TeaHaus, grew up in Boulder, Colorado, graduated from college, and went backpacking in Europe for six months. Those six months turned into 14 years, as she took a job teaching United Nations politics at the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, then struck out on her own as a business consultant to auto suppliers. She met her husband, Mark Hewko, at an English-speaking theater group in St\u00fcttgart, Germany; moved to Sweden, had their first son, and eventually moved to Michigan. \"That's what happens when you study French and teach in Germany; you end up in Michigan,\" Lisa joked. The path she took was circuitous and perhaps a bit exotic but, for Lisa, it was all in a day' s work. \"Really, I could have taught and been a business consultant in Kentucky, or Ohio, or anywhere; it just so happened I was in Germany.\" After returning to the United States, Lisa was being a mom and kicking around ideas of what she would do. \"I knew I wanted to work. I thought I'd be a better mom if I at least worked a little bit,\" she said. She wasn't sure what she wanted to do, but she didn't really want to return to business consulting. The one thing Lisa really missed about Europe was the apothecary- type tea stores she found in nearly every village she traveled to. She'd even taken some of the training classes for tea blending while in Europe, though she didn't become a full-fledged tea sommelier. When her friends in Ann Arbor began complaining about not being able to find more than a few good loose-leaf teas in the area, she knew what she wanted to do. After researching tea suppliers, knowing that Germany is the world' s largest tea-purchasing country and has the strictest quality controls, she hooked up with a store in Chicago where she could buy German-tested tea. Lisa opened the TeaHaus in December 2007, and five days later gave birth to her second son. She has since expanded and opened the TeaHaus Tea Room next door last October. Lisa was more afraid to open a business in her own country than she was to be a self-contracted business consultant in Europe, although it was more of a self-imposed fear. \"It's far more difficult to open a business in Europe,\" Lisa said. \"There's just no entrepreneurial spirit there and if you think, as a woman, there's a glass ceiling here, you should try working in Europe. The ceiling there is flat-out cement!\" Certainly, she'd been able to successfully create her own business there, but \"a large part of that was the adventure and novelty of being an American working in Europe,\" she said. Lisa McDonald of TeaHaus \"The bottom line, no matter what you do, no matter what product or service you provide, is to do it to the best of your ability.\" --- Lisa McDonald of TeaHaus Along with the more than 200 varieties of tea available at the T eaHaus, you can also buy scones, jams, sandwiches, and soups, all of which are handmade, and often infused with tea or made with a tea stock. \"I've always enjoyed being in the kitchen,\" Lisa said. She buys her food preparations locally as much as possible, \"because that's just what you do, or what you should do.\" \"No matter how unconventional my work path seems to have been on the outside, really it was, and is still, very conventional, especially here in the United States. Being able to open a business with ease compared to other places should be a good reminder that there is something of the American Dream still available here. The bottom line, though, no matter what you do, no matter what product or service you provide, is to do it to the best of your ability.\" TeaHaus, 204-206 N. website: www.teahaus-annarbor.com ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 29 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 30 Go Eco-frugal! Being thrifty is a powerful \"green\" practice Story and Photos by Sarah Rigg Marketers and public relations firms capitalizing on the new \"green\" trend want you to think that it's smart to pay more for eco-friendly products and services. However, many people in Washtenaw County are getting the word out that going \"green\" and being frugal often go hand-in-hand. Our parents and grandparents have been practicing frugality for decades, and many of those practices are also friendly to the environment. Examples include repairing rather than throwing out old (and buying new) appliances, substituting vinegar and baking soda for more toxic cleaning products, and shopping at second-hand stores - an inexpensive option that also keeps those items out of the landfill and in productive use. You may already know about the more well-known re-use options like St. Vincent DePaul, the Salvation Army store, Value World, the Ann Arbor PTO (Parent-Teacher Organization) Thrift Shop, and the Recycle Ann Arbor ReUse Center. Here we present some of the lesser-known \"eco-frugal\" sources, along with the best tips from representatives of several local groups focused on sustainable living and conserving resources. These organizations and services can help residents of the greater Ann Arbor area live green without spending a lot of green! Eco-frugal parentingLaura Cowan, a resident of Whitmore Lake who grew up in Ann Arbor, realized early in her pregnancy that being a green mommy could quickly get hard on her pocketbook. \"As I did all this research, I discovered that being green was more than about being good to the earth, but also keeping my baby and my family safe,\" Cowan said. \"Eco-friendly products have fewer chemicals and are less likely to be recalled. There's just a higher level of quality there, so I started looking for ways to make that affordable. I had just been laid off a month before I got pregnant, so that was extra incentive to be frugal.\" Cowan said that many eco-friendly parenting methods are affordable, but not obvious. \"My friends kept getting pregnant, and I was sending them this information I'd compiled, over and over,\" she said. \"And the light went off in my head that this could be a blog, and maybe even a book.\" Her quest to find frugal and yet eco-friendly ways to parent lead to her blog, 29Diapers.com, and the publication of a book called Eco-frugal Baby: How to Save 70% Off Baby's First Year . Cowan said that during her research, she discovered that products like cloth diapers have \"come a long way.\" \"They're made of high-tech fabrics, they have Velcro and snaps, and they're easy to wash. I think lots of people don't know this. Cloth diapers are better for the baby, they keep one ton of trash out of the landfill per year, and they'll save you money, too.\"Cloth diapers not only keep trash out of landfills, but, surprisingly, they save water as well. \"The amount of water you use to wash cloth diapers is nothing compared to the amount of water the manufacturer needs to make disposables,\" Cowan said. Besides considering cloth diapers, one of Cowan's other top tips for eco- frugal parenting is breastfeeding. \"It's eco-friendly, because you're not throwing away canisters of formula,\" she said. \"And breast milk is much better for babies' health. A lot of people don't know it can save you $1,200 to $1,500 over the course of a year to breastfeed. It's another win-win situation\u2014it's healthier, eco-friendly and extremely frugal.\" Cowan cited \"Freecycling\" as another frugal resource that can be helpful at any stage of life, but especially as the parent of a baby. \"I got nearly a year's worth of baby clothes for free through Freecycle,\" Cowan said. Online Freecycle groups, including a very active one in the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti area, allow those who have things they don't need to give them away, free, to someone who needs them. \"Freecycle is amazing for baby clothes. People have clothes that didn't get worn, and they're too busy to sort out and sell them, or they're just generous. Once I went a little bit out of my way to get some Freecylcled clothes and found four trash bags of designer baby clothes. I couldn't use all of it, so I packed up several bags and passed them on to a friend. Over time, I've given away maybe 16 paper grocery bags of clothes I didn't need.\" Cowan said that in a few categories, cheaper isn't always better. \"With cribs and some other items, like baby toys, don't skimp,\" she said. \"Safety is really important. When I was pregnant and shopping for cribs, I kicked a few tires and was appalled at the quality. Later, I found out that three out of the four I was considering were recalled for broken slats, lead paint or other issues.\" She said she ended up paying $200 for a used crib she found on craigslist that had originally cost $1,000, and was satisfied with the quality. \"The most important thing is to know it's sturdy, new or not.\" Cowan said there aren't many websites or blogs for eco-frugal parenting, so she suggests her own, 29diapers.com, as a resource, but said other parenting blogs are a great resource for free stuff via blog contests, where visitors can enter by leaving comments on the blog. \"I got over $600 worth of free stuff from blog giveaways, like cloth diapers and BPA-free bottles,\" she said. \"The odds of winning are fairly high since it's a niche audience, and maybe only 200 will enter, whereas in a typical sweepstakes, they might get a million entries.\" There are a number of places to buy new or used baby gear in Washtenaw County, but Cowan said her favorite is Little Seedling, because she said the staff are knowledgeable about baby gear and can recommend safe and eco-friendly products. Learning eco-frugal skillsThe mission of the Transition Towns movement is to help communities wean themselves off dependence on petrochemicals and other nonrenewable The Reskilling Festival is \"about trying to gain low-energy skills \u2014 old-fashioned skills or newer, more modern, hybrid skills. The skills tend to be old-timey, but they don't have to be. Whatever helps us save energy and water.\" \u2014 Laura Smith, Transition Ann Arbor\"I discovered that being green was more than about being good to the earth, but also keeping my baby and my family safe...Eco-friendly products have fewer chemicals and are less likely to be recalled.\" \u2014 Laura Cowan, 29Diapers.comThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 31 resources, take action against climate change, and still support a robust economy. However, many of the techniques and skills taught by local Transition groups are also old-fashioned frugal skills. Locally, Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Chelsea all have strong Transition groups. Ann Arbor's group started with a training session in early 2009. One of the founders of the Ann Arbor group, Laura Smith, said she came late to the founding team and with a more academic standpoint. \"I essentially had an academic perspective on localization, a more theoretical perspective. Transition is the active hands-in-the-dirt side of things,\" Smith said. She said that the Transition movement is about finding \"the best response to peaking resources,\" and using less energy overall, not just greener alternative energy sources. \"I think that's where frugality comes in,\" she said. \"We need to get savvy about how and when we use energy, and not use it for things we don't need to use it for - being frugal with our energy resources. It touches on everything in your life. The clothes you wear, the food you eat, the way you transport yourself - it all ties back to energy.\" Transition Ann Arbor puts on public showings of documentaries about climate change and hosts book discussions, but the event that draws the most attention and participants is also, she said, the most fun one: a Reskilling Festival. Transition Ann Arbor hosted well-attended Reskilling Festivals in January and July of this year. \"Basically, they're really fun,\" Smith said. \"It's a day-long event, where community members volunteer to present that day. It's a motley crew. Last time, there were 225 people, and that was a record attendance.\" The first festival in July of 2009 was attended by a little over 100 people, she said. \"Typically we have topics like beekeeping, gardening, backyard chickens, canning,\" Smith said. She said one of the more popular sessions is with Merilynne Rush, who does a talk on natural death care and home funerals (you can find an article by Merilynne Rush on this topic in the May-August 2011 issue of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal, which can be found at our online archive at crazywisdom.net). More typical offerings might include sessions on herbalism, bread-making or creating hoop houses. \"It's about trying to gain low-energy skills \u2014 old-fashioned skills or newer, more modern, hybrid skills. The skills tend to be old-timey, but they don't have to be. Whatever helps us save energy and water.\" She said that the festivals attract a lot of people who wouldn't necessarily attend other events sponsored by Transition Ann Arbor. \"People who come don't necessarily want to be bombarded with discussions on peaking of resources and climate change,\" she said. \"That's the cool thing about the Reskilling Festivals - they attract an interesting, fun group. It injects a little bit of levity, even though it's motivated by some serious concerns.\" Smith said one of her best tips for eco-frugal living is to create a sense of community. \"Community building is a way to make yourself resilient,\" she said. \"You can get to know your neighbors and share things. If something goes wrong, you've built community and expanded your network of people who can help you. If nothing bad happens, there are all these people you know, and you didn't lose anything but gained a lot.\"Sharing tools and skills David Dye is certainly on the same wavelength as Laura Smith when it comes to community building as an eco-frugal move. Dye is a licensed builder in the Ann Arbor area and webmaster for one site for do-it-yourself projects and another site for a tool-sharing cooperative. \"I'm a licensed builder, and I do environmentally-friendly repairs,\" he said. \"As a builder, I de-install as opposed to demolish when I do renovations \u2014 either to reuse the items on site or take them to the Habitat for Humanity ReStore or post it on craigslist.org in the materials section. I find that through craigslist and Freecycle, I can find people that do not mind getting materials for free that have been used.\" He said one of his websites, A2Help.com, was his first stab at being self-employed. He said the website has been neglected, but he's planning to update it soon. \"The concept is that I can help people with projects if they are handy and just need some guidance or a hand. It reduces my liability costs, and people get the use of contractor-grade tools and skilled labor \u2014 me.\" His other website, www.toolcooperative.com, is also a work in progress, and he said he's still sorting out issues surrounding liability, should someone hurt himself while using one of the cooperative's tools. \"I am gathering tools for the lending program, and it will be a membership type of club. For a modest annual dues \u2014probably around $50 to cover maintenance and acquisition \u2014 I will lend out tools for a few hours at a time. Right now I have hand tools, gardening tools, a pole saw, a rototiller, a hammer drill, sanders, and other tools. I will be adding a trailer soon \u2014 once I get a new one.\" Dye said the tool cooperative \"will promote neighborhood communities sharing tools and resources among each other,\" and added that he seeks input from area residents on implementing the program. \"This will be community-driven and a great way to get to know your neighbor while reducing tools costs for homeowners,\" he said. Dye said he's also passionate about saving water. He's interested in, and has taken classes about, creating rain barrels, cisterns, and rain gardens and recommends those courses to other eco-conscious homeowners. \"A rain garden is a retention area for rain water runoff, so it doesn't go into the storm sewer. It helps the water permeate back into the aquifer, rather than flowing into the watershed - it helps avoid floods.\" He said combining having a rain barrel or cistern with planting a rain garden is a frugal way to landscape that's also ecologically friendly. Dye said that Washtenaw County is a great resource for information and classes about water conservation, including lots of information on the county's website about water conservation and eco-friendly home and garden skills. \"On the water conservation front, eWashtenaw.org has some good sources for rain gardens,\" he said. \"And Ann Arbor has a RiverSafe program that David Dye's tool-sharing cooperative \"will lend out tools for a few hours at a time. Right now I have hand tools, gardening tools, a pole saw, a rototiller, a hammer drill, sanders, and other tools.\" Deb Heed, of Ann Arbor's Clean Energy Coalition, says that there are local, state, and national programs for energy savings... [from which] people at many income levels can benefit. \"In some of these programs, they'll come in and re-caulk your windows or replace your refrigerator with a more efficient model for free.\" Continued on page 32people can sign up for and get a credit on their water bill \u2014 there are credits for rain barrels, cisterns, and rain gardens too.\" Re-selling and rehabbing Ann Arbor's Habitat for Humanity ReStore is another great example of how being frugal and being eco-friendly can go hand-in-hand. The local affiliate of HFH has been in Washtenaw County since 1989, but the ReStore was established just five years ago. \"We carry a whole line of cabinets, furniture, appliances, and building materials,\" said Vic Whipple, community relations manager for the ReStore. \"The only things we don't take are things like clothes, shoes, and knick-knacks. And if someone donates something we don't sell on our floor, we'll find another avenue to recycle it.\" Whipple said that inappropriate items given to the ReStore are donated to other area nonprofits. \"Say someone brings clothes here,\" Whipple said. \"We would take them down the road to ShareHouse. It's a nonprofit, smaller-scale resale shop. They take clothes and electronics, the kind of items we don't deal with.\" Whipple said about 80 percent of the items in the store come from donations, and the other 20 percent are purchased. When the items are re-sold to the public, the profits are used to build Habitat for Humanity homes for low-income families. And, more recently, Habitat for Humanity of Huron Valley has been focusing on rehabbing foreclosed homes rather than building new ones - another eco-friendly move. \"When the economy slowed down and builders stopped building new homes, Habitat for Humanity started buying foreclosed properties and renovating them as Habitat homes,\" Whipple said. \"It makes a lot of sense. You see a home sitting in foreclosure, scoop it up inexpensively, rehab it and give it to somebody who would otherwise not have a chance to be in a home.\" Whipple said the typical ReStore donor is a homeowner or contractor who renovates a kitchen and donates the old cabinets and appliances in good shape that are leftover from the job. \"They don't want to just throw it in a dumpster, because they know someone else can use it,\" Whipple said. \"And another client comes in, says, 'I'm redoing my kitchen and I need flooring or cabinets or appliances and can't afford to buy new.' That's the typical person on the purchasing end.\" Whipple said that the ReStore \"diverts tons of products from landfills.\"He said that area residents are catching on that the ReStore is a great place to leave donations, but he wants people to start thinking of it as a place to purchase goods as well. \"People think of it as a donation center, but the point I'd like to drive home is that they're welcome to come in and shop, too. Our tagline is: 'Drive and donate. Stop and Shop.'\" Eco-frugal energy at home and on the road Deb Heed, a project manager with Ann Arbor's Clean Energy Coalition, said energy efficiency is the main topic in the classes and workshops that the nonprofit puts on around Washtenaw County. \"What we talk to folks about, especially lower-income folks, are ways to save money on utility bills,\" she said. Heed said that many of the local, state, and national programs for energy savings are specifically targeted at people who are at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, but people at many income levels can benefit.De-cluttering your home seems like an obviously eco-frugal project, but some people start out doing it all wrong and spend more than they need to, said Judy DiForte, marketing manager with the Betty Brigade. The Betty Brigade was established about eight years ago by Ann Arbor resident Sharon McRill. Currently, the business offers services like organizing, moving coordination, and running personal errands in Ann Arbor and in Birmingham. DiForte said that while many people spend too much on organizing, it's easy to de-clutter on a budget and in an environmentally friendly way, too. \"With de-cluttering, it's a matter of subtracting the unnecessary stuff that gets in your way,\" she said. \"One tip for budget de-cluttering is to sell what you're getting rid of. You'll often find listed on e-Bay the very thing you don't want to keep anymore.\" DiForte suggested E-bay, amazon.com, and craigslist.com as places to sell stuff you no longer want taking up room in your home. \"Then there's donating as much as you can,\" she said. \"That's also eco-friendly, rather than simply trashing those items. Put them in a box, itemize them, give them to a thrift store and deduct them from your income taxes the next year.\" She said that doing tasks in the right order will help keep de-cluttering inexpensive as well. \"When people start out de-cluttering, they sometimes run out and get all kinds of organizers,\" she said. \"It can be expensive, because they buy the wrong things, or too many of them. It's best to wait until after you've de-cluttered. Wait and see what you need and how many, and what shapes and sizes.\" DiForte also said that you don't have to go out and buy matching designer baskets in order to get organized. \"Often, you can use what you already have as organizers,\" she said. \"A lot of people already have baskets, bins, and jars. You can buy things and spend any amount, but being budget-conscious is also better for the environment. You can reuse pickle jars, for instance. And my son uses a six-pack from Jones Soda as a desk organizer. It has cardboard partitions, and he uses it to divide pens and rulers and so on. It's cheap and a creative way to recycle.\" DiForte suggested getting kids involved in thinking up items that can be repurposed for organizing and de-cluttering. \"Get them to look around and figure out, 'What can we use this for?' It gets them into the reuse mindset, and it's cheaper for parents. It involves creativity, and that's helpful when you're trying to be eco-friendly.\" DiForte said one of her favorite places to take items to be recycled is the Scrap Box in Ann Arbor, a store that re-sells donated materials to be used for all types of creative projects. \"They take all sorts of things, from corks to google eyes - anything you might have left over from a craft project.\" She recommended checking the Scrap Box website first or calling ahead to see what the staff needs before bringing a large donation, since the business has a \"Do Not Wish\" List of items they have too much of or items they can't easily resell. Thinking outside the thrift store box for other places to donate the things you no longer need, DiForte suggested taking old electronics to Best Buy, who will recycle most items for free. And if you find an old fur coat or mink stole in the closet, she suggests donating it to the \"Coats for Cubs\" program of the Humane Society. They use old pieces of fur to comfort injured wildlife while they are being rehabilitated. DiForte also suggested giving old towels, bedclothes, and otherwise worn-out items to animal shelters. \"You might have towels that are not in good enough condition to donate to a traditional thrift store, but you can give them to a shelter to be used to comfort animals or to be made into bedding. Even an old sock can be fit over a paw that's healing.\" \u2014 Sarah Rigg Resources mentioned in this article: Ebay.comcraigslist.orgAmazon.comThe Scrap Box - Creative Recycling www.scrapbox.org/home.html (734) 994-0012 581 State Circle, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 Best Buy www.bestbuy.com 3100 Lohr Road, Ann Society's \"Coats for Cubs\" Programwww.humanesociety.org/issues/fur_fashion/donate_fur_coats_for_cubs_11042010.html The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 32 Go Eco-frugal!

She also noted that DTE Energy has programs for energy efficiency assistance. \"Go to the DTE website and click on My Energy Analyzer. It takes 20 minutes or so to fill out a form about your energy habits and use. Just from filling it out, they'll send an efficiency kit to your home that's worth $20.\" She said more intensive options are to arrange an in-home energy survey or a full-blown energy audit. \"For the survey, you spend $25 and a professional inspector comes out and makes some recommendations. In the full energy audit, DTE will pay you $100 to $150 toward your audit - most audits are in the range of $300 to $600.\" If you implement some of the recommendations from the audit, like putting in a new energy-efficient furnace or upgrading your insulation, DTE will pay the homeowner extra incentive money, Heed said. Heed said mobile homes even qualify for weatherization and some rehab money. She said renters \"have to jump through a few extra hoops\" and get approval from landlords, but they can often benefit from energy surveys and audits as well. Heed said many of these tips involve spending money now to save money later, including purchasing energy-efficiency lighting, low-flow shower heads, and aerators for faucets. \"Those are great investments that all pay you back within a year. After that, you're saving money. In my house, we changed out the light bulbs in the fall of 2007 over the course of a couple weekends, from incandescents to compact fluorescent bulbs. My electric bill from one month to the next went down 20 percent, so I saw immediate savings.\" In addition to saving you money, the CFL bulbs last longer, so you spend less time going up and down ladders to change bulbs out, she added. Heed said that water-saving devices like low-flow shower heads not only save up to 1.5 gallons of water per minute, but they also save on the energy and cost to heat that water. What if someone can't invest a lot of money up front to save money, though? \"People say to me that they can't go out and replace all of their appliances and they want to know which one or two make the biggest difference. I tell them, if they want to get just one appliance, my research says the best bet is a front-loading washing machine. It saves you a ton of water, because it uses only 10 percent of the water a top loader does. It saves on heating up the water, and you use less electricity.\" Heed added that the spin cycle on a front loader leaves clean clothes dryer, and so they can also spend less time in the dryer. Heed also had some advice for eco-frugal commuting. Local energy-efficient travel resources she suggested included the Getdowntown program and website, using short-term rental zipcars instead of owning a car, or using public transportation. If you can't bike or take the bus, though, Heed gave her top three gas-saving tips for commuters: Reduce idling. \"If you're sitting waiting for your kid at school or in the drive-through lane, turn the car off. If it's off for more than 30 seconds, it saves you fuel.\" Open your windows while driving on surface streets instead of using the air conditioning. \"Every time you turn on the AC, your mileage goes down.\" Heed said the drag on the car from open windows cancels out fuel savings at highway speeds, but open windows are preferable when you're driving more slowly around town. Fill your tires with air up to the specifications listed on the car door. \"They laughed at President Obama when he suggested this, but it really does improve your gas mileage.\" ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 33 A Compelling Reason to Join our Email List Last year, over 60 different spiritual, holistic, and psychological growth organizations and individuals used the Crazy Wisdom Email List to reach our over 3,000 self-selected subscribers.

Two wonderful women, Anita Rubin-Meiller, LMSW, and Dawn McCalla, LMSW, CAAC, began Tapestries ten years ago, creating a unique resource for sexual trauma survivors and their families in Southeastern Michigan - really, one of a kind in the region. This fall, after having helped over 100 women heal through their Tapestries 15-week intensive program, Anita and Dawn are turning over their group to two new therapists, Karen Zokas, MA, LMSW, and Hillary Baldwin, MSW. I spoke with all four women about this exciting time of transition at the current Tapestries office in Dexter (the new group will be held in Ypsilanti starting this September). Their enthusiasm and passion for their work is palpable. I was fascinated and inspired to hear about the genesis of their work, the future of the group, and to gain insight into this epidemic that affects far more than we may realize. Maureen McMahon: Anita, you've said that Tapestries began with a spark of insight into how your training and interests could serve women who have experienced sexual trauma. What was that spark and how did your training prepare you for this role? Anita Rubin-Meiller: I had been working in the addictions field for over 20 years and had for a long time been aware that many women struggling with addiction were survivors of sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse - I think the actual statistic is 70%. At the time, the philosophy of addiction treatment was to avoid as many difficult and complicated issues in early sobriety as possible and focus on the skills and supports for staying clean and sober. So the abuse was never dealt with directly, but we offered groups for building self-worth, developing assertiveness, and so on. When I came face to face with a trigger for my own history of an adolescent rape, I recognized how powerfully these memories were lodged in our brains and bodies and that they did not dissipate over time if they were not healed. So, in 2001, several factors came together to make Tapestries possible. I began a private practice with a focus of treating trauma and dissociation, better utilizing my expertise from trainings, especially EMDR, and workshops focused on these issues. I came across the book Addictions and Trauma Recovery by Dusty Miller and Laura Guidry that defined the necessity of treating a woman's trauma history at the same time the addiction is being treated in order to avoid a cycle of relapse and trauma reenactment. It also described a group designed to do this. With this, I approached my long-time colleague Dawn McCalla and tweaked her interest in working with me to develop and facilitate the group. Maureen McMahon: So your group, Tapestries, was inspired by your awareness of this connection to addiction and abuse. I think we're often not aware of how many people are affected by this. Anita Rubin-Meiller, Dawn McCalla, Karen Zokas, Hillary Baldwin \"Neither of us wanted to see the community lose this resource.\" ~ Anit a Rubin-MeillerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 35 There is a statistic that 1 in 3 women in our society has experienced sexual abuse before the age of 18. Paired with your insights about the connections between addiction and abuse histories, there's a suggestion that a huge number of women in our culture - and other cultures around the world - are walking around traumatized and numbed. Will you comment on that? Anita Rubin-Meiller: Y es, I do believe there are a large number of women who are living lives deeply impacted by the abuse they have experienced - probably more so in other cultures and regions of the world than here. This is exactly what prompted the creation of Tapestries. It was this awareness that drove my desire to offer a treatment to bridge the gap in available services. Maureen McMahon: If each person experiences abuse differently, then there must be a continuum of abuse represented in each Tapestries group. Is that right? Anita Rubin-Meiller: There is a continuum of abuse based on the frequency of the abuse; the relationship of the abuser to the victim; the felt sense of terror and danger; the presence of other forms of abuse along with the sexual trauma; and the availability or unavailability of safety and nurturance elsewhere. The greater the trauma, the greater the fracturing of the Self. In cases of the most severe trauma, the best chance for survival might be in developing a dissociative identity disorder, where emotional and cognitive experience is split off into different personalities, or parts of the mind, that are not in communication with each other. MM: Do the more extreme cases cause you to despair at times? Or have they inspired you to be all that more determined to help individual women, one at a time, and make a difference to those women? Anita Rubin-Meiller: Of course, Tapestries does not reach everyone and is not successful for each participant. There are some situations of abuse that are so severe that a person literally creates a fractured Self, and the stories of these experiences can be emotionally overwhelming to hear. When I work with these women in my therapy practice, I rely upon my grounding in spiritual beliefs that speak to a greater meaning and larger reality than our one, single, human life. While it's sometimes hard to see, I do believe the circumstances of our lives, whatever they are, have a purpose. This belief and others help me to stay rooted in hope and possibility for healing and change with each woman I work with. Leonard Cohen has a lyric that says \"there is a crack, a crack in everything...that's how the light gets in.\" I like to focus on that possibility of light that manifests for each abuse survivor as soon as they claim their experience rather than deny it. Maureen McMahon: Yes, that possibility of light and helping them to see it is extraordinary. I understand Tapestries is fulfilling a great need in Southeastern Michigan - it's really one of a kind in the region. Can you speak to this and explain the format of Tapestries? What are some of the therapeutic goals and modalities? How big are your treatment groups and how frequently do you meet? Anita Rubin-Meiller: There have been other groups offered for sexual trauma survivors, but none have been sustained for this long. One of the most important aspects of Tapestries is the particular care taken to reduce triggering and create safety. Our groups have always been small, most often 5 women and never more than 8, and in our first session each participant is encouraged to identify and give voice to her particular needs for emotional safety. Some groups for survivors have focused on telling the story of the abuse as a cathartic experience. However, research has shown - particularly Judith Herman, Bessel van der Kolk, Peter Levine and Pat Ogden - that if a survivor is triggered to a level of distress outside of their 'window of tolerance,' healing is not possible and the likelihood that the experience would be retraumatizing is high. Tapestries is organized to strengthen and expand that window. Each session is based around a topic to increase understanding of how trauma impacts the mind, body and spirit and to develop skills for coping more effectively with how the legacy of the trauma is interfering in the survivor's life today. The sessions have a didactic component and an experiential component as well as time for personal sharing. In the course of the 15 weeks of Tapestries there is also a group for family and friends to enhance supportive connections. At the end of each 15-week session, we collect feedback and use that to evaluate and revise the program's structure, if needed. It has been a wonderfully creative and collaborative process and we feel that the women who have gone through the group have benefited greatly from its constant evolution. Maureen McMahon: Anita, when you conceived of Tapestries, you felt the group would function best with two therapists, so you brought Dawn McCalla on board and launched the group together. Dawn, what about your background prepared you for this role? Dawn McCalla: I worked on my own recovery more than 25 years ago and then went back to school for my master's in social work. I had the good fortune to be selected for a specialized training in the treatment of childhood sexual abuse at the University of Michigan under the guidance of Kathleen Faller, Ph.D. Having worked previously as a recreational therapist for 15 years, I am inclined to work from an experiential perspective, so I used this background to develop an intensive outpatient treatment model for recovery from sexual abuse for my master's project. The program encompassed psycho-education, experiential involvement and processing with a skill-building focus. The program had successfully been piloted a few years before Anita approached me and asked me to join her in this endeavor. MM: So during your time with Tapestries, Dawn, what have been some of the changes you have see in women participants over the course of the 15 weeks? Dawn McCalla: We consistently see women begin to trust us and each other enough to verbalize their experiences, identify and express their feelings, let out their pain, empathize and validate each other and their own realities, grow closer, realize they are not crazy and they are not alone, and begin to make sense of what happened to them and what has been happening since. It is especially rewarding when a woman recognizes and accepts that it wasn't her fault, even if she was precocious or didn't stop it. Then we try to guide her into letting go of the guilt and shame that have imprisoned her for years. We move toward that end in Tapestries, and while not everyone gets there by the end of the 15-week program, most women have a solid foundation in place to continue with this work in individual therapy or in the Tapestries Phase 2 on-going support group. I feel very honored to facilitate this process and to help women find the freedom that comes from acceptance of what is, and learn to leave in the past what cannot be changed. MM: You both told me that the most rewarding part of this work is witnessing what you call \"small miracles\" or breakthroughs that improve quality of life for survivors of abuse. What are some of the small miracles you've witnessed? Anita Rubin-Meiller: We begin each week of Tapestries with a centering/ relaxation practice, most often a simple, mindful breath practice. There are often one or two women who cannot relax into this practice because of their hyper-vigilance and anxiety. Sometimes they are able to verbalize this discomfort, other times they struggle nonverbally, with restless legs or a fixed stare. Usually by the seventh or eighth week of the group they are joining the others in the centering practice. This is a small miracle that has been repeated again and again in our 10 years of offering the group. It is so significant Dawn McCalla & Anita Rubin-Meiller Therapists Anita Rubin-Meiller and Dawn McCalla began Tapestries ten years ago, creating a unique resource for sexual trauma survivors. They're turning over their group to two new therapists, Karen Zokas and Hillary Baldwin. \"Leonard Cohen has a lyric that says 'there is a crack, a crack in everything...that's how the light gets in.' I like to focus on that possibility of light that manifests for each abuse survivor as soon as they claim their experience rather than deny it.\" ~ Anit a Rubin-Meiller \"It is especially rewarding when a woman recognizes and accepts that it wasn't her fault, even if she was precocious or didn't stop it. Then we try to guide her into letting go of the guilt and shame that have imprisoned her for years.\" ~ Da wn McCalla Continued on page 36because it is a gateway to being able to find safety with an inward connection to oneself and to feeling trust with others. Without this, all other healing is stalled, so when a woman arrives at this turning point we know that other possibilities will manifest for her as well. One of the most moving experiences for me in our years of offering the group developed from a terrible tragedy. One of our group members took her life and all of us were overcome by this event. The group decided that they wanted to attend the memorial service together. It was an incredibly moving and honest memorial and it helped the group to have the healing experience of having the truth about this woman's abuse and struggles spoken publicly. There is so much secrecy and shame in most families, and so the possibility that it doesn't have to be that way was a gift of healing offered in the midst of this terrible tragedy. Whenever we experience women taking risks and making any sort of change in their protective and patterned ways of thinking and relating, it is a small miracle. I think what happens for many of the women can be summarized by feedback we received from one who wrote: \"My favorite part was what I thought I would hate the most: sharing with the group. I feel so much more empowered now that I've received such loving support from five former strangers.\" MM: Dawn, what have been some of the small miracles you've witnessed?Dawn McCalla: The first story that comes to my mind is of an older woman who was afraid she was \"going crazy\" as she was getting older because she had begun to experience flashbacks and felt angry all the time. She had been abused by her father and brother. She had a lot of anger at them, but also at her mother for not protecting her and for colluding with the abuse by denying it - a fairly common occurrence in families of abuse. She came into Tapestries in an attempt to make sense of what happened to her, what was happening in the present, and to let go of her anger and be able to provide loving care for her aging parents, both of whom were developing dementia. She was in a marriage that was controlling and triggered her memories of the abuse. She worked on being able to set and maintain healthy boundaries while voicing her reactions to her husband. Being validated by the information she received on the effects of trauma, taking risks to voice her experiences of what had happened and what was currently happening in her relationships with husband and parents, this woman found her way back into her marriage and was able to provide support to both her parents in a way that not only worked for her, but left her feeling good about what she could do for them. MM: So you're seeing these gradual changes, like the breath coming more easily or a woman inhabiting her body differently, that signal to you the healing of the fractured Self you spoke of earlier. It's amazing how these \"small miracles\" are changing lives. And Dawn, in response to your story about the older woman, while it may be obvious to people doing trauma work, it's a powerful reminder for me that many victims remain in relationship with their abusers, especially if the abuse happened within the family. I can only imagine the courage and maturity it would take to handle that well, and to even, as you described, be a long-term caretaker for someone who had abused you. You've helped over 100 women since Tapestries began. How has co-leading the group impacted its success? What has the collaborative process been like? Dawn McCalla: Because of the long-term residual effects of childhood trauma, survivors often have a great deal of difficulty with interpersonal relationships and managing reactivity, so having two therapists in group is essential to its success. This allows for one therapist to be able to focus on content and presentation of material and the experiential exercise, while the second therapist attends to the individuals and their reactions throughout the group. The process of collaborating with Anita has been an experience I have valued since the beginning. We often see and experience things very differently and that has enriched what we have to offer the group. I think we have both grown personally and professionally from the experience. I also think the supportive nature of collaboration has helped us prevent burn-out and allowed us to creatively make changes through the years that have enhanced and shaped the group into what it is today. Anita Rubin-Meiller: I could not imagine facilitating Tapestries alone - although we have each done that for a session here and there. Each of us brings a different combination of strengths and personal experiences, which makes it more likely that a group participant will feel a connection with at least one of us that allows for her to develop safety and trust through the weeks of the group. Often there has been a person in the group that needs additional attention, and with two of us there, we can offer that without disrupting the \"program\" for that session. If one of us can't quite understand what is going on for someone, usually the other person will get it. It has been an amazing collaboration and I look forward to it continuing in a new context. MM: Anita, you've mentioned that over the past ten years of Tapestries the curriculum keeps refining and evolving in wonderful ways - and that you and Dawn would like to share these resources with other therapists regionally and nationally. What are your plans for that and how are they related to the more immediate succession plan for Tapestries? Anita Rubin-Meiller: Dawn and I have really enjoyed our time offering Tapestries, but feel called by other things in our lives that make it less appealing to keep such a huge commitment of time going. Dawn recently became a grandma for the first time, and I am needing to be more present to some family responsibilities and relationships as well. However, neither of us wanted to see the community lose this resource. So, we decided we wanted to try to find a way to pass the group on to a new therapist or two. It happened a lot more easily than I expected. Dawn found Hillary and Karen through her connections to some folks at the School of Social Work - Kathleen Faller and Laura Sanders, I believe - and we actually had several responses to an ad we placed in the Michigan Mental Health Networker. We have had several meetings with Karen and Hillary and they each attended at least one session of Tapestries to get a feel for how we do it.

I believe that healing is a process, and we will continue to focus on the mind and the body. I am looking forward to helping clients to understand, as well as work through, how and what they are feeling; as a result, I am sure the group will evolve as Karen and I see what works for us and who is in the group. Karen Zokas: We will be using phase focused victim /survivor centered trauma interventions. Trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy along with body focused methods will be implemented in a creative and innovative approach to group treatment. This includes art, writing, storytelling, metaphor and ceremony that are anchored in sound theory. These approaches have enhanced the process and effectiveness of our group therapy. Each group will include education along with creative application of skills to help empower group members. I know that Level 1 groups have been very helpful for previous Tapestries members. I'm looking forward to working with Hillary to continue to provide this opportunity for sexually abused women. MM: Where will Transitions be located? When will the first session begin? How do people get involved? Karen Zokas: Transitions is a Level 1, 15-week Trauma Phase Focused group that will develop and emphasize empowerment skills. At this level it is not necessary for members to disclose their abuse. Tapestries, led by Dawn and Anita in their Dexter office, will continue to offer a Level 2 ongoing group for members that have completed Level 1 to provide support and application experiences. MM: Anita and Dawn, you have created an extraordinary resource for healing the body, mind and spirit of women survivors of sexual trauma. How wonderful that it can continue through Hillary and Karen. In this phase of preparation for change and reflection on your journey with Tapestries, what are you most grateful for? Anita Rubin-Meiller: There is a bumper sticker that says \"expect miracles.\" I feel that Tapestries has been an experience full of small miracles - the relative ease with which it came together; the incredible moments of excitement when each of us generates a new idea that is so well received by the other; the great gift of friendship that came with this collaboration; the amazing changes we have witnessed for some of the women from their first Tapestries session to their last; changes in how they inhabit themselves, how they deal with challenges, how they relate to others. All of this has created a wellspring of personal growth and satisfaction for me, and I will always be grateful for that. Dawn McCalla: I am eternally grateful for being given the opportunity to have been trained to do this work. I am also grateful and honored to have been asked by Anita to work together to bring healing to so many women who have benefited in countless ways. And I am grateful to the women who had the courage to reach out for help, take a risk, and trust us with guiding them into new ways of living with their pasts. MM: Thank you all. ###The new Transitions group will be run by Karen Zokas, MA, LMSW , (734) 332-7141, hmb1020@gmail.com.

For more information about Tapestries and Transitions, please visit www.tapestries4healing.com/About.html .are passing on our session notes and handouts and then they will have their own creative process to shape it in a way that fits their skills and experiences. Dawn and I hope to use our newly found \"free time\" to write up a manual and explore how to offer trainings for doing this kind of work so that groups like Tapestries can become a resource in more communities. These are very nascent plans at the moment and I am looking forward to how our collaboration will help them take shape. MM: After so many years of carefully refining your approach to this therapy practice and enjoying the work, it must have been a challenging decision to turn it over to two new therapists. How did you find the right people to hand it over to? What qualities were you looking for? Anita Rubin-Meiller: What was most important for me was that we find women who would have the same passion and open heartedness for the work that we have had and would use a combination of life experience and professional learning and experience to shape the group. Dawn McCalla: For me, passing the group on to two therapists who also have a heart for this work was essential. I had a long telephone interview with Hillary and loved her energy, her passion for working with those who have abuse histories, and I must admit, loved that she, too, has a background of experiential work. A month or so later, Karen's name was given to me by a respected colleague, as someone who was interested and would be able to provide what we were looking for in group facilitation. I interviewed Karen over the phone and was impressed by her background in leading groups, her training in body-oriented therapy and a sense of being well-grounded. I had been hoping to find two therapists who not only have some years of life experience, but would also complement each other in their personalities and trainings. I think Karen and Hillary offer just that. MM: Sounds like synchronicity to me. Now that we've heard some about the genesis of Tapestries, I'd like to hear from Karen and Hillary about where the group is headed. Hillary, tell us a little bit about your background and what draws you to this work? Hillary Baldwin: I became interested in trauma work while teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. I was running a drama therapy group for 6 th and 7th graders in the South Bronx. It was during this group that I really started to notice the positive effects of physical movement on trauma survivors compared to talk therapy. This led me to graduate school, and while at the University of Michigan I was trained at the Family Assessment Clinic (FAC) and began to focus seriously on trauma work. Currently I am the Social Worker at the Family Learning Institute, where I work with children who are struggling in school for reasons other than intellect. MM: And you, Karen. This is your second career. You worked in elementary education as a teacher and principal for many years. What motivated you to become a social worker? Tell us how your passion ties into the work of Tapestries - which, by the way, will be renamed Transitions in its new incarnation under your and Hillary's leadership. Karen Zokas: During my career as an educator and principal I worked with many children and families that had experienced trauma and abuse including sexual abuse. As I supported them to help find treatment, it became apparent that there were not enough expert trauma trained therapists available in the area. When I investigated further I found the alarming statistic you mentioned earlier. The National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect reported that 1 in 3 girls are sexually abused before the age of 18. I further recognized that this reported statistic is low because many incidents of sexual abuse or assault are not reported. It is clear that sexual abuse and assault continue to happen at epidemic proportions. Although there is a clear need for services, quality treatment with therapists that specialize in working with children and adults who have suffered sexual abuse or assault are not always available or affordable. I knew then that this was where I was needed. I was able to retire from education and return to school at the University of Michigan to become a clinical master social worker specializing in treating sexual abuse and other traumas experienced by adults, children and families. I am very passionate about helping victims of trauma and sexual abuse to become empowered survivors. Transitions will provide one more avenue of support for women victims/survivors of sexual abuse. MM: Hillary and Karen, what therapy methods are you looking forward to implementing? What are you excited about going forward?

We can drag it along with us - or project it into our Future, where we use it to trip ourselves up and convince ourselves that the past is responsible for our stumbles, forgetting that we flung the obstacle in our path. The Earth made her conscious choice in 1987 with what was called the 'Harmonic Convergence'; she made the commitment to support with her body and breath those who honor her and her committed life principle of co-creative partnership, and to no longer give life support to those who insist on maintaining domination as their primary or only mode of operation . She did not make this choice alone; indeed it was made in response to the collective call of humanity, seeking to claim and reclaim our true nature as Beings of love and of good heart. We have had almost 24 years to respond to this shift, to take upon ourselves the choice to affirm life in all its rich diversity, and support and create solution and resolution that are based on this affirmation, and to develop our compassion - our global compassion. We have it within our power - the power of our love and will, of our essential loving nature. We are awakening - have awakened - to the deep yearning for true peace that is stirring in our Hearts and Souls right now, as we each pick up the imperative, singular and global, of our Human evolution. We are called to move to the next step of being loving, reclaiming our imagination to create, express and allow the positive futures few till now have dared to dream, still in thrall as we have been to the fear of the humiliation or assassination that too often greeted such visionary ardor in the past. No longer. The tide has turned, and our dreams of futures unborn are being activated and set in motion. Many such dreamers are children, dreaming through their hearts, for they are closer to Source. So too the Elders are called to dream, and grandparents everywhere, of lineage or maturity, are being called to nurture and hold space for these dreamers and their new dreams. These dreams travel along the dream paths of consciousness, to be picked up and implemented by the ones whose path it is to heed one or more of these specific dream stories. The New Dreams are awakening, as we choose to no longer fuel the old stories of wars and domination, comparison and competition, that keep us mired in the past, unavailable to the Futures being born. There is a cost for us - that of recognizing cynicism as the voice of ignorance, however much we try to dress it up. Instead we now must practice the discipline of following the heart's imperative to align with Goodness, Truth, and Beauty and to discover that what is most loving for others is what is also most loving for self. We are invited to live in a field of gratitude - gratitude for the gift of Life that we have each been given. And if in a particular moment we struggle with a present that seems painful, and image a bleak future, even more then are we invited to reach deeply into the well of gratitude at what we have been given, and what is being given even in a time when our perception is blurred. We are asked to be aware of and to hold the Truth of the revolution of Hope that is transforming our World through our individual and collective Soul Awakening. Can we see ourselves as vessels of Hope, heralding a transformative force far more powerful than the Renaissance that the Chinese Admiral Zheng He's fleet ignited when it sailed into the Mediterranean in 1434? Ours is a cosmic flotilla of Global Harmony riding the oceans of space-time and beyond. What a time to be Alive! We are invited to fully acknowledge the consciousness in all things - in nature and all created ones. We live in a participatory universe, and refusing such acknowledgement is an extreme anthropocentrism, a narcissism that is reflected painfully in our bodies and our world. As we are finally willing to surrender to the trust of the consciousness in all things, we come home to ourselves, we emerge into our True Being. And each of us individually breathes again, and contributes to the collective harmonized in-breath and out-breath of our loving relationship with each other and the earth. And we remember who we are.This is Emergence. And so it is. We are invited to live in a field of gratitude - gratitude for the gift of Life that we have each been given.

I think I do a respectable job managing the risk factors over which I have control. I do, however, spend a fair amount of time contemplating losing my mind. I guess one could say that as long as I can engage in that pastime, I'm probably doing OK. But it hasn't always felt that way. My mother began showing signs of dementia in her seventies. She was able to hide it well; for a few years, every (infrequent) visit to my parents' house would begin with my father finding a private moment to quietly ask, \"How do you think your mother is doing?\" She seemed herself to me, and he respected her privacy in a way that precluded his saying more than that for a couple years, even though he had been aware of changes. I didn't quite get his gist. It was only when I began trying to teach my mother how to use email that I realized she could no longer grasp and retain new information. After that I started noticing the nuances and not so subtle changes. When my father was diagnosed with lung cancer nine years ago and died 18 days later, the shock unraveled her brain. The most painful part to witness was her forgetting he had died and having to break the news to her countless times, each time as shocking and excruciating for her as the first. Her agony was mixed with anger, magnified by the mistaken belief that he had known for a long time and had withheld the diagnosis from her. Her agony and anger seemed to fade over time, but then so did she. This was my first encounter with the effect of cortisol - the body's stress response hormone - on brain function, though it was several years before I began understanding the physiology of how stress is so hard on the brain. This past spring life presented me with another opportunity to venture a little further from the comfortable shoreline of academic understanding and into the ocean of experience. While my partner and I were visiting friends in another state, we checked our cell phones one evening to find several frantic messages from our petsitter. My seemingly healthy, much beloved, nine-year-old dog Coby had collapsed. Our petsitter took him to animal emergency, according to the message. When we couldn't reach her right away, I made the unfortunate decision to call the clinic, expecting news of and an update on his condition. I can't fathom what would possess someone to do what the person who took my call did: she got his chart and read me verbatim the medical notes ending with, \"humanely euthanized...\" That my beloved boy was dead was far too shocking to comprehend. In fact, after that moment, comprehension in general became a real problem. Shuttling between shock and grief at the loss, plus fear about what was happening to my brain, occupied much of my inner space for the next month. For 2-3 weeks I woke up and had to remember all over again that he wasn't on his bed on the floor at the end of our bed. My ability to remember the beginning of a spoken or read sentence by the time the end came around was non-existent. I struggled with any arithmetic calculations in my head, or remembering a number sequence when looking up, then dialing a phone number. If it wasn't written down, I didn't remember it. During that first month I went to a conference several hours away. I got there only to discover I had neglected to put my suitcase in the car, funny only in retrospect. The only thing I had no difficulty remembering was what happened to my mother's mind after my father died. It was a frightening time. I scheduled an appointment for a functional brain assessment with a chiropractic neurologist a few weeks later, the results of which, I'm relieved to write, showed that my compromised cognitive function was temporary, the result of shock and living a life too busy. The fear dispelled by this news alone was enough to improve my thinking and memory almost immediately. It provided me with a new resolve to slow down and to become as conscious of brain health as I am of physical health, in both my personal and professional life. We all have probably heard or read that stress is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But it's also a killer of brain cells. Good brain chemistry plays a central role in brain health and maintaining cognitive processes. Forgetting names, losing nouns, needing to write things down more, feeling more fatigued with night driving, walking into rooms and forgetting why, having more trouble staying focused, or difficulty learning new things are not \"normal aging\" processes, but they are common as people age. They are usually indications of both body and lifestyle imbalances. We can look at brain health for simplicity's sake from two perspectives, though they are interrelated. One is looking at the impact of stress, more specifically cortisol, our primary stress hormone, on the brain. The second is to consider other physiological factors that affect the brain. In either case, changes in the brain will cycle back and affect the body, specifically the immune and endocrine systems, and then body affects brain in an ongoing loop. Our current medical system, which divides the body into systems and clinical practice into specialties for these systems, has not caught up to our growing understanding of the inter-relationships of all these body-brain connections. Here is a brief and simplistic synopsis of what happens to your brain under stress. Brain registers an \"event\" (could be a thought, perceived threat, pain, emotion, etc.) as stressful;Brain signals adrenal glands to secrete cortisol;Cortisol causes amino acids, most notably glutamate, to excite brain cells (neurons); Cortisol interferes with the brain's usual mechanism for clearing glutamate, and glutamate shifts from a healthy function of brain activation to an unhealthy one of over-excitement. Glutamate in this state is called an excitotoxin; andNeurons atrophy or die. If the stress is temporary, the neurons can recover. However, if the neurons are already compromised from other physiological conditions, or if stress is prolonged or ongoing, the neurons likely will die, shrinking brain (hippocampus) size and reducing some brain functions, particularly those having to do with memory. This is part of the process that eventually leads to dementia. Cortisol is both friend and foe depending on context. When we're really, truly threatened, it suppresses all non-essential functions. To paraphrase Stanford neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky, who has devoted his career to researching cortisol's effect on the brain, when you're being chased by an attacker, you don't need to be ovulating; you can do that later. The same goes for digesting, growing, burning fat, having sex or fighting infections. They just aren't a priority when you're life is being threatened, so all the related mechanisms for these functions get suppressed. You can see where this is going. Being stressed in the way we are today is rarely useful; it's making us fat, stupid, and sick. What are some of the physiological factors in our bodies that we can control to help preserve optimal brain function? Blood sugar regulation is a good start. Being hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) or insulin resistant deprives the brain of its fuel, glucose. These are very modifiable conditions that unchecked make the brain more vulnerable to cortisol induced damage. In addition, these conditions of poor blood sugar regulation affect the brain's ability to make the good mood, natural anti-depressant neurotransmitter serotonin, which in turn makes one more vulnerable to stress and damaging cortisol elevation. Free radical damage is another. These DNA damaging, unstable molecules come from both healthy and unhealthy processes. Exercise and energy production in cells both cause free radical production. But more of it comes from unhealthy things we can either control or mitigate like smoking or smoke exposure, pollution, polyunsaturated vegetable oils, fried foods, radiation, and even alcohol, although we know alcohol has some health benefits as well. Through the use of antioxidant supplements and making sure our diet has lots of foods with antioxidant properties, we can offer our body and brain significant protection against free radical damage. Of course, we should be minimizing our exposure to pollutants and smoke as much as we can. Many people take steroids given to them by doctors for conditions like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or asthma. Prescription steroids are just a synthetic cortisol, and high doses or prolonged use are as harmful to the brain as self-generated cortisol. There are many well-researched, alternative solutions to all of these problems that address underlying causes of these conditions rather than attacking only the symptoms. It goes without saying that finding strategies for reducing the stress in our lives is critical. Whether it's changing external factors or changing internal factors (how we perceive or respond to what life presents), preserving memory and brain health is up to us. I feel very grateful that my diminished brain capacity was only temporary and provided me the opportunity to examine my own choices. It has led me to the decision to stop doing too many things - even good things - a long-time bad habit and source of stress in my life. So it is with mixed feelings that I want to let readers of Sustainable Health know that this will be my last column. I hope you have gained as much reading it as I have writing it, and I thank you for coming along with me. ### (Judy Stone can be reached at 734-994-5549 or at: cfninA2@gmail.com.

The only thing I had no difficulty remembering was what happened to my mother's mind after my father died.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 40 By Lindsay Hitt Passmore Photography by Doug Russell Last January, I met my friend Karen for a walk at Matthaei Botanical Gardens and we visited the new labyrinth. It was nine degrees outside. We were shivering in our boots , but determined to last as long as we could. The sky was a sparkling blue, the trees and land blanketed in snow. When we reached the labyrinth, footprints in the snowy spiral signaled that someone had been there ahead of us, despite the frigid weather. Although I had never walked a labyrinth, I was aware of its use as an ancient tool for contemplation, even higher awareness. Far from a New Age fad, the labyrinth is said to date back to 2500-2000 B.C.E., with some of the earliest examples found in ancient Greece. Its popularity was widespread throughout early societies in the Middle East and Europe. In the last decade, the publication of several books in the U.S. about labyrinths has inspired their revival at retreat centers and places of worship and in private gardens. The one at the Botanical Gardens, first conceived over ten years ago, is part of this movement.When Karen and I reached the spot, I realized that I had labyrinths mixed up with mazes. I was expecting something like the towering confusion of corn that our family got miserably lost in one blistering August day when our children were small. We had seen a corn maze by the side of the road on the way home from a camping trip and stopped for some spontaneous \"fun,\" only to stagger out of the hedgerows after more than an hour of maddening turns; exhausted, cranky, and soaked with sweat. But what I saw in the frozen landscape at the Botanical Gardens was altogether different and pleasing in its simplicity \u2014 an unpretentious, winding pathway that seemed to coil around itself. Its spiraling shape was created with short plantings of buffalo grass and the small open area in the center was marked by three low boulders. The power of the labyrinth to cultivate mindfulness lies in its design. Unlike a maze, there are no tricks, no dead-ends, and no decisions to be made. You just step onto the path, keep putting one foot in front of the other, and eventually you arrive at the center. Free from the distraction of guessing the way, you can focus on the \"now.\" The labyrinth also mimics the shape of the human inner ear - the part of our anatomy that facilitates both hearing and balance. According to the ancients, using our physical bodies to retrace this pattern on a larger scale, we are able to step into greater balance in our lives, and hear the guidance that is meant for us to know. On this labyrinth visit with Karen, I did not seek or find such depths. After pausing to read the interpretive sign that suggested \"quietly traversing the winding path to the center while allowing the experience to quiet your thoughts and relieve stress,\" I suggested a radical alternative, and my friend indulged me. Rather than moving contemplatively along the coiled path, we simply marched straight into to the center. It felt like a bold declaration! I know this was my way of dealing with an enormous loss I was facing in my life. I also know that actually, the only way through deep loss and grief it is to meet it with kindness and presence, acknowledging it, letting myself feel it. But I was too weary that day, feeling short on emotional fortitude. We strode right in and laughed at our irreverence. The center felt surprisingly spacious. Gazing out across the stark and beautiful horizon, I promised myself to return alone sometime and give myself the gift of a proper labyrinth walk. ********************************* A Pathway Home Walking the Labyrinth at Matthaei Botanical Gardens \"The power of the labyrinth to cultivate mindfulness lies in its design. Unlike a maze, there are no tricks, no dead-ends, and no decisions to be made...Free from the distraction of guessing the way, you can focus on the now .\" About the Labyrinth at Matthaei Botanical Gardens Background The inspir ation for this labyrinth, according to labyrinth project manager Sarah Weiss, came nearly ten years ago from benefactors of the gardens who wanted to offer a unique, meditative experience for visitors. The project stalled for a long time, Matthaei Director Bob Grese explained, because after funds were donated, an artist hired, and a beautiful and complex design created, cost projections were nearly double the initial $500,000 estimate. Grese, who joined the staff in the fall of 2004, eventually brought it to life again on a smaller scale than originally planned. Wanting to fulfill the donors' intentions, he asked Britt Zimmerman, a seasonal intern from the University of Michigan, to do some further analysis and develop a new plan. The r esulting labyrinth \u2014 the one I visited \u2014 was dedicated in August of 2010. Private but reachable by an accessible trail that is designed to meet the needs of people with impaired mobility, it was completed with the help of many dedicated volunteers. The labyrinth's pathway is one foot wide, because, according to Weiss, the meditative experience is born partly from placing one foot carefully in front of the other, and this careful approach is required when the path is narrow. Wheelchairs are still welcome at the labyrinth, Weiss said, because the tough buffalo grass that defines the spiral shape can easily survive being wheeled over. Quick Facts Where: The Matthaei Botanical Gardens are located at 1800 N. Dixboro Road, Ann Arbor, 48105. To find the labyrinth, take the Sam Graham Trees Trail (which can be found on the Matthaei visitor map, available in the visitor center). The trail is reachable off the main entrance drive, about halfway between the entrance and the visitor center. Or, if you want to visit the frog pond on your way, stand facing the visitor center and enter the Sam Graham Trail to your immediate left, along the small wooden fence.When: The labyrinth, like all of the outdoor spaces at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, is open from sunrise to sunset.Cost: Visiting the outdoor trails and gardens is free of charge, as is parking.Materials: According to labyrinth project manager Sarah Weiss, this labyrinth uses buffalo grass to create the spiral design instead of regular turf because it provides an opportunity to educate people about a sustainable lawn alternative. Buffalo grass is drought resistant, does not need mowing, and fits in well with the native prairie grass featured elsewhere on the property. The gravel-like material on the footpath is recycled slag, which Weiss said is a by-product of steel production at the Ford Rouge plant. Even the buried edging used to maintain the shape of the spiral is made from recycled plastic and wood fiber.Design: There are several labyrinth patterns used in the ancient world. Designer Britt Zimmerman chose the classical Baltic design because it offers the option of exiting directly from the center, rather than retracing the pathway in \u2014 a helpful option in a public labyrinth that might become crowded with visitors at times. This allows those who have already traveled to the center to exit without encountering others who are on their way in.More information: (734) 647-7600 or http://mbgna.umich.edu ### The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 41 Building \"a Future Worthy of the Human Being\"\u2014 A Special Crazy Wisdom Salon Series on Anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner's Work Four Tuesday nights in October. 7 PM. Free. \u2014 At Crazy Wisdom \u2014 A century ago, one of the most remarkable human beings of the last millennium \u2014 the Austrian-born Rudolf Steiner \u2014 began to shift the direction of our emerging global civilization. He restored a holistic image of the human being to the center of cultural thought and set out to bring humanity's soul and spiritual resources back into balance with materialistic science, technology, and economics. Trained as a scientist but also a profound esoteric researcher, Steiner developed resources for every individual to evolve herself or himself as a free and creative local change agent in planetary life. In this series of talks/conversations we will explore his vision, its amazing breadth, and three of its particular applications. October 4th Anthroposophy: the Consciousness of our Humanity Steiner's \"spiritual science\" aims to awaken just those powers of perception which are excluded in materialistic culture. So we rediscover the cosmic significance of being human and the pattern of repeated lives, and begin to take part as co-designers of the evolutionary plan. Speakers: Frederick Amrine teaches literature, philosophy, and intellectual history at the University of Michigan. John Beck was recently general manager of the New York Open Center and is now editor of the Anthroposophical Society's quarterly magazine, being human. October 11thBiodynamics: Nutrition for the Soul, Healing for the Earth One of Steiner's last initiatives, and a foundation for the organic movement, was biodynamic agriculture. Here the human being stands as the conscious ego in a farm organism of animals, plants, and soil, open to sun, moon, and stars. And the food produced works to support our awareness of the interconnected life of the cosmos. Speakers:For almost 20 years, Paul Bantle and Annie Elder have been biodynamic farmers for The Community Farm of Ann Arbor, seeking to work with, and build social values around, the life-giving forces of nature. October 18thAnthroposophical Medicine Steiner's approach to health is a complementary medicine bringing together the outstanding technical skills of modern western medicine with traditional western environmental medicine. And it adds a new intuitive approach to health as a totally individual matter where illness is part of our karmic path and the \"I\" of each patient is a profound agent of healing. Speakers:Molly McMullen-Laird, MD is the medical director of the Rudolf Steiner Health Center and practices anthroposophic medicine with Quentin McMullen in Ann Arbor. Susann Herb-Eddy is a teacher of eurythmy at the Detroit Waldorf School and does therapeutic eurythmy together with Drs. McMullen and their patients. October 25thWaldorf Education for the Whole Child Steiner is best known for his educational initiative, a response to an appeal by factory workers for an education for their children which would open up to them all of life's opportunities. Waldorf sees the child as already a unique individual, going through archetypal stages of development which affect the needs and potential for learning. The teacher acts as a social artist, assisting each child in opening the fullest human potential. Speakers:Lawrence Mathews is a class teacher at the Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor, currently teaching 7th grade, and an instructor in teacher education for the Waldorf Institute of Southeastern Michigan. A Waldorf teacher since 1985, Mary Emery teaches English and drama at the Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor High School. Trained at Rudolf Steiner College, she teaches in its summer program for teachers.

Days after that first January visit to the labyrinth, I agreed to write an article about it. Now that I have an opportunity to return, I hope I will feel something, but I don't know what to expect. Still, there is nothing to lose by surrendering to the experience. Lately I've been frightened by the complexity of creating enormous and necessary life changes. Perhaps this will help. I leave my car in front of the Visitors Center, take to the trail, round a corner and am hit by a wall of sound, a tremendous force enveloping me in waves of vibration that rise in a spine-tingling crescendo, fall, then rise again. This pond was silent and frozen in January. Now it is a kingdom of bullfrogs! I step forward onto a bridge and let my senses carry me away in the overwhelming splendor. This wild frenzy of sound, and the grass so fresh and green, bursting out of the ground on the edges of the trail \u2014 everywhere, the earth is pulsing with new life. My own life feels small in comparison. Already I am grateful to be here. I pass the gazebo with a \"living roof\" and move onward. I hear a rush of water , come upon Fleming Creek , and let my soul soak up the purple hues of redbud trees dotting the tangle of new growth along its banks. After ten minutes or so, I become uncertain of the way. Finally, I see a sign sporting a labyrinth pattern and an arrow pointing . . . straight . . .or left? I follow my instincts and turn. Then, a surprise. As soon as the labyrinth comes into view, I feel a rush of tears. I enter and start walking the curved pattern. Slowly, this time. One step, then another. The tears are still flowing. Don't worry about that. Just be with whatever comes. Be present with it, notice it. Noticing what a great comfort and relief it is to be on a path that has already been determined for me. Nothing to figure out here. The pathway is narrow, it is winding. I am listening to the steady crunch, crunch of gravel underfoot and I am looking at my feet, and walking. I have been striving with such earnestness to open to the changes I am facing, to let grief move through me, to flow with it. But much of the time, the way seems filled with terrifying doors that I don't know how to open or even approach. Here, now, watching my feet carry me forward, I realize that somehow I am doing it nonetheless. I think of the Bible passage about the birds of the air and the lilies of the field, how Spirit cares for them and will care for us as well. I am a bird, a lily. I realize I am utterly safe. Some greater wisdom is in charge. That is what these tears are about. This feels like safety . . . this feels like . . . rest. Mind is thinking now, reflecting on the continuity of life. The people I sat with as a hospice volunteer yesterday, three men and a woman, all on death's threshold, their bodies warm with life but spirits very close to leaving this earth. I, too, will pass on. I am just a part of the circle. My concerns are small, really, in the scheme of things. Quiet mind now. Crying is done. Crying is about effort and not-knowing and desperately needing to know. Here is rest. Reaching the center now. I stretch out on my back across one of the rocks, remembering the lion, Aslan, in C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, at the moment of his apparent death, lying defenseless on the stone table, open to whatever lies ahead. Moments pass. It's warm, humid. Now it's time to go. Walking out the same way I walked in. Feeling relieved, refreshed, unburdened. A bit impatient to be done, now. But not impossibly distracted. Stay present. Taking time to stretch when I reach the labyrinth's exit, standing with eyes closed, feeling the breeze in my hair, hearing the bright chirruping of birds against the dull drone of farm machinery in the distance. This day feels glorious. Back on the bright green pathway, past Fleming Creek, the living-roof gazebo, entering the realm of the frogs again. Their song is so primal, so loud, crossing their bridge is like passing through a foreign country. I peer into the water, clear in the sunshine, and greet its subjects, green and brown and shiny in their wet skins. They seem to me the most miraculous and wonderful beings. ###\"I have been striving with such earnestness to open to the changes I am facing...But much of the time, the way seems filled with terrifying doors that I don't know how to open or even approach.

The chapter is called \"The Dance of Life as an Ecstatic Conversation with Everyday Reality.\" For a very long time now, Friedlander has been the leading psychic, clairvoyant and intuitive in this region. Because of his books, and the fact that he has lectured and taught around the country, he has become one of the nation's better known serious psychics. His writings are substantive and far-reaching. He has mentored, taught and influenced many people in the Ann Arbor area's thriving \"intuitive awareness\" community. Friedlander's first book, The Practical Psychic, co-authored with Cynthia Pearson, was first published in 1991. His next book was Basic Psychic Development, A User's Guide to Auras, Chakras and Clairvoyance, co-authored with Gloria Hemsher. It was named by Amazon one of the 10 best occult/metaphysical books of 1999. He has been published in six languages. Friedlander is also a graduate of Harvard Law School. Friedlander lives in Saline with his wife, Pamela Moss, who is a professor at the University of Michigan School of Education. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal first interviewed John Friedlander in the fall of 1997. We interviewed him again three years ago as he was turning 60, and that interview can be found at www.crazywisdom.net/interviewpdf/issue39/Catching%20Up%20with%20John%20Friedlander.pdf. You can also learn more about this new book, and about Friedlander and Hemsher, by going to their website: www.psychicdevelopment.cc/.____________________________________________ INTRODUCTION The Dance of Life as an Ecstatic Conversation with Everyday Reality \"Darn, I had thought that being psychic meant you had a voice that gave you all the right answers.\" \u2014A student \"Desire has such a wild ye t subtle creativity that when you engage it with courage and unconditional responsibility , it leads you from the surface of your longing to the depths of meaning.\" In Psychic Psychology we embrace the uniquely personal, joyous, and meaningful events of everyday life and relationships. As humans, we are enticed into the psychological life of everyday life and relationships through our desires, and in psychic psychology we welcome our desires as a divine attraction, neatly and sometimes not so neatly drawing us into all the adventures and lessons of human life. Still, reliable happiness does not come from the fulfillment of desires, it comes from the richness that can only result from real life experience. Everyday life presents us with a dazzling array of subtle and specific interactions that offer spiritual, even mystical, opportunities to develop happiness, kindness , and generosity. Souls incarnate as humans because the sharp focus of space, time, and desire generates experiences, meaning, and understanding that the soul cannot generate by itself in its own higher soul plane. In time and space we enter into conversation with our desires, our own humanity, with others, and with the world. This conversation is ineradicably open-ended. Life constantly surprises us, and whether it delights or disappoints, it always offers back more than we knew or could have known before encountering it. Many excellent systems give psychic/spiritual advice on how to attain your desires. Psychic psychology brings the powers and pleasures of psychic awareness into your life so you can use your ever-growing awareness effectively. In this book we explore and use a system whereby when our desires are congruent and we create the aura space for those desires, we obtain our goals. However, though most of us tend to imagine that great power will inevitably lead to the fulfillment of our desires and therefore to happiness, life is too rich and deep to be tamed or solved by any technique. Like all spiritual/mystical paths, this one involves paradox. Without paradox you could program your life into a computer. You would speak and the world would obey. It's the open-endedness of paradox that generates a never-ending conversation in which you bring newness to the world and it brings newness to you. Two paradoxes in particular are important. The first one we've been alluding to already. Our desires are the passageway to embracing life, but reliable happiness comes from much deeper sources than satisfying our desires. Life is so unstoppably creative and spontaneous that following our desires inevitably takes us in unexpected directions. Author, Psychic and Meditation Teacher John Friedlander will be the Guest Speaker at a Crazy Wisdom Salon on Thursday, September 29th, at 7:00 pm. ______________________________ \"You create your reality but cannot absolutely control it no matter how powerful or aligned you become.\" \"The personality survives and continues to grow into finding its own sublime and unobstructed consciousness. The personality isn't lost in further incarnations, though further incarnations usually happen; nor is the personality gobbled up by the soul.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 45 For example, all of us know that we have longed for things that in retrospect didn't make us happy, or that would have brought pain if we'd gotten that desire; yet most of us think that we now know what will make us really happy. In a way, we are all like adolescents in our desires. An adolescent lacks the experience to even imagine what love is or to understand that it doesn't just drop out of the sky: love develops over the span of years and through the power of committed engagement with ourselves and the loved one. Since by its very nature desire anticipates experience, there is inevitably a naivet\u00e9 and shallowness in our desires compared to the depth of experience and transformation that the pursuit of our desires can bring. In this book we explore powerful means of finding what is authentic and true in our desires, yet even so, it is a good idea to be open to the unexpected directions that desire inevitably takes. The second centrally important paradox is this: you create your reality but cannot absolutely control it no matter how powerful or aligned you become. The external world has a life of its own; when we engage it, it engages us back with spontaneity, creativity, and surprise. Our inability to pin down the external world is part of the very fabric of reality and meaning of existence. Were it otherwise, there would be nothing to be gained by life experience. It would be a puzzle to be solved that would quickly become as predictable as tic tac toe, and as deadly as the life King Midas discovered when he turned everything he touched into gold, even his daughter. Reality's intrinsic uncontrollability is an essential precept of wisdom teachings from ancient Taoism and Buddhism right down to the modern Seth, originator of the phrase \"You create your own reality.\" The price we pay for being in a world we create but do not control is that life inevitably involves an interplay of pleasure and pain. We can learn to engage the dance of pleasure and pain with practical skills like those taught in this book. Such skills allow us to engage the world capably, achieving more of our goals. Still, there is something even more fundamental, more core than competency. All life expands in all directions; everything is ultimately redeemed in an underlying unobstructed and sublime awareness (technically called non-dual awareness). It is the nature of desire to resist change so that we can rest eternally in the pleasure we anticipate such desire will bring, but it is the purpose of desire to engage us in the unceasing change of life expanding in all directions. What is most essential is learning to engage life with a courageous open-heartedness that welcomes unbridled creativity and generates happiness. There are many paths to that open-hearted happiness. The path we explore in this book focuses on skillfully engaging everyday life and relationships through a combination of psychic skills, understanding the big picture, and practical wisdom. Psychic psychology approaches everyday life and relationships through a fun, exciting, and easily learned system of psychic development that is uniquely psychological and relationship-based. But being psychic is not enough by itself to generate life and relationship skills. Thus there are two other equally important aspects of life covered in this book which, when integrated with psychic skills, do reliably generate life and relationship skills, and more fundamentally, do reliably generate happiness. These other two aspects are: 1) the \"big picture,\" or understanding our place in the world and the purpose of desire and life experience itself; and 2) practical wisdom, or the ability to engage complex real-life situations that have no single right answer. Part One of this book explains how to develop psychic abilities that are particularly focused on everyday life and relationships. The psychic skills we each develop can enhance our own psychological well-being. Using these skills we become more self-aware, authentic, kind, and generous, and more understanding of others. Two simple kinds of awareness are the basis from which a rich assortment of psychic skills grows. First you learn to sense psychic energy, something surprisingly easy for most people. In particular, you learn to sense what energy is yours and what energy is another's. It is true that underneath all manifestation there is a fundamental unity, so from that point of view there is just the one energy of All That Is. But within manifestation, that is, within your life as a human, life's purpose is to learn how to engage the utter uniqueness of all the manifested world, particularly that of each human being. As a psychic you can explore your uniqueness by identifying and learning to use the energy that is uniquely yours. That unique energy has an intrinsic directionality, that is, a desire or impulse towards action in your unique authentic direction. When you act skillfully using your own energy, you move and act naturally and spontaneously. Acting naturally and spontaneously out of your intrinsic uniqueness is \"authenticity.\" The second kind of awareness or psychic skill out of which all others emerge is the skill called \"being in current time\" or simply \"current time.\" Ideally, moment by moment, your aura is free to vibrate through the entire range of human actions, emotions, and thoughts and thus respond to whatever you turn your attention to. However, in any given moment there is a tendency for portions of your aura to be stuck in past reactions to life. Where the aura is stuck it vibrates in an unresponsive fixed pattern called a picture. Having stuck pictures in your aura is much like having a muscle with a cramp in it or a guitar string with knots tied in it; the stuckness limits your ability to be open to, active in, and responsive to the present. Your ability to have new experiences is degraded. This book teaches a powerful method for psychically releasing the stuckness so you become more open to the present. Once you learn to recognize your own energy (which generates authenticity) and learn how to free your aura of pictures (which allows you to be open to whatever is happening now), a world of powerful psychic abilities opens up. Part Two of this book explores the big picture: how you create your reality, the purpose of human experience, and how to find happiness. Some traditions address the uncontrollability of the external world by trying to rise above desire. While rising above desire can reliably generate a kind of happiness, we the authors are committed to a path of engaging the world through our humanity and our relationships. Desires particularize experience and trigger the spontaneous creativity and surprise inherent in life. Desire is the way one commits to life. The second part explores what creating your reality means, what you can and cannot do, and where desire fits in. Here is discussed the surprising fact that not only your soul but also your personality is eternal. One needs to look in a usually unexplored psychic direction to see that the personality survives and continues to grow into finding its own sublime and unobstructed consciousness. The personality isn't lost in further incarnations, though further incarnations usually happen; nor is the personality gobbled up by the soul. As illustrated in Chapter 14 through the experience of John's deceased friend Will, a personality grows and powerfully transforms, yet retains what seems most precious and individual. Understanding that the personality continues and grows eternally after this life, and understanding the personality's eternal relationship with the soul, helps us comprehend the sometimes-mysterious complexity of desire. We close Part Two by exploring the nature of happiness\u2014what it is and how to attain it. Part Three delves into practical wisdom, sometimes called know-how. We can use psychic abilities and techniques to help us create the reality we want, but every day moments defy formulation. What do you do when your spouse says you're spending too much money? We explore how to use all you've learned to have a meaningful discussion when neither of you are probably at your best. You're both probably vying to prove your point rather than deeply engaging your own concerns and those of your partner. Practical wisdom is the ability to address the tension inherent in the dance of polarities that underlies all manifestation, even to use that tension as a vital part of the unbridled creativity of all life. Yes, there is an intrinsic underlying harmony to all of the universe, but too many of us try to repress the irrepressible other voice that lies outside our ego self. With practical wisdom we move from trying to repress the external world so that it adds nothing of its own, to engaging the spontaneous creativity of All That Is. Part Three, then, offers practical skills such as: how to relate to and work skillfully with anger, how to integrate the insights of psychology and communication theory with psychic abilities, and how to pursue your goals in ways that enhance your overall clarity, kindness, and generosity. Hindu iconography portrays life as an ecstatic, chaotic dance. The world of psychic psychology takes us directly into a skillful engagement with this dance. Engaging this dance is the most authentic of spiritual journeys. Our spiritual state grows through and is most powerfully reflected in our responses to everyday life\u2014a baby crying, the demands of work, an unexpected promotion, a parent's death, a wedding, heavy traffic, grocery shopping, a baby laughing. If the everyday life of a human weren't deeply meaningful and enriching, we would never incarnate in the first place. The opportunity to know oneself more authentically and more joyfully is present in every breath. Our goal is to engage life with practical wisdom and a sense of adventure, to know that life is a spiritual journey, and to know that each of us (and no other) holds the key to our own happiness. Seeing life as an adventure and staying open through its ups and downs with authenticity, practical wisdom, kindness, and generosity is a reliable way to cultivate happiness. ### \"Life constantly surprises us, and whether it delights or disappoints, it always offers back more than we knew or could have known before encountering it.\" \"Our desires are the passageway to embracing life, but reliable happiness comes from much deeper sources than satisfying our desires.\"\"Everyday life presents us with a dazzling array of subtle and specific interactions that offer spiritual, even mystical, opportunities to develop happiness, kindness, and generosity.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 46 Partner with a Life Coach today!

I know we are all very busy with everyday living, but taking the time to read your pet food labels will help your pets live a long, healthy life. Do a little research on the foods you choose and your pets are likely to benefit. Don't fall for manufacturer's claims, pretty bags, salesperson's pitches, or commercials that show all the \"fresh\" ingredients that go into their food. Since ingredients are listed by weight, the first four or five ingredients are the most important and make up the majority of the food. One of the most important things to remember is to try to feed foods that are \"species appropriate.\" For felines, that would be a grain-free diet. Cats are obligate carnivores and cannot process the grains that are in many foods on the market. So if you feed a dry kibble, keep in mind to always look for a grain-free food with animal proteins listed on the label first. Also, today's kibble is about only nine- or ten-percent moisture content, so always offer lots of fresh water. A good quality canned food might be a better option, with higher water content and high animal proteins. However, there are many healthy alternative foods. Raw food for cats is a growing market. Raw foods closely mimic their natural eating habits in the wild and offer nutrients essential to life, in a more bio-available composition. Our store cat, Pawz, loves his Primal brand raw rabbit! Now for canines, I find that it is more of a mixed bag. Some experts claim \"grain free\" and some say they need some grains. What they are debating is, \"Do dogs need carbohydrates?\" I'm definitely not an expert; however, I don't believe that there is one perfect diet for every dog. I think it's important to try to mimic their natural meat-based, fresh food diet. I do support a raw meat, bone, and vegetable diet for dogs, but realize there may be some financial restraints. My dog, Pepper, is ten and thriving on a raw food diet made by Bravo. If you choose a dog kibble, choose one with animal proteins listed first on the label; make sure it's not heavy on the grains. Don't be afraid to throw in some fresh vegetables here and there, healthy meat scraps, and maybe a high-quality canned food to increase the moisture content of your dog's diet. If you suspect a grain allergy or intolerance, look for a high-quality, grain-free kibble. These tend to be a bit pricier. However, they usually provide more animal proteins, so you don't have to feed as much to get the same nutritional benefits as a kibble with grains. I have seen dogs with many health issues benefit greatly by cutting out grains.Let's not forget about treats! Whether it's for training or \"just because,\" treats are an important aspect of our pet's diet. So make sure they have quality ingredients and look for all meat-based treats that add important nutrients without tons of calories. And who wants to eat the same food everyday for years? Give your pets variety. Don't be afraid to change up their food. Maybe add some fresh foods at home. Some pets need a transition period for switching foods, especially if they have been on the same food for years. Slowly add in a new food over the course of a week. If you have the desire to cook for your pets at home, that's great! Just make sure your pet's nutritional requirements are being met. You may have to add a multi-vitamin, crushed eggshell or bone meal, depending on your recipes. Whatever foods you choose for your pet, here are a few things to remember: You get what you pay for. Cheap foods have cheap ingredients. Stay away from foods that contain: BHT, BHA, Ethoxyquin, propylene glycol, Propyl Gallate, wheat or corn gluten, cellulose (basically dried wood), by-products, and any artificial colorings. Choose foods for their contents, not looks. Nutrition is an important element for our own health, why should it be any different for our pets?

He is the founder and clinical director of the Lotus Center on Carpenter Road.The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Brodie Burris on Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Interviewed by Bill Zirinsky, Photos by Rachael Waring Brodie Burris has now been practicing Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture for about 13 years. A few years ago, he moved his Lotus Center to a building he had purchased on Carpenter Road, and he oversaw a beautiful renovation, replete with fine woodwork and Oriental design motifs. At that time, he invited a host of other healing practitioners to work at the Lotus Center, and the Lotus Center also became a pleasing space for classes and workshops, including ones focused on yoga, breathwork, personal growth, and energy healing. Burris lives on the south side of Ann Arbor with his wife, Amy, and his three children. He is an athlete, massage therapist and martial artist, in addition to being a fine acupuncturist, herbalist and healer. Naturally kinesthetic, he uses his hands gracefully to make a point, and he moves with a certain strength and ease. He is a warm, gentle and reflective man, with a studied irreverence and humor. He has a wonderful style of welcoming his clients, listening to them intently, and encouraging them in their own healing journeys. I met with him on a warm spring evening, and we talked about the world of traditional Chinese healing and medicine, and the contemporary American acupuncture scene. Bill Zirinsky: Brodie, you told me you'd been doing bodywork since you were 10. That's Northern California for you. Where were you raised there, and how is that you started doing bodywork at such a young age? Br odie Burris: Yes, I was born in Sacramento and lived there until high school when we moved to Davis, which is about 45 minutes east of San Francisco. I know it sounds crazy to say that I've been studying bodywork since the age of ten, but it was an integral part of the martial arts tradition I have been involved in since I was very young. My parents say that they were looking for a way to channel my extra energy into something productive, and I expressed an interest in going to Judo at the local YMCA. That began my studies in Kodenkan Dan Zan Ryu Jujitsu, which is a traditional Japanese martial art. Part of our tradition is learning to heal what you have broken, and so we learned first aid, sports injury taping, resuscitation and massage. The style of massage we learned was created by the founder of Dan Zan Ryu, Henry Okazaki, and was thus named Okazaki Restorative Massage. I' ve always loved helping people feel better, and I practiced on everyone I could. During my undergrad studies, I decided to get professionally certified, and completed a program for Swedish massage at the Healing Arts Institute in Roseville, CA. and have been practicing professionally ever since. On a side note, I also completed an additional program in Tui Na, a Chinese Style of massage and joint manipulation, in my Chinese Medicine graduate program. I don't do full body sessions anymore, but I do incorporate massage into most all of my acupuncture treatments. Bill Zirinsky: People who haven't had acupuncture think it might hurt to be punctured with needles. Does it hurt? Do you put needles into your kids? Do they cry? Does acupuncture help them? Brodie Burris: It's quite common for people to be afraid of getting acupuncture because they think it's going to hurt. I won't say that you don't feel anything, but most people who've had acupuncture, will tell you that it's relatively painless. The needles I use are extremely thin (like a fat hair or cat's whisker), at .22 mm in diameter, so often people don't notice them. Occasionally upon insertion, you can catch a sensory nerve at the skin which can produce a stinging sensation, but that typically goes away immediately. As well, when I connect with your body's energy, or \"catch the Qi\" as it is \"Chinese Medicine, like any complete medical system, is like an ocean of knowledge and takes a lifetime to master.\"Photo by Rachael Waring sometimes referred to, people report a dull, heavy, sort of achy experience. Initially acupunctur e can produce a noticeable sensation, but the overall effects are generally surprisingly relaxing and restorative. I do tr eat my children, they usually prefer that I use pressure instead of needles, but they are open to needles if they feel poorly enough. I actually love to treat young people because they often respond the best to treatment. My sense is that their bodies are already changing so rapidly, that it often takes very little to shift them in a positive direction. Bill Zirinsky: Where did you go to college, and where did you get your acupuncture training? Brodie Burris: I went to Albion College to meet Amy, (as she would say) and also for my undergraduate liberal arts degree, with a major in psychology. I actually started out as a physics major, but quickly realized that I liked people far more than numbers. Since people had been confiding in me most of my life, and I felt like I had some innate talent in listening and helping people, I was drawn to psychology. It was after my graduation that I set my sights on a career in Chinese medicine, and I spent the following year taking the pre-med prerequisites needed for entry into the program. My graduate program was at The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in San Francisco - the oldest and one of the most well respected programs in North America. A CTCM was the first school to offer a Master of Science Degree in Chinese Medicine. I truly enjoyed my time spent there both in the class room and in the clinic. The school's low cost clinic in San Francisco provided a wonderful opportunity to study and treat a wide range of conditions and serve many populations including a number of HIV positive patients participating in the Ryan White study. During my four years in San Francisco, my two oldest children, Toben and Maya, were born, and I was able to utilize my new skills during their births to relieve pain during Amy's labor. It was an incredible experience as a partner, father and practitioner. You said to me that \"it took a year of graduate level acupuncture study to feel like my understanding was beginning to crystallize.\" How long was your program, and what was involved? Approximately, how many students entered with you, how many ended with you, and how many didn't complete the program? Burris: Chinese Medicine, like any complete medical system, is like an ocean of knowledge and takes a lifetime to master. It seems like the more I study and learn, the more there is to know. It took a year of grad school before the basic principles began to come together in my head in a coherent way. I think this is largely due to the fact that we were learning an entirely new paradigm, or way of thinking about the world and how things can work. My degree was considered a four year master's degree program, roughly 3000 hours long. We had about 1000 classroom hours in acupuncture, 1000 in herbal medicine, and 1000 in theory, diagnosis, western medicine, and clinical experience. Without question, it was the most rigorous academic experience of my life. Back in '98 when I graduated, it was the most advanced degree you could find in the U.S., but recently they have developed an additional 2000 hour PhD program that is available. My class started off with a little over 40 students. I participated in what could be called the aggressive track, in that we took 20 plus units a quarter, and we maintained that pace year round to complete the program in three years. It was a marathon, and many of our classmates dropped back in the program, so by the end, only 23 of us graduated together. Of those that didn't stay with us, I would say that probably 10 or so dropped out of the program all together. About ho w many acupuncture certification programs are there now, across the U.S., and about how many were there 15 years ago? Burris: According to Google, there are currently over 50 schools in the US. Back when I was looking for a program there were less than 10 that I was aware of. The most widely recognized being: the American College in San Francisco, the Pacific College in San Diego, the Southwest School in Santa Fe, and the New England school in Boston. As Chinese medicine has gained popularity and acceptance as a modality, it has also blossomed as a profession. Y ou're now one of the senior acupuncturists in town, and you know most of the other acupuncturists working in this area. Is it a competitive or collegial group? Are there local or statewide organizations that bring you together? Burris: Over the years I have come to know most of the other acupuncturists in town, and during my time spent as president of our state association (MAAOM), I have also met many of my colleagues in Michigan. The majority of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners I know are kind, compassionate people, which make sense when you consider we have devoted our lives to helping others. The market in Michigan is open enough to provide us with busy practices and relatively low levels of competition, as far as I'm concerned. In fact, it's not uncommon for us to refer to each other when our schedules or a patient's location is an issue. Five years ago, I began working with local acupuncturist Heather Sloan, who has since become one of my closest friends. As you may know, Heather is an amazing practitioner, who has been practicing in the area for years. I feel working together has helped us both in many ways. Over the years, we have had many opportunities to learn from each other and benefit from sharing ideas, discussing difficult cases, and also connecting about similar interests. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 51 \"I think that people often want to fit the Chinese model into an allopathic one so that they can make more sense of it from a perspective which is familiar to them, but I believe that this just creates more confusion.\" Continued on page 52 \"I love treating athletes.

We have a great group of members across the state devoted to providing quality care, expanding public awareness about TCM, and supporting regulatory standards that protect the public. We meet several times throughout the year, which gives all of us the opportunity to connect socially as well as unify our voices politically. Might you be able to briefly give our readers a sense of where acupuncture is, statewide, in terms of accreditation, registration and licensure, and in terms of acupuncture having a voice as a political entity in the statewide health care infrastructure? Can you also tell us about how the acupuncture field is working to maintain standards? Burris: We are currently in an exciting time nationwide, as well as in the state. Acupuncture is enjoying a significant growth in recognition for being a legitimate form of healthcare. We have just completed our efforts to become registered acupuncturists with the state, which protects the title 'acupuncturist'. What that means, is that people must now have a degree from an accredited school, and have passed the national NCCAOM board exams to call themselves acupuncturists. This ensures that the public can be confident that registered acupuncturists are well educated and have demonstrated a minimum level of competency. As well, this is one of the ways we have worked to maintain high standards in our profession, because to keep our national board certification we must complete 60 hours of continuing education every four years. Our next effort will be to become licensed practitioners so that we can have a better chance at getting insurance reimbursement, and have the opportunity to practice autonomously, since we currently have to practice under the supervision of an MD or DO to practice legally. Though the MAAOM is a small organization, and we have only a very small voice in the statewide health care infrastructure, our medicine is gaining recognition and momentum, and I believe it is only a matter of time until it is well integrated into what people think of as a regular part of the health care spectrum, right along with physical therapy and other examples of integrated modalities. Also, I think our readers would find it interesting to get a sense of the differences between California and Michigan in terms of acupuncture practitioners, health insurance, lab requisitions, etc. Burris: Honestly, I have lost touch with the current laws regarding acupuncture in the state of California, but I expect that things are not that much different than when I lived there. A t the time, after I completed the state licensure boards, I would have been a primary care provider. That means that people could come to me as their sole medical provider, and I would have the responsibility not only to treat them with my medicine, but also to recognize when they might need other tools than I have, and refer them to the appropriate specialist. We don't officially have those responsibilities here in Michigan. Since we have to work under the supervision of an MD or DO, all of our patients should already have medical care established for their condition, and we are simply an adjunctive therapy. It is still our responsibility to some extent to direct people to the appropriate care if they need medical intervention we don't provide. One of the other major differences is that in California, nearly all insurance companies would cover acupuncture and even herbal medicine. Here in Michigan, the coverage for this medicine is extremely poor. I don't understand how this works but as an example, it has always confounded me that Blue Cross-Blue Shield in California covers everything I do, but here, won't cover a penny. I just don't understand why they would recognize it as a good investment in one state and not in another. I always encourage our patients to talk to their insurance company to ask that acupuncture be covered, since I believe that consumer demand is one way to change things. (Some auto insurance does cover acupuncture and the same is often true for health savings accounts.) From my vantage point, I see acupuncture flowering. Do you agree that acupuncture is \"coming of age\" in the Ann Arbor region, and if so, why?Burris: I can see what you mean, Bill, there are definitely more and more acupuncturists in the area, and not just in Ann Arbor but all over the state. This medicine is one of the fastest growing alternative modalities out there; in fact, I have heard that there are currently more people in acupuncture school than are practicing. I think this is happening because the mainstream is finally catching up with what many have known for decades, and the Chinese have known for thousands of years. Acupuncture works, and works well. In addition, it is relatively cheap, and very safe. I think that Ann Arbor probably attracts more practitioners than other communities because it's such a fantastic and diverse community - with something for everyone. I really love living here. You said to me that Western medicine has a difficult time understanding how acupuncture works. You spoke of linear versus quantum understandings. Please elaborate. Burris: I suppose I meant that I think acupuncture is hard to understand from a western perspective because I believe that its actions are functioning more like quantum mechanics which are very subtle and difficult to observe as opposed to the cleaner, easier-to-observe actions of Newtonian models --- like ball A hits ball B at a certain angle and velocity to produce a predictable result. Modern medical research, for the most part, still operates in a very linear, reductionistic way, looking to break things down into their parts and examine how the mechanics of their actions work. So they want to be able to observe a meridian, or determine what chemical cascades are being triggered, believing that there is a physical root to the effects of acupuncture. Unfortunately, these examinations produce only limited explanations or require instruments of observation which have sensitivities beyond our current ability to produce. I believe that the actions of acupuncture start at a very subtle energetic layer, which we might compare to the quantum levels of reality, which are very real, but difficult to observe directly. We need a new model of examination which can discern the energetic actions of whole dynamic systems, not just discrete pieces. I know that it's easy for me to say that, and not to say, of course, that the classic scientific approach hasn't served us very well, and it has drastically improved our understanding of the body. It's just that the subtle energetic mechanics of acupuncture don't lend themselves to easy study by that method. I feel a responsibility to mention that I know very little about anything and the fact is, none of us really do. There is a lot of really great work being done out there, like that of my colleague, Dr. Rick Harris, right here at U of M, who is exploring the effects of acupuncture on the receptors in our brain which control pain. This is really great work which advances our understanding of acupuncture's effects on the body. It's just that the subtle question of why acupuncture affects us in this way, and in a host of other seemingly unrelated ways -- that lies beyond our reach. \"If you were to go to see an old Chinese master of acupuncture and begin to tell him why you were there, he would probably tell you to be quiet and show him your tongue, check your pulses, and then know better than you what you need.\" The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Brodie Burris on Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Continued from page 51The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 52 Photo by Rachael WaringWhen you're studying acupuncture, and reading its textbooks, is there an attempt to explain to Western students how the Chinese approach compares and contrasts with the allopathic model, or are they such different paradigms that no such \"compare and contrast\" effort is even made? Burris: The allopathic model and the Chinese model of healthcare are significantly different paradigms, which have little overlap in many ways, yet they are both dealing with the same organism and so there are actually many similarities, especially in the way the functions of the organs are described. In our textbooks and discussions, though, there are not that many examples of a comparing and contrasting effort. I think that people often want to fit the Chinese model into an allopathic one so that they can make more sense of it from a perspective which is familiar to them, but I believe that this just creates more confusion. It's like trying to understand a foreign language by looking for sounds that are similar to one's own language, presuming that they have similar meaning, and then thinking that you understand what they are saying. I think that we really just need to accept that it's completely different and we have to learn the new language altogether if we really want to understand what is being said. Are there medical journals, in English, for acupuncturists and practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine? Do you see cultural bias in studies as to the efficacy of acupuncture, between studies done in China and Asia versus studies done in the U.S. and Europe? Burris: Yes, there are a few professional journals like Acupuncture Today and The American Acupuncturist which I get and usually find to be interesting to read. As far as a cultural bias in studies of acupuncture, I am fairly certain that there is an inescapable bias that runs through literally all research, in which people look to find what they expect to find, and often succeed! I presume that studies of acupuncture are no different. I read an article on this topic, and in it they talked about the different findings of studies done on acupuncture in different countries. Not surprisingly, studies done throughout Asia, where the practice has been completely accepted by the culture, demonstrated higher levels of success than those done in Europe and America, where the culture expects that there won't be a good effect. None of the studies showed it to be ineffective; there just was greater statistical significance to the data in Asia. I think it is to be expected to find differences like this, and does not ultimately detract from the value of the studies in either culture. You called acupuncture a \"complete medicine\". What do you mean by that? Burris: I might have meant to say Chinese Medicine, which also includes herbs, limited surgical procedures, and physical medicine similar to chiropractic or osteopathic adjustments and PT. I called it that because it functions as a whole system, a \"complete\" system of healthcare that can and does address all the needs of the population. It needed to do this since it was nearly the exclusive medicine of most of Asia for the last few thousand years. Most people think of using acupuncture to treat pain, and it is certainly great for that, but it is also very effective at addressing respiratory conditions, digestive disorders, gynecological issues, mental and emotional challenges, and a host of other conditions. You can go to my website for a more thorough discussion of the different conditions treated at TLCAA.COM if you like. What kinds of ailments do you treat most often? Burris: Far and away I treat various pain conditions the most, with back pain of any sort being the number one condition I address. I want to emphasize that this is not because I love to treat back pain and want to specialize in it. I believe this is simply the result of limited public awareness of what you can go to the acupuncturist for. Most people have heard of acupuncture for back pain and so that is what they think of when they think about what acupuncture is good for. Like I've said, I treat mostly pain of any kind, but I see a lot of people for fertility, digestive issues, and stress or emotional distress like anxiety or depression. Frankly, I'll do my best to treat anything, and think of myself as a general practitioner. You told me that you've \"gotten very good at treating pain, any kind of pain.\" Tell us more. Burris: As I mentioned before, most people come to me with some sort of pain condition. From arthritis to chronic migraines, fibromyalgia to sports injuries, I treat it all. I guess if you do anything long enough you get pretty good at it, and so I suppose it's fair to say I've gotten pretty good at treating pain. Acupuncture just works, I don't actually even understand exactly how, I just know how to use it, and I keep learning more and more tricks and tools over the years to put in my bag. You are/were an athlete. You work with a lot of athletes and professional teams. Tell us about that. Burris: I love treating athletes. Almost without fail I get great results with any kind of sports injury. I can significantly reduce pain and inflammation, and improve circulation to an area, speeding recovery. I attribute a fair bit of that success to the fact that most athletes are young, generally healthy people who have great Qi and vitality to work with. Back in grad school, I studied with a gentlemen, who at the time was the acupuncturist for the 49ers, and he claimed then, and I've seen it bear out, that we can nearly cut the recovery time for sports injuries in half compared to standard treatment of rest, ice and ibuprofen. Not that we shouldn't use those tools, but we can actually accelerate recovery with acupuncture and herbs. I want to be clear, of course, that I think that sports taping, massage and PT are very important and valuable therapies, which I think have a great synergistic effect with acupuncture. Can acupuncture be effective with elderly people with an accumulation of medical challenges, and an array of prescription medicines they have to take? Burris: Yes, I do have good results with elderly people. Unfortunately, though, it typically is considerably more difficult to see rapid and dramatic effects in this situation. As anyone who survives long enough will tell you, growing old is not for sissies, and we just don't have the resilience we once did to bounce back from adversity as quickly and easily. Anytime someone comes in with multiple challenges, and a cocktail of medications, it is going to be more difficult to sort out what's going on and what they need most to find their way back to health. As well, as we age, our vitality and energy also tend to wane as a natural result of life's wear and tear. These factors make it more challenging to address the health concerns of my elderly patients, but with time and persistence we can get very satisfying results. In China, acupuncturists had a role to keep their communities healthy. Please tell us about that, and talk about \"acupuncture as a form of maintenance\". Burris: I'm not sure how things are these days, but it is my understanding that many years ago, it was the role of the doctor in China to keep the community of his patients healthy. To an extent, they would be my responsibility, and if they were to fall ill, it would be considered a failure on my part. If you were the physician to the emperor, your life may in fact be on the line. We maintain people's health by being able to identify subtle imbalances that are arising in our patients, before they get so severe that they develop into symptoms. We recognize these imbalances through the use of the traditional diagnostic tools of observing our patients, examining their tongues and evaluating their pulses. The doctor's job was to regularly examine his patient population to evaluate their health and \"tune them up\" if you will. In this way, traditional Chinese medicine is a truly preventative medicine. \"Acupuncture's highest use is to augment health,\" you have said. And also you've said it's cumulative. I'd like to hear more. Burris: Following the line of prevention that I was just talking about, it is considered the highest use of the medicine to maintain health as opposed to waiting for people to get sick and then try to fix them. When problems are small, they are easy to remedy. When they have developed and grown, they are much more difficult to resolve. I really believe that there is a difference between being free of symptoms, and true, vibrant health. I have a number of patients who come in about once a month, feeling good, and use acupuncture to help them stay that way. I know it is difficult to say how they would be feeling otherwise, if they weren't getting acupuncture. But, here's an example: I have a woman who I have seen for years who used to get sick 4-5 times a year, and since getting regular, occasional treatments hasn't been sick since. I also have a few athletes who use acupuncture to enhance their sports performance. The Chinese Olympic teams certainly use acupuncture in this way. As far as being cumulative, I mean that much like many medicines that we use, the effects of acupuncture build on previous treatments. If you are maintaining health you only need occasional treatments to accomplish this, but if you want to address an acute problem in an effective way, you need to treat people more frequently, maybe 2-3 times a week, so that the treatments build on each other and deliver satisfying results. We can see The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 53 Continued on page 54 \"One of the other major differences is that in California, nearly all insurance companies would cover acupuncture and even herbal medicine.\"similar effects with other medicines; take antibiotics for example. If someone had an infection, and only took one pill a week, they would think that the medicine was useless, that's because the effective dosage for antibiotics is three treatments a day for a week to ten days. You were trained, also, as a massage therapist? How do you integrate that into your work with people, and in what ways has it influenced your view of health and well-being? Burris: I integrate massage at least to a certain extent into most of my acupuncture treatments. For people who have pain, I will often massage the affected area to help relax the muscles and open up the joints. Otherwise, I often do a little massage to help people relax and settle into the treatment. The greatest impact that my massage training and experience has had on my practice is through creating an intimate understanding of anatomy and how the tissues should feel. I can pretty quickly identify muscular and structural disruption and tension through my sense of touch. I think without question that it has made me a better acupuncturist. I suppose it has influenced my view of health and well-being, in that I think that relaxed, supple tissues are really important to optimal health. On that note, Chinese medicine would say that soft, flexible musculature is synonymous with youth and vibrant well-being, and that stiffness and rigidity are indicative of aging and ill health; the examples being babies on one end of the spectrum, and rigamortis on the other. You have been a martial artist since the age of five. How does your interest in the martial arts dance with your work as an acupuncturist? Burris: I have been trained in a traditional Japanese style of Ju-Jitsu. My martial arts experience has undoubtedly shaped my life. For as long as I can remember I have held a fascination with the traditional Japanese culture and philosophies, and in the last two decades, the Chinese as well. The training in the martial arts also has internal cultivation of the qi known as qigong, as a component, which it so happens is something that, in my opinion, is a necessary part of cultivating oneself to become a master of acupuncture. How does acupuncture \"move a person\" --- I have seen you mimic a martial arts motion when you've said this. Burris: Well, I suppose I meant that it moves and unblocks the energy within a person. This can have not just physical but also mental and emotional effects on an individual, moving them in their lives, if you will. I guess I mimicked a martial arts movement as I said this because I talk with my hands a lot. How do you become an expert in pulse and tongue diagnosis? Burris: Honestly, the only way to become an expert in tongue and pulse diagnosis is to have some excellent teachers, and about 20 years of experience feeling pulses and looking at tongues. They say you need to do something about 10,000 times before you can consider yourself good at it. I agree. What does tongue diagnosis help you to understand about the person and his/her health? Burris: The tongue tells me a lot about the general state of a person's tissues and their blood. Different areas of the tongue relate to different organ systems and so different things happening like cracks, the color, the coating, etc. which in turn tells me information about the state of a person's organs. What does pulse diagnosis help you to understand about the person and her/his health? Burris: The pulse also tells me a lot about a person. It is said to reveal more about the state of the qi or the energy of the organs. There are three positions on each wrist that we check and each of the positions relates to a different organ system. I am not concerned so much about the rate as I am with the quality of the pulses at each position. For example, whether a person's pulse is weak or strong, will give me the basic information about the strength of the organ. There are many, many different qualities that a practitioner might notice, all with different implications. A master of the pulses can gather a considerable amount of information about your current well-being and your history as well. What is hara diagnosis? Burris: Hara diagnosis is the examination of the belly, and is, I think it's fair to say, more of a traditional Japanese tool. Tender spots or differences in the tissues upon palpation have implications for each of the organs, depending on where in the belly they are found. What else do you look at, when working with a patient? Burris: We try to take in the whole person, using all of our senses to notice what is going on in the patient sitting across from us. We examine the skin, hair, eyes, timbre of the voice, quality of the nails, smell, gait, posture, etc. The human being is a mysterious wonder, and figuring out what is happening inside requires gathering as much information as possible. Everything has significance if you pay attention, and all that information comes together to generate a picture which helps us decide upon a course of action. You said to me, \"If it's internal, I need to check your pulse.\" Please explain. Burris: By that I meant that in clinical practice I don't need to check your pulse and tongue if I'm treating a musculoskeletal issue like pain; that is, unless your condition isn't responding well and I need to check to see if there are underlying constitutional issues which are affecting the condition. Otherwise, I would check your pulses and tongue to treat any disorder which is likely resulting from internal imbalance like respiratory, digestive, and gynecological issues, etc. Does a person's story matter, when you are treating that person constitutionally? Burris: A somewhat amusing anecdote about this is that if you were to go to see an old Chinese master of acupuncture and begin to tell him why you were there, he would probably tell you to be quiet and show him your tongue, check your pulses, and then know better than you what you need. In our culture, we like to talk and be heard. I do my best to listen carefully to my patients, and I feel that it is an important part of the healing relationship. I want to get to know my patients, understand what's going on in their lives, their feelings, what makes them who they are, but I don't necessarily have to have that information to know what they need as far as their organ imbalances. When I treat people, I always want to make what they came in for is a priority, but I am also interested in their whole health as a being. If you came for shoulder pain, I would certainly focus on eliminating it, but I would also address your constitutional health, maybe things that you didn't even know were an issue, because as I like to say, \"You're not just a shoulder to me.\" You said to me that \"if you're doing acupuncture well, you're really soaking in the person.\" My sense is that you're doing it well, Burris: I know that I am trying my best, and that's about all I can hope to do. The Lotus Center that you and your wife, Amy, have created is thriving. You've got other fine practitioners here, classes and workshops taking place, a beautifully renovated space, and great woodwork, too. What do you love about your work, and what are you most grateful for? Burris: I really love the opportunity to help people. There is little which is more satisfying than to make a positive impact in someone else's life. I love working in our new space with the incredible team of talented practitioners that we have working here. I am so grateful to have discovered my passion and have the chance to live it. I try to make it a practice to be grateful for even the smallest blessings in my life, and when I do, I see they are plentiful. I am most grateful to my wonderful wife, Amy, without whom I couldn't hope to do anything as well as I do. She's been an integral part of the success of my private practice, and supported my dream of the Center by taking on the administrative side of our business, allowing me to focus primarily on helping others. We work really well together, and the center has provided us both with careers we love and lots of time for family and friends. Ho w many kids do you have, boys or girls, what ages? Burris: I have three children. Toben, my oldest son, is 15, my daughter, Maya, is 13, and my youngest son, Cameron, is 10. I am deeply grateful for them and the privilege to participate in their lives daily. They are amazing people with so much to offer the world, and continue to teach and remind me about what life is really all about. ###The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Brodie Burris on Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Continued from page 53 \"We maintain people's health by being able to identify subtle imbalances that are arising in our patients, before they get so severe that they develop into symptoms.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 54The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 55 Questions for Dr. Shan Kong, Eighth Generation Acupuncturist Dr. Kong Shares her Extraordinary Journey from Growing Up During the Cultural Revolution to Launching a Successful Career and Practice in Ann Arbor Interviewed by Maureen McMahon Dr. Shan Kong, O.M.D., is a physician of Chinese medicine and a nationally certified acupuncturist with over 30 years of clinical experience. I visited her at her private practice within The Acupuncture & Chinese Medical Center on the south side of Ann Arbor. With openness and kindness she discussed her remarkable personal journey, her successful career as a physician in China and America, and her views on the future of acupuncture in Ann Arbor. Maureen McMahon: Dr. Kong, you are an eighth generation healer, born and raised in China. I'm curious to know more about that family history. Was acupuncture always a focus? And have there been both female and male healers in your lineage? Where and when did your training begin? Dr. Shan Kong: I come from a medical family with a very serious tradition of practicing acupuncture and Chinese medicine, so acupuncture is deeply ingrained in my earliest memories. Growing up, I was constantly surrounded by lively discussions of medical theory and practice. However, for the past seven generations, the passing on of ancestral knowledge and skill of acupuncture and Chinese medicine was done from father to son; the daughters of the family were generally excluded. But my father discovered that whenever he'd given a talk on acupuncture, I could commit the entire lesson to memory and recite it effortlessly. He decided it's time to break the family tradition and began to train me. That's how I started my training at the age of five, in Harbin, China. Maureen McMahon: You were a teenager when the anti-intellectual Cultural Revolution took place in China (1966-1976). Coming from a family of physicians and intellectuals, how did this affect your family? Were you sent to a rural area to do farm work? How did you keep up your training as a Chinese medicine practitioner? Dr. Kong: My father was an extraordinarily well known and well respected doctor in the medical field, so during the Cultural Revolution, a time of \"anti- intellectualism,\" he was labeled as a \"reactionary medical authoritarian\" and persecuted to death. In 1968, at the age of seventeen, after I had graduated from high school, I was forcibly sent down to the countryside to do hard labor. Life was arduous and difficult; people weren't given sufficient medical attention and treatment; drugs and necessary medical equipments were lacking. Incidentally, the old farmer, whose house I was residing in at the time, was suffering from a large boil on his buttock. I cured his problem with acupuncture. Subsequently, several other patients who received treatment from me also healed quickly. The local government especially built a clinic for me to provide acupuncture and Chinese medicine for the residents of the area. So, I began to practice at the age of 17. MM: You mentioned that when you returned home, despite the disruption in your education caused by the Cultural Revolution, you took a national exam to prove your medical knowledge and placed first in Heilongjiang Province, population 38 million. Can you explain this more? Dr. Kong: I returned to the city in 1970, when I was 19. The two years I had spent practicing gave me a good reputation, and the result of my practice was seen as quite an outstanding achievement by the provincial government, so I was invited by the Harbin Medical Health Bureau to teach acupuncture to western medical doctors, in addition to practicing acupuncture at Harbin's Sixth Hospital. Because of the 10-year disruption caused by the Cultural Revolution, the economic, educational, and medical institutions suffered severe setbacks and were on the verge of collapse. To salvage the damages inflicted upon the national medical institution, the Central State Council, in 1978, issued a national examination to excavate the best and brightest Chinese medicine and acupuncture practitioners. This was done to strengthen important national medical research and education departments. I was 27 at the time of the examination. I placed first in Heilongjiang Province, and was promoted to Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Medical Sciences - the highest medical science research institution in the province. MM: That is amazing. Your description of a rebuilding an institution as excavation from within a collapsing structure is so vivid. What were some of the other highlights of your career in China? Dr. Shan Kong, Acupuncturist and Physician of Chinese Medicine, first began working at her own clinic at the age of 17, during the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution in China. Having relocated to Ann Arbor, she now runs her own practice at The Acupuncture & Chinese Medical Center. Continued on page 56 Photo by Rachael Waring Dr. Kong: I published 5 medical textbooks as well as over 20 well cited articles in medical journals. In 1978, I was awarded \"The Most Distinguished Physician\" - a rare honor given by the Harbin Medical Health Bureau, the highest medical management institution of Harbin, a city of 9.8 million population. MM: You had to give up a great deal to move to a new country, to the United States. What motivated you to do that? Dr. Kong: It is true what they say about America being a land of freedom. I came here, like many other immigrants before me, to seek to a better life and more opportunities. MM: Did you leave important family members behind in China? Dr. Kong: I do have some family members in China, many of whom are successful doctors. MM: What do you most miss about your life in China?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 56 Questions for Dr. Shan Kong, Eighth Generation Acupuncturist Dr. Kong: The thing that I miss the most about China is the food. I love traditional Chinese cuisine. MM: Why did you decide to live in Ann Arbor? What do you most appreciate about life in Michigan and in the United States? Dr. Kong: I have a friend living in Ann Arbor. I enjoy being close to nature and the beautiful environment in Michigan is very suitable for me. MM: Well, you chose a great place to contribute your talents. You mentioned in your practice you treat all ailments, with specialties in pain, insomnia, facial rejuvenation, and in particular, digestive disease and infertility. Over the years you've helped many families facing infertility challenges, treating both men and women, and you showed me some wonderful photos of the babies you helped bring into the world. In 2009, you published the results of a 4-year study you conducted on acupuncture as an adjunct to in vitro fertilization (IVF). What were the main results of your study? Dr. Kong: The integration of a special acupuncture technique I had used to help my patients undergoing IVF treatment obtains a remarkable 81.8% success rate. That doubles the national average IVF success rate without acupuncture. MM: That is remarkable - and certainly welcome news for many families who weren't aware of these connections. As a doctor trained in Chinese medicine, you have a vast knowledge of Chinese herbs and their applications. While more Americans are opening up to the use of Chinese herbs, many are concerned about the quality of the Chinese herbs available on the market. Is this a valid concern and how do you source your herbs to ensure their quality? Dr. Kong: Generally speaking, Chinese herbs come from naturally grown plants that are safe and reliable. The herbs I use are ordered from American pharmaceutical companies. MM: Now that you have been practicing here for a while, first at Bio Energy Medical Center, and now in your own practice, have you found there to be a difference between American clientele and Chinese clientele? What are your thoughts about the future of acupuncture in Ann Arbor? Dr. Kong: In terms of the acceptance and understanding of acupuncture, there is virtually no difference between my American and Chinese patients. And I think the future of acupuncture is very bright for Ann Arbor. I'm very hopeful. MM: What has been most challenging about creating your new life in America and starting a practice here? Dr. Kong: Many of my patients don't have insurance policies that cover acupuncture treatment. This is very difficult for them financially. I would very much like to see that changed soon. MM: You mentioned your patient base mostly comes from physician referrals and word of mouth, and that The Acupuncture & Chinese Medical Center has a referral incentive that's helped you connect with patients. What's that incentive? Dr. Kong: If you refer a friend who sees me twice or more, you can receive a free acupuncture visit. And if your friend comes for a single visit, then you can receive a $30 discount. MM: That's great. Finally, Dr. Kong, your daughter and son, who lived in Ann Arbor as teenagers, have become the ninth generation of healers in your lineage. Have your children studied with you? What and where are they studying now? Dr. Kong: When they were both very young, I started to teach acupuncture to my son and daughter. My daughter completed her medical school training and is now undergoing her clinical rotations in New York. My son is studying Chinese medicine and acupuncture at a medical university in California. They'll both graduate next year. MM: Again, truly remarkable. Thank you and best of luck to them both. ### Dr. Shan Kong, O.M.D., practices at The Acupuncture & Chinese Medical Center, 4343 Concourse Drive, Suite 110, Ann Arbor, MI 48108.

I caught up with him at his private practice within The Acupuncture & Chinese Medical Center on the south side of Ann Arbor. He introduced me to his son, a law student at University of Michigan, and together we chatted about his background, some of the treatment outcomes he's been most excited about, and acupuncture coming of age in Ann Arbor. Maureen McMahon: Dr. Kong, you come from a family of healers. Where and when did your training begin and where were you formally educated? Dr. Qingchun Kong: I began my training in acupuncture as a child under the guidance of my parents who were well-respected physicians and prestigious medical university professors. I later received formal education in Chinese medicine and preventive medicine from Harbin Medical University and Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Maureen McMahon: Before you arrived to the US in 1999, you had a very successful career in China as a physician of Chinese medicine and acupuncture and even authored five textbooks. What brought you to the US, in particular to Ann Arbor? Dr. Kong: I received an invitation from a practicing MD here in Ann Arbor. To come to the US seemed a great opportunity to help people who are not traditionally exposed to Chinese medicine. MM: Did you leave behind important family members? Are you homesick sometimes? Dr. Kong: Yes, many members of my family are still in China. Some are professors, some are in business, and many are also physicians. I miss my friends and family and I have been back to China many times. MM: In your acupuncture practice, your specialties are broad, including pain, respiratory issues, mental and emotional problems, neurological and muscle disorders, reproductive and gynecological issues, and digestive problems. During our chat you were very enthusiastic about recent successes in treating complex health issues like Bell's Palsy and the autoimmune disorder Lupus. How does acupuncture provide treatment benefits in these complicated cases? Dr. Kong: Basically facial paralysis occurs when the facial muscles of one side become suddenly weak or paralyzed and the facial nerves of one side are damaged and unable to function. Under Oriental Medical theory, this disorder is ascribed to an obstruction disrupting the flow of circulation caused by pathogens invading the channels traversing the face. These obstructions prevent the vessels and muscles from receiving the necessary nourishment. Acupuncture needles can unblock the obstructions at the dams, and reestablish the regular flow through the meridians. Acupuncture thus helps to correct imbalances in the facial energy and circulation. Acupuncture treats autoimmune diseases by reducing inflammation, alleviating pain, improving energy and vitality, and addressing the wide variety of symptoms that occur. Acupuncture reduces the damage of the membranes, tissues, and organs caused by an overactive immune response. It treats the root of the disease by putting the immune system back into balance.MM: You also mentioned treating many cancer patients, the majority combining Western and Eastern medical approaches. How can acupuncture benefit cancer patients? Dr. Kong: While Western treatment may help cancer patients, the treatments are aggressive and cause numerous unwanted side effects, as well as a lowered immune system. Acupuncture has received much attention as an adjunctive therapy in cancer treatments for its use in pain relief, reducing side effects, accelerating recovery and improving quality of life. Acupuncture addresses many of the concerns that come up during and after chemotherapy, radiation, biological therapy and surgery. It improves immune function - these are the cells that ultimately destroy cancer cells. It improves liver function, which helps lower the overall toxicity level. Acupuncture can also reduce nausea and vomiting, improving pain, weight loss, anxiety, depression, fever, and other symptoms caused by cancer treatment. MM: While it is commonplace for physicians to refer patients to you, you've noted that more MDs are also becoming your patients. Do you think there is a shift in thinking about acupuncture in the American medical community? Dr. Kong: Absolutely. When I first began my practice in the states, many of the patients seeking treatments were referred to me by Medical Doctors who had run out of medical options for their patients. These patients range from those who suffered from rare and tenacious diseases to those whose symptoms masked their underlying problems. After I'd helped them, they'd report the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment to their respective Medical Doctors, who then themselves sought treatment from me. The growing acceptance of acupuncture by Medical Doctors and the increase in research appearing in scientific literature on the effectiveness of acupuncture is shaping public opinion about the benefits of acupuncture. Dr. Qingchun Kong, Acupuncturist and Physician of Chinese Medicine at The Acupuncture & Chinese Medical Center , has over 26 years of clinical experience, specializing in preventive medicine and treating complex diseases and disorders. Continued on page 58 \"Acupuncture has received much attention as an adjunctive therapy in cancer treatments for its use in pain relief, reducing side effects, accelerating recovery and improving quality of life.\" Photo by Rachael WaringMM: How do you feel about the future of acupuncture in Ann Arbor? Dr. Kong: I'm very optimistic about the future of acupuncture in Ann Arbor. That being said, currently there are many patients who'd greatly benefit from acupuncture treatment but cannot receive it because of their lack of healthcare coverage or because their insurance policy does not pay for acupuncture visits. This means there's still a lot of work ahead of us in terms of educating the public about acupuncture as a scientifically legitimate treatment, dispelling the myths and misconceptions about acupuncture (e.g., that it hurts when it doesn't) , and ultimately changing the current discriminatory insurance policies that prevent patients from receiving necessary treatment. MM: You share offices with Dr. Shan Kong at The Acupuncture & Chinese Medical Center, though there's no relation. Did you know each other in China? Dr. Kong: Yes, we met while both presenting at a medical conference. MM: What do you like most about life in this country? Would you say you're \"happy\" or \"content\" here in the United States, or just \"getting by\" or somewhere in between? Dr. Kong: I'm very happy with my life here. I love the people here in Ann Arbor; they are friendly, well educated, and extremely down-to-earth.MM: In what town do you live? In Ann Arbor? Dr. Kong: Ann Arbor. MM: What do you most like to do for fun and recreation?Dr. Kong: I like to play Ping Pong and being in a choir. MM: That's great.

I met with her in the tearoom of the Body, Mind, Spirit Wellness Center , where she regularly sees patients and hosts The Peaceful Happy Hour, a community circle of auricular (ear) acupuncture held every second Friday of the month. Ellen is affable and charismatic, and we easily fell into conversation, her beginning with how she left a career in IT after 14 years to follow her interest in acupuncture. Maureen McMahon: Ellen, you used to be a systems analyst and now you're practicing acupuncture full time. How did you first become exposed to acupuncture? Ellen Porter: As a patient. I had injured my lower back and found relief with acupuncture. I also noticed I stopped getting headaches and had less frequent colds. Then I needed some emotional/spiritual support through my mother's illness and death. I was surprised to find that support from my 5 Element Acupuncturist. She introduced me to the Tai Sophia Institute. I realized it was the \"second career\" I had been looking for - to be able to tend and support those in pain - Body, Mind or Spirit - all through acupuncture. It called together my interests in nature, preventative healthcare, systems analysis and teaching. Maureen McMahon: Yes, you mentioned the Tai Sophia Institute in Maryland is the nation's oldest accredited school for acupuncture and is where you were trained in the 5 Element approach. What is 5 Element Acupuncture? Ellen Porter: 5 Element Acupuncture is a traditional Asian cosmology organizing life into the basic elements of nature: Water, Wood, Fire, Earth and Metal. Each element has energetic properties that sustain life and help it thrive. As part of nature, we embody these energetic properties, too. Any of the elements can get out of balance, creating struggles, pain and symptoms. An easy example this year would be a Water imbalance! In nature we have boggy soil and overflowing rivers. In our bodies a Water imbalance may show as edema, runny nose, sinus headache, fear, or exhaustion. Our bodies have a natural language to inform us of our imbalances, which we call \"symptoms\" or often \"pain.\" My job as a 5 Element Acupuncturist is to find each unique person's root cause or elemental imbalance to help heal the person at all levels - body, mind and emotion/spirit - to prevent any further progression of disease. MM: These days you teach introductory classes on Chinese meridian theory and also teach related topics at Washtenaw Community College, though you began your acupuncture teaching experience at the Tai Sophia student clinic in Baltimore. You mentioned it was there that you deepened your expertise with reading pulses for diagnosis, adding, \"Pulse reading is a lifelong journey of acuity.\" Can you explain that process a little bit and also comment on reading tongues for diagnosis? Ellen Porter: Pulse reading is a fascinating diagnostic tool. I listen with my fingers to three places along each wrist to \"hear\" 12 different pulses and their different qualities. We are familiar with having our pulse rate checked by doctors. The rate is just one of many qualities. I listen for the condition of the whole body - organs, blood, energy, etc. Pulse reading gives remarkably accurate and timely feedback as to a person's wellbeing. Tongue diagnosis is also a wonderful tool. Our condition of health shows on the tongue, our most accessible \"internal organ.\" I can read the health of the different organ systems on the tongue. I tell my patients to \"get to know your tongue\" by looking at it in the mirror. We can see our tongues improve as we heal. MM: Yes, absolutely. As someone having a first experience with acupuncture, I definitely found the pulse and tongue diagnostic process fascinating. I couldn't help but compare it to the time and technology western diagnostics take. It was really eye opening for me. What are some of your specialties? What kinds of cases have you found most satisfying to treat? Ellen Porter: I see and treat each person as the unique being they are with fascinating life stories of challenge and triumph. My heart goes out especially to those going through life's transitions. Life is full of change and transition. The question is, how smoothly do we dance through these changes? Whether its adolescence, new job, new parent, menopause, retirement, etc., all have their inherent wobbles. Acupuncture is helpful to sustain or regain our balance at these times in life. Without it, symptoms show up or return, or we start making excuses for feeling \"stressed\" or \"getting old,\" etc. Often people have a chief complaint I call their \"admission ticket\" to see the acupuncturist. I find it rewarding to be able to support and heal them at a much deeper, constitutional level that they did not realize was possible. I am rewarded when I hear remarks such as, \"I feel like my old self again.\" I am currently treating several wonderful people who are challenged with Type II Diabetes. This condition can be overwhelming. It is a joy to be able to help them live long, healthy lives. MM: Have you treated any professionals trained in Western medicine? Do you think there is a shift in thinking about acupuncture in the American medical community? Ellen Porter practices 5 Element Acupuncture through her business, AcuThrive, and hosts The Peaceful Happy Hour at the Body, Mind, Spirit Wellness Center in Ann Arbor. \"Often people have a chief complaint I call their \"admission ticket\" to see the acupuncturist. I find it rewarding to be able to support and heal them at a much deeper, constitutional level that they did not realize was possible.\" Photo by Rachael WaringEllen Porter: Yes. I have both treated Western trained medical professionals as well as patients referred by their doctors. Patients tell me of their surprise that their doctors are enthusiastic about them seeing an acupuncturist, too. Just as I will recommend my patients continue to see or find a good Western trained doctor, the medical professionals are making similar recommendations to their patients to see an acupuncturist, too. Acupuncture is a safe and effective medical treatment for many issues. No one modality can cure all. And together, Western, holistic, and complimentary approaches to healthcare bring the most ease to the most people. MM: Why did you choose to base AcuThrive Acupuncture in Ann Arbor? Ellen Porter: I chose Ann Arbor for personal and professional reasons. My family originated on the East Coast and is primarily in the Midwest now. I wanted to move my practice to be closer to my family. I had visited family in Ann Arbor for many years prior to moving my practice here and have always enjoyed the town's atmosphere. Ann Arbor is a location that has always welcomed complimentary healing modalities, including acupuncture. I knew it would be a good fit for my AcuThrive Acupuncture practice. I wanted to serve those in Ann Arbor and surrounding communities who appreciate acupuncture and all it has to offer. MM: You mentioned several acupuncturists in town were also launching businesses when you relocated here 3 years ago. Do you think acupuncture has come of age in Ann Arbor? Where do you see it headed? Ellen Porter: I think we all realized Ann Arbor was a wonderful location that was being underserved. I knew that Ann Arbor would welcome acupuncture, and as an acupuncturist I knew I could help serve the community. I am frequently honored by the commitment my patients show to their healing by coming routinely, some traveling many miles, to receive acupuncture. They know Ann Arbor is the place to go for superior healthcare and I'm proud to be a part of that! \"My job as a 5 Element Acupuncturist is to find each unique person's root cause or elemental imbalance to help heal the person at all levels - body, mind and emotion/spirit - to prevent any further progression of disease.\" I envision acupuncture in Ann Arbor continuing to grow as more people come to understand what they can gain from treatment. We have had a new growth of acupuncture practitioners and I hope it continues to grow. I envision more centers with both Western and Eastern medicine in the same location so that patients can conveniently get the treatment most helpful to them. MM: It's been great meeting you, Ellen. Thank you. ### Ellen Porter, M.Ac., L.Ac., Dipl.Ac.

This is acupuncturist Carey Ryan's most potent medium. It's in her eyes, her treatment rooms, and in her touch. Entering the lobby of her healing space at the Center for Sacred Living (co-owned by Carey, Tiffany Mazurek, and Dr. Robert Koliner) is like stepping into a warm, soft nest. The walls are the color of baked red clay and sun-warmed adobe, and the counter, doors, and trim are all honey-colored wood. A large, comfy couch with peachy silk pillows beckons on the left, across from two burnished leather chairs. A purified water dispenser and a small table with tea, \u00fcber-healthy snack bars, and reading material on alternative health topics stand next to the couch. This comforting ambiance is highlighted when Carey, a lithe, pixie-like gal with short, wavy brown hair, fair skin, and bright blue eyes, welcomes you with her radiant smile, appearing genuinely happy to see you. Carey has a sweet clarity to her that sparkles with joy, but make no mistake: she's no lightweight. She is thoroughly grounded in the rigorous training she received from the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in Chicago, Illinois. She earned her Master's of Science in Traditional Oriental Medicine (MSTOM). For those of you who think that acupuncturist training is akin to taking a couple of weekend workshops, reading a few books, and then practicing on voodoo dolls ... think again. Carey's curriculum included 3,000-plus hours of academic training; 705 hours of Oriental medical theory, diagnosis, and treatment techniques in acupuncture, herbal medicine, and related studies; 450 hours of biomedical training; and 660-plus hours of clinical training. The clinical training included a full-year clinical internship treating patients with acupuncture and herbal medicine in the school clinic. In other words, it is a full-time, four-year master's program. This is not to mention the nine-hour round-trip commute Carey made weekly from Ann Arbor to Chicago and back for four years. When asked what it took for her to complete her training, Carey said, \"A lot of work, a steel will, and the grace of God.\" Her training is certainly being put to good use. Not only is Carey co-owner of the Center for Sacred Living and busy running her private practice in Ann Arbor, but she is also on staff, yes, on staff , at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. Who knew that a Michigan hospital has an acupuncture clinic? In fact, Beaumont has the largest Integrative Medicine Department of any hospital in the Metro Detroit area. They offer naturopathy, massage, craniosacral therapy, Reiki, and guided imagery, as well as acupuncture. The acupuncture clinic at Beaumont has six acupuncturists trained in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), overseen by Brenda Donaldson, M.D. Dr. Donaldson was hired to develop the acupuncture program at Beaumont in 2006 and the program has grown exponentially since that time, due to patient demand. Currently, Beaumont is offering acupuncture six days a week in three different locations, including the Troy and Royal Oak campuses of the hospital. Dr. Donaldson is a medical acupuncturist who practices a neurofunctional, scientifically based approach called Contemporary Acupuncture. She encourages her staff of TCM acupuncturists to also study Contemporary Acupuncture, believing that a scientific understanding can greatly enhance the traditional approach. Contemporary Acupuncture was developed by Dr. Alejandro Elorriagia Claraco at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, where Dr. Donaldson studied and now also instructs. Dr. Claraco is internationally renowned for his pioneering clinical research in the field of neurofunctional acupuncture and sports medicine. He designed the Contemporary Acupuncture curriculum for medical professionals who want to incorporate acupuncture into their western medical practices for treatment of functional and musculoskeletal disorders. Physicians, chiropractors, acupuncturists, and physical and manual therapists from all over the world enroll in Dr. Claraco's cutting-edge neuroscientific lectures and workshops.\"When Dr. Donaldson told me about the Contemporary Acupuncture program, I signed up right away,\" says Carey. \"The course is fascinating, as it reinterprets and presents the concepts of traditional acupuncture from a neurological and biochemical perspective. This is very usefully clinically. It is also useful conceptually, as it affirms and rationalizes why acupuncture can be so effective.\" Further, Carey says that the course helped her \"to be able to clearly articulate the mechanisms of acupuncture using scientific terminology, something that is particularly useful working in a hospital context.\" She took the 300-hour course over five three-day weekends, completed in December 2010. The Integrative Medicine Department at Beaumont grew out of the Oncology Department. It is becoming more common for progressive oncology departments to house integrative medicine departments, because research has shown that a variety of integrative modalities can help patients undergoing cancer treatments. So many of Beaumont's cancer patients were seeking alternative modalities to help cope with their chemotherapy side effects that the oncologists decided it would be in their patients' interest to provide them with high-quality services on site. Cancer patients at Beaumont today, however, are just a portion of the hundreds of patients a year who receive acupuncture services there. Currently, Beaumont staff and their families make up about 30% of the total volume of patients, and the other 70% are hospital The New Face of Acupuncture in Michigan - Carey Ryan Blends East and West in her Practice Acupuncturist Carey Ryan practices locally at the Center for Sacred Living, and she is also on staff at Beaumont Hospital's acupuncture clinic.Photo by Amy HogaThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 63 outpatients or the general public. It is worth noting that these statistics reflect how Beaumont has broken ground in another arena as well. It is the only hospital in Michigan to offer coverage for integrative medical services in their employee health plan. Including all employees and their family members, this covers about 40,000 enrollees. As of a year and a half ago, this plan covers acupuncture, medical massage, and naturopathy. Carey says that many of her Beaumont patients are nurses, doctors, and other medical staff who often come in complaining of chronic pain resulting from the physical demands of their jobs. \"It's a great opportunity to work with so many Beaumont employees. A lot of medical professionals have never tried acupuncture before. When they have a good experience and become, shall we say, 'believers,' they tend to spread the word. This seems like a good thing all the way around.\" People from the general public usually come to the clinic at Beaumont because they have heard that acupuncture can be helpful in resolving many conditions. The fact that there is an acupuncture clinic in a reputable hospital makes people feel safe trying out something new. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in treating a broad range of conditions such as: chronic pain, arthritic conditions, sciatica, fibromyalgia, tension and migraine headaches, neuropathy, phantom limb pain, dysmennorhea, PMS, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, urinary retention, nausea, allergies, menopausal hot flashes, night sweats, infertility, depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-operative recovery, addiction, and fatigue. Carey enjoys working with all sorts of patients, especially couples struggling with infertility issues. Success in this arena typically results from a combination of acupuncture and assisted reproductive techniques \u2014 in other words, medical interventions. Numerous significant studies have shown that acupuncture treatment can greatly improve the success rates of in vitro fertilization treatment. In western terms, acupuncture improves reproductive and endocrine function and helps decrease the physiological stress response, thereby supporting the process on many levels. Traditional Chinese medicine would say that acupuncture helps to tonify the chi , or vital life-force energy. Regardless of the language used to talk about it, Carey says, \"Even playing a small part in helping a couple have a healthy, happy baby is quite a profound experience.\" Holly Ryan (no relation) came to Carey as a healthy, high-energy woman of 39. She and her husband already had one child, but wanted another. They had tried to conceive \"au naturel\" for about a year with no results. A friend recommended acupuncture, so Holly started working with Carey in tandem with standard fertility treatments. \"After taking medication for awhile and not getting pregnant, the doctors said I needed to up the ante and start an at-home injection protocol. I had a lot of anxiety about this and started questioning my very desire to get pregnant. I asked myself, 'Am I tempting fate at 40?''Holly continues, \"When I shared my concern with Carey, she asked me if the decision to do the injections to get pregnant was based out of fear or love. When she put it that way, it made things clear and helped me make a decision I had really been struggling with.\" Holly became pregnant in April 2010 and delivered a healthy baby boy this past January. When asked what role she felt that acupuncture played in her pregnancy, she said, \"I'm a really high-strung person, so acupuncture helped calm and relax me. It also helped with blood flow, which is critical to ovulation and the fertility process. Also, my conversations with Carey helped me to have a positive attitude spiritually and emotionally. She's highly empathetic and a great listener. She is also really determined to get you the help you're looking for.\" Holly continued to see Carey on a regular basis throughout her pregnancy, because the acupuncture also helped with morning sickness and fatigue. \"I always felt so relaxed after my sessions with Carey. And it was great just talking with her. She makes you feel like you're her only patient, really special.\" About a year and a half ago, another patient, Roxanne Smith, was in desperate straits. After four back surgeries, she was already on disability with chronic pain, but when she learned that her father-in-law was dying, the stress bumped up her pain to severe. She had had some acupuncture treatments by a highly skilled neurologist in Southfield, but the drive from Ann Arbor was hard on her. Roxanne's doctor suggested they find an acupuncturist who was willing to make home visits. They made countless calls, but no one was willing \u2014 until they found Carey. It was the day before Christmas in 2010. Carey went to see Roxanne in her home that Christmas Eve day and continued her visits once a week for the rest of the year. \"Carey's treatments got me through one of the hardest years of my life,\" says Roxanne. \"Acupuncture provides some help with pain but, even more, it calms my nervous system's response to the pain. I feel more relaxed in between treatments, and this helps me cope with the pain. I now see her twice a month.\" Roxanne was a physical therapist before her disability, so she appreciates that Carey uses both objective and subjective methods to reevaluate Roxanne's needs in the beginning of each session. Carey adjusts her treatment depending on Roxanne's condition on a particular day. Sometimes Carey suggests supplements or other modalities that Roxanne can practice at home, such as Emotional Freedom Technique, which Roxanne says really helps to calm and balance her autonomic nervous system. In addition to the excellent acupuncture, Carey brings something equally vital to Roxanne's treatments. \"Carey has a joyfulness about her and, most of all, she embodies hope. She has helped to carry that hope for me during some really tough times. She also has excellent professionalism. She enters easily and graciously into a patient's personal space and has a gentle presence.\" Although she is only in her third year of practice as an acupuncturist, Carey has been a practitioner of energetically based healing modalities since 1999. \"I became very interested in natural medicine in my early twenties, when I experienced a bit of trouble with my health. I have pretty much devoted myself to the process of healing on many levels since that time. This has been an invaluable experience for me personally, and I think that it has also expanded my capacity as a clinician to some extent. \"I've also had the incredibly good fortune of having been surrounded by many extremely kind and skillful mentors over the years. Before going back to school, I worked as an associate to Dr. Rob Koliner, practicing Neuro Modulation Technique. This was a wonderful experience, and I am deeply grateful to Rob for helping me to begin my career in this way. For those of you who think that acupuncturist training is akin to taking a couple of weekend workshops, reading a few books, and then practicing on voodoo dolls\u2014 think again. Carey's curriculum [constituted] a full-time, four-year master's program. Ryan is also on staff at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak...Beaumont has the largest Integrative Medicine Department of any hospital in the Metro Detroit area, [offering] naturopathy, massage, craniosacral therapy, Reiki, and guided imagery, as well as acupuncture. Continued on page 64 Photo by Amy Hoga\"When I was ready to go back to school, I decided that a degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine would be an excellent comprehensive, integrative medical training. I had the sense that learning acupuncture would provide me with a fascinating, powerful tool that could be used to facilitate healing for a lot of people. This is proving to be true,\" says Carey. Carey says that she has been on a steep learning curve since completing her training and starting her acupuncture practice. \"So far, every single day has offered tremendous opportunity for learning. I am very lucky to have had Abby Humphrey as a senior associate and partner in practice at the Center for Sacred Living. She generously helped to guide me through the beginning stages of being a new practitioner, and I have benefited tremendously from the wisdom she has gained through years of clinical practice.\" The distinctly peaceful, clear atmosphere of the Center for Sacred Living is no accident. The Center houses a range of holistic healing practitioners and the directors exude a gentle caring and sincere love for what they do, which has attracted like-minded souls to join them. In observing Carey, it is evident that she puts her heart into it. \"I really enjoy working with people in a context that supports healing. It is both humbling and rewarding, and I'm very aware of how fortunate I am to be doing this kind of work,\" she says. Last spring, Carey was elected vice president of the Michigan Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, the state organization for nationally certified acupuncturists. \"It's a very exciting time to be in this field. Last spring, we succeeded in obtaining legal registration in Michigan for nationally certified acupuncturists. We've been trying to do this for over twenty-five years. Over the next few years, we will be working toward licensure for acupuncturists in Michigan,\" an even more comprehensive legal recognition. The change that many have seen coming for years is upon us. Dedicated and thoughtful practitioners from around the world are now actively seeking ways to integrate the ancient wisdom of acupuncture with cutting-edge training and technology, in order to better serve patients in need. Love. Light. The best of east and west.

As a young boy and his mother shop for apples and cheese, honey, smoked salmon and green kale, McClure shows how each item is grown or made and introduces the farmers and artisans who work so hard to fill tables and tummies. Culminating in a fabulous feast, this is a joyful celebration of good food and the skill that goes into making it. I love this book not only for the artistic illustrations, but also because it satisfies slightly older readers, up to age 9 or so. McClure is a self-taught artist who has published several books and journals. She lives in Olympia, Washington, and visits the farmer's market in her community each week. $17.95 The Whole Family Cookbook: Celebrate the Goodness of Locally Grown FoodsBy Michelle SternThere's no better way to teach your children to eat fresh, healthy, organic food than by growing your own garden and cooking and eating together! Written by the founder of San Francisco's premier children's cooking school and award-winning, green-parenting blogger Michelle Stern, this book gives your family the resources you need to cook delicious, local food in any season, including practical advice, color-coded instructions, and more than 75 organic, family-friendly recipes with color photos. Although intended for the older child, lots of the steps in the recipes can be geared for younger ones.

Boggess feels good that he can take a lot of time with each new patient. A typical initial consultation can take 80 minutes. \"We do a thorough history and a physical exam,\" he states. \"If needed, we consult through patient education.\" In addition to the aforementioned clinical practices, Dr. Boggess often assists those seeking a switch away from stimulants, sleeping medications, or drugs such as Prozac to natural alternatives, when desired or appropriate. He combines appropriate diagnostic tests of the digestive, nervous, and immune systems with nutraceuticals and therapies to address the underlying causes of \"dis-ease.\" Nutraceuticals are high-grade dietary supplements and functional or medicinal foods that provide health or medical benefits. Examples include vitamins and minerals, as well as omega 3 fatty acids and probiotics. New Balance Clinic works in cooperation with Building Bridges Therapy for concerns such as occupational, speech, and language therapy and psychological services. Building Bridges maintains a satellite center within the New Balance Clinic for patients' convenience. Boggess, who holds a degree from the Midwestern School of Medicine, completed specialty training in physical medicine at the University of Michigan and earned additional certification in medical acupuncture through Stanford University. New Balance Clinic offers medical acupuncture, massage, water/air filtration systems, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy rentals. The clinic takes standard private insurance, but not HMO insurance.

Some of this is done through patient education, which Boggess says is \"fifty percent of what we do.\"By Karen L. Totten If you'd like to be considered for inclusion in the next Crazy Wisdom Kids column, please contact our columnist at: cwkidscolumn@crazywisdom.net. The deadline for submissions for the January thru April 2012 issue is November 1, 2011. Treating children with special needs and their families is a specialty of Dr. Tony Boggess of New Balance Wellness Medical Center of Ann Arbor. The doctor of osteopathy, with a clinic on Main Street directly across from Michigan Stadium, devotes about 50 percent of his practice to this group of patients. He says, \"Our practice recognizes the tremendous impact certain medical conditions have on the entire family...Our goal is to support the entire family unit holistically.\" Special-needs children include those experiencing autism spectrum disorder; ADHD; or mood, sleep, or behavioral problems, as well as those with cognitive and speech deficits and physical impairments. Often, the adults caring for special-needs children neglect their own health and need attention too, Boggess notes. He attributes many of the parents' problems to the accumulation of stress brought about by caring for someone with chronic pain or illness. Stress symptoms can include problems such as insomnia, chronic headaches, mood problems, and even physical pain. \"Acute stress response,\" says Dr. Boggess, \"is activated during times of real or perceived danger.\" As such, it \"regulates or 'blocks' chemicals in the brain and body, which, under normal circumstances, are very helpful. However, left on for weeks, months, or even years, stress can become horribly uncomfortable and ultimately lead to these chronic health or mood problems. Especially for families with special-needs or other individuals facing prolonged hardship, the stress system can get stuck in the 'on' position, and symptoms result.\" New Balance Clinic offers a program of lifestyle changes to diet, routine, and exercise that help the whole family manage stress. Some of this is done through patient education, which Boggess says is \"fifty percent of what we do,\" and adds, \"The root word of 'doctor' means 'teacher'.\" He explains, \"I believe the body has the innate ability to heal itself with proper support, and given the right set of circumstances.\" In fact, he says, \"Many of our programs are devised to require a certain amount of determination and commitment. The patient has to be an active participant in his health.\" \"Clients generally leave less confused than when they came in. Many have been to lots of different doctors looking for relief or help,\" he says. Boggess attributes a good portion of his patient base to word-of-mouth advertising. \"We are unique in what we do, treating the whole family,\" he notes. Families come from all over the metro Detroit area as well as Ann Arbor and surrounding areas.

A copy of Mona Lisa smiles knowingly from a corner. This is a painting class with Elena Townsend-Efimova of Talking Colors Art School and the children are all eager to be creating on a beautiful summer July day. One can see large poster-sized paper sheets spread out before each student, along with trays of tempera paints, brushes, and jars of water. This day's project is a composition in straight and curved lines. Townsend- Efimova begins with a story, characteristic of her teaching method. \"Everything we see in the world,\" she explains, \"is made up of straight lines or curved lines. The straight lines are very firm and look a person right in the eye. The curved lines are more relaxed and say 'maybe.'\" She gestures as she says this, her body exemplifying the two types of movement the lines make. The children are shown examples of both straight and curved lines, then asked to use paintbrush and black tempera to place eight different lines on the paper before them. \"Now,\" says Townsend-Efimova, \"the lines find a way to have a conversation between them.\" The children are asked to connect all the lines in some way, so that they all touch. The spaces left will be filled in with color. Townsend-Efimova continues her story: \"Now they are friends,\" she says, \"mixing with each other so that they blend on the paper. They are like people. What is the name of this school? Talking Colors. You are asking the color, 'Who do you want me to invite to play with you, who is your friend?'\" The children reach for blues and greens, sunny yellows, and bright reds. They bend over their work while Townsend-Efimova roams the class, offering additional inspiration. \"Scoop up the paint as if you were making a sandwich,\" she says. \"Peanut butter or mayonnaise.\" Townsend-Efimova stops to hold up a picture. \"This is quiet like a lullaby,\" she comments. Another student's work is proclaimed \"bright like the July day.\" She makes a point to honor each child's efforts, always finding a gentle pictorial way to illustrate a point. Each child has chosen his or her own path. The dynamic spirit of Townsend-Efimova infuses every class she teaches. The Russian-born, -raised, and -schooled teacher (from St. Petersburg) came to the United States in 1992 for three months to teach and do presentations on art therapy, on which she is an expert. In 1993 she came to stay, settling in Ann Arbor and immediately opening Talking Colors. She was invited to teach at the Rudolf Steiner School, and has been there for 15 years. \"My passion is children's art,\" says Townsend-Efimova, who has master's degrees in both architecture and education, Waldorf teacher training, and a certificate in art therapy. Certainly she has touched the lives of all the students who come before her flawless teaching style, her grace, and her warm, charming manner. \"What I do with children is all about them,\" she says. \"I help them bring out what is inside. The children make visible for us things people might otherwise not see.\" She quotes Pablo Picasso, who said, \"By age 13 I could draw like Raphael, but it took me a whole life to learn to draw as a child.\" It is art from the inside out, says Townsend-Efimova. As Picasso also said, every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain a child. Townsend-Efimova was a pioneer in art therapy in Russia. She notes that after the Second World War, this discipline emerged and developed. Townsend-Efimova, knowing friends and colleagues with expertise in this practice, began setting up a program in the then-Soviet Union. \"I worked with children who were in psychotherapy and with autistic children,\" she explains. Plenty of encouragement came her way as a child learning to do art. She had art class in school through the 6 th grade but credits her preschool teacher, now 82 and still a close friend, with helping to instill her love of art. \"Nina Aleksandrovna Potapova was passionate about art,\" Townsend-Efimova says, \"and I see her when I go back to Russia to visit.\" Perhaps the most profound influence on Townsend-Efimvoa was her father. \"My father had a law degree. He lost an arm during the war, but he sat with me for hours to do art with me and nurtured my interests,\" she says. \"He drew cartoons which were published in the papers.\" It was natural that Townsend-Efimova would gravitate toward an artistic career. Many years later, Talking Colors Art School is quite successful. \"Art teachers in town know me and they send their students to me from other programs,\" Townsend-Efimova says. \"Whole families come and stay for years. I teach home-schooled students and also advise on portfolios for students interested in attending art school after graduation from high school.\"stay-at-home mom by choice, the business developed out of her home as a means of helping children get where they need to go when parents or others are not available. \"My daughter was in preschool,\" she says, \"and I was working in Toledo, commuting on a daily basis. It became a choice between family and career\" \u2014 and McCommons chose the former. Friends would often call McCommons for rides for their children, because they knew she was at home. She decided to make the service official and created her business from that idea. \"I enjoy kids,\" she says, \"and I enjoy driving. So I put the two together.\" McCommons is currently operating one van and is working on securing a second vehicle this fall. The Kruiser, a 2008 Chrysler Town and Country, can carry up to six riders, with seat belts. Riders range in age from preschool through high school seniors. The service does not transport infants because, McCommons states, \"We like our passengers to be able to tell us what they need.\" The service can arrange to pick up children directly from school when permission is secured from the parents. A teacher or assistant escorts riders to the van. McCommons plans the drop-off schedule around the day's riders and their destinations. Consideration is given to the start times of lessons or events, as well as the distance from collection points to destinations. McCommons is the driver. She carries a chauffeur's license and her business is registered with the state of Michigan as an LLC. She is working on obtaining a limousine license. She has CPR training and a first aid certificate. Also, any drivers she employs will meet these standards, as well as a background check. A copy of her driving record is kept in the Kruiser. Compared to a regular taxi service, McCommons says her rates are favorable. Rates are based on the number of miles to a given destination and the number of days the service is used. Discounts apply for various situations. Parents pre-arrange payment. McCommons can accept VISA, American Express, Mastercard or Pay Pal. Typically, a parent interested in the Kids Kruiser will set up a meeting. McCommons meets both the parents and the child or children who will be using the service. Registration forms and transportation agreements are signed. The meeting gives parents an opportunity to ask questions and look at McCommons' credentials, as well as give the child a secure feeling about who will be driving them. \"I like my riders to feel comfortable,\" McCommons notes. Also, for their comfort, books and music are available for the riders. As for discipline, McCommons sets a clear standard. \"I reserve the right to cancel service for riders who don't follow the code of conduct, which includes no cursing, kicking, or throwing things, and no food or beverages.\" Currently, the Kids Kruiser is servicing Western Wayne County and Eastern Washtenaw County on a first-come, first-served basis. The hours of operation are M-F 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday by appointment only. McCommons can be reached at 734-255-3556 or through the website www.kidskruiser.com.

A lion, for example, would impart courage or self-confidence. A grizzly bear momma strengthens the instinct of what is safe and what is not, and is especially powerful for children who have been abused. Wilson does not have to explain the animal to the child. \"They know what that animal means to them,\" she states. She might ask a parent to play lion or grizzly with the child, or to provide a picture or stuffed toy of the animal, as a symbol to help the child keep the power animal in mind. Of her work with children, Wilson says, \"I have seen tremendous healing happen.\" She is an ordained minister who is also a Reiki master and a certified healing practitioner.

Every year, thousands of children benefit from the many programs offered to instruct and delight: the Music Field Day, the \"Meet Your Conductor\" program, the Instrument Petting Zoos and Family Music Concerts, and Ensemble Concerts in the schools. The Symphony's annual Music Field Day in March brings 5,000 to 7,000 students from a three- to five-county area to Hill Auditorium to hear two performances of music especially suited to the ears of young listeners. Dozens of volunteers work to ensure the success of this event. The visiting composer for the 2012 Music Field Day will be Michael Daugherty from the University of Michigan. The Symphony will perform from his Metropolis Symphony (inspired by the Superman comic books), as well as pieces by Mendelssohn (\"Scherzo\" from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Opus 61) to Tchaikovsky (the \"Waltz\" from Sleeping Beauty, Opus 66) to the Harry Potter Symphonic Suite by John Williams, among others. Symphony Maestro Arie Lipsky does presentations for the Symphony's Meet Your Conductor program. Lipsky visits schools to play his cello or flute, discuss the life of a musician, teach simple conducting techniques, conduct student ensembles, or teach leadership skills, depending on the age level and experience of the group whom he is addressing. More widely known are the Benard L. Maas Foundation Family Concerts offered three times during the year. These concerts, designed for all ages, give children a chance to hear music designed for their listening appreciation. Kept to about 70 minutes in length so that attention can be held, the concerts also feature pre-concert activities, including the very popular Instrument Petting Zoo.Townsend-Efimova helps select pieces to include in a portfolio and guides students in creating any additional pieces required by a prospective college. \"Some schools send homework,\" she says. And Townsend-Efimova helps train new teachers as well, through the Waldorf Institute of Southern Michigan. Her summer art classes, held at the Rudolf Steiner High School on Pontiac Trail, are very popular, but Townsend-Efimova also holds courses during the regular school year, both after school and on school breaks. She also offers parent-child classes and art activities for birthday parties. Visit her website at www.talkingcolors.com to register online. Her telephone number is 734-995-5959. \"I have been a healer most of my life,\" says Eve Wilson, healing practitioner, of her work with children and adults. Wilson, an Ann Arbor-based spiritual minister, moved her practice to Ann Arbor from Royal Oak last year (her arrival was announced in this column in the January-April 2011 issue of CWJ). She works telepathically with individuals who find themselves in a place where trauma or injury are interfering with their life journeys. \"I was always open to people's problems,\" Wilson says of her early childhood experiences. She began working with her own family members, until by age 26 she was called to devote her life to working with others. Eve's method is gentle and simple. She can work over the phone with the parents of a child referred for care. The child need not be present, and could be in school or doing other activities. She works back and forth between parent and child, working with the child's higher self and helping him or her work through the issue. Wilson asks questions designed to elicit possible reasons why a child is having problems. \"Tell me what you think I need to hear,\" she will say. As she explains, \"I am not the one in charge of the healings. It is better if I do not have a predetermined belief about the best course of action. That only gets in the way.\" A typical session lasts about an hour or an hour and a half, with intervals of four to 10 weeks between sessions. Wilson likes to wait between sessions to allow time for changes to occur. Wilson explains the children's processing this way: \" I access a given moment in a child's current or evolutionary lifeline where they might have gotten 'stuck'. We are one hundred and fifty times more efficient and effective working this way. We don't have to re-traumatize the child to bring about improvement.\" Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Reaching out to the youth of the area with programs designed to teach and inspire is part of the mission of the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra.

EveWilsonAt the Instrument Petting Zoo, children get the opportunity to hold a stringed instrument, listen to the sound, and try it out for themselves. Ideally suited for three- to 12-year-olds, even the youngest children can touch the wood and feel the vibrations of the sound, even if they can't actually play. The Petting Zoo began in 1991 and was held at Briarwood Mall. It originally included all the instruments of the orchestra, as well as stations where children could do various activities, such as build their own instrument. It stayed in that location for another year, then was scaled down to its present size and format. The Petting Zoos are possible thanks to the generous assistance of Shar Music, which donates the instruments used at the events. And the Zoo does travel. The program also goes into the schools or day care centers as a more formalized program. Among the works featured at this year's November 13, 2011 Family Concert will be the works of Poulenc ( The Story of Babar, the Little Elephant) and Leopold Mozart's Kindersymphonie , Hob 11:47. In the latter piece, children take the stage to play \"toys\" with the music. The cornerstone of the education program, however, is really the Ensemble Concert, as performed by various small groups of Symphony musicians (brass, string, and woodwind quintets, and a percussion ensemble). They take music directly to the schools for small concerts themed on the music from the Family Concerts. About 35-45 minutes in length, these performances bring music to the children, thanks to the incredible musicians who take time to travel for these mini-events. And, we cannot forget the wonderful Sing Along With Santa, held yearly at the Bethlehem United Church of Christ. Some type of world music is offered at the concert, along with the carols and of course Santa Claus. In previous years, a calypso band was featured, and one year the songs of Puerto Rico. Information on all of these programs and more are available at the Ann Arbor Symphony website, www.a2so.com. This year, tickets to the Family Concerts are $10 each, and the Symphony is featuring a buy-one-get-one-free membership offer.

Often grief can be such an overwhelming experience for adults that it can be hard to have the energy or perspective to address a child's needs. However, as this article and these resources (video, books, and local and online support groups) suggest, being present to the pain will ultimately, paradoxically, help lighten and heal the grief for parent and child. The Ann Arbor Public Library has an excellent video entitled What Do I Tell My Children? (www.aquariusproductions.com) addressing how kids handle grief. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross and other professionals as well as parents and kids are interviewed on the video. The discussion is organized around 4 phases of grieving (stages that overlap and cycle): Understanding Provide as much open and honest feedback as kids seem to be requesting. Let them keep asking questions. Very often cues that they want to \"talk\" about the topic may come indirectly via kids talking for or about their dolls, stuffed animals or pets, rather than volunteering information directly about themselves. You might use these \"displacement\" figures as an inroad to express the feelings and thoughts you imagine the child might be experiencing. The child will often experience relief by knowing an adult understands how they feel (via talking about what their pet feels) without having to put it into words themselves. Protect them from some of the details, depending on their age, but don't hide all the facts or all your tears. They're watching you closely to be sure it's okay to cry, talk, or be silent. They're also watching to be sure you hold it together. They need to see adults managing life and grief together. Define death: \"when the body totally stops working.\" Avoid euphemisms that kids can misconstrue, such as \"Grandma went to sleep for a long time.\" Try to explain the specific causes of death at a level of detail appropriate to the age of each child. If we don't explain death in ways they can make sense of, then they have to guess, and their ideas may be far worse than the actual facts. In other words, children fill in gaps in their knowledge by using their imaginations, and that can create more frightening \"facts\" than if they had heard the actual information. Death is not a nightmare. It's natural. Let them into the room when someone is dying. Let them hold a hand if they choose. Let them hold a pet that has died. Until age 4 or 5, magical thinking predominates. For young kids, death is temporary. After you explain death, let them play with their own versions or understanding without hammering in a truth which is beyond their comprehension. Dr. K\u00fcbler-Ross spoke of a 4-year-old who said, after they buried his dog, \"When the tulips come up, the dog will be out to play again.\" She suggested a parent might reply, \"That would be lovely\"; therefore, letting him hold onto that comfort while not directly agreeing. Kids will keep meeting \"reality\" and then returning to their fantasies until their cognitive level shifts and they can understand the permanence of death on a different level. Let them learn about animals and flowers dying naturally. Expose and discuss, ideally before they have to deal with a person in their life dying. Grieving Adults can take 2-3 years to manage an acute loss and move on (not forget). Kids can take longer. At each new stage, they'll re-process it. Drawing pictures and repeating the stories are useful again and again and again. Commemorating Honor the important place that a person/pet had in the child's heart. Let the child plan as much as possible of her or his own remembrances. They need a sense of control over their experience of the death. Let them pick out the clothes they'll wear, or the songs to be sung at their cat's memorial service. Make \"Remembering Cards\" on holidays and birthdays in honor of the deceased. Teach what fits for one's own beliefs - that the person lives on in soul, heaven, memories, reincarnation, or in relationships. Plant a tree or a little garden to have as a living memorial, a place in one's own yard or other special location, to visit the spirit/memory of the loved one.Moving on There is a continuing cycle of life. Model and live into the joy of the present. The deceased would want that. Do what it takes in terms of getting help for the grieved. Sometimes meeting with a counselor can help release any blocks to help a child or grown-up get back on developmental track, integrating the loss as part of their rich experience. It's not all a loss. There's opportunity in the incredible growth of grieving. There are other wonderful resources in the library addressing the topic for a range of ages, relationship to child, and reasons/ways that people (and animals and plants) die. Using characters in stories, they raise the types of feelings and reactions, fears and questions that kids (and all of us) may have at various stages. Obviously, adults would want to review and consider what is most appropriate for a given child's situation before delving in. However, books may help provide a way to address fantasies or worries without requiring that kids directly talk about themselves. It is often a tremendous relief for children when a character puts words to their problems, rather than being forced beyond their developmental ability and comfort range to express a host of confusing thoughts and feelings directly. Here are a few books that put this complex experience into words and art: Don't Despair on Thursdays! The Children's Grief-Management Book by Adolph Moser and David Melton. Excellent, realistic cartoon description of grief process and tools for healing. Tear Soup: A Recipe for Healing After Loss by Pat Schwiebert, Chuck DeKlyen and Taylor Bliss. A touching, poetic description of ingredients involved in the process of grieving and healing. When Dinosaurs Die: A Guide to Understanding Death by Laurie Krasny Brown and Marc Brown. Quite specific. One could pick several pages without reading it in its entirety. After Charlotte's Mom Died by Cornelia Spelman. Sad, honest, beautiful. The Tenth Good Thing About Barney by Judith Viorst. Dear story of a boy whose cat dies. For the funeral, the boy easily finds nine good things to say about Barney. The tenth was harder to come by. He decides that his cat enriches the soil when he is buried. Lifetimes: The beautiful way to explain death to children by Bryan Mellonie and Robert Ingpen. Of this list, this is the most general intro to death among animals, plants, and people - not too specific or graphic; lovely pictures, poetic.

As a musician, music teacher for all ages, business owner, and performer, people know him for different reasons. There are the parents who witness his amazing talent for teaching music and helping their children explore instruments. Other adults know him as a wonderful teacher for their age group and as a talented musician and performer. He has a full calendar that often keeps him working seven days a week. On Tuesdays, you can find him entertaining kids with his music in the youth department at the downtown branch of the Ann Arbor Library, as part of the popular story time. Thursday nights he leads group guitar lessons. Saturdays he gives lessons, organizes \"Strum and Drum Family Fun\" and performs for an occasional wedding. Sundays are usually the day he hosts birthday parties in the Oz's Music Environment. Then, of course, there are the individual and group lessons that he gives Monday-Saturday. Steve has been part of the Ann Arbor community for over thirty years. A music environment for exploring instruments has always been part of Steve' s teaching space. For almost two decades, Oz's Music Environment has been located on Packard. Passers by will notice two storefronts - one for Oz' s Music Store and one for the Music Environment. The Music Store is managed by Steve's wife, Leslie Zager, and provides repairs and rentals and buys, sells and trades instruments. Steve calls it, \"The quintessential ma and pa shop with a variety of services that go beyond sales.\" Oz's Music Environment is filled with instruments, and includes a stage for performances and other events. In addition to Steve, there are many talented musicians who give lessons in that location. Early Influences Growing up in Tecumseh, Michigan, music was always a part of Steve's life. He has early memories of sitting around the organ with his grandpa, mom and brothers singing hymns. He was only five-years-old when he campaigned to be the first child in the church choir. Soon he was singing harmonies with the grown-ups in the choir, which encouraged other children to join. As a teenager, Steve attended summer sessions at Interlochen Center for the Arts and studied classical guitar at Eastern Michigan University . He took a job working in a music store, which helped him realize how much he enjoyed teaching. Around the same time, Steve visited his nephew's Montessori school to find out what his nephew was learning. There he first encountered Sister Anthonita Porta, a teacher who was nationally known for her role in Montessori education and whose ideas would eventually greatly influence his teaching. Sister Anthonita helped start The New England Montessori Teacher Training Center where Steve studied years later.Early in his career, Steve taught at the Ann Arbor Montessori Center and still includes many Montessori practices in his current teaching, including prepared environments for children, sensorial development, and hands on learning experiences. Steve has also been inspired by the Suzuki Method. He believes in kids not only imitating but creating music. In the Music Environment students, teachers and parents take turns leading and following. The Music Environment After eight years as a partner in the Crescent Music repair shop and rehearsal space, Steve started Oz's Music in 1990. The third and current location for Oz's Music is on Packard. Seeing a child in the Music Environment is like watching a kid survey all of the treasures in a candy store. Their eyes are wide; they are looking over all of the possibilities; but in the case of the music environment, they are encouraged to try all of the different instruments. Parents are often surprised that Steve is so willing to let their young children try any instrument. Freshly painted walls display the artwork of local artists, but the instruments are the stars of the space. The drum set is like a big magnet for kids, inviting them to come make some noise. Kids get excited about singing into the microphones and trying the variety of drums. There are also two smaller rooms in the upstairs portion of the Music Environment. One room has the instrument choices offered by the Ann Arbor Public Schools for fifth graders. The other room, known as the \"back room,\" is a wonderful space where students and siblings can explore a wall of guitars and violins, boom whackers, xylophones, and a variety of other unique instruments before and after lessons. Exploring Music Nine-year-old Lute Smith was only two when he started taking lessons from Steve. His mom, Eileen Storer Smith, recalls, \"I heard he worked well with all age levels, and provided more than learning instruction but a 'learning environment' in which children could learn and grow. Steve, indeed, provides a learning environment filled with instruments of all kinds in which children are free to explore and experiment.\" Both of Karen Vetor's sons (ages 8 and 5) love going to the music environment for lessons with Steve. She says, \"Steve has a wonderful way of getting children excited about music because of his flexibility in creating special musical opportunities for children to explore reading music, rhythm through games, a variety of instruments, and how to play music together .\" Nicky Northrop credits Steve for her daughter Ashley's ability to play so many instruments. Ashley started learning acoustic guitar, then learned electric guitar, and continued learning new instruments. Nicky says, \"If Ashley had started taking lessons somewhere else she might have just played acoustic guitar. We might not have known what she could do.\" That appreciation of exploration is also true for the Brownlee family . Aerin Brownlee says her son, Gram, started taking percussion lessons and discovered how much he enjoys piano. In addition, Brownlee says that she appreciates that Steve recognizes the student's interest at the moment and doesn't force him to follow his own schedule. Teaching Guitar Steve might be better known for his teaching abilities with kids, but he has students of all ages. Steve Balogh is one of Steve's adult students. He is usually at Oz's every Thursday night for the group guitar lessons. Balogh One of a Kind ~ Steve \"Oz\" Osburn and his Music Environment Inspire Musicians of All Ages \"I don't want to be just the teacher who tells kids what to do. I want to be a teacher who helps kids make constructive decisions towards learning.\" ~ Steve OsburnSteve Osburn plays the Chapman Stick at the first national stick festival, which he helped organize in Ann Arbor in 2006. Musicians and students agree that Osburn has a won- derfully unique style on this instrument with 12 strings that is a cross between a guitar, a bass and a keyboard. Leslie Zager and husband, Steve Osburn, are the cre- ative forces behind Oz's Music. Besides managing the store, Leslie contributes her talents to summer art camps and drop in art sessions for pre-schoolers. Their daughter, Rose, is a high school student. Photo by Donald Adiska, Ovation Photographicssays, \"I've never seen a store like this, with a few teachers that are actually known professionals and an actual stage where performances are held, too. There's really no other store I've seen in Michigan where students can actually be taught in a performance-based environment.\" Steve is unassuming and very humble. He never takes credit for anyone else's success, yet he is clearly excited by his former students' accomplishments. Aaron Wolf, Tyler Duncan, and Randy Napoleon all started exploring music with Steve and went on to become professional musicians. Aaron is also a teacher himself. At the age of eight, Aaron started taking music lessons from Steve. He says, \"Steve is a very talented classical guitarist and creative musician. He encouraged me to compose and explore. He also encouraged me to record my first CDs and to get into teaching.\" Tyler, a member of My Dear Disco, a nationally known band, started taking lessons from Steve when he was nine-years-old. He says, \"Steve was a crucial part of my musical upbringing. He encouraged me to experiment, create, and simply have fun with music, which are the most important musical elements of all. Creating that association at such a young age was the reason I eventually pursued it (a music career) full-time.\" Randy Napoleon is an internationally acclaimed jazz guitarist, arranger and composer who performs with the Freddy Cole Quartet as well as with the Randy Napoleon Trio. As a teenager, Randy took his first guitar lessons from Steve Osburn. Randy says, \"He was the ideal person to introduce me to the instrument because his interests and knowledge base are wide open. Whatever I wanted to explore, Steve was into it and pointed me in the right direction. Anything I asked about, he seemed to be able to point me in the right direction.\" Napoleon also appreciates Steve's support. He says, \"The other thing that struck me was that he cared. He was excited when I learned something, and he was always encouraging.\" Saturdays at Oz's That exploration and encouragement are part of the Music Environment. Every Saturday at 3:00, Steve works his musical magic for the \"Strum and Drum Family Fun\" event for kids. He leads a drum circle on the first Saturday of each month, and on the other Saturdays children explore a variety of instruments. Steve recalls a recent Saturday when six kids showed up, ranging in age from 3 to 5. He happily shares a story about how the kids composed, conducted, and performed simple rhythms while their parents listened. Steve says, \"The parents' reaction was, 'Wow!' They knew their kids were capable, but they didn't realize how much they could do.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 73 Even the smallest of children have big wishes. Kids get excited by the variety of instruments and ask to try their favorites. Steve recalls a three-year-old who chose to play trumpet for three weeks straight and then started learning trumpet. Steve says, \"I don't want to be just the teacher who tells kids what to do. I want to be a teacher who helps kids make constructive decisions towards learning.\" The first Saturday of each month, Oz's Music also hosts an open stage. Kids don't need to be students at Oz's in order to perform. It is a supportive environment for young musicians and singers. What's Next? After more than thirty years of teaching, Oz still gets excited about music and learning. Recently he has been creating music games for a new exploratory space in the basement of the Music Environment. He says, \"My hope is to create a space parents and kids can interact in, with little knowledge of music, and teach each other with hands-on music.\" He is also working on funding for a CD of his own music. Recently Oz's Music started offering Interactive Metronome (IM) sessions. IM is a research-based therapy that has shown benefits for improving focus and concentration. The research shows benefits for people diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, athletes, and people recovering from strokes. Steve is excited about this new opportunity, which is offered once a month at the Music Environment. \"Talented, dedicated, amazing, wonderful, fun\"...those are just a few of the words parents and students use to describe Steve Osburn and his Music Environment. As a professional musician, Randy Napoleon has traveled all over the world, and even he thinks, \"Steve is one of a kind.\" Learn more about Oz's Music by visiting: ozsmusic.com.

There's really no other store I've seen in Michigan where students can actually be taught in a performance-based environment.\" Feature Continued on page 74 Know Obstacles A Band of Young People with Varying Special Needs Musician and teacher Steve \"Oz\" Osburn believes that music is for everyone. His teaching philosophy allows children of all ages and adults to experience and explore music, and his Music Environment provides the instruments and the performance space. David Ziff was only five-years-old when his older sister Vera first took him to Oz's Music Environment. Oz remembers how David immediately felt at home. After several years of lessons, David, who is autistic, became the first band member in Know Obstacles, a band of young people with varying special needs. Steve leads the band, and together they write songs, perform, and record. David's dad, Bob Ziff, says the band is, \"Mainly about them enjoying playing together and accomplishing something.\" The band has a busy calendar, with many performances. Seeing how much they enjoy music makes it even more fun to watch them. Nicky Northrop, mom and stepmom to two of the band members, says that although the band members tend to be introverted, they have a \"stage presence\" when they perform. Nicky says being part of the band allows them to work with other people and be part of a team, and she believes those skills will benefit them in other areas of their lives. The parents praise Steve for his patience and his ability to bring out the best in each person. \"Steve is an incredible person. He has an extreme amount of patience and an incredible amount of dedication,\" says Bob. Nicky says, \"He has worked wonders with everyone who he comes in contact with.\" Dylan Northrop, age 18, has spent nine years as a drummer for Know Obstacles. He likes writing new tunes and covering old ones. Dylan \"enjoys playing gigs.\" He says, \"I am glad that I am part of the band because I can get better at playing my instrument.\" Ashley Brunk, age 19, sings, plays guitar and piano. Her perfect pitch and attention to detail are definite assets. She says, \"I am glad I am in the band because I have been able to improve my musical techniques. I've always wanted to be part of a band plus... you make friends along the way.\" The admiration and respect the band members and their parents have for Steve is clear. Dylan says, \"Steve is our leader. He teaches different musical techniques. Steve is very gifted.\" Ashley says, \"Steve is very, very multi-talented. He is a respected and gifted musician.\" \"Steve is one of their heroes,\" says Dave Northrop (Dylan's dad and Ashley's stepdad). And he adds, \"He's one of my heroes too. What he does is absolutely amazing!\" --- Karen Larson ###One of a Kind ~ Steve \"Oz\" Osburn Continued from page 73 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2011 Page 74 Steve \"Oz\" Osburn believes that music is for everyone.Drummer Dylan Northrop performs with Know Obstacles at one of their 2010 summer concerts.

It has for my children.My sons and I first experienced Steve Osburn's talent during a concert at Ann Arbor Learning Community last winter. My older son, Austin, watched with his class, and my younger son, Colin, and I were part of the audience. Steve brought the room alive as he played musical rhythms and asked everyone to clap back. He demonstrated the Chapman Stick (a combination guitar, bass and keyboard), drums, and guitar and ended the program by asking the entire group to clap or move to the music. Both Austin and Colin came away excited about the event! They wanted more! Over spring break last year, Austin attended a special field trip at Oz's Music Environment with a few friends from school. He had never played an instrument before and was thrilled to end the day with a jam session playing the electric guitar! Austin loved it so much he signed up for a week-long summer music camp. Steve has a wonderful way of getting the children excited about music through his great rhythm games, his fun games to introduce reading music, his encouragement to explore any instrument, and through playing music together. Colin attended a shorter version of summer music camp with his preschool friends. He came home singing every song they learned. On the last day, Steve offered the preschoolers the chance to try any instrument they wanted, and Colin chose the drums. The entire experience made a lasting impression. Colin even made up his own song about Oz's music called, The Osburn Song . My sons have continued to take lessons at Oz's Music Environment. The kids in the summer camp session return for a group lesson every other week. As Austin says, \"I love it. I love dancing, playing instruments, and singing songs.\" In the eyes of an 8-year-old, what wouldn't be better than to feel the accomplishment of having a band, being able to explore any instrument you want, and to have the opportunity to sing into a microphone, and express yourself musically? Both boys also take a group guitar class. They both tell me that guitar class is one of their favorite parts of their week. Music is a significant part of their world. It makes them happy. I appreciate the incredible gift that Steve Osburn has for inspiring kids to enjoy music.

Life is pregnant with change, and the new paradigm is in the birth canal. \"What is going on,\" you ask? According to many indigenous tribes, cosmolo-gists, scientists and seers, we are about a year away from the Earth giving birth to a new beginning, although we are already in 'the shift.' Many people are consciously choosing to change with the changing Earth; others are resisting change, kicking and screaming. Which one are you? Our Earth and solar system are completing 3 simultaneous cycles: a 5,125 year cycle, a 26,625 year cycle known in astrology as the Precession of the Equinoxes, and a 75,000 year cycle. Historical data shows us that the end of such cycles is much like the end of a season; planetary 'upheaval' renews the Earth, creating a refocus and rebirth for all upon it, taking us to a higher dimensional (or hertz) frequency. Although the media puts a spin on 2012 as a doomsday scenario, the world is not ending. The timekeepers of the world, the Mayans, mark time with \"waves\" or \"underworlds.\" In our lifetime, having passed through a wave dominated by actions of power and greed to a wave be-ing dominated by actions of ethics and transparency, we are now cycling into the last wave called conscious co-creation, where we are collectively break-ing through the mass mesmerisms of life and have begun to see the world as it truly is. Much like Truman in the movie The Truman Show came to the edge of the water only to find a painted sky, we are beginning to discover the world's illusions. Our world's foundation is crumbling and is not 'fixable'; it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. Ominous situations seen in all corners of the world are making way for the paradigm shift; upheaval related to debt, diminished resources, a weakening of our monetary system and an increase in 'natural' disasters, to name a few. It is hard to look at the policies of governments in most nations and see coherence, benevolence, enlightened action, or intel-ligent behavior. The degradation of morals in the 'controlled' media dish out less than enlightening entertainment designed to dumb down our society while competition keeps us in separation with an 'us and them' mindset. Movie scenes of hitting, killing and \"power-over\" sexuality are a constant. Our chil-dren are starting to emulate the behavior and think it is 'normal.' Fear, war and power-mongering will burn itself out in the coming times. The new energies of conscious co-creation will not support this vibrational offering. Now is the time to discover the true nature of reality that is emerging and embrace this passage into conscious co-creation. This process is like going down the rabbit hole, because many ideas you hold in life and think are real are unreal; true are untrue, good are bad, right are wrong, as well as upside down and backwards! Why would you take the time to learn about all this when you could keep your 'status quo' life, you ask? Because time's up for this social ex-periment and it is time to prepare for the quantum leap. The old ways are falling away and a higher level of order is upon us. Ideas that we have held about our world and the ways in which we do things must change. Consciousness has its own agenda and we bow to its wisdom. Envisioning the Shift: Our Role in the New Paradigm By Nina Howard, Photo by Joni Strickfaden Nina Howard has been teaching metaphysical classes since 1988. She is also the founder and owner of Bellanina Day Spa & Institute. \"We are beginning to realize that our thoughts, words and deeds impact the whole. What changes will you make inside of yourself now to begin the journey of awakening consciousness?\" \"Historical data shows us that the end of such cycles is much like the end of a season; planetary 'upheaval' renews the Earth, creating a refocus and rebirth for all upon it, taking us to a higher dimensional (or hertz) frequency.\" Photo by Joni Strickfaden of StrickfadenPhoto.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December Page 84 I will share with you some rabbit hole discoveries I have made that can help you wake-up from the mass mesmerisms of life and see the change before us. Considering these ideas can better prepare you to begin to piece the puzzle together, answering questions you may have had before that didn't quite make sense to you. Even though it is easy to doubt or dismiss the new paradigm before us and difficult - confounding even - to grasp the paradigm we are leav-ing, my hope is to connect you to new thought and make you aware of patterns playing out so you can understand your role as a conscious co-creator. New Discoveries of Who We Are! Mankind has been on this planet for eons, long before Adam & Eve. Who you are is much grander than who you think you are! I firmly believe that civiliza-tions with technologies and capabilities greater than modern man's have come and gone (and very sophisticated ones)! Where we came from and what has transpired is now being revealed through archaeology, science, seers, and, yes, even our space brothers, but is not in our textbooks. The collective agreement - the view of reality supported by mass consciousness - adheres to the selectively approved ancient teachings with blind faith; rather than commit heresy! Have you ever wondered if these teachings may have been 'edited' or lost something in translation by the controlling and power hungry rulers of yesteryear, perpetu-ated to this day? New Technology Free energy has been suppressed. We have been given the technology to power our life without the use of fossil fuels, but because it does not support the power structures that have us addicted to oil, it is not allowed to replace sucking the lifeblood out of the Earth. Finance, Health & Well-being My point of view is that our government is controlled by a shadow 'govern- ment' composed of people and financial institutions that have profit as their top value and our survival and well-being as their lowest priority. Agendas are put in place to take away our freedoms, diminish our resources, create toxic food supplies, weaken our immune systems, implement eugenics, and cause us to lose our hard earned money. Do you want that? What are you going to do to ensure your ongoing health, freedom and supply? There is no one to cry \"do something\" to. We're it! \"We are the ones we have been waiting for,\" as Gandhi so aptly put it. We will consciously co-create a better world by insisting on it and by creating it! The Universe and all its inhabitants are morphing! The whole universe is shifting, including all the planets in our solar system and beyond, as we move through a plasma belt and galactic plane. Many animal, plant and human inhabitants of Earth are beginning to increase their frequency, activating a DNA change. Children are being born 'hard-wired,' with multi-dimensional awareness and the inability to sit still in our linear world. We medicate them. A quantum leap in evolution and a new reality beyond our current concepts is imminent. Are you feeling your body, mind and spirit change? Are you having a harder time staying focused? Does it feel like time is speeding up and you can't keep up? Are you noticing drastic weather patterns almost daily as the Earth's changes are becoming more active? Our Relationship with God is Changing For so long we have assigned our power to everything outside of ourselves; from religion to crystals to gurus, ministers and priests. We are now beginning to realize (real eyes) that we do not need a go-between for a relationship with God; you can find God in the center of your heart. Religion is losing ground as we discern that God is not exclusionary, but rather inclusionary. This era of transparency is 'busting' religious leaders and showing us their ugly side, as in the rape and sodomy of thousands of precious children in the Catholic Church by the most 'Godly,' the Priests. How did we, as a society, let it get to this? How much more proof do we need to see through this and stop supporting these organizations with our tithes? Our Space Brothers It is time for us to rejoin the Universal families from other star systems. So far, 21 countries including Canada, China, Denmark, France, Russia, Sweden, Chile and India have all declassified their E.T. material for view by the public, but the United States Government has not. Our government continues to ridicule any-one who claims to have contact with or awareness of E.T.s. Consciously asking for the presence of our benevolent brothers will help facilitate 'disclosure' and help to move us swiftly into the new era of peace and prosperity. You can see with these few tidbits of information that have taken us down the rabbit hole that we need a major reality adjustment as well as a systems upgrade! Life right now reminds me of being a 9-year-old who does not want to believe that Santa Claus is 'make believe' after all those years of happy moments around the brightly lit Christmas tree. If they don't believe in Santa, then they won't get all those presents. Knowing the truth will change their life forever, and they don't want it to change. It is hard to let go! Today, if we don't wake up and collectively start dealing with the truth of life, we may not have a sustainable planet to wake up to in the very near future. We are beginning to realize that our thoughts, words and deeds impact the whole. What changes will you make inside of yourself now to begin the journey of awakening consciousness? Start your action plan by first answering these important questions:1. Who am I? 2. How do these changes affect me, my family? 3. What unique gift do I have to offer to the world? 4. Am I ready to operate from my heart and not my head? 5. Where is my water? My garden? My community? 6. How de-pendent am I on the system? This shift requires the participation of every single one of us. Every one! No one will do it for us. Each individual soul has a part to play to fuel the collective will for positive change and ascension to a higher order. ### Nina Howard has been teaching metaphysical classes like her \"Down the Rabbit Hole\" class- es, as well inspirational classes on overcoming adversity, since 1988, when she co-founded the Ascension Principle Center in Atlanta, GA, and Waynesville, NC.

More than Bee Stings and Seasonal Sneezes: Transforming the Conversation about Food Allergies By Gary Merel According to The Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), allergies affect 1 out of 4 Americans. Additionally, from 1997 to 2007, reported food allergies increased 18% among children under age 18. Food allergies are increasing at alarming rates with dire consequences, yet some health professionals never talk about them. It is time to address what many doctors and scientists agree is one of the greatest contributors to our discomfort - the food we eat. Let' s transform the conversation when it comes to your health. Understanding Allergies, Their Symptoms and Causes The conversation begins by understanding what an allergy is. An allergy is the immune system's response to a protein that it perceives as a foreign body. An immune response is usually triggered by foods such as peanuts, eggs, soy or dairy. Among the most prevalent and most serious are allergies to gluten, which can be found in wheat, barley, rye and flour, among other things. Many people tend to confuse the difference between food allergies, food sensitivities and food intolerances. For example, a lactose intolerance is caused by the inability to digest the sugar in milk. A person could have sensitivity to chemicals in foods, such as the sulfites. Both intolerance and sensitivities often cause a disturbance in a person's GI tract. However, they don't meet the definition of triggering an immune system's response to a protein that it perceives as a foreign body. Did you know 60% of people with food allergies have no digestive problems? Just because you don't exhibit obvious signs of a food allergy, like hives or digestive discomfort, doesn't mean you are allergy-free. The immune system's response can appear up to 72 hours after digestion and manifest anywhere in the body. Watch for these warning signs: Tiredness, drowsiness. Headaches, migraines. Stomach bloating, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, Chronic cough, bronchitis, asthma, colds, \"flu.\" Eczema, psoriasis, general skin problems. Aching joints, bones, back. Weight change. Tinea or Yeast (Candida) infections. Clumsiness. Miscarriage, infertility. Hemorrhoids, ear pain. Cravings, addictions. Interstitial cystitis. Fibromyalgia, numbness, tingling in extremities. Crohn' s disease, ulcerative colitis and IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer' s, Parkinson' s, and epilepsy. Autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Type I Diabetes. Celiac disease. IgE IgA and IgG Fast response (few minutes) Slower response (2 hours-72 hours), can take years to manifest Strong response Weaker response Similar physiological response in most people Varied physiological response in most people \"Fixed\"- do not change during our lifetime Can evolve at any age Analogous to immune system \"blow-torch\": instant, acute, powerfulAnalogous to immune system \"sand paper\": delayed, slowly damaging Immune system response to a protein found in digestive system that is perceived as foreign objectImmune system response to a protein found in digestive system that is perceived as foreign object Least Common Most Common Most doctors test only for IgE allergies Most people's IgA/IgG allergies remain undiagnosed since common blood tests cannot detect themGary Merel specializes in digestive health. He has a degree in Oriental Medicine. \"Let's change the conversation about your health, from talking about symptoms to what is stopping your body from healing.\" \"Through a deeper understanding of what our bodies do and do not absorb, and how these physiological responses affect us, we can take charge of our wellness.\" In determining causes, most food allergies are acquired (not inherited) due to various factors. Some develop sensitivities due to consistent exposure, or occasional exposure in large quantities. Others react to pesticides and herbicides combining with the natural chemicals in food. Regardless of how it develops, our immune system' s response is what determines how we feel after eating the trigger food. The Immune System in our Digestive Tract When most people think of their digestive system and their overall digestive health, often there is little thought about how important digestion is in relationship is to the immune system. Around 70% of our immune system is located in our digestive tract. Its primary role is to decide whether to accept or attack a food we ingest. When our immune Allergies aren't just to peanuts and bee stings - there are many different kinds. Several important distinctions need to be made when it comes to understanding the different types of allergic reactions a person experiences with food allergies. The two main differentiations have to do with Immunoglobulin (Ig) or antibodies, and are between IgE and non-IgE (IgA and IgG). Most people do not have IgE allergies, though the majority of doctors test only for IgE. This is why understanding the symptoms and implications of all food allergies is extremely important for your health. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December Page 90system reacts to a food based allergen it fights with inflammation and excess mucus. If the immune system is constantly on the offensive, these reactions can damage our digestive tract. Inflammation deteriorates the intestinal lining, resulting in something called \"leaky gut syndrome\" (or increased intestinal permeability). Partially digested food then enters into the blood stream through the compromised tissue wall. Once our tissue wall is thus damaged, other secondary food aller gies may develop. Symptoms can manifest all over our bodies. A Pathway to Healing Though the detriments of undetected food allergies sound severe, there is hope. The first step to healing a compromised digestive system and to restoring the integrity of one's immune system is getting tested for food allergies. Testing is critical for gathering the information needed to start on the pathway to healing. Let's examine some of the methods used in food allergy testing. ELISA: The Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay panel (ELISA) is a blood test that examines 96 of the most common food allergies such as dairy, meat and fowl, grains, gluten, nuts, vegetables, seafood and fruits. The ELISA test measures both IgE, IgA and IgG immune responses. This food allergy test is available at Ann Arbor Holistic Health. RAST: Most physicians utilize an IgE blood test called RAST (short for radioallergosorbent test). Though this method accurately determines IgE allergies, it cannot detect IgG or IgA allergies at all. Most people do not have IgE food based allergies. Skin Prick Tests: While commonly used to test for IgE immune responses, the exam is painful, inaccurate, and does not detect non-IgE food aller gies. Once testing has been undertaken, removing trigger foods and healing with appropriate vitamins and supplements will lead to amazing results. \"You are what you eat. Or, even more accurately, you are what you absorb,\" says Dr. John Wycoff, an osteopath based out of East Lansing who believes hormonal balance, allergies and diet are integral to health. As reactionary medicine and over-usage of prescribed chemicals fail to alleviate our pain and discomfort, more and more physicians are embracing holistic approaches to healing. Through a deeper understanding of what our bodies do and do not absorb, and how these physiological responses affect us, we can take charge of our wellness and move towards a brighter, more fulfilling future. ### Gary Merel received a master' s degree in Oriental Medicine from the New York College of Health Professions, which includes training in both Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture.

A decade ago, I would have never predicted that I would be teaching yoga, much less the path I would follow to arrive here. In 2003, I became ill with meningitis. Recovering a few months later , I was happily back to work as an emer gency services nurse, continuing my charmed life with my husband and our five children. Six months later, I was again hospitalized with another episode of meningitis, which is very unusual. A few months later, it was meningitis once again! I was diagnosed with Auto-Immune Chronic Lymphocytic Meningitis. This rare type of non-infectious meningitis differs from the more common viral meningitis, which resolves with supportive treatment and usually only occurs once. In chronic meningitis, the meninges (the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord) become persistently inflamed, causing severe pain and other debilitating symptoms. Over the next four years, I would be hospitalized several times each year with episodes of this illness. Eventually , the pain and other symptoms associated with the condition became constant, with one painful bout of meningitis indistin - guishable from the next. Despite the excellent medical care I was receiving and the support of my family , the condition persisted. Now the pain was always with me; tiny and seem - ingly innocuous movements had become excruciating. Before I developed this disorder , I was an avid runner and practitioner of Hatha Yoga. Reluctantly, I had to discontinue my yoga practice, stop running, and leave my nursing position. By 2007, I was beginning to feel very discouraged and longed to return to the peace of my yoga practice. I began very slowly to practice the yogic relaxation breath, moving my body only slightly . I was amazed to find that with the focused use of this simple breathing technique, I was able to significantly reduce the pain in my head and spine. I began to feel better and began adding gentle yoga postures to the healing breath, eventually returning to my full Hatha Yoga practice. W orking for 25 years as an RN in intensive care units, emergency depart - ments, and as a flight nurse, I was solidly trained and based in \"W estern\" medicine. No one could have been more surprised than I that yoga could actually provide pain relief!

They tell me they enjoy the class because it is gentle, mindful, and they leave feeling restored. Periodically , I offer a two-hour workshop called \"Yoga for Aches and Pains\" as a benefit for the American Pain Foundation. As I do in my Gentle Yoga classes, in this workshop I teach students simple yoga sequences to ease everyday aches, pains, and stiffness. The Lotus Center of Ann Arbor and Sun Moon Yoga generously donate their spaces for these benefits. The next \"Yoga for Aches and Pains\" workshop is Sunday, September 19, 10 a.m. to noon at the Lotus Center, in recognition of Pain Awareness Month. Combining my nursing experience with therapeutic yoga has truly become my passion. My experience of illness and pain has allowed me to move into a role I am so happy to fill: teaching others how to tap into the \"healing center\" within them - selves. ### Janine Polley teaches at the Lotus Center of Ann Arbor, Sun Moon Yoga, and the Health and Fitness Center at Washtenaw Community College.

Because yoga combines all four of these systems, the practice is uniquely suited to enhance health and provide comfort for those with painful conditions.\" Steadily feeling more healthy and now inspired, I trained to become a yoga instructor with Sondra O'Donnell at Sun Moon Yoga in Ann Arbor. I am grateful to have Sondra as my yoga mentor and continue to study yoga therapy with her . As a health care professional, I wanted to bring the healing power of yoga, an \"alternative\" medicine, to other people with persistent pain conditions. I began to gather information and found a growing body of research supporting yoga for pain relief and healing. W e now know that we can access the body's natural healing and pain relief responses in four specific ways: gentle exercise, meditation, relaxation breathing, and body awareness. Because yoga combines all four of these systems, the practice is uniquely suited to enhance health and provide comfort for those with painful condi - tions. Add in yoga' s focus on postural alignment and it easily becomes clear why yoga \"works\" for pain and health imbalances. Yoga has been proven helpful for arthritis, headaches, back pain, scoliosis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, anxiety, depression, and many other health challenges. When I first began teaching this health-centered yoga as a component of a chronic pain support group facilitated by psychotherapist Jody Kohn at the Lotus Center of Ann Arbor, I began to witness the healing power of yoga on others. I saw students in pain become more comfortable in their bodies, developing an ability to consciously relax their sore muscles and decrease the pain. Through the relaxation breath fused with very gentle yoga postures, they were allowing their bod - ies to open up to the nurturing and healing benefits of yoga. Students were reporting a decrease in their pain, stress reduction, greater mobility, and an increased feeling of overall well being. In my classes, I try to create an environment that is safe, both physically and ener getically. I individualize my yoga instruction for each student, keeping my classes small to insure adequate attention to all, with the health status of each unique person in mind. It is humbling and gratifying to see students embrace their yoga practice and actually begin to feel good. Lori, a student in one of my Gentle Yoga classes, sums it up well: \"Initially, I was very resistant to yoga, due to years of chronic pain. The first time I tried it, Gentle Yoga was a confidence-boosting revelation, mainly because of Janine's gentle, individualized approach. I am able to do much more than I ever realized. Each week, I see progress, which is something I never thought would happen. After class, my spirit is uplifted, and my body actually feels good!\" Photo by John FredericksThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December Page 97 Yoga Cooking Workshop with Jody Tull and Rupert De Salis Sept. 25, 4-6 p.m. Learn to cook and get to eat a delicious \"sattvic\" vegetarian meal specifically designed for the yogic lifestyle. $25.

Salons Crazy Wisdom Salon Series: An Evening with Psychic and Author John Friedland-er on his new book, Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships Thursday, Sept. 29, 7 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom Tea Room Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships is a unique look at individual psychology and interpersonal relationships. John Friedlander and co-author Gloria Hemsher present the everyday usefulness of clairvoyant skills within a big picture where they explain that we create our reality, but do not control it; and that the personality - like the soul - is eternal and always growing. John will teach two simple, powerful exercises that underlie all advanced Psychic Psychology practices and will clairvoyantly answer a few questions from the audience. You can read the introduction to this book in this issue of the Com - munity Journal on page 44. Free.

As we think, so we create the world.\" In the old mechanistic worldview, the world is as it appears: objective, law-driven, independent of human concerns. But quantum theory of the early 20th century upset this view; human observ - ers have a measurable, definite role in the atomic realm, and thus at the most basic level of reality. From this key insight, we have come to realize that the world is intimately connected to our state of consciousness. In fact, the world as we know it is, quite liter - ally, coincident with the limits of our comprehension. As our mind expands, so does our world. When our vision withers, our world withers as well. Thus our state of mind is of paramount importance: it creates the world in which we live. Free. For more informa - tion, call 665-2757; bill@crazywisdom.net, info@crazywisdom.net or crazywisdom.net. Building \"A Future Worthy of the Human Being\": A Special Crazy Wisdom Salon Series on Anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner's Work Four nights in October, 7 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom Tea Room A century ago, one of the most remarkable human beings of the last millennium, the Austrian-born Rudolf Steiner, undertook to shift the direction of our emerging global civilization. He restored a holistic image of the human being to the center of cultural thought and set out to bring humanity' s soul and spiritual resources back into balance with materialistic science, technology , and economics. Trained as a scientist but also a profound esoteric researcher, Steiner developed resourc-es for every individual to evolve herself or himself as a free and creative local change agent in planetary life. In this series of talks/conversations, we will explore his vision, its amazing breadth, and three of its particular applications. Free.

So we rediscov - er the cosmic significance of being human and the pattern of repeated lives, and begin to take part as co-designers of the evolutionary plan.Oct. 11 Biodynamics: Nutrition for the Soul, Healing for the Earth with Paul Bantle and Annie Elder of The Community Farm of Ann Arbor One of Steiner's last initiatives, and a foundation for the organic movement, was biodynamic agricul - ture. Here, the human being stands as the conscious ego in a farm or ganism of animals, plants, and soil, open to sun, moon, and stars. The food produced works to support our awareness of interconnected life and of the cosmos.Oct. 18 Anthroposophical Medicine with Dr. Molly McMullen-Laird and Euryth-mist Susann Herb-Eddy Steiner's approach to health is a complementary medicine bringing together the outstanding technical skills of modern western medicine with traditional western environmental medicine. It adds a new intuitive approach to health as a totally individual matter where illness is part of our karmic path and the \"I\" of each patient is a profound agent of healing.Oct. 25 Waldorf Education for the Whole Child with Teachers Lawrence Mathews and Mary Emery Steiner is best known for his educational initiative, a response to an appeal by factory workers for an education for their children that would open up to them all of life's opportunities. Waldorf sees the child as already a unique individual, going through archetypal stages of development which af fect the needs and potential for learning. The teacher acts as a social artist, assisting each child in open-ing the fullest human potential.

Little did we know that when we were hopping, we were con - necting with the energetic template of the Tree of Life in Kabbalah. The Tree of Life can assist us in co-creating the lives we desire. We all have a choice. We can co-create Tree of Life (unity consciousness) lives, which can be primarily playful, magical, harmonious, peaceful, supported, and easeful. Conversely , we can co- create Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (duality consciousness) lives, which can be significantly stressful, struggling, insecure, unstable, and intense. As a teacher for many years exploring this topic, I love sharing personal growth work through the Kabbalah. 'Kabbalah' means 'receiving' -- we are receiving the secrets which are hidden in the Old Testament. These secrets teach us how to cre - ate and sustain a meaningful and fulfilling life. Sometimes we create a wonderful life, but then we sabotage it, constantly strug - gling with weight, relationships, lack of income, and any number of issues. When we study The Kabbalah, we discover that instead of struggling, we can co-create miracles. The Kabbalah system is unique in that the Higher Power, G-D, the Cre-ator, is at the Center. Because G-D is at the Center, we are privileged to share the excitement of miracles happening in people's lives, all the time. One time a new Kabbalah student asked that our class do prayer and meditation for him and his wife, as they had been trying to conceive for years unsuccessfully . Having been disappointed for so long, he was skeptical of our group prayers, to say the least. The very next month he walked into our Kabbalah class and an - nounced incredulously that his wife was pregnant! Furthermore, the baby was born on December twenty-fifth, which happened to be both Christmas and Chanukah that year (which happens very infrequently)! Our Kabbalah group had been com - prised of both Jewish and non-Jewish students. I believe it might have been the Creator's way of informing us that when we all (of different faiths) cooperate and pray together, miracles can be \"birthed.\" Beth Wielinski, M.F.A., stated, \"For me, Kabbalah was world-altering, internally and externally...My long-standing personal struggles were approached head-on and worked through, once and for all...\" I would like to share with you how this particular Kabbalah journey works. In actuality, we complete an experiential personal growth journey through the Tree Kabbalah Miracles By Karen Greenberg This Tree of Life is comprised of ten different spheres ~ each one represents a different quality of the Creator, which we integrate and emulate, as we learn Kabbalah.

Contact annarborstorytelling.org.aries, you have a fear of being rejected or abandoned, or of losing a client, and then not having sufficient income, or of feeling guilty when saying \"no.\" As we work through these concerns, together with the support and encouragement of the group, one can then more fully embrace the \"severity\" energy, whenever \"tough love\" might be in the highest good for all concerned, for instance. Month by month, we integrate, and thus emulate, the qualities of the Creator . We become more powerful co-creators of our lives. As long as our will is aligned with G-D's Will, we become more successful at co-creating the lives we desire. Another reason that the Kabbalah journey through the Tree of Life has deeply affected so many is that it has been Divinely designed with a specific order. We ascend systematically through the physical, emotional, mental, and then spiritual aspects of life, through the Tree of Life. Perhaps you are more comfortable in the physical and mental realms, and less comfortable in the emotional and spiritual arenas. Therefore, these last two areas may be less developed. You might even tend to avoid these two areas. This un-derdevelopment of these significant areas of our lives disempowers us! When we traverse this Tree of Life path, we do not avoid any aspects of our lives, whatso - ever, (even those which may be more challenging for us). We progress through the Tree of Life in a particular order. As a result, even our weakest areas become strengthened! We become much more balanced, healthy, and powerful! Again, as a consequence, we become much more successful at co-creating the lives we desire (as long as our desires are in alignment with G-D's Will). Moreover, we learn a formula that is extremely powerful for creation. Once we identify with ourselves as proactive co-creators of the lives we desire, we cease believing that the best that we can do is merely to react to everything that enters our orbit. In order to be the proactive co-creators of the lives we desire, we must learn clar - ity, to be authentic in every moment. That means, we learn to tolerate unfavorable reactions to \"not pleasing\" our parents, spouses, children, superiors at work, society , culture, etc. We embrace the boldness to discover what our unique gifts and talents are, what our life's purpose is, and to embody the courage to live it, and to earn a living doing both what we love and what we were created to do. If you would like to join us on an amazing, life-changing, experiential Kabbalah journey of personal growth and empowerment, please contact me. ### Karen Greenberg is a registered Physical Therapist, has danced professionally and owned her own dance studios.

The Tree of Life is an energetic structure composed of ten spheres. Each sphere represents a different quality of the Creator. We study one sphere, that is, one specific quality of the Creator, each month, for about a year. I have combined my Clair-Ascension personal growth work with each sphere, which helps enhance our ability to embrace each of the Creator's qualities, more fully . For example, one of the qualities in the Tree of Life is \"Chesed,\" which means an \"outpouring of loving-kindness,\" that is, \"giving.\" This quality or sphere is bal-anced by its opposite, \"Gevurah,\" which translates to \"severity.\" More generally defined, \"Gevurah\" means standing up for yourself, with courage, in your power , setting healthy boundaries, saying \"no,\" that is, \"withholding.\" Now suppose you are a student in my class and \"Chesed\" (outpouring, giving) comes more naturally to you and \"Gevurah\" (withholding) might be more difficult for you. When our Kabbalah journey progresses to the level of the Tree of Life that addresses the \"Chesed\" quality, divinely orchestrated circumstances will be brought to you to enable you to work on whatever may be blocking you from setting and enforcing healthy boundaries.

I am totally amazed at the transformation brought about in my life by his teachings. Even more amazing is that my work is still in progress. This process of trans-formation will never end. In time it becomes deeper, it touches deeper and deeper parts of my being, bringing to the fore more and more awareness of all the layers that make up a human being. As a token of gratitude for what I re- ceived, for over two decades I have been teaching meditation classes. These are of-fered free of charge in the spirit of service to the community, which is the philoso-phy of Sri Chinmoy. The idea being that, like prayer, meditation is everybody's birthright \u2014 no charge should be applied to its teaching. In my classes, I cover basic meditation and breathing techniques, but also ex-pand to describe what I call a \"meditative lifestyle.\" Because our being is composed of different layers, or sheaths, there is a different form of \"meditation\" for each of these layers. Thus exercise brings physi-cal excellence and health to the body and, as such, it is a form of meditation for the body. Engaging in creative activi-ties serves to release stress and bring to the fore dynamism in our vital or energy sheath. Spiritual music and readings nourish and illumine our minds, and meditation opens the inner gateway to the soul and the power of the spirit. Sri Chinmoy encouraged and stressed the importance of this holistic approach to well-being and happiness. In class, we also discuss another aspect of meditation: once the constant chattering of the mind has been quieted and the restless vital or energy sheath has calmed down, quite naturally we begin to access our inner being, and its voice can be \"heard\" or perceived. On the one hand, this inner voice brings direct guidance from our soul. We no longer need to ask others what to do; the wisdom of our own soul has all the answers. On the other hand, the process of self- discovery begins. Once we get a glimpse of this inner space where true joy, peace, and hap- piness can be found, we want more of it, like a child who has his first taste of honey. This is when we begin to notice that certain aspects of ourselves are keeping us from experiencing more of this. Gradually we become ob-servers of our actions and reactions. Through this lengthy process we begin to get rid of, like weeds, the unwanted aspects of the self and gradually become a transformed person \u2014 loving, compassionate, and fulfilled. With those who are interested, I also discuss the basics of the ancient Indian philosophy that is the basis of our meditation practice. ### Dr .

It all started on a hot summer after-noon in Italy in 1980, when I was asked if I would like to go to the United States for a month to inves-tigate the possibility of academic collaboration with some American universities. Little did I know that this would be a major turning point in my life. This month's visit be-came 30 long years dedicated to re-search and the teaching of physics, but also (and primarily) dedicated to spiritual growth. Leaving Italy meant leaving behind my family and the ancient culture and traditions of my country to em-brace a new, young country, full of vibrant energy - the perfect ground for the exploration of new possibili-ties and a new way of life. Not long after I came to this coun- try, I stepped into a meditation class in Chicago. It was based on the phi-losophy of Sri Chinmoy, a spiritual teacher from India who came to the U.S. in 1964. He established cen-ters around the world, encouraging a balanced lifestyle that incorpo-rates the inner disciplines of prayer and meditation with the dyna-mism of contemporary life. As I began to practice the meditation techniques, it felt as if I had at long last found what I had been looking for all my life. As a young girl I had dropped out of the Catholic Church, as I did not feel any affinity with it. For several years I just focused on my studies, moving progressively further away from religion, to the point of declaring myself an atheist during my college years. I guess I had to cross an ocean to be able to find what I was missing: spiri- tuality. As I was gradually going through Sri Chinmoy's writings, I found the answers to questions that for so long had been left unanswered. I also found his musical compositions very soothing and relaxing. Yet my mind would often fight against all this. How can a physicist be- come involved in spirituality? The answer came through a book - Quan-tum Questions by Ken Wilber - that I picked up at the campus bookstore in Berkeley, CA, while visiting for a conference: all the major physicists were spiritual people, including the \"demigod\" Einstein. Reassured, I kept going. Eventually I met Sri Chinmoy in New York, the place he called home for over 40 years until his passing in 2007. The im-pact of this meeting was very profound. I actually felt that we knew each other already. In the course of time, Sri Chinmoy helped me considerably, deepening my spiritual practice, giving me guidance and encouragement when needed. Eventually I began to look at him as a father.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 115 By Mary Runser Halloween is just around the corner and since it's a holiday commonly associated with witches, warlocks and wizardry, I thought it would be best to get some thoughts on the subject from a practicing witch. Misti Delaney-Smith, a practicing Hedgewitch, has been living in the Ann Arbor area since 1982. Five years ago, she moved with her husband Rod and their eight-year-old son Jack to the East Ypsilanti area because they could afford a wooded acre there. In her 'normal' job, Misti is a technical writer for a major components manufacturer in the automotive industry . Rod, originally from Australia, is an astrologer and also homeschools Jack. I was grateful that Misti was willing to sit down and talk candidly with me about her background and feelings concerning Halloween. Your first question might be, what is a Hedgewitch? Admittedly, it was my first question, so I went to digging around. I learned that a Hedgewitch is one who practices solitary magic focused on nature and its aspects. Hedgecraft (the magic and practice of a Hedgewitch) seems to be loosely based on the ancient practices of folk healing, herbalism, wise men and women, and shamanism. There are some similarities between the Wiccan and Hedgecraft traditions, particularly their focus on nature and healing, but Hedgecraft is more solitary and less rigidly structured than Wicca. One possible history behind the name Hedgewitch is that in earlier times a hedge was a physical barrier between a village and the wild forest beyond that represented the boundary between worlds. A Hedgewitch then was believed to be one who rode the line between one world and the next. Misti agrees with the above as a \"loose\" definition of who she is and what she does. \"Being a Hedgewitch really means that I make it up as I go along,\" she said. \"If something works, I keep doing it, and if it doesn't work, I try something else.\" Hedgecraft is not a religion and Hedgewitches do not worship any particular deity , though some believe they worship the Triple Goddess and Horned God as the Wiccans do. \"I think of Wicca as the Roman Catholic Church of Paganism because it is a highly organized tradition. Hedgecraft is more a do-it-yourself practice,\" Misti said. \"It can be either good or bad, depending upon who is using or performing it.\" Misti started out as a Hedgewitch but studied Wicca for a number of years. \"I find it difficult to pinpoint exactly how I came to be a witch. I just feel like I always was, but over time I discovered it had a name. I came across my first 'teacher ' in South Carolina in the late 1970s, but we didn't use those words and I didn't realize it until many years later.\" And, yes, they share all their magical activities with Jack. \"Astrology and herbalism are a part of his curriculum along with math and botany ,\" she explained. \"Hedgewitchery is not so much a practice or a belief system as it is a way of life.\" Asked her opinion of Halloween, Misti replied she hates it because it frightened her as a child. \"My mother thought I would enjoy seeing the kids coming to the door in their costumes, so she put me in my highchair and set me in front of the door . I was terrified of the images in front of me and I had no way of escaping.\" Misti doesn' t believe there is anything inherently bad about the holiday or its celebration, but there are certain aspects that have come to be associated with Halloween that she doesn' t agree with and so chooses not to participate. In a historical context, Halloween is believed to derive from the Roman feast of Pomona, the goddess of fruits and seeds, as well as the festival of the dead called Parentalia, and is most commonly associated with the Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced Sow-an or Sow-in, the name means \"summer's end\" and represents the final harvest). Samhain was considered a time to celebrate the lives of those who have passed on and often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died. In some rituals, the spirit of the departed are invited to attend the festivities. Another similar tradition is D\u00eda de Los Muertos, when family and friends gather to pray for and remember those who have died. D\u00eda de Los Muertos is a celebration connected to the Catholic holidays of All Saints Day and All Souls Day. During this celebration, family members and friends go to the graves of their loved ones to picnic with favorite foods of the departed. It is a celebration of both life and death. Many of the images and traditions of Halloween are derived from all of these festivals and celebrations of old. The carving of the jack-o-lantern has its roots in the Celtic tradition of carving turnips to remember the souls held in purgatory. Trick-or-Treat hails back to \"souling,\" when the poor would go from house to house and receive food in return for prayers for the dead. The images of Halloween - pumpkins, cornhusks, and scarecrows, with which many homes are decorated during the holiday - are all elements of the autumn season. The costumes worn by kids during Trick-or-Treat are traditionally modeled after supernatural figures such as monsters, ghosts, skeletons, witches and devils. In modern times, satire and commercialism have altered what's popular, with more people dressing up as characters from fiction, celebrities and generic archetypes, such as ninjas and princesses. Just as costumes have modernized, traditional Halloween attractions such as haunted houses, corn mazes and hayrides are reinterpreting tradition for profit, bringing in $300 to $500 million every year. These changes have informed Misti's opinion of Halloween. \"Halloween has become much too commercialized,\" she said, noting costumes aren' t cheap and purchasing them limits the creativity of the child wearing them more so than making a costume would. \"And why should there be only one day out of an entire year that' s reserved for dressing in costume? Many kids enjoy dressing in costume, so it' s a pity that this is the only day when it's acceptable to do so.\" She added that haunted houses and houses of horror rake in an incredible amount of money in a single month, not to mention the money made by the film industry, which generally has more than one movie slated to come out during this time of year. \"I'm also not a fan of the violence, celebration of gore, and the desecration of death that has come to be associated with Halloween. There are basically two sacred moments in life: birth and death. Why would we celebrate the desecration of one of them?\" The celebration of Samhain is the celebration of spiritual and physical ancestors, a celebration of the continuity of life. \"We celebrate our ancestors for all they've given us and for all they've meant to us, in both their lives and the memories they left us with.\" Halloween and witchcraft are often seen as one and the same, but they aren' t and never really have been. \"Halloween is its own thing, it takes place the same time as Samhain and both nod to death, but really that's the end of the relationship as I see it. Using my husband's words, because he's much more eloquent than I am, 'As the mantle of death descends over our world, the green life disappears from plants and the vital radiance of the green god is silenced for a season. In this season, as the life of the god has gone to the underworld, so we travel with it and contemplate those who have gone before us.' For us as a family, Samhain is a time to honor our beloved dead and it's also the harbinger of the final harvest from our garden. We harvest the last autumn crops, clean the garden and ready ourselves for winter.\" While Misti does not celebrate Halloween, she also doesn't think others should avoid or not recognize the holiday. \"I know many friends (witches) who do celebrate Halloween and have a good time doing so.\" During the October season of hayrides and haunted houses, whether you think Halloween is a perfect time to honor tradition and ritual, a commercial folly, or a fine mixture of both, I wish you a happy season of commemoration and celebration. ### (Misti Delaney-Smith can be reached at: Halloween: A Conversation with Misti Delaney-Smith There are some similarities between the Wiccan and Hedgecraft traditions, particularly their focus on nature and healing, but Hedgecraft is more solitary and less rigidly structured than Wicca. \"In this season, as the life of the god has gone to the underworld, so we travel with it and contemplate those who have gone before us.\"\"Hedgewitchery is not so much a practice or a belief system as it is a way of life.\" - Misti Delaney-SmithendpieceThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 116 Business Card DirectoryAcupuncture the Arts/Dance/Music/ WritingBodywork/Massage /Healing Touch Energy Healing Kathleen Moore singer, songwriter, voice teacher, certified music therapist, & certified teacher of the Alexander Technique(734) 668-8146 kathy@kathymoorevoice.com www.kathymoorevoice.com Reconnective Healing\u00ae EFT) marie.goodvibrations@gmail.com, (734) 546-6594Marie Slottow, BA, TFT-Adv.Good Vibrations Healing Practice Certified Energy Healing PractitionerCelebrations & Ceremonies Bodywork/Massage /Healing Touch S u p p o r t f o r a l l t h e w a y s y o u r b e i n g m o v e s C a r o l i n e C h a r l e swo r t h CO N S C I O U S BO D Y W O R K M a s s a g e E n e r g y Wo r k G r a d u a t e , B a r b a r a B r e n n a n S c h o o l o f H e a l i n g 734.485.8485 Gym Giovino \"Build the Strength to Support Your Giovino Postural Alignment Specialist, trained by Egoscue734-276-7769 info@gymgiovino.comwww.GymGiovino.com Essential Oils The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2011 Page 117Business Card DirectoryFood Allergy Testing Holistic Health Hypnosis Intuitive/Psychic Spiritual Counselor and Medium P s y c hi c R e a d i n g s by Amy Garber * Departed Loved Ones * Relationships * * Past Lives * Spirit Guides * Individuals, Pairs, & Parties by Appt.
