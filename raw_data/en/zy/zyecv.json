In this study my aim is to analyze public repertoires which are available to parents as discursive resources to substantiate their decision not to vaccinate their children. Online content, two televised talk shows and a series of interviews with parents who refused vaccination from 2017-2019 were analyzed. As a result of this analysis, I have identified a series of repertoires such as distrust repertoires, rejecting any risks when it comes to children, vaccine ineffectiveness and 'immunity is a limited resource that should not be forced'. These repertoires do a discursive work that seem to go beyond signs of concern or challenges to vaccine safety to perform a moral and epistemic delegitimization of the current system of medical services, medical research and government authorities. Moreover, the identification of the repertoires that circulate in the public space as resources fulfil a discursive function of replacing the current system with new moral and epistemic perspectives.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-12-13", "cleaned_text": "[https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040757](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040757) [Vaccination and Public Health: Optimizing Vaccine Uptake through the Application of Social and Behavioral Science Theory, Principles, and Strategies]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Vaccination_vaccines )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00757)]. measles cases has increased to 20,204 since the beginning of the epidemic. One possible cause that has been much debated is the explicit refusal of vaccination. In July 2019, explicit refusal of vaccination was responsible for 11.8% of the total number of children unvaccinated at 24 months [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00757)]. A national poll conducted between 21 January and 11 February 2019 (INSCOP Research in Romania, commissioned by the National Society of Family Medicine [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00757)]) found that only 55% of respondents believed that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks, while 8% believed that vaccination of children is not necessary. [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00757)]. Another synthesis showed that the main cause for concern is the side effects of vaccines [ [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00757)]. Dub\u00e9 et al. found that mothers who are hesitant about vaccination considered them to be ineffective and dangerous, and distrust medical authorities [ [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00757)]. A meta-analysis of 145 articles which highlighted that the main concerns are related to vaccine safety in association with distrust of government authorities [ [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00757)]. In Romania, the refusal of the free human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was driven by fear of being part of an experimental drug testing program [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00757)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00757)] that circulate and prove to be acceptable and ultimately legitimate become a discursive capital available to people when making decisions about vaccination. Kata (2012) showed that as a result of the development of Web 2.0, associated with the postmodern perspective of the informed citizen, the influence of vaccination campaigns on vaccines has significantly increased [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00757)]. Betsch et al. (2010) demonstrated experimentally that there is a significant influence of exposure to antivaccine messages on web pages about the perception of risks regarding vaccination [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00757)]. Witteman and Zikmund-Fisher (2012) also showed how exposures to narratives can affect perceptions of vaccination risks [ [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00757)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00757), [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00757)], challenging reductionist approaches which hold that language is a simple channel for communicating mental processes [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00757), [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00757)]. Attitudes and interests do not precede language, but emerge from discursive configurations and must be mobilized and made discursively available [ [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00757)]. Thus, DA is the study of language-in-use, or more precisely, how language is used to do things [ [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00757), [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00757)], because discourse is the main medium of action [ [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00757)]. The way in which language is used\u2014the choice of vocabulary, grammar, syntactic structure, style figures, rhetorical devices and the type of narrative construction\u2014produces consequences, sometimes unintentionally. Through language, explanations are given, justifications are offered, categories and members of these categories are created [ [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00757)] and power is legitimized [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00757)]. DA is an analysis of the functions of language. The aim of this research is to provide an insight into the main interpretative repertoires circulated and used in Romania for supporting child vaccination rejection. 2. Materials and Methods [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00757)] and were then taken over and developed by the promoters of DP. Repertoires represent building blocks speakers use for constructing versions of actions, cognitive processes and other phenomena [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00757)], similar to books on the shelves of a public library, metaphorically speaking [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00757)]. They represent linguistic resources in the form of a system of specific terms used in a specific stylistic and grammatical fashion [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00757)]. They have a culturally familiar character [ [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00757)], representing a basis for social understanding [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00757)]. Another important feature is the recurrent nature or the habitual and familiar character [ [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00757), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00757)], constituting linguistic resources that can be absorbed, circulated, refined and relaunched in the public space. [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00757)], I followed discursive sequences composed of a restricted range of terms used in a specific stylistic and grammatical fashion, organized around recurring themes [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00757)]. When people talk about a certain topic the same way, having the same lines of arguments, similar tropes and rhetoric devices indicate the existence of possible repertoires. 3. Results 3.1. Online Content Analysis 2017 (Online Repertoires 2017\u2014OR2017) 3.2. Online Content Analysis 2018 (Online Repertoires 2018\u2014OR2018) 3.3. First TV Show (TSR\u2014Talk Show Repertoires) I have nothing against vaccination. Today's vaccines have nothing in common with the vaccines we were vaccinated with, immunized in Ceausescu's time that came from the Cantacuzino Institute. In the vaccines of that time, if you had the opportunity to ask a pediatrician, maybe your next guest, he will tell you what the vaccines contained then, a doctor who caught both eras. What did the vaccines contain then and what does it contain today? How many children at that time had cancers and leukemia and how many have cancers and leukemia today? How harmful were the vaccines or what were the risks? We are talking...there are such cases it is true...we are talking about young girls aged 14,15,16 who had been injected with the vaccine against cervical cancer, young girls who were athletes, who were cheerleaders, were doing sports on daily basis, they were in perfect health and died from this vaccine. We must also say that in America there is a special court that judges such cases from its inception and until today compensation has been granted to vaccine victims, whether they were serious injuries or even deaths worth $4 billion. Do you know how such compensations are given? With evidence! 3.4. Second TV Show (TSR\u2014Talk Show Repertoires) We are fasting for Easter. That is in the first place. So, I really want a calm discussion and in no case from frond positions or...pros and cons...uh...I would like to place myself today in the position of a mother who has some doubts. Vaccines and Autoimmunity...a book written by medical researchers...Yehuda Shoenfeld is...global, his reputation is global, an undisputed immunologist and...I don't know if he can be challenged or is questionable...however...who raises some very pertinent question marks and then, if you are a responsible parent. There is no dilemma...look what he says...we can challenge any scientific researcher and based on this conclusion we can challenge the doctor here, we enter a dangerous carousel for anyone who has an opinion, yes? [What does this researcher say?]...He says so...it's about...First of all, it starts from the statement of William Gies who 100 years ago came to the conclusion [yes] through personal observations, scientific studies that the use of aluminium or any aluminium compound in food is a dangerous practice...[quoting from the book)...the toxicity of aluminium discussed here is usually manifested by learning disabilities, memory, concentration and of speech, so problems that autistic children and those who have diseases of this spectrum, through diseases of the motor system, intensification of seizures and behavioural changes and so on. Just a second. I just have to tell you that my best friend has an autistic child, right? After the vaccine. The day before he had a favourite game on the table, coloured cards were placed and the child identified the horse and so on, and the child said horse, horse, horse because he was ordered to identify the horse. The next day after the vaccine he didn't know what the horse was. Doctor, if there are no safety studies to show that these 4 \u00b5g are safe it means that we are playing with children's lives. Do you have any knowledge of any one study that shows that this proposed vaccination algorithm, that mandatory vaccines in our country are safe to be administered to children? All at once? But the doctor would do well to point out that there are two types of viruses, the wild-type virus and the vaccine-derived virus. You specified, or is it known whether the virus that infected those children came from the vaccine or is wild? To find out if it is not those that are vaccinated that make the unvaccinated sick?[The doctor discusses the existence of such studies on doctors who have been contaminated]Let me tell you, we are not sure that those children were infected with the wild-type virus and not the Varilix virus...This does not mean that we have the certainty that those children became ill with the wild virus. If no studies have been done...so please let us talk based on evidence, okay? On evidence and science. - Vaccines are harmful - Moral and epistemic higher ground of foreign authorities that recognized vaccine harmfulness - Moderation and reasonableness - Properly documented - Fragile children; victims of vaccines - Vaccines can cause the disease they are supposed to prevent 3.5. Interviews with Parents (IR\u2014Interview Repertoires) Have you seen or read what is written, out of curiosity...what is written on the vaccine leaflet? Well, when you read about aspirin, if you take the leaflet, you get scared. There are some things. Aaa and I received the argument, well yes, but the manufacturer is forced to put there everything. And isn't this a normal thing to do? Yes, he's too panicked, I don't think he's panicked at all, the man says what he saw when he tested the vaccine on his study groups, that is, there is what exists. Why would I put all these risks in a child's small body and why? Why would I do such a thing?I don't want my children to be in those 2% or in those rare cases because no one, no one guarantees you that it will be a...that he will not be in those cases, that is, no doctor will sign that the child will be ok after vaccination and as long as there is this small risk, I prefer my child to get the measles. Why a substance, that I do not know exactly what it contains, this is also a problem, that it contains aluminium, which is stored...I do not know how...that accumulates in...and there are too many question marks that create anxiety. Measles, rubella or flu vaccines...means...certain strains that are injected and you can make some easier form, but you can still get the disease, and I said to myself if I can still get the disease, many being childhood diseases, aaa...than no vaccination.What strikes me is that there are children with...I don't recall...yes...rotaviruses, and those children who are vaccinated and still got the disease as if they did not get any vaccine...No vaccination gives you immunity for life, only the disease gives you immunity for life. I think that this comparison with vaccines, that diseases have disappeared due to vaccines, that this is not the case, that hygiene has improved, that we live in an age when hygiene is very important and thus no one takes into account the hygiene conditions led to eradication of so many diseases...not necessarily vaccines. My biggest fear is polio, my husband says...yes but how many cases have you seen, it's eradicated, it's a whole medicine now, we don't live the conditions of decades agoI don't understand why she shouldn't be exposed to childhood diseases. I know a case...my colleague, uh, both children got chickenpox, and her husband of almost 40 years old also got chickenpox because he didn't have it as baby, and...very unpleasant, exactly, the children got through easily, the youngest one the easiest, the other child mmm harder, harder than the youngest, and the husband was...awful, he would not wish this to his worst enemy. And then why? One immunologist...I can't remember his name, I'll remember. He is Romanian and he said the following...he had an interview in 'Adevrul' a few years ago, that the immune system is the least known, how the immune system works, that is. Scientists know only such a superficial part, they do not know profusely how it works, all its mechanisms and he made a very interesting analogy with vaccines aaa...Imagine an elastic that you keep pulling, and what will happen in the end? It will get weaker. That is, if you give your immune system...you keep fooling him with these vaccines...and he is alerted, in real fights he will be weakened and...I liked this analogy made by a doctor. I do not have a specialized language, when I read, I understand the idea, but I cannot repeat the same...that these childhood diseases also have their role in the system. After having chickenpox or...you become stronger in the face of other diseases. I also read this...besides the fact that it offers you immunity for life, the immune system strengthens, because it goes through a real fight. I don't...so no one in the doctor's office told us if there was any adverse reaction, we asked her and she said that there will be no fever or irritability, that is, she was not open to tell us...well...look this can happen or look at the leaflet...But there are families who read clinical trials and if, before, I was a patient who, whatever, the doctor told me I would have followed to the letter, now there are so many situations when I received the wrong diagnosis, wrong medication and unfortunately people die from wrong medication. Yes, yes in the end I noticed that all doctors, scientists, who come with a different opinion, are a little, that is not a little, they are totally taken off the line, they are discredited, and then I cannot trust.There are studies that prove...were banned, banned, there were also publications in scientific research, journals, medicine, I don't know where in the USA it seems. and this is the thing that these studies that are done for vaccination and I don't know now are divided opinions, but I don't know if they are all made by independent companies, which have nothing to gain from this thing, and as we all know, the pharmaceutical industry is very profitable. Doubtful source of vaccines and there may be a lot of fake news, but as long as the Ministry of Health is not able to come and say 'Sir, this is the source, from there I took the vaccines, they were kept in these conditions, I distributed them like this', and I no longer trust the Romanian state.Let's align ourselves with the European Union, let's see, not in vain 20 countries have removed and banned the 'Infanrix' and use its alternative, yet we still do it. [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00757)]. These positions express a desire to be perceived as rational and responsible and can be interpreted as reactions to the accusations brought in the public space against antivaccinators as being irrational, uneducated and irresponsible. They are built as reactions of a minority: When I see that he has a high fever, I'm not just standing there, I have a subscription, I go to the emergency room. If the doctor tells me that he needs to be supervised, I'm ready to hospitalize him. I do NOT give him homeopathic pills leaving him with fever of 40 \u00b0C. Of course, I am also with allopathic medicine, with antibiotics.I personally do not recommend either to anyone, I only say why I have not vaccinated so far.I'm not against vaccination, I really think it's a very good thing, but I want a doctor to make sure it's 100% safe. [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00757)]. In this type of construction, parents make discursive efforts to demonstrate the quality and volume of sources they have investigated, positioning themselves in opposition to an artificially constructed category of 'those who believe anything they read on the internet'. For authors of sources they have consulted, parents provide scientific titles and describe previous contributions and biographies, sometimes in a hyperbolic manner. 3.6. Identified Repertories and Their Functions [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00757)], these repertoires allow parents to build an identity of the loving, responsible and rational parent, morally (and even rationally and scientifically) superior to governmental, medical and research authorities. [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00757-f001)). In presenting the danger posed by vaccines, there is a moral and epistemic dislocation, although the epistemic dislocation is made to a lesser extent. The repertoires of moral and epistemic dislocation contribute to a subtle and gradual preparation for replacement with one's own perspective and positioning. Similarly, the invocation of institutions such as American courts mainly serves to dismantle epistemic claims that support the safety of vaccines, but also fulfils the function of moral challenge by asserting the moral superiority of these types of courts. The repertoire regarding good documentation and lack of reliance upon the internet performs a moral legitimation (I do my duty to inform myself) and epistemic legitimation (I am well-informed from reliable sources). 4. Discussion [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00757)]. One of the main repertoires identified in this research was represented by the 'distrust' repertoires, in doctors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, authorities and medical research. The issue of distrust has been found by others to be one of the dominant attitudes of refusal or hesitation in the face of vaccination [ [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00757), [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00757)]. Similarly, other arguments and reasons, which resonates with the identified repertoires have been highlighted, such as fear of side effects [ [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00757), [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00757)] and the perception that children are too precious to subject to risk [ [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00757), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00757)]. Confirming the existence of these attitudes among the Romanian public is undoubtedly important. Through the present study, however, I have offered an image of the rejecting discourses, brought under the same umbrella and presented in the form of a pool of easily accessible resources. Repertoires are not treated as reflections of attitudes, but serve as ready-made functional discursive constructions, which can be easily employed without reflective effort. I therefore suggest the need for a dramatic reconsideration of the importance of language in understanding the ways in which social reality is constructed, decisions are substantiated and actions are performed. Although there are some notable studies which have used a discursive approach to explore the topic of vaccination [ [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00757), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00757), [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00757)], it is still an underemployed methodological approach in this field and could bring new perspectives on how the foundations of decisions are built and actions are taken. [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00757)], from positions of epistemic superiority or in sarcastic treatises [ [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00757), [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00757)]. Blume (2006) suggested that the refusal of vaccination should not only be seen as a result of the influence of the vaccine movement but rather as a consequence of a paradigm shift in public health ideology, according to which citizens have been encouraged to become responsible, informed, critical and empowered consumers [ [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00757)]. Kata (2012) referred to a postmodern approach that emphasizes patients' ability to inform themselves and to contribute to the knowledge base [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00757)]. The effects of this are represented by the delegitimization of expert authority, replaced by expertise of ordinary people. The identified repertoires not only confirmed such an approach, but also indicated the concrete way in which such ideological change is articulated at a discursive level. In this context, for citizens who are invited to be critical, informed and challenging, repertoires represent ready-made content in open circulation, morally and epistemically grounded, which can be accessed as discursive resources that allow them to become 'experts'. 5. The Limitations of the Study 6. Conclusions [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00757)]. This study is a starting point for future research into the importance of language for understanding health-related decisions and behaviors, especially in a world where the internet is a preferred source of information for many people.
