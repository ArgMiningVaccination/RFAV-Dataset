Our body and mind, while separate entities, maintain a mutual influence over each other. While our physical state and behaviors can impact our physical condition and vice versa; our minds can influence how healthy our bodies may or may not be. Think of how happy we may feel and how much we might smile when we recall enjoyable memories of our loved ones. Likewise, replaying a frightening, embarrassing or painful experience in our minds can speed up our heart rate, make us sweat and tie tight knots of despair in our stomachs. [These physical sensations](https://www.verywellmind.com/physical-pain-and-emotional-pain-22421) typically occur when the body, mind and spirit\u2014which share a deep connection\u2014are out of balance. [Nurturing the mind-body-spirit connection](https://www.recoveryranch.com/addiction-blog/healing-demands-mind-body-and-spirit/) can help us enter more resourceful states when encountering life's stressors. For this reason, holistic treatment can be effective for people who need relief from addiction and substance abuse, and their underlying psychological issues. Understanding that overcoming addiction requires a dedicated, focused approach that addresses a person's body, mind and spirit, The Ranch Tennessee provides [a range of holistic healing options](https://www.recoveryranch.com/addiction-treatment-center-programs-nashville-tn/holistic-addiction-treatment-centers/) guided by trained, experienced, skilled and compassionate addiction recovery experts. What Are Holistic Practices? Per the belief in the mind-body connection, interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors can determine the causes, development and outcomes of physical illnesses. Our bodies and minds communicate chemically, explaining why we are more likely to be happier and enjoy a better physical state when our mind is at peace. At the same time, we can literally and figuratively ache when physical, mental, emotional or situational disasters strike. Stress can accompany negative and positive life events, ultimately affecting our emotional health. Whether a person is going through a divorce or enjoying newly wedded bliss, experiencing foreclosure, or purchasing their first home, their body, mind and spirit respond to this stress. Giving equal attention to an individual's mind, body and feelings during therapy and treatment, which holistic therapy practices do, is imperative. Holistic practices are a safe combination of traditional treatments and alternative treatment methods used to prevent and treat illness and promote optimal health. This form of therapy typically considers and incorporates a person's physical, emotional, spiritual, environmental and nutritional state as well as their lifestyle. One crucial element of holistic healing, especially as the experts practice it at The Ranch Tennessee, is that it focuses on patient education and getting them engaged and participating in their healing process with their whole self. Holistic Healing, Emotional Health, and Recovery Holistic medicine aims to address a person in their entirety: their mind, body and spirit. With its consideration of the mind-body connection, holistic therapy can benefit an individual's emotional health. [Components of emotional health](https://www.apa.org/topics/emotions) include: - A person's ability to manage their feelings - How a person feels about themselves - A person's overall psychological well-being - The ability to develop positive coping skills and utilize them - The quality of an individual's interpersonal relationships at home and at work Emotional health is an essential part of an individual's total health, as being emotionally healthy relates to being able to control one's feelings, thoughts and behaviors. When striving to develop good emotional health, it's important to remember that being emotionally healthy does not mean being happy all the time\u2014and being happy all the time is not a requirement for having a good, healthy life. Instead, having good emotional health means better coping with life's stressors and challenges, keeping your problems in check, and successfully [bouncing back from setbacks](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-resilience#1). An emotionally healthy person does not try to avoid their feelings, nor feel like they must rely on drugs or alcohol to numb them. Instead, they're aware of their emotions and can deal with the positive, the negative and anything in between. When practicing good emotional health, a person can tell when a stressful situation or problem they encounter is too much for them to handle alone. Whether they're dealing with everyday hurdles or they're struggling to fight the urge to use drugs or alcohol, they know when to confide in a loved one for support and when to seek help from a professional. In essence, emotional attunement can be a skill, one that can be developed through holistic healing. Benefits Associated With Holistic Therapy Holistic healing can be effective in a wide range of situations. It can benefit people who may be dealing with substance abuse, trauma, disordered eating, behavioral problems or mental illnesses because it aims to support and improve the health of the mind-body system in its entirety rather than target specific functions or areas of the body. Emphasizing the importance of the entire body can ultimately allow holistic therapy methods to enhance specific, sick areas of the body while improving the body's condition overall. Benefits of holistic healing include, but are not limited to: - An enhancement of the body's natural healing abilities - An increased desire for healthy and happy living - Diminished depression symptoms - Reduced stress and anxiety - The adoption of lifestyle and behavioral changes and healthy habits - Disease and disorder prevention - A stronger body with the ability to withstand the onset of physical, psychological or behavioral conditions more easily Understanding Holistic Addiction Treatment Programs Designed to enable the entire body to recover from the effects of addiction or a mental health concern, the holistic therapy programs offered at this center incorporate elements of recovery that traditional therapy options may miss. For instance, through these programs, patients are provided with conventional modalities of treatment like individual therapy, group therapy, family therapy and holistic modalities that enable them to express their feelings and thoughts comfortably.
