From an infrastructure standpoint, pipelines have transformed the way we live by bringing resources to people and communities. In business, a pipeline can cause an organization to transform strategies based on \"what's to come.\" At Cincinnati Children's, our pipeline of new technologies\u2014an array of therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices, healthcare IT and research tools\u2014offers promise and potential to transform patient lives and the healthcare industry. This year, we've seen a lot of encouraging changes in both the healthcare landscape as well as within our institution, and specifically our pipeline of innovations. While securing traditional funding for early stage research has become more and more difficult, it's caused research institutions and pharma and biotech companies to work together to ensure innovative research has the resources it needs to be commercially viable. This trend has caused us to create internal funding programs like our Innovation Fund; as well as, pursue risk-sharing models of collaboration with our industry partners, like our rare disease collaboration with Alexion Pharmaceuticals. We've also seen\u2014and are embracing\u2014the future of gene therapy and its game-changing potential. We're excited about Dr. Punam Malik's corrective gene therapy for Sickle Cell Disease, which has entered its Phase I/II clinical trial and the many other gene therapy technologies currently under development in our labs. We continue to see promising therapeutics and diagnostics enter our pipeline as well as innovative software and healthcare IT solutions. We're developing commercialization strategies around these technologies individually as well as by therapeutic area. We believe smart collaborations are key to advancing our technologies from the bench to the bedside, and together, with our partners, we continue to strive to be the leader in pediatric healthcare innovations. Niki Robinson, PhD Assistant Vice PresidentInnovations Report \"pipeline offers promise...potential\" \"smart collaborations are key\" 4 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONResearch & Discovery We are very fortunate at Cincinnati Children's to have some of the world's most innovative researchers and clinicians, focused on nearly every area of life science. Here is a snapshot of just a few of our faculty members that are filling our pipeline with novel technologies capable of changing the outcome for patients in Cincinnati and around the world. Distribution of Funding FY2014 FY 2014STATE 1% OTHER 10% INDUSTRY 11% FEDERAL PLANS TO ESTABLISH A CENTER FOR SYSTEMS IMMUNOLOGY Our new Director of Immunobiology brings a strong dose of pri - vate sector experience to Cincinnati Children's as we transform the research methods that support new drug development. Harinder Singh, PhD, joined us this fall after working since 2009 in the Department of Discovery Immunology at Genentech in San Francisco, where his roles included overseeing drug dis - covery and development projects. Before that, he worked for six years at the University of Chicago, where he was the Louis Block Professor of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, an in - vestigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Chair of the Committee on Immunology. Our reconstituted Division of Immunobiology includes 15 faculty members who study the complex molecular mechanisms at work in the body's immune system. Their work is advancing our understanding of allergic asthma, type 1 diabetes, non-alco - holic fatty liver disease, and how the immune system responds to many other diseases. Singh is an expert on regulatory molecules that enable pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells to generate various cells of the immune system. His group has identified key regulatory proteins that control cell generation in the immune system. Now his group is looking for candidate compounds that can influence how these proteins function, which could lead to improved treat - ments for a number of immune-related diseases. Singh also is working to bring an important new element to the division: a Center for Systems Immunology. This growing area of research, fueled by recent leaps in computing power, explores how large networks of genes interact as systems rather than studying the functions of one gene at a time. By apply - ing this approach, Singh and colleagues hope to identify entirely new targets for drug development. Singh earned his PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Bi - ology in 1984 from Northwestern University and completed a post-doctoral fellowship in cancer research at the Massachu - setts Institute of Technology in 1988. He has authored more than 50 research papers, articles and book chapters and served as editor of Molecular and Cel -lular Biology from 1997-2007. He has presented at scientific meetings throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia and was a member of the Board of Scientific Counselors for the Na - tional Cancer Institute. Singh also currently serves as an advisor to the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. 6 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONCincinnati Children's has added more firepower to its already extensive team of experts in sickle cell disease. Russell Ware, MD, PhD, joined us in 2013 as our Director of Hematology and Executive Co-Director of the Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute. He also serves as Associate Director of our Center for Child Global Health. Ware is an expert in sickle cell disease who has published more than 225 peer-reviewed articles and has personally trained dozens of students and fellows. Ware's research interests focus on expanded use of hydroxyurea among children with sickle cell to manage iron overloads, prevent strokes, and improve quality of life, especially in Africa where more than 75 percent of chil - dren with sickle cell are born. \"If we really want to make an impact on this disease, we need to go outside the United States,\" Ware says.In 2014, Ware will launch three research projects in Africa to improve outcomes for children with sickle cell: a disease map - ping study in Uganda; a hydroxyurea clinical trial in Uganda; and another hydroxyurea study to involve up to 450 children in An - gola, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo. At Cincinnati Children's, Ware's plans include expanding the Division of Hematology's research portfolio and building upon the national and international prominence of its clinicians. Ware received his medical degree from Duke University and completed his pediatric residency at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. He completed a fellowship in pe - diatric hematology and oncology and a PhD in Immunology at Duke University. Russell began his academic career at Duke be - fore moving to St. Jude Children's Hospital, then Baylor, where he served as chief of hematology.WARE LEADS GLOBAL CLINICAL TRIALS TO HELP PEOPLE WITH SICKLE CELL DISEASE Research & discoveryCINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/CTC 7Research & discovery Be it the nation's largest study of pediatric migraines, evaluating the best drugs to treat epilepsy, or groundbreaking advances against tuberous sclerosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Cincinnati Children's is a global leader in developing better treat - ments for pediatric neurologic conditions. Andrew Hershey, MD, PhD, FAHS, leads a division that has grown from five faculty members in 1997 to 38 in 2014. Since 2008, annual research funding for the division has doubled to nearly $10 million and the results of this work have had signifi - cant impact. A continuing large-scale study of children with absence epi - lepsy, led by Tracy Glauser, MD, has changed how physicians nationwide prescribe medications for this condition. Life ex - pectancy for young men with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is growing thanks to innovative multi-disciplinary care approaches led by Brenda Wong, MBBS, MRCP .Researchers Darcy Krueger, MD, PhD, and David Neal Franz, MD, have led studies establishing the critical role played by the mTOR molecular pathway in tuberous sclerosis (TS). This work has led to breakthrough clinical trials that demonstrate the ability of the drugs everolimus and rapamycin to shrink TS tu - mors in the brain and throughout the body. Previously, these tumors could be treated only with surgery. Now a $12 million study involving 40 medical centers is tackling the long-overlooked problems caused by pediatric mi - graine headaches. This research - led by Hershey and Scott Powers, PhD -- will compare the effectiveness of two commonly prescribed treatments -- topiramate and amitriptyline. \"Pediatric migraine is one of the five most prevalent child - hood disorders in the United States,\" Hershey says. \"Yet so far, there are no FDA-approved medications to prevent childhood migraines.\" RESEARCH PRODUCES BREAKTHROUGHS IN TREATING NEUROLOGIC CONDITIONS REDUCING THE RISK OF 'SUPERBUGS' Cincinnati Children's is working to ensure that kids with bacterial infections receive the safest, most effective treatment thanks to infectious disease expert David Haslam, MD. Haslam, who joined Cincinnati Children's Division of Infec - tious Diseases last year, heads our Antimicrobial Stewardship program. The program's goal is to lessen the use of broad- spectrum antibiotics by encouraging doctors to prescribe bet - ter-targeted antibiotic therapies. Haslam will work with the hospital's clinical pharmacists, using an innovative software tool, Vigilanz. Cincinnati Children's is the only pediatric hospital currently employing the program. The tool allows them to identify in real time patients with bacte - rial infections, which medications they are receiving and whether those medications are the most effective. In cases where there might be a better alternative, the team will recommend alterna - tives. \"The point is to reduce the use of the 'big gun' broad-spec - trum antibiotics that we know are not effective and might be more harmful in the long-term,\" Haslam says. Widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has proven to be less effective and is giving rise to \"superbugs,\" bacteria that don't respond to treatment. Haslam says it's easy to understand why doctors want to knock out infections as quickly as possible, but newer studies are showing that better targeted therapies are just as effective without the \"superbug\" effect. 8 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION Disclosures The result of innovative research in our labs is innovative new technologies being developed. When our office becomes aware of discoveries that have the potential to improve patient out - comes\u2014whether it is a therapeutic, diagnostic, medical device, software, or a research tool\u2014 we get involved. A new technology disclosure enters our sys - tem and is assigned to a dedicated Technology Manager who is responsible for assessing the technology and determining its commercial po - tential. This year, we received more than 180 new technology disclosures. We've seen year-over- year growth in nearly every category, which is a positive trend.

Innovation Fund projects can receive up to $200,000 over two years and must meet commercially relevant milestones. Projects can be therapeutics, diagnostics, medical devices, or software/IT. As an institution, Cincinnati Children's takes a hands-on approach to ensuring its most prom - ising research projects have the resources they need to advance to a point where they're ready for commercialization. Cincinnati Children's real - izes the critical nature of funding for each step in the commercialization pathway, from idea incep -tion to licensing or venture investment. To that end, Cincinnati Children's created many inter - nal funding programs, detailed below, that aim to advance commercially-promising early stage ideas to the point where they may be licensed or the basis of a start-up company. Research Advancement Innovative Funding Programs Drive Discoveries Towards CommercializationCINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/CTC 17Cincinnati Children's Innovation FundMargaret K Hostetter, MD Development of Peptide Vaccines and Antibodies to Prevent Central Line Infections The goal of this project is to advance development of an antibody shown to prevent biofilm formation and Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infec - tions (CLABSIs). The current antibody is effective against Candida and current research is underway to test against Staphylococcus Epidermidis and Au - reus. This project is being evaluated for licensing and start-up opportunities. Peter Margolis, MD, PhD & Michael Seid, PhD The C3N Portal for Personalized Collaborative Care Peter Margolis, MD, PhD and Michael Seid, PhD have built a personalized care portal. This technology is a collaborative learning system for patients, clinicians and researchers to support personalized care by integrating patient reported data with clinical data and using the data to drive decision making. This technology has been licensed to a company in California. John Perentesis, MD Next-Generation Clinical Trials Management Software: Natural Language Processing to Identify Adverse Events in Clinical Trials The costs and manpower required to test new drugs in clinical trials remains a major obstacle for getting new drugs to the bedside. This project is a revo - lutionary new approach addressing a significant unmet clinical need by devel - oping a novel computer based approach to directly analyze medical records for patients enrolled on clinical trials. John Pestian, PhD Thought Markers as a Predictor of Repeated Suicide Attempts This technology can identify suicidal patients with 90% accuracy using natural language processing and analysis, ultimately reducing suicide attempts and improving treatment . An additional grant of $50,000 was awarded to this project through the Technology Validation and Start-Up Fund (TVSF) through the Ohio Development Services Agency. This technology has recently been successfully optioned by a personalized medicine company. Hector Wong, MD The Pediatric Sepsis Biomarker Risk Model Hector Wong, MD has developed a technology that reliably identifies patients with septic shock at low/high risk for poor outcomes through effective strati - fication in septic shock, revolutionizing patient-centered decision support, clinical trials and quality assurance efforts. This technology has been spun out into a start-up company named Persepsys. Yi Zheng, PhD Novel Anti-inflammatory Drug Targeting NOX2 in Acute Lung Injury The goal of this project is to develop a novel class of anti-inflammatory drugs that specifically target neutrophil NOX2 to ameliorate lung damage by Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Optimiza - tion of lead NOX2-I inhibitors is complete and efficacy is being tested. This project has received additional commercialization funding through the NCAI project.ROUND 1 PROJECT UPDATES THE FOLLOWING PROJECTS WERE FUNDED DURING THE INAUGURAL INNOVATION FUND THAT TOOK PLACE IN 2012. HERE IS A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE THE PROJECTS CURRENTLY STAND IN YEAR 2 OF THE PROJECT. 18 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONresearch advancement Lee Denson, MD Ileal Transcriptome Analysis as a Diagnostic and Prognostic Tool in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Lee Denson, MD is developing a diagnostic technology that uses genetic signatures and computer algorithms to delineate between the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis. The incidence of IBD in children has doubled over the last decade. This technology is designed to address a critical unmet need for a novel diagnostic and prognostic tool. Charles Dumoulin, PhD Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Charles Dumoulin, PhD has developed a novel neonatal MRI scanner to meet the diagnostic needs of fragile newborn babies at risk of injury during trans - port from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to radiology for diagnostic scans. The smaller scanner, which can be housed right in the NICU and pro - vide closer, quieter and improved imaging quality, is expected to have a major impact in improving care for premature babies. This technology is in start-up due diligence. William Hardie, MD Targeting the P70S6K in Pulmonary Fibrosis William Hardie, MD is studying the 6 ribosomal protein kinase (p70S6K) as a potential pharmacological target in treating pulmonary fibrosis. In-vivo and in-vitro testing has been completed, and Hardie will soon be testing the effi - cacy of p70S6K inhibition in reversing established and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in mouse models. Punam Malik, MD An Improved Fetal Hemoglobin for Genetic Correction of Sickle Cell Disease This project aims to build upon previous research that may offer the possibility of a one-time treatment for sickle cell disease resulting in a lifelong correc - tion. Punam Malik, MD has since engineered an improved - globin gene that has a higher tendency to form HbF and has improved antisickling properties, resulting in superior correction of SCD. Malik is studying the mechanism of its improved antisickling activity and has recently initiated a Phase I clinical trial. Senthil Sadhasivam, MD, MPH Personalizing Pain Management with Opioids: Preemptive Risk Assessment, Personalized Decision Support and Point-of-Care Genotyping This project is focused on the development of rapid-point-of care gene chip that allows physicians to precisely tailor the use of opioids for pain manage - ment in perioperative patients. Inadequate pain relief and side effects from perioperative opioids occur in up to 50 percent of patients. This technology has the potential to address a critical unmet medical need by using informa - tion on genetic variability in patients to prescribe precise, safe and effective pain medication. Hector Wong, MD Interleukin-27 as a Novel Diagnostic Biomarker for Sepsis This project aims to further test and validate a novel diagnostic biomarker (IL- 27) for rapid and early identification of sepsis in patients. Current diagnostic methods using microbiologic cultures can be imprecise and time consuming. Successful development of IL-27 as a novel diagnostic biomarker for sepsis would allow more prompt intervention with antibiotic therapy. A start-up com - pany, Persepsys, has been created out of this technology. ROUND 2 PROJECT UPDATES THE FOLLOWING PROJECTS WERE FUNDED DURING THE SECOND ROUND OF THE INNOVATION FUND THAT TOOK PLACE IN 2013. THE GREATER CINCINNATI FOUNDATION SUPPORTED THIS ROUND WITH A $100,000 GRANT. HERE IS A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE THE PROJECTS CURRENTLY STAND IN YEAR 1 OF THE PROJECT. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/CTC 19research advancement Ming Tan, PhD Multivalent vaccines against norovirus, rotavirus, hepatitis E virus and astrovirus Ming Tan, PhD is developing a vaccine to combat norovirus, rotavirus, hep - atitis E virus and astrovirus, which cause epidemics of gastroenteritis and hepatitis that affect millions of people each year. Except for vaccines against rotavirus, there is no FDA proven vaccine or antiviral against these pathogens. Lee Grimes, PhD Inhibitors of STAT5 This project is working to develop new pharmaceutical compounds that tar - get a molecule called STAT5, which plays a role in the progression of multiple cancers, including acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. Michael Jordan, MD Exploiting the DNA damage response to develop new therapies for immunologic diseases Michael Jordan, MD has developed a targeted method of suppressing harm - ful immune responses by taking advantage of how immune cells called lym - phocytes respond to DNA damage. Jordan's team is working on a way to target activated immune cells so that undesirable immune responses are sup - pressed while helpful immune responses are allowed to proceed. Prasad Devarajan, MD Hermine Brunner, MD have developed a blood test that detects the onset of kidney damaging lupus nephritis. This project aims to develop a practical clinical platform for the test to make the diagnosis faster and more accurate while improving quality of life and patient experience for the more than 1.5 million children and young adults with lupus nephritisROUND 3 PROJECT UPDATES THE PROJECTS HERE WERE FUNDED AS PART OF THE FY14 FUNDING ROUND AND ARE CURRENTLY IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF FUNDING. 20 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONresearch advancement The Ben-Gurion Cincinnati Children's Collaborative (BG3C) is a collaborative between Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Is - rael and Cincinnati Children's. The collaboration addresses the lack of medical devices designed specifically for children and identifies projects that need to be funded beyond design and development. The project combines the medical expertise of physicians at Cincinnati Children's with the extensive technical and engineering capabilities of faculty at BGU. The goal is to im - prove health outcomes by ensuring device design is customized to meet the unique physiological differences and medical needs of children. The collaboration identifies and funds projects that meet a medical need and have a strong pathway to commercial - ization. Each project receives up to $100,000 in funds. Jeffrey Whitsett, MD (CCHMC) & Joseph Kost (BGU) Surfactant Delivery Device The device consists of a delivery system for prolonged administration of surfactants to the lungs of premature babies using nanoparticles. Current procedures do not allow for the sustained release of proteins or other complex particles in the alveoli of infants or adults. This technology would do that, with the potential to deliver numerous therapies to the lower airway through a non-inflammatory delivery system.Ben-Gurion University Cincinnati Children's Collaborative (BG3C) (CCHMC) & Hugo Guterman (BGU) Image Guided Needle Insertion Device The Human Assisted Needle Delivery System (HANDS) is a handheld medical device that links the sophistication of advanced imaging technology with the precision and accuracy of robotic guidance to provide targeted, accurate needle access to a particular site in the body. HANDS is designed to be a small and relatively inexpensive device that can reliably pinpoint a clinician's vascular target. A prototype of the device has been built and an additional grant of $50,000 was awarded to this project through the Technology Validation and Start-Up Fund (TVSF) through the Ohio Development Services Agency.research advancement Thomas Inge, MD (CCHMC) & Amir Shapiro (BGU) Clamp for Stabilization/Uniformity of Traction of Stomach during Sleeve Gastrectomy This project aims to build an improved clamp for use during sleeve gastrectomy surgery. This clamp will have innovative graspers with long jaws and a bending joint above the jaws, and a flexible plastic cover sleeve from the jaws tip up to the handle. This flexible sleeve will be disposable and sterile. This novel device will allow for uniform traction and exposure (visualization) of the stapler target region during this procedure. Richard Azizkhan, MD & Lester W. Martin (CCHMC) & Ibrahim Abdulhalim (BGU) Smart Sensing Catheter The device provides immediate and continuous assessment of the metabolic and physiological profile of critically ill infants and small children. Secondarily, this technology will reduce the need for repeated tests, thus reducing costs for the health system and society. Catheter utilization is widespread; therefore, this technology has the potential for broader application in the adult market. 22 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONCOLLABORATIVE COMMERCIALIZATION GRANTThe NIH Centers for Accelerated Innovation (NCAI)research advancement The NIH Centers for Accelerated Innovation (NCAIs) is aimed at identifying technologies and moving them through the com - mercialization pathway. The NCAI is an award that was granted to the Cleveland Clinic Innovation Accelerator and partnering institutions: Cincinnati Children's, The Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine; Case Western Reserve University, The Ohio State University, and University of Cincinnati. The NCAI, funded by the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), tar - gets technologies to improve the diagnosis, treatment, manage - ment, and prevention of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders and diseases. The effort is part of a major initiative to improve how basic science advances and discoveries are translated into com - mercially viable products that improve patient care and advance public health. Funding for projects is used for product discovery or development-related activities, high throughput screening, product definition studies, preclinical studies, feasibility studies, prototype development, proof-of-concept or validation stud - ies. NCAI funds awarded to projects at Cincinnati Children's re - ceive matching funds from the institution. From the first round of awards Yi Zheng, PhD, received a grant for his Novel Anti- inflammatory Drug Targeting NOX2 in Acute Lung Injury project. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/CTC 23research advancement InnovIG is a synergistic collaboration between CincyTech's Imagining Fund and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center's Innovation Fund. Through the InnovIG program CincyTech works with Cincinnati Children's Innovation Fund awarded projects that are not yet licensed, and provides them each with a CincyTech Imagining Grant of up to $45,000. The funding is used to assess the critical needs and proof points that will lead to commercialization or a start- up recommendation for the technologies. Activities conducted using this funding include market analysis, value proposition, regulatory pathway analysis, operational requirements, IP review, and Remaining R&D/IP proof points needed to engender start-up phase. To be considered for this funding a project must have an Innovation Fund. InnovIG Grants Collaboration between CincyTech and the Cincinnati Children's Innovation Fund Through the CTC, Cincinnati Children's has received three Ohio Third Frontier Technology Validation and Start-up Fund (TVSF) grants. The TVSF grants are in support of protected technologies developed at Cincinnati Children's that need known validation that will directly impact and enhance both their commercial viability and ability to support a start-up company. The three Cincinnati Children's projects are the Suicide Risk Index, NICU MRI, and the HANDS project. Each project receives $100,000 in total funded, matched 1:1 from Cincinnati Children's and the Ohio Third Frontier. These funds provide crucial support in validating innovations and pushing them to commercialization. Technology Validation & Start-up Fund Grant Ohio Development Services Agency GrantsThe Tomorrow Fund is a program through the Ohio Third Frontier with matching funds from Cincinnati Children's for pre-seed funding for Ohio based start-up companies. The Tomorrow Fund continues the pipeline of funding for early stage innovations by investing in a select number of commercially viable technologies that meet specified criteria for company formation by Cincinnati Children's. With input by experienced investment professionals in the SW Ohio region, funds are invested in companies spun out of Cincinnati Children's innovations. To date, with Tomorrow Fund I and II, $6.4 million has been invested in 7 stat-up companies. Funds I/II have successfully attracted investments of over $70 million while creating over 200 jobs with an average annual wage of $109,546. In June, 2014, Cincinnati Children's received funding from the Ohio Third Frontier to initiate Tomorrow Fund III, a $6 million fund. Tomorrow Fund III builds on the accomplishments of Tomorrow Funds I/II and provides greater resources to capitalize on Cincinnati Children's growing pipeline of qualified opportunities and increased financial commitment to pre-company development.Tomorrow Fund Ohio Third Frontier Pre-Seed Program Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine The Ohio State University Cincinnati Children'sCase Western Reserve University Cleveland Clinic Innovation Accelerator University of Cincinnati24 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONAvailable Technologies Our portfolio of available technologies is com - prised of more than 50 therapeutics, diagnos - tics, medical devices, and software products.

The CTC is actively pursuing industry collaborations across all therapeutic areas and is open to risk- sharing models. Here are a sampling of some of our recent industry collaborations and commer - cialization successes: CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/CTC 27Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Cincinnati Children's recently an - nounced a research collaboration that will leverage the early stage research and clinical expertise of a leading pediatric in - stitution with the drug development experience and capabili - ties of an industry leader. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will have the opportunity to fund selected research programs through the Alexion Rare Disease Innovation Fund. Following completion of the funded research programs, Alexion will have an exclu - sive option to enter into a licensing agreement for these pro - grams. The Alexion fund is a focused opportunity within Cin - cinnati Children's broader Innovation Fund, which covers all therapeutic areas and technology types. Alexion will focus its selections based on the company's specialty of developing new treatments for complex and rare diseases.ALEXION AND CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S LAUNCH RARE DISEASE INNOVATION FUND The second annual Rare Disease Partnering Summit was held at the Biotechnology Industry Organization's (BIO) convention that took place in June of 2014 in San Diego. The event, a col - laboration between Cincinnati Children's and Children's Hospital Los Angeles, brought together leading companies and research institutions working in the rare disease space to form meaningful collaborations focused on discovering and advancing life-saving therapies. The success of this event highlighted the important need for collaboration between industry and academia, particularly in the rare disease space. The event was sponsored by Rare Disease Therapeutics, REDI Cincinnati, NPS Pharma and Nixon Peabody.CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S CO-HOSTS RARE DISEASE PARTNERING RECEPTION AT BIO 2014 Cincinnati Children's has entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Diagnovus for its technology shown to diag - nose eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic upper gastroin - testinal disorder. The technology, developed by Marc Rothen - berg, MD, PhD, looks at the expression levels of a focused panel of genes to identify patients with EoE. The currently available test, ENGAUGE\u00ae GI-EoE, is a gene expression based assay that can quickly and accu - rately diagnose patients with EoE, independent of eosinophil count. ENGAUGE\u00ae GI-EoE can also aid in the identification of patients who are negative for EoE due to steroid-induced remission, which can assist physicians in developing treatment strategies. ENGAUGE\u00ae GI-EoE is highly sensitive, specific, cost effective and is accurate in both children and adults. This test uses routine FFPE biopsy material and does not require an additional endoscopy and biopsy procedure.DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR EOSINOPHILIC DIAGNOVUS 28 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONCollaborations & Successes What started as a simple project to implement CRM software to improve the business development and marketing efforts of the CTC, turned into a CRM Solution File that has the potential to change the way research institutions market their available technologies to industry. The CRM Solution File, licensed to Aspect, allows an in - stitution to capture the Areas of Interest of a company and run a report against its portfolio of available technologies that are categorized based on the same Areas of Interest, thus providing a \"Matching Report\" that shows exactly what technologies the institution should share with the company. \"We needed to be very targeted in what technologies we put in front of a potential partner,\" said Chris Stahl, Business De - velopment Manager for the CTC and one of the primary inven - tors on this project. \"In order to do that, we needed to be using the same language when we talked about a company's Areas of Interest and our available technologies.\" As the CTC continued to refine the platform, it was apparent that there was value in other technology transfer offices having access to a solution like this. \"We knew that if other institutions started interacting with pharma and biotech companies with this level of efficiency, it would improve the industry as a whole,\" Stahl added. \"And that's what ultimately led us to license the technology back to Aspect, who has the infrastructure in place to be able to offer the tailored solution to tech transfer offices anywhere in the world.\" The CTC was honored to be nominated for and win a Mi - crosoft Health Users Group Innovation Award in the category of Innovation in Infrastructure Optimization for the Solution File. CTC LICENSES CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGER (CRM) SOLUTION FILE FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, WINS MICROSOFT INNOVATION AWARD Cincinnati Children's and Sirona Biochem signed a Letter of In - tent and subsequently a License Agreement to create an anti- aging skin care treatment that combines Cincinnati Children's patented synthetic vernix technology created by Marty Visscher, PhD and Sirona Biochem's patented cell preservation glycopro - tein. Sirona will lead the development, with support from Cincin - nati Children's, of the anti-aging cream incorporating the propri - etary technologies of each organization. The resulting new anti- aging product will be patented with the goal of licensing the new technology to a global leader in the cosmetic and consumer packaged good marketplaces. Right: An infant is shown shortly after birth with some vernix still intact - vernix provides incredible protection to the skin while a baby is in utero. SYNTHETIC VERNIX TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO SIRONA BIOCHEM Cincinnati Children's spinout Assurex Health sees unprecedented growth and doesn't plan on slowing down anytime soon In 2006, Assurex Health was founded based on technol - ogy from Cincinnati Children's and Mayo Clinic with the hopes of changing the outcome for patients suffering from behavioral health conditions. Assurex Health's proprietary technology, with six issued worldwide patents and eight more in process, helps clinicians determine the right drug for individual patients through pharmacogenomics, evi - dence-based medicine, and clinical pharmacology. Assurex Health is experiencing growth on many fronts; here are a few areas of key growth and impact: Grew from zero employees in 2006 to 200+ today Launched with approximately $500,000 in seed stage funding and have currently brought more than $45MM in equity and debt investments into the region Expanded its GeneSight\u00ae product portfolio from one to four:Collaborations & Successes ASSUREX HEALTH: FROM ZERO TO 200 GeneSight\u00ae Psychotropic This test analyzes genes that may affect a patient's response to antidepressant and antipsychotic medications.
