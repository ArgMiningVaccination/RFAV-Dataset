More Dems than Reps, but it's pretty clear that the majority of Reps are still complying with the mandates and that removing the mandates isn't going to win over the other side. - As for how dangerous the Reps are when not pandered to, the Capitol Hill riot is the result of not taking them seriously. The police tend to be more sympathetic to the Right than the Left for reasons, and so there weren't nearly enough officers on the Hill, nor were the officers threatening or tear-gassing the protesters the way they would had the rally been mostly Left-wing weirdos. Had the Capitol Hill had as much security as, say, they did during the BLM rallies and been treated in a similar manner, the traitorsprotestors would not have charged the Capitol building, and if they did, they would've been turned into hamburger-meat by all the bullets.

I find all three of these statements exhausting and filled with frustrating half-truths. Taken together, it seems that those most to the left are whole sale attacking the administration because they would even entertain negotiation. I agree, the minimum wage needs to be increased, and there are serious policies being discussed by Manchin (D-WV) and Romney (R-UT) [[1]](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-manchins-11-minimum-wage-more-popular-bidens-15among-democrats-republicans-1573489) that would increase the wage more slowly but then tie it inflation. Why is it that several liberals seem willing to torpedo good policy because it doesn't fit exactly with their catchy phrase, and abandon a willing policy partner for some bollocks political purity. More people support a higher minimum wage, but are more supportive of $11 than $15. They can literally deliver Americans a raise, but won't get out of their own way.- [RipCityLiberal](/wiki/User:RipCityLiberal) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:RipCityLiberal)) 00:00, 4 March 2021 (UTC) - No matter how high you set the minimum wage, it won't be applied to people working under the table...

Communism is in theory as Left-Wing as you could get, but in practice every Communist country was rebranded Feudalism, with different names for King (Chairman), Noble (Party Member), and Peasant (Worker). In theory, property was owned by all, but when the property's use and the fruits of labor is decided for all by just the senior party members, well, that's basically Nobility with a new name. All historical Communist countries collapsed into the Feudal system regardless of how they started, and it's highly probable that Communism itself is unworkable. So would Communist Russia/China of the 1960s truly be \"Left\" as they pretend they are, or are they just a far-Right group pretending to be Left-Wing? Horseshoe theory and all... - But anyway, the US is actually \"far Left\" when compared to the globe when it comes to things like \"Welfare\", \"Pollution Controls\", \"Worker's Rights\", etc. Even when restricted to \"rich\" countries, Workers Rights and Pollution Controls are an absolute joke in South Africa, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Mid-East, Japan still hasn't figured out how to integrate women into the workforce (if you think sexual harassment in the US is bad...), and really, the sum-total of European countries that are to the Left of the US are still fewer people than the US itself.

You have to be well compensated if laid off and to be fired with cause requires an extremely good reason. Minimum wage is high in most countries compared with the cost of living. Maternity leave is far more generous than the US and most countries have paternity leave. Most countries have generous sick leave with a few countries having unlimited sick leave with generous support from the government if you become chronically ill. Most Western European countries have generous programs to help the disabled work and will even pay for university education while you are unemployed. Unemployment is also generous in most countries and when that runs out is replaced with welfare programs far more generous than the US. Unionisation is generally at a higher rate. Every Western EU countries have strong laws about discrimination and being fired based on race, gender or sexuality (the last one many US states do not have).

As the general concept of \"left\" vs \"right\" from this lens is between safety nets and equality (left) vs promotion of capitalism (right), it is fairly clear that from this framing, Europe is certainly more \"left\" than the USA as a general rule, although this of course obscures many details. (Yes, some countries tend to have more rules avoidance. Some don't.) The European and US meaning of \"left\" and \"right\" seem similar enough where direct comparison is possible. But, to give an example of where terms can differ, in the US, \"liberal\" tends to be both a [snarl word](/wiki/Snarl_word)and a self-identification directed at those seeking social justice, equality, or enhanced safety nets. Where in my experience, in Europe, typically \"liberal\" is used as a [snarl word](/wiki/Snarl_word)and a self-identification for laissez-faire capitalists. Who knows how the political neologisms and tribes have evolved in other nations, it is fair to guess that \"left\" and \"right\" might not even apply over in Asia, South America, etc. It is fair to note that a lot of places in the world have neither competitive capitalism or safety nets and equality, of course.

In other words they can only rely on the US maternity leave laws which are pretty meagre to begin with. Does that mean that because 12 states have no rules that we can dismiss the value of the maternity leave laws in the other countries? Would that make the US's more generous maternity leave than in say, Pakistan...not particularly impressive? That's ridiculous. Of course not just in the aggregate but in the high numbers of people who have maternity leave it is of a much higher level than in Pakistan even though in a few states they don't have extra benefits. - Participation in the shadow economy in Mediterranean countries is by mostly choice.

Excessive porn viewing is a part of a disorder known as \"compulsive sexual behavior\"; this is considered an [impulse control disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse-control_disorder), a broad category of obsessive activities that includes excessive internet usage, compulsive shopping, pyromania, and others.

Greatest human fears[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive384&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] I've been thinking the past few days about what I and people in general seem to be truly afraid of, and I decided to express a few of my ideas here. This isn't going to be a well planned or rigorously systematic analysis, since I just now decided to type this and am not 100% sure how to explain it. Anyways, I think our greatest fear is having our humanness compromised. One of the things you learn when studying cultural stories and ideas, like mythology, is that they reflect deeper individual and societal ideas that are sometimes invisible on the surface level. I think having one's humanness compromised is a fear that can be seen at the root of many common anxieties today. In the past, this idea have have manifested as fear of the supernatural invasion of the body by spirits. I'm sure there are countless other examples, but that suffices for now. Today, I think fear-mongering about 'microchips' or 'DNA alterations' (in the COVID vaccine, to select a current example) express the fear of having ones bodily integrity corrupted, and thus having their humanness compromised. I don't really want to spew out a number of examples, even though I'm sure I could think of more (you guys can probably do that thinking on your own). I think this fear stems from a desire for structure and identity, and fear of chaos/disarray. This also may reflect the idea that an individuals humanity is their greatest possession, since at a fundamental level, 'human' is the only thing we are certain we are. I think the fear of that 'humanity' being damaged stems from the fact that our humanness is how we navigate reality, and having our humanness damaged means the very lens by which reality is visible and available to us has been tainted. This isn't as much as I'd like to write, but I think this suffices for now. I hope I get some interesting feedback.

So you got to please yourself.\" [Bongolian](/wiki/User:Bongolian)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Bongolian)) 05:57, 24 February 2021 (UTC) - I don't know you in person so I'll just do everything even if you already have this all down... - 1) Hygiene. No one likes being around someone that smells, and if you must have a \"logical\" reason, quite simply, evolution killed off the people who got too close to those who were covered in filth. Brush your teeth daily, and while it might not seem like a big deal, keep your hair/beard neatly trimmed. - 2) Clothes. As stupid as it sounds, good clothes show the world you have the few minutes to spare on your appearance. Don't wear ratty clothing, even if it's just \"a small hole\". It's also tough, since expensive, but if you have patience you can find the occasional good thing at a consignment shop or thrift store. It's ok if it's a tad out of style, but it must be in decent shape. - 3) Be useful. You need to add something to people's lives beyond a presence. Everyone wants to stay in touch with the guy who they can depend on, whether that's due to some special skill or can take them to the airport. If you know your way around cars, your friends will ask you about car stuff. If you have a pickup truck, everyone and their mother will keep in touch for moving things. If you are great at home repair, people will ask for advice on home maintenance. Find something and learn it well. Note: Do not, I repeat, DO NOT be the \"Computer Guy\". - 4) Make people feel special. This may be the hardest, but is also the most important. It's something few people can do well, but if you can, well, you will need nothing else in life. People remember how they feel around you, and if they feel good around you, they want to be around you more. It's something that every politician has mastered; when they enter the room and talk to you, they make you feel like the most important person on Earth. It's going to be little things like small but seemingly genuine compliments, noticing improvements and praising people, and so forth.

Because being \"the computer guy\" means you get to spend an hour over the phone trying to explain how to use a basic computer function with your grandmother who actively fights you on how to use a computer in spite of calling you for help, other members of your family insisting you work many hours for free building them some stupid website because they think all computers are toys and therefore you must be having fun all while fighting you on web design, oh and then calling you up at 2 am to fix their website when they inevitably screw it up, you get to do an untold number of godawful projects for other friends and family and get no respect for it. Just don't bother. If you are good with computers, whenever someone asks you if you are good with computers, always say \"I'm good enough that I charge money\". If people pay you, they respect your work more and don't bother you with stupid shit, and chances are their request was some stupid shit they aren't willing to pay for. I'm not the computer guy in my family (luckily that's my uncle, followed by my dad), but when I get requests I just tell people to download Opera and uBlock Origin first.

No amount of having weird quirks or having unattractive qualities will drive every single person away. It's very possible for some people to never like you. Easy, in fact. And it's much harder to make friends as an adult. Especially post social-media. There's still options. (Post COVID only) join an in-person interest group, go do things, if you're bad at it, it's a learning experience, and there's always someone who likes showing the newbies the ropes. Join an exercise group, especially, as everyone there is doing it because other people make an unpleasant task less unpleasant. Make active time in your schedule for socializing.

Would you be willing to drive your friends to the airport? If they lost their home, could they couch-surf for a few days? Do you offer to make them dinner? Are you able to dog-sit their border collie if they have to go out of town for a few days? Because those are all very useful things that friends do for each other. It's not the main reason friendships form, but just see how long you keep someone around who can't be relied on for anything while still insisting you do stuff for them. Nobody likes a mooch. - Clothes are a first impressions thing, but hygiene is not.

[ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)15:48, 24 February 2021 (UTC) - It's more of a general thing. I know one guy who's trying to be everyone's friend, let's call him \"Jason\", but no one can stand him. His body odor isn't terrible, but Jason is disliked by everyone. His home is filthy, he leaves fish out for a couple of days and the place reeks. There's dirty dishes left in the sink for a week so they rot. His home is a death trap due to poor maintenance; seriously, how hard is it to use a screwdriver and tighten up the door handles whenever they get a bit too loose? His car is a stinky wreck and he's incredibly disorganized, when he asked me to help him move there was no space in his car because the backseat and trunk was filled with random garbage so I don't know how he expected to move anything. I started emptying out his trunk of trash and found rotten vegetables from months prior, it was just beyond gross. Jason was moving because the owner found out about how filthy the place was that they decided to \"move back in\" and not renew the lease, but Jason doesn't seem to realize this. Now Jason thinks he can quit his job and become a landlord instead, buying a house and using AirBnB to rent it out, not understanding that AirBnB has a rating system that will let everyone else know just how much of a disaster anything he owns is, and if he decides to rent traditionally what kind of tenant is going to put up with a landlord that can't even do basic repairs? And just how much profit does he think landlords get per month? Not enough to live on yourself from just one house, otherwise the tenant would just get a mortgage and buy the place themselves. - Oh, and Jason is an anti-masker to boot. And does nothing to help others, but is always asking for help for his stuff.

Jason does have one other friend, but that's also someone no one else seems to like. - As for the general case, no one in the world will care why you are a trainwreck in the shape of a human, and that's the harsh truth of this world. It's so harsh because we, society, have all been lying to you all this time, and the Great Lie of society has been getting bigger and nastier. We aren't inclusive, we aren't tolerant, we are judgemental, and worst of all we won't tell someone why we don't like them. We've created a world where no one is allowed to tell someone why they don't like them; go to a job interview and when you get passed over, the hiring manager used to be able to tell you exactly what you did wrong, but today, to protect themselves from lawsuits it's policy to just say \"we decided to go with another candidate\" even if the job opening is still posted 2 months later. We've been trained to avoid conflict at all costs, even the slightest hint of confrontational behavior is generally shunned, but the result is a world where no one can tell you what it is that you do wrong.

Best advice is to watch out for selfish/useless/toxic people (which can be a little difficult as they may seem charming at first which also means not \"fully\" trusting people too quickly but you should develop this as you get olders). Other general rules of thumb are to reciprocate in a relationship with anyone (try to give as much as they are giving if you want it to develop and if you think it's worth it and don't give notably more than they are willing (this includes listening, helping, caring, favours, suggesting things etc). If you give a fraction of what they do the friendship might fizzle out. If you give way more then they will probably take you for granted.

So for every long term meaningful friend there were 19 people whose attempts to befriend turned into acquaintances, party-friends or usually never saw them again.

IT's not clothes or hygiene (I mostly go in shorts and t shirt since I walk a lot or go to the gym and sneakers). I'll dress up a little more around company. And I can promise you people DO forget how you made them feel, it happens to me all the time. The being useful part doesn't work either since it just leads to you being used, which is also my case. Confidence does not work either. People tend to stop messaging or wanting to hang up rather quickly as well when they see I don't need much to have fun. In short, I live a \"boring life\". It's quite but I like it, even if it's lonely. But I can assure you it is possible to have no one like you when you're trying to be kind, tolerate, and easy to be around. YOu know why? Because that is the default. IT's the background noise in day to day. I've joined groups, done things, but it leads nowhere. EVERY, SINGLE, TIME. I'm even a ghost in my own house, people don't know if im in or out or even see my walk by. The only time people notice is when you don't do something for them, that's it.

We've created a society where, to avoid offending anyone, we absolutely fuck over anyone who doesn't know why they don't fit in. - As for being \"boring\", if you spend all your free time watching TV, you could try organizing a \"bad movie night\" every Thursday or something along those lines, once the pandemic ends of course. You don't always have to host it, though you will have to host the first few. Again, this is more a general thing and not specific to any person, but the host should make sure the place is clean and provide plenty of snacks and drinks.

I've had no problem developing one or more meaningful long term friendships in several countries spanning most classes and genders/sexualities as well as covering a few very divergent cultures. If you live in a modern open society and your friendships aren't working out then you are almost certainly need to change you approach/outlook. There is no reason you have to be lonely.

You could consider joining in on one of those. Except there is. IT's not my approach or outlook it's just me. No one is interested and no one wants to stay.

Yes there are tons who make friends but there are also those who are doomed to be alone no matter what they do. I'm just one of those unlucky few who are. That is the reason I am lonely so there clearly is one. People just don't want to be around me even though I haven't done anything to them.

I am always willing to engage with you, I care about what you have to say, and I honestly appreciate it when you engage. But on the occasions that you frustrate me, or anyone, I would say that your criteria for how I'm supposed to like you doesn't override my actualization of liking a person, enjoying their contributions, and interpreting the relationship. It is different from yours, and I know it's hard to put into practice. You have all the power when it boils down to who you like and don't like. So does everybody else. People generally say things that they want to hear. I think you're right to rely on yourself, but thinking just because nobody wants to hear what you want to say or appreciate what you do means they don't like you is an ass take.

You can't really believe it's ok, you're clearly upset about it now and have been depressed for years from what I remember, loneliness can't be helping that. You can't be alone for your whole life. - I can't and won't diagnose you, but if you've just never been able to make friends you may be autistic, in which case you could talk to other autistic people, you're on an atheist/skeptic wiki so you're already halfway there. - The sad reality is no one likes someone who's miserable all the time, is it possible people can tell you're unhappy and avoid you for that reason? If that's the case, you're trapped in a cycle with misery feeding loneliness and loneliness feeding misery that's very hard to escape from, but it's not impossible. I'm sure you've heard all the advice about antidepressants or more exercise before. - Sorry if I'm being a bit blunt here. As someone who is autistic, it's a reason a lot of people don't like me.

If I knew who you are and where to find you right now (obviously, don't share personal information out to strangers on the internet, but bear with me) I would definitely try to be your friend and if it doesn't work out, at least tell you exactly why. It can't be that hard, if you are as advertised a decent human being. There's bound to be something you like that I can try to get into. Maybe you just are living in a community that makes it especially hard to form good friendships and you just need a change of scenery or to meet way different people than what's around you.

[https://youtu.be/gFmrr4f6XkU?list=PLjiPh7vdm10Le0TNck05xY-B2SdpTPTls](https://youtu.be/gFmrr4f6XkU?list=PLjiPh7vdm10Le0TNck05xY-B2SdpTPTls) As odd as that may be, what I found even weirder is the fact that I cannot find any sources of this at all, this is the only thing that I could find where it's been talked about. The fact that the title is just a vague clickbait doesn't help in looking into information about this in addition to the fact that the guy cites no bloody sources so I have no clue where he got this information from. Alright, no biggie, I'm just gonna use the key information in the video to try and find more info on this. I've made a long ass post that I lost, and it took forever to write so I'll give the bottom line: I've search the alleged phone number and found that, yes, at one point it was registered in California I've searched all the titles and body texts of the 4chan and reddit posts and found nothing at all. I've searched all the URLs in the video ( [5:34](https://youtu.be/gFmrr4f6XkU?t=334)) ( [8:43](https://youtu.be/gFmrr4f6XkU?t=523)) ( (tinyurl and imgur) and found nothing. I've searched key info about time, place, amount of calls reported etc. and found nothing. I've searched the alleged YouTube channel ( [5:56](https://youtu.be/gFmrr4f6XkU?t=356)) that posted the supposed phone number, only found 2 channels: [one that admits he is not the guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW1SYMq3AlC7VlBiuApCkww/discussion) and [another that was made in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAdlyANkrXxQnSiHJPV6_hA/about), 2 years after this all apparently happened.

I could only look at their comments of a max from 5 months ago and I messaged them to ask about it.

Like I'm sorry, it's wrong, period. I'm 100% anti-death penalty, I'm literally as against it as you can get (I actually used to be pro-death penalty long ago though, fun fact), and, much to the chagrin of conservatives, this circumstance is no exception. I have two major flaws with this argument. 1. Criminals can rehabilitate. Many of them don't, obviously, but that doesn't mean none of them do. 2. What if someone is falsely accused of pedophile-related crimes and is then killed for it? Of course these two arguments can be used against any death penalty-related circumstance, not just this one. But anyway, it seems like basic common sense, but go to literally any YouTube video of some pedophile getting sentenced and pretty much every comment calls for said convict to be killed slowly, brutally, etc. I just never see myself agreeing with it, like, I don't even fully know why sometimes, I just don't. I've tried to explained this to my (way too conservative) brother in the past, and I've come to discover there's literally no arguing with him on it. He basically acts like I think all pedophiles are innocent and should go free, which is NOT true of course, I've never said they were innocent, I just don't think they deserve the death penalty. But it's like with at least some people these days, you say that, and bam: next thing you know you're some \"pedophile apologist\", which is false. Sometimes I feel like literally the only person on the planet who feels this way. Like... idk, is something really wrong with me or something or is it just my imagination? I'm all for putting them in prison for life (as a maximum), sure, but the death penalty? No, it's an ludicrous, outdated form of punishment that can't be phased out soon enough.

The government shouldn't be able to kill their own citizens, and I believe the death penalty is fundamentally immoral. Putting aside my religious justifications for this, there's the simple fact that killing someone for their crimes lets the executioners indulge in hatred, falsely believing that this tit-for-tat punishment accomplishes anything. The death penalty doesn't reduce crimes, and only provides an outlet to encourage and promote our most repugnant instincts.

I don't know enough about the PRC's vaccine program to speak on it. In any case, I'm relying less on whether the program belongs to X country or Y country and more on the reports the reliability and safety of the vaccine programs, as well as information on distribution (which the US botched, and is still botching up to some degree). - I don't trust Russia or China. While Trump dropped the ball on containing COVID, China also helped in covering it up. -- I would guess that the Russian and Chinese vaccines are likely safe but that the efficacy could easily have been overstated for propaganda purposes. Regarding efficacy of the other available vaccines, efficacy of 85% vs. 95% probably isn't a difference that matters in this situation because the testing was done testing was sometimes done in different time-frames with different mixes of variants in the populations. For now, most people won't get a choice about which vaccine to take, so it's best to just take what's available.

The claim that it was totally ineffective with over 65's (a rumour spread predominantly by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron) and the claim that it doesn't work with mutations (e.g the South Africa variant). The claim that its ineffective for over 65's has been pretty much [debunked](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-data-show-vaccines-reduce-severe-covid-19-in-older-adults)and both France and Germany have U-turned and now recommend it for older people.

The second fear was it is less effective against the South Africa variant, and to be fair there is data that supports this. But its still [effective](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/05/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-works-against-uk-variant-oxford-says.html)against the UK variant, which is far more transmissible than the South Africa variant (and apparently could become the most dominant global variant).

The real crisis is of personal sacrifice. Many people (mostly in the West), have no concept of sacrificing for the public good. Most of the people who made those sacrifices during the Flu of 1918, Great Depression and WWII have died. Their children and grand-children grew up in a world where no sacrifice was necessary, and those less off were demonized. Among the reasons that East/South East Asian and West African nations have seemingly managed this pandemic more effectively is the recent memory of SARS as well as Ebola and AIDS.

The US in addition has a lot of paranoid style / conspiracy culture which helps fuel the misinformation (a Brazilian would have to chime in if there is something similar there, I'm guessing there is). Sometimes there is some legitimate fuck-ups that may trigger doubts -- for instance, a Guardian article on [vaccine scepticism in France](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/jan/11/vaccine-scepticism-in-france-reflects-dissatisfaction-with-political-class)cites over-preparation for the 2009 swine flu along with French doctors [misusing a diabetic drug as a weight loss prescription (leading to 500-2000 deaths)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49795237)as large causes for current doubts in France.

The worst kind of COVID denialism tends to step beyond reasonable doubt though. Incidentally, anti-masking [was a thing in the US in 1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Mask_League_of_San_Francisco), so no, don't expect too much cultural changes, unfortunately.

Insincerely appropriating social justice language is rarely about pretending to be marginalised, it's about getting a reaction, it's trolling ( (ec)i loathe conversations like these where its all broad hypotheticals that misses all the nuance of such refusals in the world. as with most things to do with how people deal with people, there is no line that can be drawn where all on one side is prejudiced while on the other side the enlightened sit. the real answer is depends. there are a myriad reasons why someone might not date someone of particular type, be it race or gender identity, or anything, that have little to do with prejudice. plenty that are about prejudice, but its usually clear when it is something like that. is it really prejudice if a particular class of person doesnt turn you on? no it isnt. different strokes for different folk. is it prejudice that a particular class of person doesnt turn you on, and you go out your way to make sure everyone knows they dont do it for you, maybe thats where any prejudice shows itself. log on to grindr and there used to be loads of folk declaring they are not into asians for. fine if asian guys arnt for them. an explicit declaration of not being into asians, less so. same if its white guys or black guys that get a special mention of not being into. there is a lot of racial stereotyping around sex that can play a part here. if you are doing the stereotyping then the prejudice lies with you if using that as the basis of not dating a particular ethnicity. if its you being stereotyped then its not your prejudice that makes you not wanna date ethnicities not your own but other peoples. black guys who only date black guys? maybe they wanna be treated as a human being and not just someones racist sex fantasy of a black brute and bbc. maybe an asian guy only into other asian guys is sick of older white gents looking for a submissive house boy? i dare say something similar goes on with straight folk not dating particular races, or exclusively their own race. i imagine where communities are homogenous and you are surrounded by your race and culture, you might feel you wouldnt have much in common with someone from another community, or be wary of the flack biracial couples can receive. is that prejudice? with trans as a reason for not dating, with straight folk its pretty obvious why a straight guy might not be inclined to date a transwoman. even if everything else is working for them, if a guy cant get past issues with the genitalia when it comes to it, probably best not let it come to it in the first place. if they view trans women as being 'easier' than cis women, then its a statement on what they see as sign of their masculinity. alphas like them only fuck cis women. trans are the betas not the 'real' men. that would be a bigoted reason for not dating people. theres more going on with gay guys and trans folk than with straight men. some gay men like 'men' - their ideals of masculinity that transwomen just dont meet. then there are the gay men who actually dislike transwomen. this usually down to homophobic abuse that label gay men as nancy boys or sissies. as a reaction to that some guys get hypermasculine themselves, or they see fem guys or crossdressers and transwomen as confirming homophobic abuse about effeminacy. they blame them for homophobes seeing them as poofs and not 'real' men. you seeing less often these days but its still there. but with all of this, its coms down to what you mean by a 'refusal'? how and when it is made says a lot. a polite 'you are just not my type' is how it manifests itself, doesnt really matter if their reasons are super racist or prejudiced. it doesnt tell you anymore and you shouldnt really require more from someone knocking you back. if you get knocked back with a 'i dont date...' that might require some clarification. its done with slur then you are in no doubt. you should be in no doubt if a 'refusal' is preemptive, that someone loudly declares they are not into x, so no gets any ideas or prevent all enquiry so no refusal needs to be made - likely no good reason that is necessary to do, and even then only likely to appear on some dating profile. if they announce such things on twitter or something, then clearly bigots.

I'm So Straight-I'm So Gay[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive384&action=edit\u00a7ion=29)] On the topic of \"super\" straight or gay or whatever is supposed to be a concern-troll turned real thing, for the benefit of people not understanding what sexual orientation means, let's just, I dunno, take it back? Better jokes have always embarrassed and quieted 4chan. - I'm so straight... the last time I saw a dick, I had to take the mirror out of my bathroom. - The jokes obviously don't have to be awesome, but if you can't tell why being yourself but identifying as being \"super\" anything is kinda laughable, you're not gonna be good at jokes. And if you think the super-straight or super-gay thing is funny enough on its own, you're probably not good at jokes. But hey, that's OK, the problem is people wanting you to fall victim to their bad jokes. Better jokes are ones that understand and, by non-sequitur, conflate your understanding with your not quite getting it, without being so smug about getting it. - I'm so straight... I can't look a girl in the eye unless she can tell me exactly which scent of AXE I'm clouded in. - vs - I'm so straight... I won't look a girl in the eye unless she can tell me exactly which scent of AXE I'm clouded in. - The actualization is important. It's kind of why one works as an in-joke and the other is just pointlessly mean. I think it's pretty easy to tell the difference, but maybe that's just me. It helps that I wrote them and English is my first language, I guess. But it's a difference between \"can\" and \"will\" as verbs, and that's more important to look out for than anyone who says \"super\" is an important adjective. I know it's fun to just put a descriptive adjective in front of an absurd noun to talk about something that's actually in front of you. Millenials started it, Gen Z did it something wild, like with the who would win meme. Calling, say, a leaky bag a drippy boy is fun slang for everyone, and calming in redirecting attention to a situation where the bag leaking is not good. What anger do you have to have to see the phrase \"super straight\" and have to identify as for or against it? We got a \"bad joke\" on our hands here? Probably a lot of stiffy bois laughing at their own jokes so they don't have to accept what they can't control. I understand it's a joke that encourages invalidation of a real thing. If anyone can name it something more fun than a \"bad joke,\" believe me, I'm in. But \"people not being able to take a joke\" is really bad justification for \"not being able to tell a joke.\" A joke really is a lot easier when it's so concise anyone could tell it, and it's a lot easier when it's so pared down anyone could give you the answer. - Why did the world's straightest man take the mirror out of his bathroom? - Because he saw a dick. - It's the same joke.

I got off the topic so hard because I would rather be polemic about how a joke works than worry about people working themselves up into a tizzy over a bad joke. It's my bad, truly, but y'all prioritize some confusing shit sometimes. A bad take couched as a joke needs to see the light of what a joke can be. I do know people who say \"it's all made up anyway, there are two genders and that's real\" and if they'd stop to consider the whole of what they're saying, that's the exact bad take. But I can't drive my head against that wall. If I can help them laugh at the ideas, we don't have to argue to a pointless end. If you ask me, yeah, it's kinda all made up, but it's not unprecedented and it's not in anyone's place to just be a dick to somebody to see what they'll do.

Note that the Swiss are hardly the only European country to have a ban on Burqas; France does as well, but does so against all religious clothing and unlike the Swiss, doesn't make minarets illegal. We'll see how this plays out... [Cordon](/wiki/User:CorruptUser) [ (yak)](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser) 21:41, 8 March 2021 (UTC) - Even though I am an atheist, I think that the ban is stupid.

On one hand, the burqa really isn't a good thing - it's often forced, it's patriarchial, it's meant for another climate and, like Duce said, it could be a problem in identifying terror. On the other hand, a burqa ban raises the question of why a liberal democracy is dictating dress codes to its people.

[MarioSuperstar77](/wiki/User:MarioSuperstar77)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:MarioSuperstar77)) 12:08, 9 March 2021 (UTC) - Some people fighting for equality and justice are stuck in a quagmire here. On the one hand gender equality is important and to pretend as though some form of pressure to dress modestly and even cover the face isn't involved in at the very least some of the cases is ridiculous. I lived in Iran for half a year and I lost count of the number of girls from even progressive families who felt coerced into dressing modestly even in situations where others weren't (private gatherings, parties, isolated places) and how many female friends I had in Canada who took off their modest clothing when they were sure their parents (or even male family members such as cousins or brothers) wouldn't be there to see it. Coercion is an undeniable problem when it comes to \"choice\" in religious modestly which only women have to suffer. On the other hand in Western Europe we live in open societies where freedom of religion and freedom of choice is supposed to be a right (which most people agree with). It makes how to vote in such a referendum a very difficult question to answer and I don't believe that there is an obviously correct one when two conflicting goals of social justice are so present: the the partial coercion of a marginalised group to sustain their marginalisation vs. the religious rights and choices of a marginalised group. - It obviously hurts the cause that the referendum was spearheaded by a clearly bigoted group and that there has already been a ban on minarets which was atrocious. But people shouldn't vote against something they might agree with just because it was proposed by a stupid person nor against something because the disagree with a vaguely related law. Some western European governments are also fairly silent on the problems of Islamic radicalisation, even though there are beheadings, explosions, car attacks, shootings and assassinations on a near monthly basis in Western Europe. While this is no reason to vote for something it may explain why some did, when the Swiss see the French president actually taking measures to take on extremism (pretty terrible ones but something) or the Belgian Prime Minister actually admitting islamic extremism is a problem and something has to be done...while their own government avoids the issue (because it is a really really difficult issue) some may see it as the only way they can affect change (even if it is a bad way). Government silence, government inaction (on both islamophobia, inequality of Muslims communities as well as extremism) always makes things worse. Of all the terrible things to happen to muslim communities in Europe, I would say prohibiting 30 women (at least a few of whom are very likely coerced) from the most extreme form of subjugation (the face covering) is the lowest on the list. The minaret ban was far more outrageous. Governments doing little about islamophobia and inequality is outrageous.

I don't think we can pass off burkas as simply \"religious garments.\" Looking at how they've been used in the countries that mandate them, it's patently obvious that such outfits are designed as a form of social control over women. These garments, at least in such a religious context, are by definition sexist. Burkas aren't yamakas, or hijabs, or niqabs, or chadurs: they seek to hide and erase all aspects of a woman's body over an unusual interpretation of a few lines in the Quran. They are in no way necessary for Islamic worship, and when they are used in such contexts, they send a blatantly sexist message that women must not be seen, and that their very bodies are sinful, unpure, and unfit for the gaze of their male superiors. Are these values really worth defending, seeing as they're more extreme versions of those espoused by the far-right?

It creates a backlash effect where the majority of that community, already facing external sociopolitical threats, lumps you in with their existing enemies. They also feel that their culture is being \"stripped away by force\", and as a result may cling ever tighter to it. \"So what is a better method GC?\" you may now be asking. Quite simply, deescalation of the sociopolitical climate. By opposing discriminatory laws you can buy trust and favor with that community, which can then translate into inner-community change over time.

[Meow](/wiki/User:Meow) [Purr](/wiki/User_talk:Meow)14:45, 9 March 2021 (UTC) - @ [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)Actually think about what the numbers mean. Rounding for simplicity, both White and Muslim terrorists killed 100 people each over 20 years, but there are 2,500,000 Muslims and 250,000,000 White people in the US. That means that a Muslim American is 100 times as likely to commit a terrorist act as a White person. \"White Nationalists kill more\" is the wrong way to look at it. Instead, look at it in terms of the whole, because 100 times a really small number is still small. 100 murders from terrorism over 20 years from 2,500,000 people amounts to a per capita of .2, compared to the US's average murder rate of 6 per capita. I can't seem to find the actual stats of \"murders by religious background\", but let's assume it's just 6.2 vs 6. Now consider that Muslims make up a disproportionate number of doctors. In other words, allowing Muslims into the US (at least, Uni-Educated Muslims) is more likely to save your life than end it.

It's a pretty rare news cycle where I'm more on the side of Joko Widodo than a European country, but here we are. The burqa is as ridiculous as IveBeenFrank describes, but banning it to me is counterproductive. Obviously there's enough Islamaphobia in Switzerland where a very slim majority don't agree with me, but from my perspective, I don't see how burqa bans really does anything to address Islamic extremism and terrorism. To frame using another group of extremists, would anyone in the US think that a national ban on the [Confederate flag](/wiki/Confederate_flag)would do anything to solve white nationalist extremism?

The idea behind making various forms of speech \"unacceptable\" in public is that it causes the next generation to believe that holding the \"unacceptable\" ideas makes them a bad person, and over time, fewer and fewer people would become White Nationalists than if the symbols were out in the open, even if the ban pisses off current White Nationalists more and thus causes a bit more violence right now.

Be it an Islamophobic response or one of actual concern for some women they believe to be coerced...it's the one way they can voice their concern in a country where the government does virtually nothing to deal with extremism (neither dealing with inequality and Islamophobia that can lead to extremism nor dealing with the importation of extremism from Saudi Arabia/Afghanistan/Pakistan). And it's obvious why many governments don't do much as they often pay a political price regardless of what they do. Funding job programs for Muslim communities rile up far-right idiots who frame it as immigrants getting all the money. Deporting radicalised muslim clerics or even publically saying some sects of islam is a problem is framed as an islamophobic and racist response.

Islam is a particular problem because there are many many marginalised grops in Western Europe, some who face as difficult or even worse problems than Muslims (black Europeans, trans people etc) and they don't become radicalised and set neighbourhoods on fire or behead people over their grievances. Obviously marinalisation is the largest factor in radicalisation but it cannot be reduced simply to a problem of marginalisation and issues within Muslim communities such as women's rights, homophobia and radicalism cannot be ignored as \"just a marginalised group\" issue.

That's... actually around the same terrorism/death rate as the US, assuming the numbers are correct. I think it's safe to say \"for every 1,000,000 Muslims in a Western country, there will be 2 additional deaths from terrorism each year\".

Although hijab is required by law in a few countries, I cannot Google any nation that actually require full face covering. In fact, a couple of Islam countries (Tunisia and Morocco) actually burn full face coverings, for a combination of security reason and as a way of resisting the spread of extremist Islam ideology. On the other hand, two nations in particular (Iran and Saudi Arabia) actually have \"morality police\" that (sometimes ridiculously) enforces hijab oriented dress codes, making it more of a legitimate agency question for women in these nations in particular. The last Islam country I visited was Malaysia. Hijabs (in the local lore, [tudong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tudong)) were common but not omnipresent. I never saw a full face covering.

Fucking outrageous. [Chef (UTC) - IIRC, he was beheaded bc he showed the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, which he did, not that he singled out the Muslim kids to leave, which he did not. To me, the answer of course is to take away the power the cartoons have over people... by plastering them on so many billboards that discussing the cartoons is no longer seen as controversial. - I think we should also ask why the cartoons are such a big deal, when back in the summer of 2001, South Park had Mohammed on the show as a goofy superhero with fire powers and no one complained a bit. The answer is that 1) Muslim leaders see exactly what has happened in the Western World in terms of all the cartoons making fun of Jesus, that jokes and humor are the means by which \"Holy\" institutions are able to be scrutinized and eventually torn down, and rather correctly believe that if no one is able to make jokes about Mohammed, then Muslims are much less likely to become secular or even *gasp* non-religious, and 2) they saw in the aftermath of Jyllands-Posten that Western societies could be intimidated into avoiding even suggesting there's anything about Mohammed that could be joked about. If we truly care about secularizing the Islamic world and ensuring that Islamic terrorism is \"just a phase\" and not a permanent fixture, we need people to be able to criticize the religion without risking death, and that means, yes, doing our best to ensure that it's safe to make a cartoon about the guy.

I do believe you can criticize Islam, and I in no way believe those terrorists were justified in massacring the journalists involved with such a cartoon, but merely that intelligent criticism should be preferred, and is in many ways necessary: if we keep treating Islam as some ridiculous thing to be mocked without ever getting into why, we're doing ourselves and the fundamentalists a disservice.

It's actually the most controversial part of the Quran, Surah 33 I believe. Basically, Mohammed had 4 wives. He also had a slave that he adopted, Zayid, and at this time adoption meant Zayid was for all legal purposes Mo's son. One of Mohammed's followers had died in battle, so Mo gave the widow, Zaynab, to Zayid. Then one day Mohammed accidentally entered Zayid's house unannounced, and accidentally saw Zaynab in a state of undress. It was at this moment that Allah decided to tell Mohammed several things. First, that Zaynab was to be Mohammed's wife. Second, that the limit of 4 wives didn't apply to Mohammed, because it's the will of Allah. Third, that this was not incest, Zaynab was not Mo's daughter-in-law, because adoptions aren't a thing. And that's why adoptions aren't really a thing in Islam. It's hugely controversial in the Muslim world, because it's almost as if Mohammed is making stuff up as he goes along and screwing people (literally) based on his own personal desires, but we all know that can't be the case, it's just a test of faith because Mohammed is without flaws.

I certainly wish Charlie Hebdo were less over the top with their cartoons but I stand by their right to ridicule a set of ideas and the sacred symbol of those ideas as much as they please. - - I don't give a shit how precious they think their prophet is. He generated and still represents a set of ideas, some of them re-fucking-diculous, dangerous and EXTREMELY offensive including to we LGTBQ+ people. The fact that far-right-assholes discuss them in ways that go beyond discussing the set of ideas and instead attacking them for being a member of a group is irrelevant. That doesn't make their set of ideas or symbols suddenly totally taboo and beyond critique and ridicule. Charlie Hebdo were absolutely right to respond a segment of the believers of a fucking ridiculous religion threatening them with violence if they depicted their symbol of their ridiculous beliefs in a way they didn't like by doing so which they had every right to do and in doing so broke a stupid taboo. No set of ideas (not race, gender, sexuality) nor the precious symbols of those ideas are off-topic from any debate. It is their choice to believe stupid shit and revere a prophet who has nothing but contempt for women, gay people and non-believers. - @meow - thats complete fucking dogshit that bares no relation to what i have said or the point i was making Incels[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive384&action=edit\u00a7ion=35)] Does noone else notice the fact that most or all incel-related pages on RW are written by the same individual, who is an incel himself?

They weren't individualist in any construction of the term. Nor were the Athenians, for that matter: Plato, for example, wasn't all that keen on individual freedoms and a focus on the self. Not to mention that for a guy how claims to know a lot about history, his understanding of the basic principles of this time period were flawed: - There was no conception of race, or even national identity, nor were there enough variations in skin tone among communicating cultures for even an informal definition of the term. Thus, \"race-mixing\" in that society would be the equivalent (minus the nationalism) of a Czech marrying a Slovak: not really different races. Not to mention that race is unscientific by its very nature: one learns more about race from how cultures define it than anything about it that can be derived through scientific means. - \"Orientals\" just makes me laugh, considering that nearly everything happening in the Western side of the world was centered around the Levant and the Fertile Crescent. The Greeks were somewhat distant and isolated-in fact, there was virtually nobody to the west of them. - Calling the Achaemenids static is also funny, because their whole method of rule was based on adapting and accommodating local traditions and customs to support a somewhat centralized rule. It was constantly changing, and had the potential to be quite dynamic. Also, the Spartans had a very static civilization-nothing changed there for nearly 400 years, even as Ancient Greece reached its zenith. - Once again, the fascist perception of victory as evidence of cultural superiority returns. The truth is, the Achaemenids were spread thin when they invaded Greece, and by that time had lost their battle-hardened experience and skill they gained when they were constantly in combat as their civilization rose. They simply had too much territory to manage, that they couldn't devote all their troops to one continuous theatre without facing uprisings elsewhere. In the end, that's why Xerxes pulled out of the conflict, not because the Greeks inflicted some decisive defeat. Alexander's story is different, however, but by that time the Achaemenids had declined severely, for reasons other than their defeat by the Greeks. - I'm continually shocked by the levels of ignorance in this man's statement.

He first got weirdly personally invested in the exchange, and by the end he was talking explicitly about the battle between culturally superior individualist westerners versus barbarous Orientals and their inferior, static mode of civilization. In then got even weirder when he started going on about how the Persians were white but failed to beat the Greeks because they practiced race-mixing and how \"we are being forced by the militant left into a modern marathon.\" I knew he was conservative but not THAT kind of conservative.- - Not an old memory, more like an oddity.

However, there are huge cultural differences, and while it's not \"woke\" to say so, cultures aren't always equal. \"What music do you prefer\" or \"what spices do you add to your food\" are basically unimportant differences, I'm talking things like \"how much do you value education\", \"how acceptable is homosexuality or other non-standard behaviors\", \"how do you raise the children\" or \"how do you resolve disputes\" are very important differences. It's not entirely objective as to which is better, but it's not entirely subjective either. If you don't think cultures can be better than one another, well, ask yourself a simple question. Do you believe that American Culture (or whatever culture you are in) can be improved?

Why have you forsaken me, Wikipedia? - True, but I'm talking about mass shootings, which occurred at a far lower frequency compared to the pre-pandemic era. Also, I'm not saying that this is a good thing, I'm just pointing out that we are slowly but gradually returning to normal.\u2014 - From what I heard it was actually 3 separate shootings with combined 8 deaths. The first one had 5 victims, 4 of whom died so I guess that counts as a mass shooting.

Ironically, the cause of mass shootings is coverage of mass shootings; the goal is notoriety, not death count itself. The shooters want to know that they will make the news even if they don't live to see it, that their name is said by others even as a curse, that people will still talk about them decades later. Of course, no one wants to be known as the \"Walmart Assassin\", that doesn't get you enough infamy. Schools are an easy choice for being in the news for longer, but it's still overplayed. But this leads to an interesting conclusion; the way to get the most news coverage ever for a mass shooting would be to target the news people themselves...

Palestinian elections- talk about a major fiasco[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive384&action=edit\u00a7ion=51)] [https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.jpost.com/middle-east/israel-us-asked-abbas-to-delay-or-cancel-palestinian-elections-report-662195/amp](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.jpost.com/middle-east/israel-us-asked-abbas-to-delay-or-cancel-palestinian-elections-report-662195/amp) So far Fatah is giving Hamas a major advantage. Fatah is in the midst of an internal conflict while Hamas seems to have a concrete plan for unity between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Fatah needs to get its act together and fast. I am interested in the outcome of this nightmare of an election. This makes the US 2020 Election look like a walk in the park. -- [Eggs Over EASyPlus](/wiki/User:Rationalzombie94) ( is basically \"absorb and/or exterminate Fatah members\", don't kid yourself. They are Ikhwan (Muslim Brotherhood), their primary goal has always been and always will be the displacement of all culture and institutions in the Islamic world with a single Islamist one, their secondary goal is the re-conquest of \"former\" Islamic territories (Israel for now, but eventually Kashmir and Spain), and if they get enough backing their Kickstarter stretch goal is the displacement of all non-Islamist institutions in the non-Muslim world as well. The only real difference between Hamas and the rest of the Ikhwan is that Hamas doesn't pretend to be non-violent. That and for Hamas, it's a toss-up whether turning Palestinian areas into Islamist hellholes or conquering Israel is the higher priority. Hamas doesn't build schools and hospitals because they are \"nice\", they do so because they want to be the only institution.

According to most reports I have seen the incidence of blood clotting issues after receiving the AZ vaccine are similar to instances of the problem in the general population. Furthermore the problems occur at the same rate in populations vaccinated with other vaccines. It looks like a case of [mass hysteria](/wiki/Mass_hysteria) to me brought on by a bad attack of [Post hoc, ergo propter hoc](/wiki/Post_hoc,_ergo_propter_hoc). I am sure that some people die in car accidents after receiving the vaccine, but nobody is going to blame the vaccine. (At least I hope not.) And it has two negative consequences 1. It slows down the already slow European vaccine roll-outs. 2. It increases the level of vaccine hesitancy which already exist in some European populations.

It's also odd that there's such a harsh split in advice, with countries suspending it whilst the WHO is saying \"no don't do that, that's stupid\", and other countries still using it, etc. I've never been anti-vax and it's even made me start wondering if someone somewhere knows something important that the rest of us don't (although I'm in the UK and 33 years old, so it'll be ~July before I'm offered one anyway). On a broader note I feel like the last 2-3 years have been a non-stop news avalanche. Everything seems really fast paced and ever-changing, and no one seems to be reflecting on older (like, last month old) news any more, so I'm sure by the start of April this will all be completely out of the news cycle and never mentioned again. Like when some countries were slamming the vaccine's use on over 65s (including Macron describing it as \"quasi ineffective\") - remember that? I didn't, until I read it in a brief summary of events about 5 minutes ago. It was only a month or so ago, the end of January.

Another good thing is that it follows the same approach of minimal patching of programs and simple, clean configuration for system utilities.
