She created her own eponymous line and has outposts in both New York City and Los Angeles at the Sunset Tower Hotel. Supernova Facial What it is: An exfoliating, lifting, tightening treatment created for Vargas's celebrity clientele. Everyone can now book the treatment at her spa. How it works: Vargas starts by exfoliating and hydrating the skin with the Aqua Peel, which uses an oxygenating formula of nutrients, saline, and glycolic acid to smooth out dry skin to prep it for red carpet makeup. Then microcurrent is used to lift, contour, and depuff the face. A medical-grade collagen mask is layered with a molding clay mask to keep it active. Then a skin-tightening cryotherapy treatment is applied, which increases circulation, oxygenation, and lymphatic drainage while providing anti-inflammatory benefits. The facial finishes with pure oxygen therapy. Benefits of the treatment: It exfoliates the skin, hydrates, and helps calm inflammation. Vargas says it's ideal for red carpet makeup, which is typically minimal and allows the skin to shine through. Downtime: Minimal. Can be done the week of the event. Cost: $550 with Joanna, $375 with a master esthetician, $325 a senior esthetician. Vargas sells her [Supernova Serum](https://www.revolve.com/joanna-vargas-supernova/dp/JNAV-WU17/) ($295) as well. Revitalight Bed What it is: An LED bed that heals the skin. How it works: Vargas developed the bed after reading studies that have shown LED lights heal the skin at a 300 percent faster rate. Benefits of the treatment: Lying in the bed for 20 minutes promotes collagen production, reduces inflammation, and shrinks pores. It covers the entire body with red and infrared light, eliminating cellulite, lines, wrinkles, sun damage, acne scars, and stretch marks to give a smoother and more even skin tone. Downtime: None. For results, however, Vargas emphasizes that it's dependent on the client, and he recommends using the bed every other day for two weeks before the show. Cost: $150 per session "}
