The therapeutic measures described in this text of Agnivesha are useful both for healthy persons and the patients too.

This indicates the greatness of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita). The text of Agnivesha by Agnivesha, redacted by Charak and supplemented by Dridhbala, it is the end of this 12th chapter, [Uttar Basti Siddhi], the Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita).[12] Tattva Vimarsha (Fundamental Principles) - Purification therapies evacuate excess accumulated wastes from body leading to transient disturbance in homeostasis. Therefore utmost care of patient should be taken after purification therapies. - The patient shall follow prescribed rules of diet and lifestyle for regaining positive health after purification. - If the rules are not followed properly, it leads to vitiation of [vata dosha](/index.php?title=Vata_dosha)resulting in various [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)related disorders. - These disorders are treated with yapana basti i.e. medicated enema that sustain health. - The treatise shall be learnt and understood by applying techniques called [tantrayukti](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti)(canons of exposition/tricks for understanding treatise). Vidhi Vimarsha (Applied Inferences ) The term siddhi means accomplishment with perfection in the administration of therapies for the treatment of diseases. Ahara (diet) is predominantly endowed with six rasas (taste) and they act through their properties by contradicting each other, resulting in equilibrium. Thus the patient should be given diet having mutually contradictory tastes, and mutually contradictory properties like unctuousness and ununctuousness alternatively till equilibrium is attained. Because the state of complete health as stated by Sushruta ie the the equilibrium state of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha), [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu), agni, [mala](/index.php?title=Mala) causing pleasant state of soul, senses mind. Samadosha samdhatu malkriyah---Prasnnatmen driyamanah (Su. Su. 15/8). The ashta mahadosha mentioned in this chapter are all held responsible for the vitiation of [doshas](/index.php?title=Dosha) mainly the [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), causing various disorders. Initiation of speech is the action of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) (udana vayu) so uchha bhashya (loudness) ati-bhashya (excessive speaking), jolting, constant sitting etc. cause various disorders. Thus it advisable as precautionary measure to avoid strain due to these activities, that one should speak slowly and less to prevent the disorders caused by the same. (13-14) Measures in terms of diet and life style having pacifying properties specially, [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) along with [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) are helpful in managing the eight impediments. After the purification therapy, the patient becomes physically and mentally weak so the experienced physician advises the patient to gradually progress diet from lighter to heavier. Starting with peya (thin gruel) and ending with mamsa rasa (meat-soup) for the stimulation of agni (power of digestion and metabolism). In view of some scholars, this protocol of specific dietary regimen is necessary after [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana) (emesis) and [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana) (purgation) therapy shiro-virechana. Yapana basti- Yapana basti means medicated preparation which can be used all the time for [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) and they promote longevity, preserve health and cure of diseases too. There are 216 [bastis](/index.php?title=Basti) mentioned in this chapter for the maintenance of health and cure of disease, having various ingredients. Some of the ingredients are not available now or difficult to get but seems to be very effective, as referred in the literature and experienced by various scholars. These [bastis](/index.php?title=Basti) are effective for the maintenance of health and cure of disease as it pacifies [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) and considered as half treatment of any disease. It serves the purpose of [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana) also as described by many scholars and it requires extensive clinical experience in this field. This uttara basti is very effective in gynecology disorders. It acts in the pelvic region /lower part of umbilical region due to that the apana vayu is pacified by the same. It is also very effective in vatashthila (Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy). Various studies have been conducted in the Department of shalya tantra of IMS BHU in BPH cases. The [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) was prepared with different kwatha and oily preparations like dashamoola kwatha and narayana taila(oil)etc. After the application of this procedure, the signs and symptons like pain & swelling, urgency, dysurea, burning micturation were reduced to great extent and the size of prostate reduced. Those patients who required surgery, the bleeding during and after operation was less and removal of prostate was easier in comparison to the control group. The probable mechanism of action is increased permeability of cells, which results in exchange of materials between intra and extracellular space. Dashmula kwatha (decoction) and narayan tail are good for pacification of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata). These remedies help to clean the urethral passage, decrease inflammation, edema and residual urine, relieving signs and symptoms of BPH. [1] So there are many benefits achieved by application of uttara basti in BPH and gynecological disorders as well as pelvic region diseases. [Tantrayukti](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti) Agnivesha, while composing this treatise followed the statements of his /guru preceptor Atreya. Since [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) is a science of spirituality also, there is a tradition of worshiping gods and natural powers having good result of action. Thus after worshiping Lord Shiva, these medicated preparations are used, while chanting Vedic mantras and blowing conch-shell accompanied with the beating sound of pataha (hand-drum) as well as bheri (kettle drum). This helps to attain the real goal of life, tri-varga or the three basic desires of human life such as dharma (performance of duties), artha (satisfaction of senses with their objects / acquirement of wealth) and kama (fulfillment of desires). After the detailed description of yapana basti and their extended form, thirty six [Tantrayuktis](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti) are mentioned in very brief. Thirty two [tantrayuktis](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti) are described in uttar tantra Harishchandra, has described forty [Tantrayuktis](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti). So there is difference in number due to difference in opinion. The word [Tantrayukti](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti) is formed of two words, tantra and yukti. Tantra means shastra(treatise) like [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda). The word yukti means rational planning. So the word [tantrayukti](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti) means the rational planning of compilation of treatise and treatment in scientific way. In the etiology, clinical features and management of diseases the application of tantra yukti is seen very frequently. For example, in the management of prameha the application of vikalp tantra yukti is seen in context of of different ingredients [Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 6/46] Similarly in the compilation of any treatise one word has been used in different context like prayojana, adhikarana and uhya etc. A compilation of any knowledge after its experience is very important for its preservation and future generation. \"Vidhina pathan\" (systematic studies) as mentioned in this chapter, reflect the importance of [tantrayuktis](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti), as the procedure of study described in [Vimana Sthana](/index.php?title=Vimana_Sthana) of Charak Samhita (8/ 7). There are in Sushruta Samhita: - Vakya yojana- Planing of construction/formation of sentences in scientific way logically so that the meaning should be clear. - Arthayojana- The way of compilation of any treatise to make the meaning of words clear, or the specific meaning of the words. The importance and application of [tantrayukti](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti) is mentioned as prabodhana (knowledge) and prakashana (making clear or manifest) in [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita). Sushruta said that having the knowledge of a single subject one can not become expert, even his own discipline requires a multi disciplinary knowledge for holistic approach as of [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda). Charak has expressed this view in context of tantra yuktis that without knowing the same one can not understand his own subject as well as others. At the same time there is controversial remark is given after naming the thirty six [tantrayuktis](/index.php?title=Tantrayukti) that the detail description will be given in uttar tantra, practically which is not present in the available text today. Over this issue Dr. Richa Vishvakarma has thrown some light by her small effort and concluded that- Concluding [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita) In the last, the importance of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita) is mentioned that this treatise comprising one hundred and twenty chapters which expounds the statements of sage Atreya by eminent disciple Agnivesa, endowed with therapeutic wisdom for the benefit of all the living beings. In the original work of Agnivesha, some topics were dealt with in great detail, and some others, very briefly which hindered its proper comprehension. For removing these defects, the redactor Charaka made efforts because a text in brief is not understandable and detailed text is not comprehensible. Therefore, the original text was redacted to make it more convenient for the readers. Agnivesha tantra which is redacted by Charaka, one-third of it was not available at the time of Dridhabala. He supplemented 41 non-available chapters. These are 17 chapters of Chikitsa Sthana and 12 chapters each in Kalpa and Siddi Sthana. So in this way this text is available in present form. Uttara Tantra The available editions of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita) contain eight parts only. The other contemporary texts like Sushruta Samhita and Samhitas of Vagbhata have a separate additional section of Uttara-Tantra. The twelfth chapter of [Siddhi Sthana](/index.php?title=Siddhi_Sthana) Charak has mentioned about Uttara Tantra of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita). So it is essential to emphasize on this issue and search the possibility of a section that has been perished in due course of time. Many controversies are raised on the existence and recognition of uttara-tantra of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita). On the other hand, some scholars who belong to a later period have mentioned certain references in their work, which are claimed to be from uttara tantra of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita). After a thorough study and scanning of available literature, it is concluded that Charak uttar tantra was existing up to the time of Nishchalakara (13th century AD.). Nishchalakara has quoted a number of references in Ratnaprabha, which are from uttar tantra of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita). Furthermore, there is a need to discuss about existence of uttara tantra of [Charak Samhita](/index.php?title=Charak_Samhita) by more detailed study and scanning of literature of [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) and allied literature.
