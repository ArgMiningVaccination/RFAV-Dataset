DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH STATEMENT OF FRANCIS S. COLLINS, M.D., PH.D., DIRECTOR ACCOMPANIED BY: ANTHONY S. FAUCI, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AL- LERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAROLD E. VARMUS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CANCER INSTI- TUTE GARY H. GIBBONS, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL HEART, LUNG AND BLOOD INSTITUTE STORY C. LANDIS, PH.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE CHRISTOPHER P. AUSTIN, M.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOM HARKIN Senator H ARKIN . The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies will come to order. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Sorry we are a little late. We had a vote at 10\u2014that is all. Well, today will be my final Appropriations budget hearing for the NIH (National Institutes of Health) as the chair of this sub-committee. I took over this subcommittee from Senator Lawton Chiles in 1989. That is a long time ago it seems, a quarter century. I am so proud of all that we have done\u2014all of us here\u2014often on a bipartisan basis, to transform the National Institutes of Health into truly the jewel and the crown of biomedical research not only in the United States, but globally. 2 On Tuesday, as many of you know, I was on the NIH campus to help dedicate the new John Porter Neurosciences building. I was struck as I drove around the campus by the growth and moderniza-tion that has taken place there in the last 25 years. But that phys-ical transformation has been more than matched by the trans-formational science and discovery that has sprung from that cam-pus. If you do not mind, a little bit of reminiscences. My first year as chair was the first year that we invested NIH dollars in an exciting new project to map the human genome, 1989. I will never forget. I had taken over this subcommittee and I was visited by Dr. James Watson, whom I had never met before, but of course I had read about him\u2014the famous Nobel Prize winner\u2014Watson and Crick, discoverers of the double helix. And so, I was quite full of myself when as a freshman Senator I was visited by this great scientist who wanted to talk to me about investing in mapping and sequenc-ing the human gene. I had no idea what he was even talking about at that time, but he brought me along a little bit, and so we were able to put a little bit of money into that. Thanks again to all that initial work. And thanks to the work of Dr. Collins and his colleagues at NIH. We can now sequence the human genome at a fraction of the cost that it required, and in a shorter timeframe. I might just add, there was a study done by the Battelle Institute. It came out last year and said that the U.S. Fed-eral Government's $3.8 billion funding of the Human Genome Project between 1988\u2014actually it's 1989, but that is okay\u2014be-tween 1988 and 2003 drove $796 billion in U.S. economic impact due to the growth of the genomics technology industry and the use of genomics in healthcare, energy, agriculture, and other sectors\u2014 quite a rate of return on investment. And consider this: In 1989\u2014I remember it well in the 1980s\u2014 HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) was a death sentence. Today, thanks in large part to the leadership of Dr. Anthony Fauci, HIV is a manageable chronic disease, and we know how to prevent it. Since 1989, the proportion of older people with chronic disabilities has dropped by nearly one-third. Cancer death rates in the U.S. are now falling at a rate of nearly 1 percent each year. And each 1- percent decline saves our Nation nearly $500 billion. There has been near miraculous progress in the fight against childhood can-cers with the 5-year survival rate for the most common type, acute lymphocytic leukemia, now rising to a 90-percent cure rate. That is fantastic. Two of our witnesses here today direct centers that did not exist, that were not part of NIH in 1989. The National Institute of Men-tal Health moved from SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) to NIH in 1992, and this sub-committee created the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) in 2011. And although the directors are not here today, I am particularly proud to have authored the bill that cre-ated the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Dis-orders in 1988. Again, as I said, we worked to elevate the Genome Research Office at that time to a center in 1989, and we created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in fiscal year 1992. Looking back to 1989, my notes tell me that 3 in 1989 a Yale scientist named Francis Collins led a research team to discover the gene for cystic fibrosis. How far the NIH has come in 25 years. So many Nobel Prizes. So many life-saving discoveries. This subcommittee has had no higher priority than to support NIH and the scientists all across America dedicated to reducing suffering and improving public health. So this is a bittersweet moment for me and for all of us who revere the work of NIH because these great achievements are in the past. The future leadership of NIH is threatened by penny wise, pound foolish thinking by too many here in the Congress. Most in Congress are obsessed by budget deficits. I am more con-cerned by our deficits of vision and ambition and leadership. I am proud to say that since 1989, I have either chaired or been the ranking member of this subcommittee. Most of that time with Senator Arlen Specter. We kept changing back and forth as the leadership of the Senate would change, more recently with both Senator Shelby and now Senator Moran on this committee. So it has been, for me, an enlightening experience, through all these years. I do not have a science background, a bit of an engineering background, but not much of science. So for me it has just been eye opening to see what has happened with NIH through all these years. As our Government charts a course of stagnation and disinvest- ment in biomedical research, other countries are surging ahead. China's government pledged to increase its basic research invest-ment by a staggering 26 percent just in the last year and will in-vest more than $300 billion in biotechnology over the next 5 years, twice what we are planning on doing. So this is the context in which we consider the proposed funding levels for fiscal year 2015. The Murray-Ryan budget deal partially replaced the sequester for the coming year, and while I am pleased that the subcommittee has a solid top line figure to work with, these austere budget caps are wreaking havoc on NIH and other national priorities. With a non-defense cap that increases by $583 million this year, it is mathematically impossible to fully replace the remaining NIH sequester and provide just an inflationary increase to NIH without forcing additional cuts to education, and job training, and other pri-orities. By not replacing the sequester this year, we are foregoing $56 billion that could be invested in programs to grow our economy, programs like NIH. The President proposed a fully offset oppor-tunity growth and security initiative that represents the $56 billion in lost\u2014that was lost to sequester. That initiative would allow for investing an additional $900 million in NIH, enough to bring NIH back to the pre-sequester level and then provide a small increase. That is what we are losing by clinging to this devastating policy of sequester. Make no mistake: Keeping the sequester in place will mean a steady, destructive erosion in our NIH investment. It is no longer a question of politics; it is just a question of math. So I look forward to the discussion today about the exciting work that NIH is doing in the face of these budget problems, and in the hopes that we can all work together to support this vital institu-tion, and to maintain America's leadership in our biomedical 4 sciences. With that, I will yield to Senator Moran for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JERRY MORAN Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you. I look forward to con- tinuing to work with you during the remainder of your term as chairman of this subcommittee along with Senator Shelby, the ranking member, and Chairwoman Mikulski to see that we accom-plish some of the goals that you outlined in your statement. And I do appreciate Dr. Collins and his colleagues being with us today to discuss the National Institutes of Health. In my view, NIH represents hope for millions of patients suffering from conditions from Alzheimer's disease to cancer. NIH-funded research has raised life expectancy, improved the quality of life, and is an eco-nomic engine helping to sustain America's competitiveness. Over the past year, cutting-edge NIH-supported research discov- ered a blood test to predict if a healthy person will develop demen-tia or Alzheimer's disease, uncovered a set of rare mutations to a gene that provides protection against type 2 diabetes, and used tar-geted immunotherapy to induce remission in leukemia. What won-derful developments. A continued commitment to NIH is essential to address our Nation's growing health concerns, spur medical in- novation, sustain American competitiveness, and reduce healthcare costs. I think NIH is at a critical juncture. We have spent years focus- ing on doubling the NIH budget, and now a decade later the NIH budget is falling victim to an Administration's budget that does not prioritize biomedical research. The fiscal year 2015 budget touts an increase of $200 million, or 0.7 percent, seven-tenths of a percent. However, with the use of, really, a budget gimmick, the increase is all but eliminated with the President's proposal to increase the evaluation set-aside. Under the President's proposal, $142 million of the $200 million increase would be transferred to other programs within the Department of Health and Human Services, leaving NIH with only a $58 million increase. Without a consistent commitment to funding our premiere med- ical research agency, the future of biomedical research in the United States is in jeopardy. Grant success rates are at an all-time low. The average age of a first-time R01 grantee is 42 years old, up from 38 years old in 1980. I looked out across the list of the panel of witnesses and discovered that you all remain very young, so perhaps that is defeating the point I am trying to make. But our researchers are becoming older as we continue this process. In fact, our principal investigators who are 65 or older receive more than twice as many R01 grants than those 36 and under. Young sci-entists, which we desperately need, will be discouraged by these statistics, and many have fled research fields or left for opportuni-ties in other countries, putting our Nation at a serious risk for los-ing our global competitiveness in the biomedical research field and reducing the chances that we find cures and treatments. Dr. Collins has consistently raised this concern about what he calls ''deep long-term damage'' to biomedical research, and we should all pay attention to his warnings. We cannot let these re-search opportunities slip away. We cannot lose the brilliant sci-5 entists, the scientific minds that will make future ground-breaking discoveries in biomedical research to alternative careers or other countries. And we must not squander the scientific capacity that we have developed. I believe funding decisions represent more than just dollars. They reflect our Nation's priorities. And this Congress faces un-precedented challenges to reduce Government spending. Now is the time to reevaluate our funding priorities and invest after evalu-ating those priorities in biomedical research. This is the time of promise in research, and the United States should be at the fore-front in this area. To do so, we must commit to pay for the re-search. We must accomplish this. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Moran. Well, again, Dr. Collins and colleagues, welcome again to our subcommittee. I got your statement. I read it. It will be a part of the record in its en-tirety. And, Dr. Collins, we will recognize you. Just proceed as you so desire for 10 minutes or so, or whatever it takes you to get it done. Welcome back, Dr. Collins. SUMMARY STATEMENT OF DR . FRANCIS S . COLLINS Dr. C OLLINS . Well, thank you, and good morning, Chairman Har- kin, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the subcommittee. Let me introduce the folks at the table who are here with me: Over to your right, my left, Dr. Harold Varmus, the Director of the Na-tional Cancer Institute (NCI), formerly the director of the NIH; next to him, Dr. Gary Gibbons, Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and immediately to my left, Dr. Chris-topher Austin, Director of the new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; to my right, Dr. Story Landis, the Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; and finally as already mentioned, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Di-rector of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. And they are here to answer your questions, as am I. Well, it is a great honor for us to be here to appear before you and present the Administration's fiscal year 2015 budget request, and to provide an overview of our Agency's critical role in enhanc-ing the Nation's health through scientific discovery. But before I begin today, I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your extraordinary leadership on this sub-committee over these 25 years. You have been a remarkable\u2014I would say even historic\u2014advocate for biomedical research and for the NIH. We are all very grateful for your service, and will truly miss you on this subcommittee in the years to come. [The graphic follows:] 6 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH MISSION Dr. C OLLINS . NIH has been advancing our understanding of health and disease for more than a century. Scientific and techno-logical breakthroughs generated by NIH-supported research are be-hind many of the gains that you can see in this image of how our country has enjoyed gains in longevity and in health. For example, over the last 60 years, deaths from heart disease have fallen by more than 70 percent. Meanwhile, cancer death rates, as you have already cited, have been dropping about 1 percent annually for the last 15 years, life expectancy gains that have saved our Nation tril-lions of dollars. Likewise, HIV/AIDS treatments have greatly ex-tended lives, and prevention strategies are enabling us to envision the first AIDS-free generation since this virus emerged more than 30 years ago. [The graphic follows:] 7 Dr. C OLLINS . But none of these advances could have happened without the strong support of the Administration and the U.S. Con-gress, and specifically of this subcommittee. This subcommittee came together in a bipartisan way, and I want to thank you for that, to make it possible in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus appropria-tion to turn a corner. BUDGET CHALLENGES To be honest, the previous year was quite challenging for us. Se- questration applied damaging cuts to ground-breaking medical re-search and affected the morale of the scientific community. That impact was further exacerbated by the Government shutdown, which forced me to send 12,000 scientists home for 16 long days, and required us to turn patients away from the NIH Clinical Cen-ter. With the fiscal year 2014 omnibus, we are optimistic that a cor- ner has been turned after a difficult decade during which NIH has lost more than 20 percent of its purchasing power for medical re-search, 20 percent down from where we were in 2003. The Admin-istration now proposes a fiscal year 2015 budget request that is $211 million, or .7 percent, above the fiscal year 2014 level. This budget request reflects the President's and the Secretary's commit-ment to improving the health of the Nation and to maintaining our leadership in the life sciences while remaining within the con-straints of the Murray-Ryan budget envelope. It allocates resources to areas with the most extraordinary promise for medical research, while maintaining the flexibility to pursue unexpected scientific op-portunities, and to address unforeseen public health needs. 8 Within the Administration's fiscal year 2015 budget, NIH will in- crease our primary funding mechanism for investigator-initiated research, the research project grants, or RPGs. And this is a crit-ical priority. In fiscal year 2013, our grant success rate, as you can see in this graph, reached an all-time low of 16.8 percent, a num-ber that desperately needs to rise again. [The graphic follows:] Dr. C OLLINS . By careful stewardship of resources, we expect to support 9,326 new and competing RPGs next fiscal year, which will be an increase of 329 over fiscal year 2014 levels, although the total number of grants we support will remain approximately the same. But now, let me turn to some of the exciting scientific opportuni- ties that NIH is pursuing today. [The graphic follows:] 9 FUTURE OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Dr. C OLLINS . I can assure you the future of biomedical research has never been brighter. Basic science, for which the Federal Gov-ernment serves as the main source of support in the U.S., had led the way. Advances in genomics, proteomics, stem cells, imagine, the microbiome, and other technologies have led to phenomenal ad-vances in our understanding of how life works, and also the dis-covery of more than a thousand new risk factors for disease. NIH will continue to spend a little more than half of our budget on these basic science advances. But as you know, we are also deeply committed to catalyzing the translation of these discoveries into clinical advances. And this can be quite challenging to the dis-may of researchers, drug companies, and especially patients. We face a situation today where the vast majority of drugs entering the development pipeline fall by the wayside. The most distressing failures, as you see here, occur when a drug is found to be ineffective in the later stages of development, in phase two or phase three clinical trials, after years of work and millions of dollars have already been spent. [The graphic follows:] 10 ACCELERATING MEDICINES PARTNERSHIP Dr. C OLLINS . A major reason for such failures is that scientists often have not had enough information to choose the right biologi-cal targets, and if a drug is aimed at the wrong target, it will not be effective against the disease it was intended to treat, and a fail-ure will occur. So to this end, we were particularly thrilled to announce the launch of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, AMP, just 6 weeks ago. [The graphic follows:] 11 Dr. C OLLINS . This pre-competitive partnership, which will share all data openly, will initially focus on three disease areas that are ripe for drug discovery: Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and the autoimmune disorders lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Besides NIH, the partners in AMP include the FDA and 10 bio- pharmaceutical firms, listed here, and a number of non-profits, in-cluding patient advocacy groups. [The graphic follows:] 12 UNIVERSAL FLU VACCINE Dr. C OLLINS . This unprecedented public/private collaboration will use cutting-edge scientific approaches to sift through a long list of potential therapeutic targets and choose those most likely to lead to success, with the cost being shared evenly by NIH and industry. But we are not stopping there. Influenza is another area where we are poised for rapid progress. In fact, NIH-funded scientists are well on their way to developing a universal vaccine. The outside of the flu virus, shown here, is coated with tiny mushroom-shaped proteins, and each of these proteins has a head and a stem. [The graphic follows:] 13 Dr. C OLLINS . Current vaccines target the head of that mushroom, but this mutates over time. Here you can see in yellow the changes that occurred in three different flu viruses. [The graphic follows:] 14 Dr. C OLLINS . These changes, primarily in the head, are hap- pening all the time. To keep up, a new vaccine must be produced every year. On the other hand, you can see here the stem of the viral protein remains almost entirely unaltered over time. A universal flu vac-cine that targets the relatively stable stem would not only elimi-nate the need for an annual flu shot, but would also provide protec-tion against outbreaks like the H5N1 and H7N9 events in South-east Asia that are causing considerable worldwide concern right now. BRAIN INITIATIVE Another major challenge is exploring what has been called the most complex structure in the known universe, the human brain. As you know, NIH is leading the new Brain Research through Ad-vancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, B-R-A-I-N, BRAIN Initia-tive, and we are grateful for your support. [The graphic follows:] Dr. C OLLINS . This initiative will provide a foundational platform for major advances in Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and many other brain disorders. But a final area of scientific opportunity that I want to highlight today involves one of our Nation's biggest and most feared killers, cancer. Until recently, our weapons for attacking cancer have been surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, all of which can be effective, but carry risks. Recent advances have given us insights into the in-tricate workings of the cancer cell, and a whole new generation of 15 targeted therapeutics is emerging, ushering in an era of individual- ized precision medicine. [The graphic follows:] OPPORTUNITIES IN CANCER RESEARCH Dr. C OLLINS . This image on the left shows a dramatic example of just how effective such targeted therapies can be because on the left is a scan of a melanoma patient who carries a mutation and a gene that codes a protein called B-Raf. Now, B-Raf is implicated when mutated in the development of cancer. The hot spots that you see all over this individual's body indicate dividing cancer cells that have spread throughout. After treatment with a new drug targeted to block the effects of mutant RAF, those hot spots almost vanish. The promise of targeted therapy is apparent. But now, there is a new powerful weapon in the arsenal, cancer immunotherapy, a revolutionary new approach that Science maga-zine named its 2013 breakthrough of the year. [The graphic follows:] 16 Dr. C OLLINS . This involves harnessing the body's own immune system to fight this dreaded disease. In one of those new ap-proaches, certain types of immune cells called T-cells\u2014you can see them here\u2014are collected from cancer patients and engineered to produce special proteins on their surface. When these engineered T-cells are infused back into patients, they have the power to seek and destroy cancer cells. And in this video, you can see one of those modified T-cells doing just that, actually obliterating the cancer cell. [The graphic follows:] 17 Dr. C OLLINS . Knowing how to turn T-cells into little Ninja war- riors required big investments in basic biomedical research over more than a decade, but the consequences are starting to be amaz-ing. I would like to share this story, in closing, of Emily Whitehead. [The graphic follows:] 18 Dr. C OLLINS . Nearly 2 years ago, this brave little girl became the first pediatric patient to be treated with a new kind of cancer immunotherapy. Emily was suffering from acute lymphoblastic leu-kemia, a disease that, as was pointed out by Senator Moran, now we cure 90 percent of the time with chemotherapy. But distress-ingly, Emily was in the 10 percent where that fails. Her parents decided to enroll her in a pioneering cancer immunotherapy trial at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Emily's T-cells were collected from her blood and re-engineered in the lab to recognize a protein found only on the surface of her leu-kemia cells. Those T-cells were then infused back into Emily's blood where they circulated throughout her body on a mission to seek and destroy leukemia. Just 28 days after treatment, she was cancer free, and she remains so to this day. [The graphic follows:] 19 Dr. C OLLINS . Here is Emily today, a happy, healthy third grader who is looking forward to celebrating her ninth birthday next month. As her mom, Kerry, puts it, ''If you didn't know what hap-pened to her and you saw her now, you would have no idea what she has been through.'' A wonderful story of success. PREPARED STATEMENTS And, Senators, I believe there are a great many more Emilys on the horizon. Our Nation has never witnessed a time of greater promise for advances in medicine. With your support, we can real-ize our vision of accelerating discovery across the vast landscape of biomedical research. From basic scientific inquiry to human clinical trials, the National Institutes of Hope is ready to move forward. [The graphic follows:] 20 Dr. C OLLINS . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support of NIH. My colleagues and I welcome your questions. [The statements follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF FRANCIS S. C OLLINS , M.D., P H.D. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the subcommittee. I am Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is an honor to appear before you today to present the Administration's fis-cal year 2015 budget request for the NIH and provide an overview of our critical role in enhancing our Nation's health through scientific discovery. As the Nation's biomedical research agency, NIH's mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to apply that knowl-edge to enhance human health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. I can report to you that NIH leadership, employees, and grantees continue to believe pas-sionately in this mission. Before I discuss the tremendous strides we have made and the exciting scientific opportunities on the horizon, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Moran, as well as your colleagues, for the recent fiscal year 2014 Omnibus Appropriation bill. The subcommittee came together in a bipartisan way to increase funding for NIH and we are truly grateful for your action. The past year has been challenging for us: The sequester reduced funding for groundbreaking medical re-search and affected the morale of the scientific community. This impact was further exacerbated by the shutdown. There is much good news to report about the science that we support. NIH has been advancing our understanding of health and disease for more than a century; scientific and technological breakthroughs generated by NIH-supported research are behind much of the gains our country has enjoyed in health and longevity. For ex-ample, deaths from heart disease have been reduced by more than 70 percent from 1950 to 2008. Cancer death rates have been dropping about 1 percent annually for the past 15 years\u2014life expectancy gains that save the Nation billions of dollars. HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention now enable us to envision the first AIDS-free generation since this virus emerged more than 30 years ago. NIH research also has given us vaccines to protect against an array of life-threatening diseases, including cervical cancer, influenza, and meningitis. We can look forward to a future in which 21 advanced prevention and treatment strategies such as these allow everyone to have a significantly better chance of living a long and healthy life. These statistics tell you how far we have come\u2014but our aim is to go even further, faster. To this end, the Administration's fiscal year 2015 budget request for the NIH is $30.362 billion, $211 million, or 0.7 percent, above the fiscal year 2014 level. This budget request reflects the President's and the Secretary's commitment to improving the health of the Nation and to maintaining our Nation's leadership in the life sciences. The request highlights investments in innovative research that will ad-vance fundamental knowledge and speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics, and preventive measures to improve public health. The fiscal year 2015 budget request will enhance NIH's ability to support cutting- edge research and training of the scientific workforce. Within the Administration's fiscal year 2015 budget, we will continue to increase Research Project Grants (RPGs), NIH's funding mechanism for investigator-initiated research. NIH expects to support 9,326 new and competing RPGs in fiscal year 2015, an increase of 329 over fiscal year 2014 levels. For fiscal year 2015, NIH anticipates funding a total of 34,197 RPGs. The budget request allocates resources to areas of the most extraor-dinary promise for biomedical research, while maintaining the flexibility to pursue unplanned scientific opportunities and address unforeseen health needs. While we are very grateful for any budget increase, the fully paid $56 billion Op- portunity, Growth, and Security Initiative (OGSI), a program included in the Presi-dent's budget, would provide an additional $970 million investment in NIH pro-grams that would allow NIH to fund or expand a host of other cutting-edge initia-tives, speeding the development of vaccines and cures, and restoring sequestration cuts to the number of research project grants. Let me describe a few of the many areas in which NIH-supported research is opening up extraordinary opportunities to improve the health of the American pub-lic. A major program that began this year is the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, for which thanks are due to this subcommittee for its fiscal year 2014 support. NIH is a major player in this pio-neering multiagency venture that will enable the creation of new tools capable of examining the activity of billions of nerve cells, networks, and pathways in real time. By measuring activity at the scale of circuits and networks in living orga-nisms, we can begin to decode sensory experience and, potentially, even memory, emotion, and thought. Successful pursuit of the BRAIN Initiative will revolutionize neuroscience, providing a foundational platform for major advances in Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and many other brain disorders. As technology allows us to tackle mind-boggling tasks like recording the activity of billions of nerve cells in the brain or determining the DNA sequence of tens of thousands of human genomes, researchers are generating enormous quantities of data at an unprecedented pace. The challenge posed by this revolution is how to store, retrieve, integrate, and analyze this mountain of complex data\u2014and trans-form it into knowledge that can improve human health. To address this challenge that affects virtually all areas of biomedical research, we have just launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative. The goals of BD2K are to develop and dis-seminate new analytical methods and software, enhance training of data scientists, and facilitate broad use and sharing of complex biomedical datasets. With sustained investment and effort, we will overcome the challenges associated with Big Data to accelerate real-world applications of basic science discoveries. We are also excited about another area of intense interest: the development of therapeutics. Recent advances in genomics, proteomics, imaging, and other tech-nologies have led to the recent discovery of more than a thousand risk factors for disease\u2014biological insights that ought to hold promise as targets for drugs. But drug development is a terribly difficult and failure-prone business. To the dismay of researchers, drug companies, and patients, the vast majority of drugs entering the development pipeline fall by the wayside. The most distressing failures occur when a drug is found to be ineffective in the later stages of development\u2014in Phase II or Phase III clinical studies\u2014after years of work and millions of dollars have al-ready been spent. A major reason for such failures is that scientists often have not had enough information to choose the right biological targets. If a drug is aimed at the wrong target, it won't work against the disease it was intended to treat. With that challenge in mind, we were thrilled last month to launch the Accel- erating Medicines Partnership (AMP). This unprecedented public-private effort will use cutting-edge scientific approaches to sift through a very long list of potential therapeutic targets, and choose those most likely to lead to success. Besides NIH, the AMP partners include the FDA, 10 biopharmaceutical firms and a number of 22 nonprofits, including patient advocacy groups. This precompetitive partnership, which will share all data openly, will initially focus on three disease areas that are ripe for discovery: Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and the autoimmune dis-orders, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Through this team effort, we believe we can reach our shared goals of treating and curing disease faster. Preventing disease is another top priority, and influenza is one area of prevention in which we are poised for rapid progress. Currently, to provide protection against the rapidly evolving influenza virus, a new vaccine must be produced each year and we all need to get an annual flu shot. Also, despite best efforts, the vaccine isn't always ideal. In an average year, the flu claims up to 49,000 American lives and costs the U.S. economy about $87 billion. But it does not have to be that way. NIH- funded researchers are now working on a universal flu vaccine\u2014designed to protect people against virtually all strains of the flu for extended periods of time and, thus, potentially reduce the need for annual flu shots. Of critical importance, such a vac-cine could also protect against a future global flu pandemic. While we are several years away from having a universal flu vaccine available to the public, our researchers have already demonstrated proof of concept and are testing a number of approaches, including two-stage ''prime boost'' vaccines and fer-ritin nanoparticles. Clearly, the prospect of a universal flu vaccine is not science fic-tion. Early clinical studies are already underway. With sustained investment, the United States may be a few years away from realizing its potential to benefit our health and our economy. As impressive as a universal flu vaccine would be, it is not the only trick we are teaching our immune systems. We are also aiming to harness the body's own im-mune system to fight cancer. Until recently, our weapons for attacking cancer have been largely limited to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy\u2014treatments that carry risks and cause adverse side effects. Now, after years of intense basic and translational research, we have an exciting new possibility: Cancer immunotherapy. Researchers have long been puzzled by the uncanny ability of cancer cells to evade the immune response. What stops the body from waging its own ''war on can-cer?'' As it turns out, our bodies have built-in checkpoints to prevent our immune systems from going into overdrive and killing healthy cells. Now, NIH-funded re-searchers have discovered a way to genetically modify certain white blood cells called T-cells\u2014the soldiers of the immune system\u2014to attack tumor cells. In this new approach, T-cells are collected from cancer patients and engineered in the lab to produce special proteins on their surface, called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). When the modified cells are infused back into patients, they multiply and, with guidance from their newly engineered receptors, seek and destroy tumor cells. Promising results in patients with leukemia prompted Science magazine to name this its 2013 Breakthrough of the Year. Today, I have provided a very brief overview of NIH's past successes and con- tinuing commitment to basic, translational, and clinical research. Our Nation has never witnessed a time of greater promise for advances in medicine. With your sup-port, we can anticipate a future of accelerating discovery across NIH's broad re-search landscape, from fundamental scientific inquiry to human clinical trials. The ''National Institutes of Hope'' is ready to move forward. This concludes my testimony, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to your questions. PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANTHONY S. F AUCI , M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to discuss current and future plans for biomedical research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Presi-dent's fiscal year 2015 NIAID budget request of $4,423,357,000 billion is approxi-mately $31 million more than the fiscal year 2014 funding level ($4,392,670,000). NIAID conducts, supports, and translates basic and clinical research into the de- velopment of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to detect, treat, and prevent in-fectious and immune-mediated diseases. NIAID has a dual mandate that balances research addressing current biomedical challenges with the capacity to rapidly re-spond to new threats from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and bioter-rorism. INFECTIOUS DISEASES RESEARCH HIV/AIDS .\u2014NIAID is leading transformational progress in basic and clinical re- search on HIV/AIDS. The decades-long NIAID investment in HIV/AIDS research has made the goal of an AIDS-free generation a possibility with sustained effort. NIAID continues to improve and refine HIV prevention and treatment tools, includ-23 ing antiretroviral therapies to effectively manage disease and reduce HIV trans- mission, and pre-exposure prophylaxis to protect against HIV. NIAID also is advanc-ing research toward the development of an effective HIV vaccine to complement ex-isting prevention strategies. HIV vaccine development will be informed by NIAID efforts to identify immunological markers in the subset of people protected against HIV infection in the RV144 trial, the first HIV vaccine trial to show modest efficacy. The NIAID Vaccine Research Center together with several NIAID grantees are making rapid progress on ways to generate broadly neutralizing antibodies to pro-tect against multiple strains of HIV, research that may translate to vaccines and therapeutics of global public health significance. Years of NIAID-supported research on HIV pathogenesis and the role of HIV res- ervoirs have suggested the feasibility of curing some HIV-infected individuals. NIAID will investigate promising reports of a handful of infants who were born HIV-positive but now test negative for the virus following aggressive antiretroviral treatment initiated shortly after birth by supporting a clinical trial to determine if this strategy is safe and effective for other infants. NIAID also will play a major role in implementing the President's $100 million HIV/AIDS cure research initia-tive. As part of this effort, NIAID will support additional research on HIV latency and persistence. Understanding these processes may reveal new strategies toward a cure. NIAID recently restructured its HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks to capitalize on the growing body of promising HIV research findings and to better address cur-rent research questions. The Networks will focus on improved ways to prevent and treat HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C co-infections, and on research toward devel-opment of a vaccine, microbicides, and a cure. Tuberculosis .\u2014Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant cause of illness and death throughout the world, especially among those also infected with HIV. NIAID re-cently launched a genome sequencing project that will examine the genetic diversity of TB bacteria and patterns of drug resistance to understand TB pathogenesis and to identify new drug targets and molecular mechanisms of resistance. This research will be particularly important to address the emergence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant TB. NIAID-supported scientists also are working to modify the exist-ing antibiotic spectinomycin to bypass mechanisms of resistance to this drug. These efforts have shown promise in TB animal models. Malaria .\u2014NIAID continues to progress toward its goal to control, eliminate, and ultimately eradicate malaria worldwide. The development of vaccines is a critical part of this endeavor. NIAID researchers and grantees recently completed an early- stage clinical trial that showed a novel vaccine composed of weakened malaria sporozoites was safe and protected against malaria. NIAID has developed two new tests to rapidly and inexpensively detect resistance to artemisinin, a first-line anti-malarial drug. NIAID also is exploring innovative methods to control the spread of malaria. For example, NIAID-funded researchers have established a bacterial infec-tion that passes from female mosquitoes to their offspring and kills malaria parasites within the mosquitoes before they can infect humans. Other Infectious Diseases of Domestic and Global Health Importance .\u2014NIAID is committed to research on infectious diseases affecting global health. Influenza is among the most important infectious diseases of domestic and global concern. NIAID research addresses the challenge of seasonal influenza and prepares for the threat of an emerging pandemic. NIAID is developing and evaluating vaccines against the avian influenza strains H5N1 and H7N9 to deploy if needed to prevent further spread among humans. NIAID also is examining these vaccines paired with adjuvants\u2014components that enhance the immune response\u2014to provide the greatest protection with the smallest dose possible. NIAID investigators and grantees are making significant progress toward the development of a universal influenza vaccine that could generate durable protection over a period of years against a wide range of seasonal and pandemic influenza strains. Studies conducted by NIAID scientists at the NIAID Special Clinical Studies Unit in the NIH Clinical Center are providing important clues into the susceptibility and immune response of patients to influenza infection. Future studies will examine the effectiveness of new vaccines and thera-peutics. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a serious respiratory infection primarily of young children that causes significant illness and hospitalizations in the U.S. and thousands of deaths worldwide. There is no vaccine to protect infants and children against RSV. Researchers at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center recently deter-mined the structure of a key RSV protein bound to a broadly neutralizing human RSV antibody and used it to design an experimental RSV vaccine that is effective in animal models. NIAID has advanced this groundbreaking RSV vaccine into early- 24 stage clinical trials in humans. Science magazine highlighted this discovery among the top 10 scientific breakthroughs in 2013. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a significant cause of chronic liver disease and cancer, and often co-infects people with HIV. Traditional HCV therapies frequently have se-vere side effects and may not be successful in many patients. NIAID and NIH Clin-ical Center investigators recently led a Phase II trial of a new HCV drug, sofosbuvir. The trial demonstrated that sofosbuvir, combined with the antiviral drug ribavirin, was highly effective and well tolerated even in patients predicted to have poor out-comes with traditional HCV treatments. Sofosbuvir and similar therapies for the treatment of HCV have recently been approved, potentially revolutionizing treat-ment outcomes. Antimicrobial resistance is a significant public health challenge and an NIAID priority. NIAID recently reassessed research needs for this important issue and es-tablished a Leadership Group to design, implement, and manage the clinical re-search agenda for a new antibacterial resistance research network. NIAID provides resources to lower the investment risk for industry, academia, and non-profit organi-zations to facilitate a robust pipeline of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for resistant microbes. RESEARCH ON IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNE -MEDIATED DISORDERS NIAID's commitment to research on basic and clinical immunology continues to foster important insights that ultimately will help to better treat and prevent im-mune-mediated disorders, including food allergy. NIAID-funded investigators re-cently demonstrated that female sex hormones affect the gut microbiome and pro-mote development of autoimmunity in an animal model, providing clues into why women are more likely to be affected by autoimmune diseases. NIAID-supported re-searchers have made progress in understanding how exposure to certain microbes in early life, especially those found in homes with dogs, may protect against the de-velopment of asthma and other allergies. NIAID grantees also developed two urine tests to diagnose and predict rejection of a transplanted kidney. These simple tests could one day replace the invasive procedure currently used to detect organ rejection and particularly would benefit African Americans, who are disproportionately af-fected by organ transplant rejection. CONCLUSION For more than 60 years, basic and clinical research conducted and supported by NIAID on infectious and immune-mediated diseases has spurred the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to improve the health of millions around the world. NIAID will continue to perform the basic, clinical, and translational re-search critical to advancing the health of our Nation and the world. PREPARED STATEMENT OF HAROLD E. V ARMUS , M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 NCI budget of $4,930,715,000 includes an increase of $7,944,000, or 0.2 percent, compared to the fiscal year 2014 level of $4,922,771,000. OVERVIEW OF NCI RESEARCH PRIORITIES This is an era of remarkable opportunity in cancer research. Armed with broad knowledge about how various cancers arise and with powerful new research tools, the NCI is well equipped to accelerate progress towards preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer more effectively. This era of opportunity is due in significant part to the subcommittee's consistent support for biomedical research at NCI and NIH. The resources that you provide allow NCI to address an ambitious challenge: re- ducing the incidence, morbidity, and mortality for all of the many types of cancer, with tangible benefits for all Americans. The fiscal year 2015 budget will allow the NCI to build on the tremendous progress in many areas of cancer research, with the aim of improving outcomes for patients with all types of cancer. I will summarize some recent accomplishments and highlight new opportunities in five areas of NCI-supported research\u2014genomics, cancer immunology, targeted therapeutics, bioinformatics, and prevention\u2014to illustrate the breadth and pace of NCI's progress. The Cancer Genomics research that NCI supports has dramatically altered our understanding of how cancer develops, identified the molecular signatures that can 25 be used to diagnose and categorize cancer more precisely, and provided new targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, two major initiatives\u2014TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Ef-fective Treatments)\u2014have addressed nearly twenty common adult cancers and sev-eral less common cancers that occur in adults and children, revealing both tissue- specific patterns of genetic changes and changes that are common to several types of cancers. TCGA is a joint initiative of the NCI and the Human Genome Research Institute. During the past year, TCGA published comprehensive characterizations of acute myeloid leukemia, endometrial cancer, and clear cell renal carcinoma, among others. While every cancer is distinct genetically, many changes in the genome are shared among a wide array of cancer types, and each type of cancer has distinct patterns that often reflect exposure to carcinogenic agents, such as tobacco smoke and ultraviolet radiation. As these massive surveys come to conclusion, the NCI's Center for Cancer Genomics is leading efforts to make full use of the TCGA results, including the best ways to incorporate genomic findings into the design of clinical trials. Some of the surprising findings from the TCGA and TARGET projects\u2014such as the involvement of genes that govern the chemistry of chromosomal proteins, that influence cell metabolism, and that guide the processing of RNAs and proteins\u2014are influencing the study of cancer biology throughout the NCI's programs. TCGA and TARGET will certainly enlarge our understanding of carcinogenesis and will likely open new frontiers for preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancers. Cancer immunology is a rapidly advancing field that, in just the past few years, has dramatically altered our understanding of host defenses in response to cancers. It has also produced new and well-validated methods for treating cancer using anti-bodies that attach to proteins on cancer cell surfaces and using methods that modu-late the complex behavior of the immune system to attack cancer cells. For several years, monoclonal antibodies against cancer cell proteins have been used to treat blood cancers, such as certain lymphomas and leukemias, and subsets of several types of solid tumors, such as breast and colorectal cancer. More recently, immunotoxins have been created by genetic engineering to fuse antibodies with parts of bacterial toxins to selectively kill cancer cells. For example, such immunotoxins developed in the NCI intramural program have induced remissions in late stage cases of mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, drug-resistant hairy cell leukemia, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There is also great optimism within the science community about modulating the immune system by introducing novel antigen receptors into cancer-killing T cells and especially by infusing antibodies that interfere with a system that impedes the immune response to cancer cells. These ''immune-modulating'' antibodies have re-cently received FDA approval, and other antibodies that bond other immune cell regulators may soon follow. In 2011, FDA approved a monoclonal antibody, called ipilimumab, to treat advanced melanoma. Some patients with metastatic melanoma being treated with ipilimumab are still alive several years after completing treat-ment. In 2013, another promising antibody to treat melanoma\u2014lambrolizumab\u2014re-ceived ''breakthrough'' designation by the FDA, helping expedite its development and further use in clinical trials, with the possibility of an expedited FDA review. In recognition of these and other recent achievements in the field of immunology, and the promise of further developments, ''cancer immunotherapy'' was named this year's Breakthrough of the Year by Science magazine. Targeted therapies, based on the use of drugs that inhibit specific proteins impli- cated in the behavior of cancer cells, are now being developed and tested for their effects in patients with many types of cancer. Over the past decade, FDA has ap-proved several drugs that rely on this therapeutic approach to treat cancers of blood cells, lung cancer, melanoma, and other cancers, and many more are in develop-ment. This activity has accelerated because of discoveries in genomics, cell signaling pathways, chemistry, and structural biology, and with the identification of new ways to inhibit proteins that are required for the integrity of cancer cells. Mutant RAS proteins are perhaps the most prominent potential targets for new therapies that the academic and commercial research sectors have thus far failed to target with inhibitory drugs. The importance of the RAS gene family in cancer has been clear for over 30 years; one family member, K-RAS, is mutated in more than 90 percent of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, about 40 percent of colorectal can-cers, and about 25 percent of lung adenocarcinomas. For this reason, the NCI re-cently launched the RAS Project, a large-scale collaboration between investigators at the NCI's Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research and those in NCI's intramural and extramural communities. The RAS Project is motivated in part by new developments in the study of RAS proteins, including new information about their structural properties, binding of mutant RAS proteins to mutant-specific in-26 hibitors, interactions with other cellular proteins required for function, and new tests for genes required to allow RAS mutants to exert their effects. Still, while pursuing a path that leads to ''precision medicine,'' the NCI must also maintain its capacity to test new ways to deploy the currently dominant means of therapy. For instance, a recent study of patients with metastatic prostate cancer showed markedly increased survival in men who received chemotherapy when start-ing anti-androgenic hormone therapy, a result that is likely to change clinical prac-tice for a cancer that continues to kill about 30,000 American men annually. Drug resistance commonly emerges in cancers being treated with either tradi- tional chemotherapies or novel targeted therapies, allowing disease to progress. Over the past decade, NCI-supported studies have revealed several mechanisms by which resistance occurs, including additional mutations affecting the target mol-ecules, mutations in related genes, and changes in gene expression. In some cases, especially chronic myeloid leukemias, drugs that overcome resistance have been identified, developed and FDA-approved. But in other situations, resistance to tar-geted drugs remains a major impediment to success, and the NCI is making major investments to study this problem. Bioinformatics, the management of enormous sets of molecular and clinical data is a critical component of NCI's toolkit to study cancer in all of its manifestations. In work that ranges from cancer genomics, to cell signaling, and to clinical trials, the proper collection, analysis, storage, retrieval, and distribution of ''big data'' are critical elements of the Institute's charge. The NCI's Center for Bioinformatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) is addressing these responsibilities, in conjunction with NCI divisions. Part of the current effort requires the costly development of ''cloud computing'' to work with the vast (petabyte) amounts of genomic data gen-erated by TCGA, TARGET, and other projects, and to assemble and ultimately inte-grate clinical data with genomic data in manageable forms to promote further dis-covery and improve cancer care. Prevention of cancer remains NCI's most desired goal. While complete avoidance of cancer may be impossible, since cancers often arise through spontaneous mutations, the control of tobacco use, vaccination against cancer-causing viruses (human hepatitis B virus and human papillomaviruses), sunlight avoidance, and regulation of dietary and carcinogenic substances (such as asbestos) have already reduced the incidence and the mortality rates of many cancers. For instance, be-tween 2001 and 2010, largely due to the earlier reductions in tobacco use, there was a 25 percent decrease in male death rates and an 8 percent decrease in female death rates due to lung cancer, the major cause of death from cancer in the United States. Likewise, vaccination with current HPV vaccines can drastically reduce the incidence and mortality of several types of cancer, including cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers that are caused by infection with certain strains of HPV. Still, NCI recognizes that these successes are incomplete, and therefore invests heavily in efforts to address several pertinent behavioral and biological questions. For instance, despite dramatic declines in the use of tobacco, about 18 percent of Americans continue to smoke. New approaches are needed to convince young people not to use tobacco and to convince current smokers to quit. Use of HPV vaccines remains far from the desired levels among adolescent girls and boys in the United States, as the February 2014 report from the President's Cancer Panel emphasized. Better methods to promote the use of these potentially lifesaving vaccines are need-ed, at the same time as the dosing schedules and the protective breadth of the vac-cines are improved. CONCLUSION An important measure of the overall success of NCI's work is the annual ''Report to the Nation,'' which describes trends in the incidence and death rates in the United States for many types of cancer. As has now been true for over a decade, the most reliable indicator\u2014death rates from all cancers combined for men, women, and children\u2014continues to decline by about one and a half percent per year. This reduction represents the savings of an enormous number of years of life and can be ascribed in large measure to the work of the NCI to prevent and treat cancers more effectively. Still, although mortality rates have been decreasing for most cancers, progress has not occurred as rapidly as desired, and for some cancers the numbers have not improved\u2014or have worsened. Thus, much work remains. But the overall success ap-parent from both the public health data and recent achievements in the laboratory and clinical sciences inspires the NCI's conviction that expanded efforts on all fron-tiers of cancer research will produce better health in the United States and around the globe. 27 PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARYH. G IBBONS , M.D. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the subcommittee: I am pleased to present the President's budget request for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood In-stitute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 budget of $2,987,685,000 includes an increase of $4,948,000 over the fiscal year 2014 enacted level of $2,982,737,000. NHLBI's highest priorities for research investment are conditions that contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. Heart and lung diseases are the lead-ing causes of death, disability, and rising healthcare costs from non-communicable diseases in the United States and worldwide. Research supported by the NHLBI has contributed to dramatic improvements in longevity, quality of life, and the wealth of the Nation. Deaths from cardiovascular disease, for example, have dropped by 70 percent in the past 40 years. This success reflects a balanced approach to supporting discovery science that spans basic, clinical, and population research. As accountable stewards seeking to maximize the public's return-on-investment, we are committed to continually improving our approach to strategic priority-setting and systematic evaluation of our portfolio to ensure the highest possible impact on science and health. Reflecting upon the NHLBI's legacy of success, many of the previous advances in- volved interventions at the latter stages of chronic disease. The fiscal year 2015 budget envisions a research agenda that elucidates the underlying mechanisms of disease such that clinicians can more accurately predict at-risk individuals and tai-lor preventive interventions for disease long before symptoms and irreversible dam-age occur. Our strategic vision is guided by the breathtaking scientific opportunities at hand and public health needs, in consultation with domain-experts at the leading edge of discovery science. The fiscal year 2015 budget continues a journey toward predictive, preventive precision medicine that holds promise for turning research-to- results, continuing the dramatic decline in the burden of chronic disease in our Na-tion. UNPRECEDENTED SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITIES Sustained investments in fundamental discovery science have led to new tools and technologies that stand to revolutionize medical research and clinical practice. Bio-medical advances in congenital heart disease (CHD), the most common structural birth defect, have led to dramatic improvements in infant survival over the past 50 years, now with more adults living with CHD than children. However, current pal-liative approaches that repair birth defects have limitations that compromise the length and quality of life. Recent NHLBI-supported research, applying the latest genomic technologies, has identified spontaneous genetic mutations that increase the risk of CHD. This breakthrough finding is beginning to unlock the mysteries of CHD, helping to define what goes awry during the formation of the heart and lay the foundation for preventing or fixing defects in the womb. To that end, NHLBI is investing in regenerative medicine research to enhance the capacity of the heart to repair itself. The 2012 Nobel Laureate, Shinya Yamanaka, is part of a large inter- institutional team of NHLBI-funded investigators studying how to use a child's own cells to repair a congenital defect or create a tissue graft that could grow as a child ages. NHLBI investments in reparative biology and tissue bioengineering may also hold promise for accelerating new drug development platforms in partnership with the private sector. For example, NHLBI-funded investigators at Stanford University are using stem cells derived from adult tissue in a laboratory to create heart cells and model diseases such as those that perturb the electrical system of the heart in atrial fibrillation. These models are being used to more efficiently screen many novel drugs to determine efficacy as well as potential toxicities, augmenting the discovery pipeline. PREEMPTING AND PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE New scientific discoveries hold promise for making public health inroads to halt chronic diseases before they become debilitating. In sickle cell disease (SCD), for ex-ample, we have made great strides in reducing complications from the disease, such as penicillin to prevent fatal infections in infants, transfusions to reduce stroke risk, and hydroxyurea to reduce pain and hospital admissions. While these advances have extended lifespans from childhood into the sixth decade of life, they target complica-tions not the disease itself\u2014a disease that disproportionately affects African Ameri-cans (about 1 in 500 births). We recently funded a new program that we hope will lead to the next generation of SCD treatments. Particularly exciting are studies that 28 are attempting to raise fetal hemoglobin levels (the most powerful known modifier of SCD severity) through modulation of a gene called Bcl11A that is involved in the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin during development. These studies open the door to potential treatments that can reactivate the fetal hemoglobin gene to inhibit the sickle cell shape change of red blood cells, which could preempt disease progres-sion. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death, is a prime example of a chronic disease in which biomedical research advances have ameliorated symptoms; yet most interventions fail to dramatically alter the natural course of the disease. There is a critical need to identify at-risk individuals earlier in the disease process to prevent disease progression. NHLBI's COPDgene study is integrating genetics and imaging studies to characterize pre-clinical subtypes of COPD. Such characterization can enable clinicians to detect subtle changes in lung function and structure long before symptoms develop, conventional clinical tests show abnormalities, or progressive lung damage occurs. This leading-edge research points to a horizon of individualized, precision medicine to preempt chronic lung dis-ease. TRANSLATING DISCOVERIES INTO PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT While basic science is the cornerstone of scientific discovery, it is the beginning of a long path to public health impact. NHLBI has been a leader in traversing this road. Noted research initiatives like the Framingham Heart Study first identified the cardiovascular disease risk factors now addressed in routine physicals, which led to basic research that won Brown and Goldstein the Nobel Prize for their research on cholesterol metabolism\u2014setting the stage for the development of statin drugs. We are currently amidst the unfolding of a similar story. The recent discovery of a mutation in the gene PCSK9 among a family with very low LDL cholesterol levels and reduced risk of heart attack has led to basic science discoveries and the rapid development of PCSK9 inhibitors. This public-private partnership is moving toward potential widespread clinical use as the next generation of cholesterol lowering drugs. We now know, however, that we must look beyond one-size-fits-all treatments. Population science and genetics research have clearly demonstrated individual dif-ferences not only in predisposition to disease but also in treatment response. For example, 26 million Americans currently suffer from asthma\u2014the leading cause of missed school days for children and a driver of preventable hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Asthma disproportionately affects African Americans; Afri-can American children are twice as likely to have asthma as white children and, as adults, are two to three times more likely to die of asthma than any other racial or ethnic group. While effective treatments exist, they do not reach all of those in need. NHLBI will be seeking applications focused on identifying barriers and testing strategies to enhance the implementation of evidence-based practices in diverse communities across the Nation. Beyond the current treatments, next generation therapies should target these differences to achieve maximal benefit. NHLBI's multi-center clinical trial network, AsthmaNet, is beginning the Best African Amer-ican Response to Asthma Drugs (BARD) study to compare the effectiveness of dif-ferent treatments on the management of asthma in African Americans. BARD will also assess how genetics may influence an individual's response to the treatments, which could be a paradigm shift in addressing challenges like disparities in asthma care. CONCLUSION We are in the midst of a very exciting period in science in which the capacity to enhance human health has never been greater. New tools and technologies are dar-ing us to envision a future that is unburdened by chronic heart, lung, and blood dis-eases\u2014not only ensuring wellness but also increasing economic productivity and re-ducing healthcare costs. For example, research shows that treating patients at mod-erate risk for cardiovascular disease with statin drugs to lower cholesterol can re-duce annual medical spending by up to $430 million. Imagine how much can be saved by preventive interventions earlier in the disease course before symptoms begin and the costs of treatment rise dramatically. By achieving that goal, the re-turn-on-investment of biomedical research will strengthen both the health and the wealth of the Nation. 29 1Statistics for stroke, TBI, and epilepsy from U.S. Centers from tion www.cdc.gov 2Circulation 2014; 129:e28-e292 32013 Report: Medicines in Development for Neurological Disorders, Pharmaceutical Re- searchers and Manufacturers of America http://www.phrma.org/innovation/meds-in-development PREPARED STATEMENT OF STORY C. L ANDIS , PH.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 NINDS budget of $1,608,461,000 includes an increase of $22,664,000 over the com-parable fiscal year 2014 level of $1,585,797,000. NINDS supports research to reduce the burden of neurological disorders, from basic studies of the normal brain through clinical trials of prevention and treatment interventions. Today, I will make four points: (1) the burden of neurological disorders is enormous; (2) past NINDS re-search has paid off; (3) opportunities for future progress are extraordinary; and (4) we have well informed plans to exploit these opportunities. BURDEN OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS Nearly 800,000 Americans experience a stroke each year, and 15 to 30 percent of the 6.8 million stroke survivors alive today suffer permanent disability.1Trau- matic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in children and young adults, common among the elderly, and a major concern for the military and veterans. In the United States, 2.5 million people receive emergency care for a TBI each year, and millions more suffer mild TBI (concussions). Epilepsy affects 2.3 mil-lion Americans, including 1 in 26 people at some time in their lives. Alzheimer's dis-ease is receiving increasing attention, but most people are less aware that frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most common dementia in people under age 60, and vascular dementia, which affects blood vessels in the brain, is the second most common dementia overall and is so closely intertwined with Alzheimer's dis-ease that most dementia patients have a combination of the two. Parkinson's dis-ease, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and hundreds of rare dis-eases that affect children and adults add to the immeasurable human and economic burden. PROGRESS FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES NINDS research drives progress directly, and indirectly catalyzes private sector advances. NINDS studies on risk factors and prevention contributed to a decline in the age-adjusted stroke death rate by 35.8 percent from 2000 to 2010; the actual number of stroke deaths fell 22.8 percent. 2NINDS research developed the only ap- proved emergency drug therapy that restores blood flow to the brain following stroke, increasing likelihood of recovery with little or no disability by 30 percent. Research has also demonstrated, defying conventional wisdom, a wider window of opportunity for stroke rehabilitation\u2014even patients who start rehabilitation as late as 6 months after a stroke can improve, and patients can continue to improve 1 year after a stroke. For people with epilepsy, an implantable device approved this year senses impending seizures and delivers electrical pulses to stop them. Long-term NINDS research provided the essential foundation for private sector development of this device. Similarly, NINDS research directly and indirectly contributed to deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies now in use for Parkinson's, essential tremor, and dystonia and under clinical testing for many other disorders, as well as to develop-ment of drugs for multiple sclerosis\u201410 are now on the market, including the first oral drugs. Overall, the private sector has nearly 450 medicines in development for neurological disorders, which would not be possible without the foundation of NIH research. 3 EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITIES Science and technology are opening unprecedented opportunities for progress against neurological disorders. Studies on the normal brain build the foundation. Notable recent advances, for example, revealed how the brain clears out debris dur-ing sleep, how molecular structures called ion channels control electrical activity, and the first human ''connectome'' maps, providing astonishing views of the basic wiring diagram of living, thinking human brains. Advances in stem cell biology now enable researchers to reproduce in cell culture key steps in amyotrophic lateral scle-rosis (ALS) and other disorders using brain cells derived from patients' own skin cells. Basic science has led to new insights that explain how chronic pain is wired 30 in the brain, what happens in the brain following a concussion, and how cell-to-cell propagation of abnormally folded proteins could drive progression of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and other neurodegenerative disorders. New gene sequencing methods and high throughput gene silencing technologies have accelerated the discovery of genes that cause epilepsy and revealed potential new drug targets for Parkinson's disease. In a few dramatic cases, gene discoveries have led directly to treatments that help patients with rare disorders, including subtypes of dystonia and childhood neurodegenerative disease, but more often painstaking translational research is re-quired to advance genetic and other discoveries toward therapies. Among the many examples, promising reports in laboratory animals this year demonstrated a drug therapy that prevented the development of epilepsy, cell transplants that controlled seizures, natural growth factor rescue of neonatal brain injury, therapies that im-proved cognition in Down syndrome, and a hand neuroprosthesis that restored touch sensation as well as movement. PROGRAMS AND PRIORITIES NINDS relies heavily upon the wisdom and ingenuity of researchers throughout the United States to propose and evaluate the best scientific opportunities. Comple-menting investigator-initiated programs, NINDS initiatives target unmet opportuni-ties or public health needs. Institute priorities reflect strategic and disease-specific planning that engages the scientific community and the public, and rigorous evalua-tion of programs, closing those that have met their goals or are no longer appro-priate for today's science. Recent plans focused on stroke, epilepsy, dis-ease, and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias. Among recent initiatives: \u2014the Stroke Trials Network will determine more quickly and at less cost what treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation strategies work best. \u2014new Epilepsy Centers without Walls will target Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and disease modification or prevention. \u2014the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program is developing assessment tools that will overcome roadblocks to more effective clinical trials. \u2014the International TBI Research Initiative, coordinated with the European Union and the Canadian Institute of Health Research, will answer questions on care and classification of TBI that have confounded development of interventions. \u2014two major cooperative studies are investigating the long-term changes in the brain years after a single TBI or multiple concussions, coordinated via the Foundation for NIH's Sports and Health Research Program, which was estab-lished with a donation from the National Football League. \u2014the NeuroBioBank, NINDS Human Genetics Repository, Federal Interagency TBI Research database, Common Data Elements Program, and an epilepsy clin-ical genetics data repository are examples of new and continuing resource initia-tives that empower individual investigators and promote data sharing. Finally, and most ambitiously, the President's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative will dramatically improve tools to understand heretofore unapproachable questions about how networks, or circuits, of brain cells enable us to perceive, think, and act. There are many reasons for con-fidence that this basic research initiative will ultimately advance progress against disease. Autism, dystonia, and epilepsy, for example, are fundamentally disorders of brain circuitry, and stroke, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease disrupt brain cir-cuits as nerve cells die. Even with our limited understanding of brain circuits and imprecise technologies for altering them, interventions that compensate for malfunc-tioning brain circuits already produce remarkable results. For example, DBS re-verses symptoms for many people with Parkinson's disease and dystonia, and para-lyzed people have controlled a robotic arm by signals directly monitored from their brains' movement control circuits. It is perhaps obvious that better understanding of brain circuits and tools to influence their activity would greatly improve these interventions, but history teaches that the most important payoffs of the BRAIN Ini-tiative, as for basic research generally, may be entirely unforeseen. PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. A USTIN , M.D. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to present to you the President's budget request for the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) for fiscal year 2015. The fis-cal year 2015 budget for NCATS is $657,471,000, which represents an increase of $25,075,000 over the fiscal year 2014 level of $632,396,000. The request includes $471,719,000 for the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program and $29,810,000 for the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN). 31 TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH In recent years, biomedical research has led to significant advances in our under- standing of human biology. We have sequenced the human genome, explored the po-tential of stem cells, and discovered RNA interference. All of these advances have been celebrated as holding enormous promise for improving human health, but the road from promise to tangible improvements in public health has been long, complex and full of obstacles. NCATS aims to turn these game-changing discoveries into treatments for patients by addressing the ''translational sciences'' needed to close the gap. Translational sciences comprise the process of turning observations in the laboratory and clinic into effective interventions that improve the health of individ-uals and the public\u2014from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes. NCATS takes a system-wide approach to diseases and the translational science process. It serves as an ''adaptor'' to connect basic, clinical and public health re-search and as a ''convener'' for disparate organizations that play roles in the process of turning discoveries into health improvements. Every NCATS initiative is a col-laboration with partners in the public, private, government or nonprofit sector. The Center is committed to developing technologies and paradigms that improve the effi-ciency and effectiveness of one or more steps in the translational process, dem-onstrating that these innovations work in specific use cases, and disseminating the translational advances widely to catalyze improvements in all translational efforts with the ultimate and critically important goal of improving health. MISSION INTO ACTION One NCATS initiative that exemplifies these goals is the Discovering New Thera- peutic Uses for Existing Molecules program. This program matches academic re-search groups with pharmaceutical companies to explore new disease indications for investigational compounds that are no longer being pursued by the pharmaceutical companies. The aim is to address several challenges in the translation process: the need for treatments for the several thousand diseases that have no effective ther-apy, the complicated process of negotiating agreements between parties who want to work together, and the largely ad hoc process by which academic and pharma-ceutical researchers develop collaborative projects. In fiscal year 2013, NCATS fund-ed nine projects covering eight disease areas, including Alzheimer's disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and schizophrenia. The program already has resulted in positive outcomes. Within 3 months of the grantees receiving funds, three com-pounds were being tested in humans for new uses\u2014two to treat schizophrenia and one to treat Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the time to establish collaborations be-tween industry and academics has been shortened to only 13 weeks from the more typical 9 months to a year. NCATS will solicit a second group of projects in fiscal year 2014. The NCATS emphasis on innovation is central to its collaboration with the Na- tional Eye Institute and Organovo (which makes 3-D tissue printers) to develop 3- D, architecturally accurate eye tissue. Such tissues have the potential to accelerate the drug discovery process\u2014enabling treatments to be developed faster and at a lower cost\u2014by giving researchers a more accurate view of how drugs will behave in human cells before those drugs ever enter clinical trials. NCATS serves as a catalyst to increase the efficiency of the translational eco- system, as illustrated by the formation of a research team that included scientists from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the NCATS Assay Development and Screening Technology Laboratory. This team developed new methods to overcome several translational roadblocks and was able to demonstrate their effectiveness by identifying a promising new compound that prevents the death of cells in the eye from glaucoma, a disease that can lead to blindness. Working together, the collabo-rators were able to solve a problem that none of them could address alone. TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH SPECTRUM Strengthening and supporting the entire spectrum of translational research with the ultimate aim of improved public health is a top priority for NCATS, and the CTSA program is crucial for these efforts. The CTSA program develops new tech-nologies, methods, resources and operational paradigms that catalyze clinical re-search progress, and supports the training and career development of translational researchers. In June 2013, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report following a review of the CTSA program. The report recommended that NCATS take a more active role in the program's governance and direction, formalize the evaluation proc-esses of the program, advance innovation in education and training programs, and 32 ensure that the patient community participates in all phases of research. Since the publication of the report, the Center has increased programmatic and fiscal manage-ment of the grants that support the CTSA program and has streamlined the govern-ance of the consortium, consulting closely with the CTSA Principal Investigators. A Working Group of the NCATS Advisory Council was established in December 2013 to provide input on measurable objectives for the program. The Working Group will submit its report to the NCATS Advisory Council in May 2014. FOCUS ON RARE DISEASES NCATS is deeply committed to developing treatments for rare diseases, which are defined in the U.S. as affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals. There are approxi-mately 6,500 rare diseases, but only 250 have treatments. The NCATS Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program advances potential treatments for rare and neglected diseases to first-in-human trials, an approach known as ''de-risk-ing.'' This strategy makes new drugs more commercially attractive to biopharma-ceutical companies, despite the small patient population that is characteristic of these diseases. For example, in 2013, a clinical trial was started to evaluate a drug candidate called cyclodextrin as a possible treatment for Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), a rare and fatal genetic brain disease affecting children. A TRND-led team of more than 20 investigators from NIH, academia, a pharmaceutical company, and patient groups developed cyclodextrin as a treatment as well as an NPC bio-marker to guide its clinical development. An Investigational New Drug application for cyclodextrin was approved by the FDA, and a Phase I clinical trial currently is ongoing. CURES ACCELERATION NETWORK CAN was authorized to advance the development of high-need cures and reduce significant barriers between research discovery and clinical trials. At NCATS, CAN is intended to advance initiatives designed to address scientific and technical chal-lenges that impede translational research. Currently, CAN supports the Tissue Chip for Drug Screening Program, which is a partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the FDA to develop 3-D human tissue chips that accurately model the structure and function of human organs, such as the lung, liver and heart. These devices will en-able researchers to predict harmful health effects of new drugs more accurately, thus addressing one of the main reasons that drug studies often fail. NCATS has had success moving projects forward with its rare disease thera- peutics program, but there are significantly fewer groups working on developing medical devices, for which there is a great need. NCATS could launch a comprehen-sive collaborative effort to accelerate device development as part of the next phase in the CAN program. CONCLUSION These projects are just a few examples of the exciting and innovative activities underway at NCATS. Though the Center is still relatively new, early successes dem-onstrate how its distinctive approaches can help solve some of the most challenging problems in translational science. We will build on our accomplishments over the past 2 years to accelerate our programs further in fiscal year 2015. I look forward to sharing more of our achievements with you as NCATS continues to evolve. [CLERK 'S NOTE .\u2014The following Institutes of the National Insti- tutes of Health did not appear before the subcommittee this year. Chairman Harkin requested these Institutes to submit testimony in support of their fiscal year 2015 budget request. Those state-ments follow:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF LINDA S. B IRNBAUM , PH.D., D.A.B.T., A.T.S. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am pleased to present the President's budget request for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 NIEHS budget of $665,080,000 includes an increase of $556,000 from the com-parable fiscal year 2014 level of $664,524,000. The NIEHS Strategic Plan, Advanc-ing Science, Improving Health continues to guide efforts toward fulfilling our mis-sion to discover how the environment affects people in order to prevent both acute and chronic illness. 33 1Ryan PH et al. Childhood exposure to Libby amphibole during outdoor activities. May 22, 2013. J. Expo. Sci. Environ. Epidemiol. Published online at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed/?term=PMID%3A+23695492 BREAST CANCER NIEHS continues its robust investment into environmental factors affecting breast cancer, with the goal of learning how we can prevent this widespread disease. NIEHS and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) collaborated to support the Inter-agency Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Coordinating Committee, whose report, Prioritizing Prevention, recommends strategies to mitigate the environ-mental causes of breast cancer. NIEHS supports several major epidemiological and translational breast cancer initiatives. The Breast Cancer and the Environment Re-search Program is a transdisciplinary initiative cosponsored by NCI and NIEHS, in which basic scientists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and community partners work to-gether to examine the effects of environmental exposures that may predispose a woman to breast cancer throughout her life, including exposures during puberty, menopause, pregnancy, and other ''windows of susceptibility.'' The NIEHS Sister Study has recruited a cohort of 50,884 U.S. and Puerto Rican women with a sister diagnosed with breast cancer, to prospectively study environmental and genetic fac-tors that influence breast cancer risk and survival. More than 1,500 incident breast cancers have been diagnosed to date. A May 2013 publication from these research-ers showed that DNA methylation profiling in blood samples may hold promise for breast cancer detection and disease risk prediction. The Agricultural Health Study, a collaborative effort by NCI, NIEHS, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), includes a comprehensive evaluation of many commonly used herbicides and pesticides and their potential impact on risk of breast cancer among 32,000 women who are mar-ried to pesticide applicators (primarily farmers). ENVIRONMENT AND AUTOIMMUNITY NIEHS supports scientists who are exploring how environmental exposures can cause immune system dysfunction. There is evidence that autoimmune diseases likely involve an environmental component. Therefore, the Environmental Autoimmunity Group in the Clinical Research Program at NIEHS is looking at the relationship between environmental factors and autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases result from an immune response directed against the body's own tissues and they collectively afflict approximately 24.5 million Americans, with women dis-proportionately affected. The cause(s) of autoimmune disorders remain largely un-known and are likely multifactorial involving both genetic and environmental influ-ences. In 2013, NIEHS released a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to en-able a better understanding of the links between exposures and autoimmune dis-ease. NIEHS continues to support autoimmune disease research in the underserved community of Libby, Montana where the population has been exposed to asbestos minerals as a byproduct of vermiculite ore mining. Of particular concern is early childhood exposure, since susceptibility may be increased during this life stage. Re-cent efforts to characterize children's exposure in Libby estimated up to 15 times higher levels of airborne asbestos concentrations during outdoor activities and 73 percent of the study participants indicated these activities occurred in the presence of children. 1NIEHS grantees are investigating whether childhood asbestos expo- sures in Libby are associated with pulmonary disease later in life. ENVIRONMENT AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS Evidence indicates there is both an environmental and genetic component in neu- rological disorders. NIEHS funds research to advance the understanding of environ-mental factors and gene-environment interactions related to neurodegenerative dis-eases and to help create new prevention and treatment approaches. At the NIEHS Centers for Neurodegeneration Science (CNS) and in partnerships with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and National Institute on Aging (NIA), teams of top scientists from different disciplines collaborate to examine the root causes of neurodegenerative diseases. CNS researchers study how exposure to pesticides, metals (e.g. arsenic, lead), and other chemicals affect the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. NIEHS recently published two Funding Opportunity Announcements to expand neurological research: one on environmental exposures and Alzheimer's disease, and the other on environmental exposures and neurodegenerative disease. 34 2Int J Epidemiol. 2014 Feb 11.

NIEHS-funded researchers have published work indicating prenatal vitamins might reduce the risk of having children with autism. 2 Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and during the first year of life was also associated with autism. 345NIEHS funds two key autism studies: the Childhood Au- tism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study, and the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) study. In April 2014, NIEHS hosted a community virtual forum on autism and the environment that was webcast live and featured a panel of autism research experts. RESEARCH UPDATE ON ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS NIEHS is the leading government agency funding research on the human health effects of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDCs have the poten-tial to interfere with a host of physiological functions, contributing to the develop-ment of costly and devastating illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and behavioral disorders, asthma, endometriosis and uterine fibroids, reproductive disorders and infertility, and breast, uterine, and pros-tate cancers. Exposures to EDCs have been documented across the population, with fetuses and young children at greater risk due to their stages of rapid development. NIEHS is currently funding over 100 grants examining effects of EDCs including bisphenol A (BPA), arsenic, pesticides, flame retardants, and others. NIEHS has focused particular efforts on BPA, in part due to its ubiquity, that re- sults in daily exposures for most people, mainly through diet. The Consortium Link-ing Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity (CLARITY\u2014BPA) research program is a collaborative effort of the NIEHS, the National Toxicology Program (NTP), the Food and Drug Administration's National Center for Toxicological Re-search, and academic researchers studying a range of health endpoints, while also establishing new testing standards and methodologies. A recent study of another EDC, phthalates, shows that levels of some plasticizers have fallen since a Federal ban on their use in children's products and voluntary removal from many consumer goods. 6However, research at Brown University suggests that replacement chemicals may be just as damaging to the reproductive development of boys.7 RESEARCH UPDATE ON GULF OIL SPILL The release of millions of gallons of crude oil following the 2010 Deepwater Hori- zon (DWH) disaster posed unpredictable risk to over 130,000 workers trained and potentially involved in various remediation activities and to the people living along the Gulf Coast. To date, there have been limited studies on the human health ef- fects of oil spills, especially long-term effects. The NIEHS Gulf Long-term Follow- up Study (GuLF STUDY), funded in part by the NIH Common Fund, is inves-tigating potential short- and long-term health effects associated with oil spill clean-up activities. The GuLF STUDY has enrolled 32,786 individuals and has completed home visits for 11,200 participants, during which clinical measurements were taken and biospecimens were collected for future research. NIEHS leads the DWH Research Consortia that funds a network of academic and community partners to study health effects in people residing in regions affected by the disaster. These studies are examining resilience at the individual and commu-nity levels, perceptions of risk among women and children, and the potential con-tamination of seafood in the Gulf (Strategic Plan Goals 4-6). While NTP is con-35 ducting research to increase our understanding of the toxicology of crude oil, NIEHS grantees have preliminary results that suggest increased depression and anxiety among Gulf Coast residents, but also suggest strong community networks promote resilience. PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSEPHINE P. B RIGGS , M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: As the Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) of the National In-stitutes of Health (NIH), I am pleased to present the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request for NCCAM. The fiscal year 2015 budget includes $124,509,000, which is $384,000 more than the comparable fiscal year 2014 appropriation of $124,125,000. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is the Federal Government's lead agency for supporting scientific research on com-plementary practices and integrative health interventions. NCCAM's mission is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of such practices and their roles in improving health and healthcare. COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CARE Complementary and integrative health practices are defined as having origins outside of mainstream conventional medicine and include both self-care practices like meditation, yoga, and dietary supplements, as well as healthcare provider ad-ministered care such as acupuncture, chiropractic, osteopathic and naturopathic medicine. As these modalities are increasingly integrated into mainstream healthcare, NCCAM is committed to developing the scientific evidence needed by the public, healthcare professionals and health policymakers to make informed decisions about the use and integration of these various practices. USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CARE For the past decade, some 30 to 40 percent of Americans have used complemen- tary and integrative health practices, according to data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion (CDC). The NHIS data shows that Americans are willing to pay for these serv-ices, spending some $34 billion in 2007, which represented 1.5 percent of total health expenditures and 11 percent of out-of-pocket costs. NCCAM has worked with the CDC since 2002, to develop the questions on complementary healthcare that are included in the NHIS every 5 years (2002, 2007, and 2012). Results from the latest survey are currently being analyzed for publication later this spring. Analysis will include, for the first time, a comparison of regional variations in use of complemen-tary health practices by adults in the United States. We also look forward to the first detailed look at integration of complementary interventions into private med-ical practice when the results of the 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-vey, which involved interviews of 30,000 physicians, are analyzed. NCCAM worked closely with the CDC to develop the questions used in this survey, as well. IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH NCCAM's approach to setting priorities and investment in research is guided by the need for rigorous evidence that ultimately may have a significant impact on public health. One example of this approach involves a major clinical trial supported jointly by NCCAM and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute examining the efficacy of using EDTA-based chelation therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease and prevent heart attacks. The trial, which involved 1,700 patients, showed a modest reduction in cardiovascular events for adults aged 50 and older who had suffered a prior heart attack. However, the results from a secondary analysis of the trial data suggest that the chelation treatments produced a marked reduction in cardio-vascular events and death in patients with diabetes but not in those without diabe-tes. Addressing cardiovascular disease in diabetics is an important public health challenge, and better treatment options are required. As this study was not de-signed to discover how or why chelation might benefit patients with diabetes, fur-ther investigation is needed. Thus, NCCAM is exploring the possibility of a follow- up study in collaboration with several other NIH Institutes. REDUCING PAIN AND IMPROVING SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT According to the Institute of Medicine, pain is a major public health problem af- fecting more than 100 million Americans and costing the Nation over $600 billion 36 in medical costs and lost productivity. Pain is also the most common reason Ameri- cans turn to complementary and integrative health practices, as conventional medi-cine often provides incomplete relief. Therefore, pain research is a top priority for NCCAM. As such, we continue to invest in research on several promising ap-proaches for treating pain, such as spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, meditation, and acupuncture. We are particularly interested in understanding how these inter-ventions work, for what type of pain condition, and for determining the optimal method of practice and delivery. Toward this end, NCCAM partners with others in supporting research initiatives, participates in the NIH Pain Consortium, and leads an NIH Task Force to improve standards for research on chronic low back pain (cLBP). The cLBP Task Force has developed common standards, measures, and other tools for clinical research on cLBP, and a report is expected to be published in The Journal of Pain later this year. Another important collaborative effort is our partnership with the National Insti- tute on Drug Abuse and the Department of Veterans Affairs to foster research on complementary and integrative approaches to managing pain and other symptoms experienced by military personnel and veterans. A number of grant applications were submitted in response to our joint solicitation, and we anticipate funding mul-tiple studies later this fall. One area of particular interest is the means by which complementary health prac- tices affect the perception of pain by the brain. Specifically, we seek to understand the mechanisms by which emotions, attention, and context modulate pain. Using neuroimaging and cutting-edge technologies, our intramural research program (IRP) is exploring the central mechanisms of pain and its modulation, with the long-term goal of improving clinical management of chronic pain through the integration of pharmacological and non-pharmacological complementary health approaches. NCCAM's IRP engages and leverages the exceptional basic and clinical neuroscience efforts across NIH. ADVANCING RESEARCH ON NATURAL PRODUCTS Another important area of emphasis for NCCAM is research on natural products. In addition to exploring the underlying biological effects and mechanisms of natural products, such as dietary supplements, herbs, botanicals, and probiotics, we are con-cerned about their safety. While there is widespread use of these products by the public, there is limited scientific evidence about their effectiveness and safety. In ad-dition to gaining greater understanding of whether natural products are effective or safe when used alone, there is a need to study how they interact with prescription medications. This is very important because many patients taking prescription medications also use natural products, such as dietary supplements, herbs and probiotics. To investigate these issues, NCCAM will launch an initiative to develop rigorous methods to evaluate potential interactions between natural products and medications. The ultimate goal is to ensure that consumers, healthcare providers, and health policymakers are better informed of the potential risks and/or benefits associated with the use of natural products in combination with medications. To propel needed innovations in technology and methodology for research on nat- ural products, NCCAM and the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements are supporting the establishment of a Center for Advancing Natural Products Technology and Inno-vation. The Center is expected to better support the needs of the natural products community while reducing resource redundancies. PROVIDING USEFUL INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC NCCAM provides objective, evidence-based information to scientists, healthcare providers, and the general public through a variety of approaches, including emerg-ing technology and platforms (i.e., video, social media, and mobile applications) and an information-rich Web site (www.nccam.nih.gov). Through these approaches, science-based information on the safety and efficacy of complementary and integra-tive health practices\u2014already in wide public use\u2014is made available to a broad audi-ence. CONCLUSION NCCAM continues to support research, collaborate with others, and leverage part- nerships to build the scientific evidence needed by consumers, healthcare profes-sionals, and health policymakers regarding the safety and value of complementary and integrative health practices. 37 1LMIC is a World Bank designation for the classification of economies, based on Gross Na- tional Income (GNI) per capita.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the Fogarty International Center (FIC) of the National In-stitutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 FIC budget of $67.776 million in-cludes an increase of $0.292 million more than the fiscal year 2014 enacted level of $67.484 million. The United States and the NIH have historically been at the forefront of major scientific discoveries that have improved health here at home and around the world. Building on these successes, ambitious health targets for the future now seem pos-sible\u2014such as a decrease in the overall mortality rate of children under the age of 5, to 20 deaths per 1,000 over the next two decades and an AIDS-free generation. Reductions in morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases have also begun to affect populations worldwide. At this critical juncture, the Fogarty Inter-national Center mission and investments will continue to accelerate the pace and progress of research, engage the best and brightest minds by building capacity at research institutions across the globe, and develop the evidence needed to confront health challenges wherever they occur. By continuing to invest in training out-standing early-career investigators and developing future global health research leaders, Fogarty will advance the goals and sustain the leadership of the NIH and the U.S. Government in biomedical research, while improving the health of Ameri-cans and populations worldwide. TODAY 'S BASIC SCIENCE FOR TOMORROW 'S BREAKTHROUGHS Non-communicable diseases and disorders (NCDs) are rapidly becoming the domi- nant causes of poor health in all low and middle-income country (LMIC) regions1 except sub-Saharan Africa, where they are second only to HIV/AIDS. For example, World Health Organization data suggest that one billion people worldwide suffer from some type of mental, neurological or substance abuse disorder. In collaboration with eight NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs), Fogarty's Brain Dis- orders in the Developing World: Research Across the Lifespan program supports cutting-edge basic science research in LMICs on the nervous system. This research could lead to important new diagnostics, prevention and treatment strategies, and interventions of direct relevance to both LMIC and U.S. populations. For example, Argentinian scientists, in collaboration with Northwestern University, are studying neuroprotective gene therapy in a preclinical trial. This team demonstrated that a unique vector gene delivery system using two powerful neuroprotective molecules could be effectively injected over time restoring neuronal function. Future studies will use magnetic nanoparticles to perform targeted gene therapy with the goal of treating neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's, the second-most common neurological disease in the United States, affecting approximately 1 million Ameri-cans (National Parkinson Foundation). NURTURING TALENT AND INNOVATION Fogarty programs have supported long-term research training for more than 4,500 scientists worldwide, in collaboration with more than 230 U.S. and LMIC research institutions. These investments provide unique training opportunities for early-ca-reer global health researchers, enabling them to effectively collaborate with foreign partners in diverse, low-resource international settings to confront global health challenges. Fogarty supports these hands-on, clinical research training experiences in LMICs in close partnership with a number of NIH ICs, providing experiences that encourage U.S. investigators to creatively approach problems under constraints that may not exist in high-income settings. Scientists trained with Fogarty support have conducted research on cardiovascular disease in Kenya, surgical capacity in Rwanda, mental health impacts of slum-dwelling in India, and the link between breast cancer and osteoporosis in China. Solving many of today's complex public health problems requires the engagement of investigators from a wide variety of fields. Fogarty's Framework Programs for Global Health Innovation awards support efforts to bring biomedical scientists to-gether with students from various disciplines\u2014 such as engineering, nutrition, busi-ness, law, environmental science, social sciences, agriculture and public health\u2014to develop research training initiatives that encourage innovative, health-related prod-ucts, processes and policies. This program supports: scientists at Michigan State 38 University studying interactions between agriculture, water resource utilization and malaria in Malawi; grantees at Northwestern University, Chicago, and the Univer-sity of Cape Town, South Africa training researchers in developing healthcare tech-nologies in Nigeria; and scientists at Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, and Christian Medical College, Vellore, India developing a training program in translational research related to non-communicable and infectious diseases. These international teams are identifying critical health needs and conducting the re-search needed to develop and test novel solutions. THE PATH FORWARD : ADDRESSING DUAL BURDENS OF DISEASE AND HARNESSING THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION FOR GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH For over 25 years, Fogarty has contributed to the U.S. Government fight against HIV, training and supporting some of the world's foremost vaccine and biomedical researchers. As the global burden of disease shifts to a greater level of NCDs, Fogarty programs will continue critical work in HIV research training while also re-sponding to both the NCD epidemic through research and training programs and the nexus between the HIV and NCD epidemics, represented by NCD co-morbidities of HIV infection and treatment. As scientific priorities evolve to match the changing burden of disease, Fogarty research and research training programs will train the best and brightest researchers around the world and facilitate scientific collabora-tion that meets new priorities while building on existing capacity and infrastruc-ture. The information and communication technology (ICT) revolution presents excep- tional opportunities and new tools for global health research and research edu-cation. ICT is a broad term that encompasses communication devices, applications, and services, such as cell phones, computers, radios, videoconferencing and distance learning. Fogarty will expand its support of innovation in the use of ICT to generate knowledge, scientific exchange, and research education in the hope of stimulating the capacity to develop and evaluate different models of distance learning and other ICT strategies, as well as adapt various ICT platforms for the needs of research and research educational communities. This will enable professionals in LMIC institu-tions to determine what works best for their particular settings as they develop novel education tools. Students and faculty will access, teach, and share information in creative and transformative ways, enabling new approaches to collaborative learning and problem solving in partnership with colleagues next door and across continents. The enormous potential for mobile technology to impact healthcare and research has led to the rapid development of new health-related phone applications. Rigorous evaluation of health outcomes after implementation of these interventions are often lacking. New emphases are being pursued to develop mobile technologies tailored to LMIC settings, assess their impact on health and determine how they can be ef-fectively scaled up in diverse, low-resource settings. Significantly, this evidence base is not only critical for LMIC populations, but can also be applied to healthcare in the U.S. These are indeed exciting times for global health with new opportunities for part- nership within and outside the NIH, the introduction of transformative technologies and mutual scientific priorities based on a shared burden of disease across high-in-come and LMIC. Capitalizing on these developments demands a multidisciplinary research workforce that can function across cultures and borders to solve common health problems. Fogarty will continue to invest in training the next generation of leaders in global health research at home and abroad to ensure that the U.S. will continue to play a key role in confronting the global health challenges of today. PREPARED STATEMENT OF PATRICIA A. G RADY , PH.D., RN, FAAN Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's fiscal year 2015 budget request for the National Institute of Nursing Re-search (NINR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 NINR budget is $140,452,000 which is $128,000 more than the comparable fiscal year 2014 appropriation of $140,324,000. I appreciate the opportunity to share with you a brief summary of some of the exciting areas of research and future scientific directions of NINR. The mission of NINR is to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and commu-nities. We fulfill this mission by supporting clinical and basic research to build the scientific foundation for clinical practice, prevent disease and disability, manage and eliminate symptoms caused by illness, enhance end-of-life and palliative care, and 39 train the next generation of nurse scientists. Today, I offer an overview of NINR's efforts and accomplishments in five key scientific areas and provide examples of how the research we support improves quality of life, health, and wellness across the lifespan. SYMPTOM SCIENCE : PROMOTING PERSONALIZED HEALTH STRATEGIES NINR is committed to finding new and better ways to treat the symptoms of chronic and acute illnesses which can cause significant suffering for individuals and families. While we still have much to learn about the unique ways people experience symptoms and respond to treatments, recent advances in genomics are providing new opportunities to develop improved, personalized strategies to address adverse symptoms of illness, such as pain, fatigue, and disordered sleep. By providing a bet-ter understanding of the basic underlying biological and genetic mechanisms of symptoms, NINR-supported researchers are making important contributions to im-proving health and quality of life. For example, one NINR-supported project found that, for pregnant women with depression, poor sleep was associated with higher levels of inflammatory chemicals in the body known as cytokines, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. Other NINR-supported scientists identi-fied pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers that predict how patients experience pain at different stages of breast cancer treatment, drawing a new link between pain and inflammation. Discoveries such as these pave the way for the development of personalized and effective treatments for adverse symptoms of illness. SELF -MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), chronic illness accounts for more than 75 percent of healthcare costs in the U.S., and often requires long-term management of illness among individuals, families, and healthcare providers. Learn-ing how to manage chronic illness presents challenges to individuals of any age as well as their family members, from children remembering to bring their asthma medication with them to school to older adults maintaining daily activities as they face multiple chronic conditions, such as arthritis and heart disease. To address such challenges, NINR supports research that enables individuals with chronic ill-ness and their caregivers to take an active role in understanding and managing their condition, and improving their quality of life. One current NINR-led initiative aims to equip families with effective strategies for improving self-management of chronic illness in children and adolescents, enabling them to follow treatment regi-mens and make healthy lifestyle choices while still allowing ''kids to be kids.'' An-other initiative emphasizes family-centered self-management that integrates family members as partners in care while promoting self-management for individuals of any age; this initiative has the potential to strengthen the ability of family members to work together to make treatment decisions, manage symptoms, and navigate the healthcare system. Through efforts like these, NINR's investment in self-manage-ment research contributes to helping people live active and healthy lives in the face of chronic illness. WELLNESS : PROMOTING HEALTH AND PREVENTING ILLNESS Another area of emphasis at NINR is on wellness research, which seeks to under- stand the physical, social, behavioral, and environmental causes of illness, identify healthy lifestyle behaviors, and develop interventions to promote health and prevent illness across the lifespan and in diverse communities. One study supported by NINR is refining and examining the effectiveness of a home-based sensor system for older adults, which monitors pulse, breathing, and restlessness while sleeping, and alerts healthcare providers to potential illness so that they can intervene early. Such warning systems may allow older adults to stay active and remain in their homes longer. In another project, researchers developed a teacher-delivered healthy lifestyles intervention that improved health behaviors and academic outcomes in high school adolescents. NINR also maintains its commitment to promoting wellness in vulnerable groups who are disproportionately affected by chronic illness. We cur-rently lead an initiative to reduce health disparities in minority and underserved children through the development of culturally-appropriate, multifaceted interven-tions. ENHANCING END -OF-LIFE AND PALLIATIVE CARE Addressing the needs of patients with life-limiting illness through high-quality, ef- fective end-of-life and palliative care continues to be a critical focus of NINR. As the lead NIH Institute for end-of-life research, NINR supports research to ease symp-40 toms and support patients and their caregivers in coping with advanced illness, while also addressing the challenges of planning for end-of-life decisions. As an ex-ample, NINR-supported scientists recently found that pain continues to be under-diagnosed and undertreated for hospitalized patients at the end of life, suggesting that more work is needed to better understand the needs of individuals facing life- threatening illnesses. Recognizing that palliative care is a critical component of maintaining quality of life at any age and at any stage of illness, not just at the end of life, NINR supports initiatives to enhance palliative care. Given that a diag-nosis of serious illness in a child is particularly difficult for families, NINR launched the Palliative Care: Conversations Matter TMcampaign to raise awareness of pedi- atric palliative care and to provide evidence-based materials to help healthcare pro-viders initiate often difficult conversations with pediatric patients and their fami-lies. NINR also continues to support a palliative care research cooperative to en-hance the evidence base for palliative care interventions. A new NINR initiative to promote use of and long-term sustainability of the cooperative will encourage re-searchers across the country to capitalize on the existing resources and expertise and streamline the research process. LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE : NURSE SCIENTISTS A primary goal of NINR is to prepare the next generation of nurse scientists to address health challenges and to contribute to an innovative, multidisciplinary, and diverse scientific workforce. NINR funds training and career development grants and programs to prepare nurse scientists to conduct research to build the scientific foundation for clinical practice. NINR's Summer Genetics Institute is an intensive training program on molecular genetics designed to improve research and clinical practice among graduate students and faculty. This year, our week-long Methodolo-gies Boot Camp focuses on using Big Data in symptom research, and provides a re-search intensive program for participants to learn new state-of-the-art methodolo-gies from nationally and internationally known scientists. By training nurse sci-entists to use new, innovative scientific methodologies, NINR advances nursing science to improve health. In closing, thank you for the opportunity to share with the Committee some of the ways the science we support impacts the health of the Nation. In fiscal year 2015, NINR will continue our mission to improve quality of life by advancing nurs-ing science and by supporting research to inform high-quality and effective clinical care. PREPARED STATEMENT OF ERICGREEN , M.D., P H.D Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2015 President's budget request for the National Human Genome Research In-stitute (NHGRI). The fiscal year 2015 budget of $498,451,000 reflects an increase of $1,323,000 above the enacted fiscal year 2014 level of $497,128,000. The research funded and conducted by NHGRI in fiscal year 2015 will continue to unlock the secrets of life's DNA code. We still have much to discover with regard to how the three billion DNA bases of the human genome influence our physical and biochemical characteristics\u2014and, in turn, our health. While we continue to reveal all the information encoded by DNA, we have started pursuing clinical applications of genomic knowledge and implementing genomic medicine. Understanding how the structure and function of the human genome relates to health and disease will be essential for the implementation of genomic medicine. Among the knowledge to be gained is how the ~20,000 genes in the human genome are turned on and off at the appropriate times and in the appropriate places; this is largely the role of regulatory elements within the genome that act like ''dimmer switches'' controlling lights. Through the Institute's Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project, a more detailed inventory of these regulatory elements is emerg-ing. In fiscal year 2015, the Genomics of Gene Regulation (GGR) initiative will begin to investigate the choreography of these different elements in different cells and tis-sues. Many of the elements that ENCODE has identified and GGR will characterize play a role in human diseases and traits, underscoring the foundational value of these projects. More than 25 million Americans suffer from rare diseases, cumulatively more than those afflicted with cancer. While the genomic bases for just over 5,000 rare diseases have been established\u2014the majority of those established since the end of the Human Genome Project\u2014the causal genes for an estimated 2,000-4,000 addi-tional rare diseases remain to be identified. To investigate the latter, NHGRI's Cen-ters for Mendelian Genomics Program is harnessing to analyze patients' genomes on an unprecedented scale en route to estab- lishing the genomic underpinnings of these remaining rare disorders. The resulting discoveries offer the promise of ending the diagnostic odyssey of afflicted patients as well as insights about the diseases that may lead to new therapeutic approaches. In fiscal year 2015, NHGRI will also focus on more common, but more genomically complex, diseases\u2014those diseases that reflect great public health burdens. One such disease, cancer, is fundamentally a disease of the genome. Hence, NHGRI has been collaborating with the National Cancer Institute in developing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) since 2006, studying the genomes of different types of tumors and cat-aloging the discovered genomic aberrations. In fiscal year 2015, TCGA will reach the milestone of analyzing 10,000 tumor samples, revealing many new insights about cancer. Similarly, NHGRI has partnered with the National Institute on Aging to pursue the largest genomics study of Alzheimer's disease to date. The Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is sequencing and analyzing the genomes of several hun-dred Alzheimer's patients to help identify the genomic factors contributing to this complex disease, which affects as many as 5 million Americans aged 65 and older. Investigators throughout the biomedical research enterprise\u2014well beyond the study of genetic diseases\u2014are now incorporating genomic analyses into their re-search. A major catalyst for this dissemination has been NHGRI's unparalleled Ad-vanced DNA Sequencing Technology Program, the successes of which have led to a phenomenal drop in the cost of DNA sequencing, 1enabling many more investigators to incorporate genomic analyses into their research. However, these researchers have a widespread and urgent need for improved analytical tools for analyzing DNA sequence data. To address this, NHGRI has created the Genome Sequencing Informatics Tools (GS-IT) program. Like the Institute's development of cutting-edge innovations in DNA sequencing, GS-IT is creating pioneering robust data-analysis tools for studying genomes. To become a reality, genomic medicine needs refined approaches for using genomic information to improve health outcomes. For instance, in fiscal year 2015, the Implementing Genomics Into Clinical Practice (IGNITE) Network will test methods for disseminating genomic medicine strategies more widely. IGNITE inves-tigators will be initially studying the use of genomic risk information for treating kidney disease, the utility of family health history, and the use of genomic informa-tion for selecting appropriate medications. In another effort, NHGRI is partnering with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to support the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) Program, which is examining the potential for genome sequencing to improve the care of newborns. Pilot programs such as IGNITE and NSIGHT, in addition to other large genomics projects, are only valuable if the generated knowledge diffuses through the medical establishment. To help healthcare professionals become competent with genomic in-formation in delivering patient care, NHGRI is working with the National Center for Biotechnology Information to develop the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), which will provide a curated knowledgebase of clinically relevant genomic variants. ClinGen will be freely available to clinicians, researchers, and professional organiza-tions developing clinical practice guidelines, helping to usher in larger-scale imple-mentation of genomic medicine. To capitalize on the genomics research funded by NHGRI and other NIH insti- tutes for medicine, the next generation of scientists and clinicians must be equipped with the skills to lead their fields during the 21st century. In fiscal year 2015, new institutional training programs and individual career awards in genomics research and in genomic medicine will develop leaders in those respective fields, including the provision of cross-training in associated disciplines such as bioethics and data science. Another of NHGRI's educational efforts targets the general public. The Institute collaborated with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural His-tory to create the exhibition Genome: Unlocking Life's Code. Privately funded, this widely acclaimed exhibition is expected to be visited by more than 3.5 million people before the end of fiscal year 2015. In addition, a series of nine public engagement programs are being produced; these events will remain accessible via the web to complement the exhibition as it travels North America over the next 5 years. As described above, NHGRI's genome sciences portfolio will continue to explain the role of the genome in human traits and disease, while its genomic medicine portfolio will apply that knowledge to improve human health. The Institute will en-42 2http://www.unitedformedicalresearch.com/advocacy lreports/the-impact-of-genomics-on-the-u- s-economy/ sure that information about genomic advances is disseminated to scientists and healthcare professionals as well as the general public, and that the technologies and generated knowledgebase will continue to be a growth engine for our economy. 2 PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALAN E. G UTTMACHER , M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2015 President's budget request for the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National In-stitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of $1,283,487,000. This reflects an increase of $2,657,000 over the fiscal year 2014 level of $1,280,830,000. Understanding human development, both normative and atypical, comprises the core of NICHD's mission. The Institute supports a broad range of research, con-ducted largely at academic institutions across the country, ranging from efforts to increase understanding of basic biological mechanisms to testing health interven- tions aimed at improving the lives of children, women, families, and those with dis-abilities. NICHD-supported research contributes to knowledge about our health, from the earliest stages through maturity. PREGNANCY AND BIRTH OUTCOMES Based on NICHD-supported research showing less than optimal health outcomes for infants born at 37 and 38 weeks of pregnancy (previously considered full-term), leading professional societies announced in the past year a new policy that preg-nancy would now be considered full-term only after 39 weeks. This change should lead to improved standards of care and better health outcomes for mothers and in-fants. While previous studies had found that alcohol and illegal drug use during preg- nancy frequently produce poorer infant health outcomes, a NICHD-funded network study has now provided evidence that smoking (including secondhand smoke), pre-scription painkillers, and illegal drugs used during pregnancy can double or triple the risk of stillbirth. These findings provide women and their clinicians important information about healthy behaviors in pregnancy. Through our Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program, NICHD has long provided the evidence base for determining whether a health condition can be detected in newborns, and whether it can be cured or treated. Currently, most states screen newborns for a panel of 29 conditions, thus preventing extensive dis-ease and disability. Now NICHD is partnering with the National Human Genome Research Institute on a major study to explore the possibilities for early diagnosis of a much larger number of disorders by sequencing newborns' genomes, while also exploring technical, clinical, and ethical questions raised by this new technology. Re-searchers also plan to develop a tool to help parents understand sequencing results, placing special emphasis on the needs of families from diverse cultures and their clinicians. PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT For many conditions, the earlier they are identified and treatment begun, the bet- ter the outcome. One of the goals of the NICHD-led National Children's Study is to amass an unprecedented amount of information about children's health, develop-ment, and environment to understand and improve health. Recently, researchers supported by NICHD have developed an updated screening tool, administered to parents, to help determine if a child between 18 months and 2 years old has autism, much earlier than the current average age of diagnosis of 4 years. Previous research has shown that earlier interventions can help improve developmental outcomes for children with autism. This tool is now widely available online, in 45 different lan-guages. Since variations in nutrition and environment so heavily influence children's growth and development, NICHD engages in international studies to increase knowledge about optimal health in childhood. In some nutrient-deficient areas, chil-dren receive iron supplements to enhance development and prevent anemia; yet, re-cently, public health officials have become concerned that these supplements may increase children's risk for malaria. To test this theory, NICHD-supported research-ers conducted a randomized clinical trial combining iron supplementation with pre-vention efforts (such as sleeping nets) in a malaria-prone area of Ghana, finding that the incidence of malaria was no higher for children who received the supple-43 ments than for those who did not, and assuring that beneficial iron supplementation could continue. Understanding human development in adolescence, with that period's substantial physical, mental, and behavioral changes, poses a particular challenge for research-ers. While there is increased emphasis on encouraging young people to be physically active to reduce overweight and increase health, engaging in some physical activi-ties may pose risks. Concerns have been raised about the potential long-term effects of repeated concussions in children, especially young athletes. Recently, NICHD partnered with other NIH ICs and the National Football League on eight research projects to help understand the effects of head injuries and improve the diagnosis of concussions. Although awareness is increasing that young people who may have had a concussion should not immediately return to play, these studies will help us understand the brain's healing process and what is required to prevent permanent damage to this vital organ, leading to such advances as more precise return to play policies. Parents of teenagers will not be surprised that adolescents often engage in risk- taking behaviors. They may, however, be surprised that informed parental super-vision can have an impact on adolescent behaviors and even on potential injury or death. An intramural NICHD study on teen driving behaviors collected data from a nationally representative sample of 10th graders, finding that adolescents who re-ported being exposed to riding with an intoxicated driver in the 10th grade were considerably more likely to report driving while intoxicated in the 12th grade. The study indicates the importance of parents' not only monitoring their own children's driving behaviors, but also that of other young drivers with whom their children may be riding. WOMEN 'S HEALTH One result of NICHD's 2012 ''Scientific Visioning'' process, which took a fresh look at what the Institute might accomplish across its broad mission over the next dec-ade, was the establishment of the new extramural Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch. Researchers supported by the branch recently shed light on the relative success and safety of two surgical treatments for pelvic organ prolapse (a form of pelvic hernia). Previous research supported by NICHD suggested about 3 percent of U.S. women experience prolapse in a given year, most commonly older women and those who have given birth several times. The study found no statistically sig-nificant difference between the two types of surgery, providing critical information for surgeons and the 300,000 U.S. women who have this surgery each year. INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS NICHD has long supported research on the causes and effects of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and on identifying effective therapies for these condi-tions. By working closely with leading researchers, clinicians, self-advocates, and families, Institute scientists identify the scientific resources most critical to ongoing progress on these conditions. In September 2013, NICHD, with the support of the NIH Down Syndrome Working Group and the Down Syndrome Consortium, launched DS-Connect TM: The Down Syndrome Registry. DS-ConnectTM, which al- ready includes over 1,500 registrants, is a web-based, voluntary, secure health reg-istry serving the Down syndrome community, providing anonymized information to families and clinicians, and facilitating connections between researchers and poten-tial clinical research participants. In addition, the Down syndrome community re-cently provided extensive input on a revised NIH Research Plan on Down Syn-drome, which will be available mid-2014. Another pressing need for scientists conducting research on cognition and brain disorders is the availability of sufficient brain tissue specimens. While NIH histori-cally has funded investigator-initiated, disease-specific brain banks, it is now taking a new approach to providing these scarce research resources by supporting a tissue- sharing collaboration among five brain banks. This new ''NeuroBioBank'' will in-crease availability of biospecimens and establish a standardized resource for the re-search community. EMBRACING RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES Increasingly, biomedical and biobehavioral researchers need to work in transdisciplinary teams, manage massive amounts of data, and acquire new and di-verse skill sets. For example, the medical rehabilitation needs of those with physical disabilities require a wide range of research, from improving our understanding of neurological repair to developing new generations of prostheses and assistive de-vices. In 2012, a Blue Ribbon Panel made a series of recommendations to NICHD 44 to bolster rehabilitation research at NICHD's National Center for Medical Rehabili- tation Research (NCMRR) and across NIH. NICHD is implementing an innovative new operating model for NCMRR that is intended to greatly increase coordination of rehabilitation research among the many ICs that support it. NICHD is excited to launch the Human Placenta Project, a coordinated inter- national initiative to understand in real time the structure and function of the human placenta, arguably the least understood human organ. The placenta is not only critical for both maternal and fetal health, but also has substantial implications for conditions that arise later in life in both the mother and child, such as cardio-vascular disease. The Project's goals include understanding placental development in normal and abnormal pregnancies, developing biomarkers to help predict adverse pregnancy outcomes, and developing interventions to prevent abnormal placental and fetal development. The currently projected span of the project is a decade, be-ginning with a workshop in May 2014 to develop a research plan. Thank you for the opportunity to submit some of NICHD's accomplishments over the last year and a few of its many exciting plans for the immediate future. PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD J. H ODES , M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's fiscal year 2015 budget request for the National Institute on Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 budget includes $1,170,880,000, which is $1,453,000 more than the comparable fiscal year 2014 level of $1,169,427,000. More than 40 million people age 65 and older live in the United States, and data from the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics indicate that their numbers will double by 2040. In less than 50 years, the number of ''oldest old''\u2014 people ages 85 and older\u2014may quadruple. As record numbers of Americans reach retirement age and beyond, profound changes will occur in our economic, healthcare, and social systems. The NIA leads the national effort to understand aging and to develop interven- tions that will help older adults enjoy robust health and independence, and continue to make positive contributions to their families and communities. We support ge-netic, biological, clinical, behavioral, and social research related to the aging process, healthy aging, and diseases and conditions that often increase with age. We also support training of the next generation of researchers. UNDERSTANDING AGING AT ITS MOST BASIC LEVEL NIA-supported studies in the emerging field of geroscience, which explores the basic mechanisms underlying age-related changes, including those which could lead to increased disease susceptibility, will provide needed insight into ways to address aging-related diseases and disorders. The NIA-led NIH GeroScience Interest Group (GSIG) involves active participation by 20 NIH Institutes and is leading the effort to accelerate and coordinate efforts to promote further discoveries on the common risks and mechanisms behind age-related diseases and conditions. In October 2013, the GSIG and private-sector partners convened a national Summit, ''Advances in Geroscience: Impact on Healthspan and Chronic Disease,'' which drew more than 500 expert participants from around the world. We expect its outcomes to further energize this field. An increasingly important research area is the identification of genes and gene variants related to aging and age-related disease. Such research will be accelerated by the addition of data on more than 78,000 older individuals from one of the Na-tion's largest and most diverse genomics projects, Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging, to the NIH database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP). These data will be widely available to qualified investigators. IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL -BEING OF OLDER AMERICANS NIH-supported investigators are testing a variety of interventions for health con- ditions common to old age. Ongoing studies include: the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial, designed to determine whether the benefits of aspirin outweigh the risks in people over 70; testosterone supplementation to delay or pre-vent frailty in older men; exercise for mood, health, and cognition; and an array of interventions for menopausal symptoms. NIA also supports research aimed at development of interventions that will en- able older adults to remain independent for as long as possible. For example, re-searchers used data from nine large NIA-funded studies to develop diagnostic cri-45 teria for low muscle mass and weakness. These conditions lead to disability in older people, but are rarely recognized as clinical problems by healthcare providers. This work is a milestone toward the development of new diagnostic and treatment strate-gies for this common and disabling condition. In addition, the recent NIA-supported finding that training to improve cognitive abilities in healthy older people lasts to some degree for 10 years after the training program was completed provides an im-portant piece of evidence that cognitive health can be improved and maintained into older age. Serious injuries from falls, such as broken bones or traumatic brain injury, are a major reason for the loss of independence among older people. In 2013, NIA and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Initiative (PCORI) solicited applications for funding to conduct a randomized clinical trial of a multifactorial strategy for pre-venting serious fall-related injuries among non-institutionalized older people. The trial will begin in 2014. NIA is also a leader in the trans-NIH Science of Behavior Change initiative. We are hoping that the long-term outcome of this initiative will be to enhance the effi-cacy of interventions to help individuals make and maintain positive changes in their health behaviors. As an example, one NIA-managed study in this initiative has shed light on how stress can reduce or eliminate the ability of individuals to benefit from training designed to help them regulate their emotions and better control their behavior, suggesting possible changes to our behavioral intervention strategies. Because investigators often, for a variety of reasons, have difficulty recruiting older people into clinical research studies, NIA is collaborating with the Administra-tion for Community Living, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and community-based health and social service providers, researchers, and private organizations on the Recruiting Older Adults into Research (ROAR) project. BUILDING MOMENTUM AGAINST ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE NIA is the lead Federal agency supporting research on Alzheimer's disease (AD), which despite our best efforts continues to be a serious public health issue that di-rectly affects as many as 5 million Americans. In fiscal year 2014, NIA received ap-proximately $100 million in additional appropriated funds. We plan to use these ad-ditional funds to support Alzheimer's research in areas of strategic priority, funding additional awards to applications received from Funding Opportunity Announce-ments issued in fiscal year 2013-fiscal year 2014. We will continue to be guided by the strategic goals outlined in the National Action Plan on Alzheimer's Disease and the results from the 2012 Alzheimer's Disease Summit. A second Summit is planned for February 2015 to update milestones and stimulate further research. Recent findings have expanded our understanding of AD and provided insights into prevention and treatment of the disease. For example, NIA-funded researchers recently identified a molecule called REST, which is lost in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and whose deletion in mice leads to neurodegeneration. REST represents a novel potential target for intervention into the disease. Inves-tigators have also found that conjugated equine estrogens, the most common type of postmenopausal hormone therapy in the United States, has no long-term risk or benefit to cognitive function in younger postmenopausal women, aged 50-55. The earlier Women's Health Initiative Memory Study linked the same type of hormone therapy to cognitive decline and dementia in older postmenopausal women, but this finding suggests that women taking certain estrogen-based hormone therapies in their early postmenopausal years may not be at increased risk for eventual cognitive decline. EMPOWERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF RESEARCHERS IN AGING As the number of older Americans continues to grow, we must not only increase the number of practicing physicians trained in geriatrics and relevant subspecialties but also foster the development of the next generation of physician-scientists whose clinical research will lead to improved care and more effective treatment options for older patients with complex medical conditions. Two ongoing programs\u2014Grants for Early Medical/Surgical Subspecialists' Transition to Aging Research (GEMSSTAR), supporting physicians who seek to become clinician-scientists in geriatric aspects of their subspecialty, and Medical Students Training in Aging Research (MSTAR), tar-geting first-year medical students in order to stimulate early interest in an aging research career\u2014remain highly successful. Building on new technologies that enable us to reach a wide audience efficiently and inexpensively, we have initiated a series of Technical Assistance webinars to provide participants, particularly those with an interest in health disparities research, with guidance on navigating the NIA grants application process. Finally, the Butler-Williams Scholars Program (formerly the 46 NIA Summer Institute) remains a vibrant and vital institution at NIA, drawing a record number of applications for the 2014 session. PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN I. K ATZ, M.D., P H.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 NIAMS budget of $520.189 million includes an increase of $0.851 million over the comparable fiscal year 2014 level of $519.338 million. The NIAMS supports a broad range of research, training, and information dis- semination activities. Many of the conditions within the NIAMS mission are very common while some are rare, affecting only a few thousand people world-wide. All have a major impact on the quality of people's lives. Diseases addressed by NIAMS affect individuals of all ages and of all racial and ethnic backgrounds; many dis-proportionately affect women and minorities. Over the years, NIAMS-funded re-search teams have made significant progress in uncovering the causes of and im-proving the treatments for many disorders of the bones, muscles, joints, and skin. While many treatments for arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin conditions have their origins in NIH-supported basic research, the timeframes for translating fundamental knowledge into therapies remain unacceptably long, and too many po-tential therapies fail late in development. To improve the drug development process, NIAMS has partnered with industry, non-profit groups, and other government agen-cies for the NIH Accelerating Medicines Partnership program in lupus and rheu-matoid arthritis (RA). Through the program, a network of investigators will use ad-vanced tools and techniques to analyze blood and tissue samples from patients. The overall goals are to gain insights into lupus and RA biology, improve the selection of biological targets for drug development, and ultimately produce new therapies. The advent of technologies for collecting and analyzing large amounts of data cor- responds with an increasing appreciation of the interactions that occur among dif-ferent tissues and organ systems, and with the microorganisms inside our body or on our skin. When researchers compared the gut microbes of people who had newly diagnosed, untreated RA with those found in the digestive tracts of healthy people, patients with RA who were receiving treatment, and psoriatic arthritis patients, they found that the bacterium Prevotella copri (P. copri) was more abundant in pa-tients with new-onset RA than in the other groups. If additional studies determine that altered levels of P. copri contribute to RA, therapies that target the bacterium could help to prevent the disease or delay its onset. Similarly, another group of re-searchers recently demonstrated that Staphylococcus aureus colonies on the skin of people who have atopic dermatitis, or eczema, release a toxin that causes skin in-flammation. This finding provides an impetus for further studies into whether block-ing the toxin could help people who are susceptible to atopic dermatitis. Other research is uncovering complex connections between the immune system and skeletal health, and the role of hormones produced by bone on the development and function of the nervous system. Recent findings have linked the misfolding of a protein that helps immune cells recognize and destroy invading bacteria or viruses to the bone erosion that characterizes spondyloarthritis of the spine. Other research has revealed that the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin is capable of interacting with neurons in the brain and influencing brain structure and behavior, at least in mice. Many people think of broken bones as a normal part of an active, healthy child- hood. Although any bone will break if enough force is applied to it, researchers are learning that the bones of some children and teens have structural deficits that can be readily identified based on what the patient was doing when the bone was bro-ken. Children who broke an arm because of moderate impact, as would occur when falling off a bicycle, had bones that resembled their uninjured peers; but, those whose forearm bones broke upon mild impact (e.g., a fall during a minor playground scuffle) showed signs of compromised bone strength and bone quality. While we do not know the extent to which bone weakness during childhood predisposes people to osteoporosis and fragility fractures later in life, this study is the first to suggest that a simple screening question could identify the young people who might benefit most from dietary changes and activities to improve bone health. NIAMS also is involved in efforts to identify laboratory-based or imaging biomark- ers that will guide treatment development or will improve patient care. Activities include the Foundation for the NIH (FNIH) Biomarkers Consortium project to evaluate biochemical and imaging biomarkers for more precise ways of measuring osteoarthritis progression during clinical trials; this project builds on resources cre-47 ated by the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a public-private partnership spearheaded by NIAMS and the National Institute on Aging with support from other NIH compo-nents, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the FNIH, and private sponsors. A separate research team, focused on molecular changes associated with scleroderma, recently reported that blood levels of a protein appeared to distinguish between pa-tients who were likely to develop life-threatening lung complications that require ag-gressive treatments and those whose disease would not warrant risky therapies. In-vestigators are confirming their observations as a next step before the findings are applied clinically. Additional research into disease-associated genetic defects and molecular path- ways is pointing to new uses for drugs that have been approved for other conditions. Work by investigators studying a group of muscle diseases called the disferlinopathies\u2014which includes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B\u2014suggests that calcium channel blocking drugs might reduce some of the tissue damage that accumulates as the diseases progress. Another example comes from a team that identified 42 areas in the human genome that are associated with RA; many of the gene products are already targeted by existing drugs. These potential drug repurposing opportunities will be explored more thoroughly before clinical trials can begin in patients. Once results from clinical studies are available, many healthcare providers insist that findings be validated before changing how they practice medicine. The ability to verify conclusions is equally important at the basic and preclinical levels of re-search, particularly when results become the basis for clinical trials. In fiscal year 2015, NIAMS plans to refocus the Pilot and Feasibility Clinical Research Grants in Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases program\u2014a grant mechanism to foster early-stage clinical trials on which larger, more robust studies will be based\u2014 to emphasize the need for a strong scientific premise on which a proposed project is based. NIAMS is committed to ensuring that well-trained basic scientists and clinical re- searchers are prepared to conduct cutting-edge studies related to rheumatic, mus-culoskeletal, and skin diseases. The Institute awards a combination of institutional training grants and individual fellowships for this purpose. NIAMS has expanded its participation in NIH training programs for fiscal year 2015 to include the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards for Individual Predoctoral MD/ PhD and Other Dual Doctoral Degree Fellows (F30) program. The Institute also has begun meeting with clinical or patient-oriented research career development award-ees\u2014both early in their award and as they are about to transition to independent careers\u2014to identify challenges that they face and ways to better support them and future awardees. As part of a commitment to communicating about NIAMS programs and research results, NIAMS has enhanced its outreach to patients, healthcare and research pro-fessionals, and the general public via social media and other activities. Building on a successful 2013 effort to ensure that the results of NIH research investments and health messages reach all Americans, NIAMS again partnered with other compo-nents of the Department of Health and Human Services and with patient advocacy groups to create a new set of health planners, titled A Year of Health, A Guide to a Healthy 2014 for You and Your Family. In the past 2 years, NIAMS received re-quests for these health planners from all 50 states and five U.S. territories, dem-onstrating a robust need for credible, research-based health information in African American, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian, Asian American/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Latino communities. Looking to the future, we are updating the Institute's Long-Range Plan. As with the fiscal year 2010-2014 plan, the new document will inform the Institute's priority setting process while enabling the NIAMS to adapt to the rapidly changing bio-medical and behavioral science landscapes. When complete, the plan will outline the Institute's perspective on research needs and opportunities within the NIAMS mis-sion, and will serve as a resource for all who are interested in our activities. PREPARED STATEMENT OF GEORGE KOOB, PH.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: As the new Director of the Na- tional Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I am pleased to present the President's budget request for the In-stitute. The fiscal year 2015 NIAAA budget request of $446,017,000 reflects an in-crease of $606,000 over the comparable fiscal year 2014 enacted level of $445,411,000. 48 SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM Excessive alcohol use has profound effects on individuals, families and commu- nities; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that ex-cessive alcohol consumption cost the U.S. $224 billion in 2006. In 2012, nearly one quarter of the U.S. population aged 21 and older and over 15 percent of young peo-ple ages 12-20 reported binge drinking (i.e. consuming five or more drinks on a sin-gle occasion) at least once in the past month, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Binge drinking has serious acute and long term consequences\u2014both for youth and adults. NIAAA estimates that 18 million Americans have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) and NIAAA research has established an important connection between early alcohol use and the develop-ment and severity of AUD. Of those who meet the criteria for an AUD, only about 15 percent ever seek treatment. NIAAA RESEARCH To reduce the considerable burden of illness and the societal costs associated with alcohol misuse, NIAAA is working to advance evidence-based prevention and treat-ment for alcohol problems for individuals at all stages of life, including those with co-occurring disorders. NIAAA's research portfolio is broad, ranging from studies on the underlying biological mechanisms that drive excessive drinking and the develop-ment of medications for AUD targeting these mechanisms, to studies on policies and interventions designed to reduce harm both to drinkers and those around them. NIAAA's portfolio also includes both research on the health benefits associated with moderate drinking and on the consequences of alcohol misuse, including fetal alco-hol spectrum disorders (FASD), alcohol effects on the developing adolescent brain, and alcohol effects on tissue and organ damage. NIAAA's cutting edge work in the neuroscience of alcohol effects on the brain pro- vides not only a firm foundation for development of novel treatments for AUD but also a framework for prevention. The NIAAA portfolio focuses on the neurocircuitry changes that promote the development of AUD as well as those that convey resil-ience. Particularly critical are the studies of the adolescent brain and how excessive alcohol intake can delay, or permanently compromise normal development of the brain's executive and self-regulatory functions. A key goal of NIAAA is to work with other NIH Institutes and Centers and Fed- eral agencies to enhance integration of research on the abuse of alcohol and other substances. Notably, NIAAA co-leads the Collaborative Research on Addictions at NIH (CRAN) with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI); co-chairs the Alcohol Policy and Underage Drinking Sub-committee of the HHS Behavioral Health Coordinating Council with the CDC; and collaborates with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NIDA, Depart-ment of Defense (DOD) and the Veterans Administration (VA) on the implementa-tion of the National Research Action Plan for Improving Access to Mental Health Services for Veterans, Service Members, and Military Families. Recognizing that medications currently available to treat AUD can be highly effec- tive but do not work for everyone, NIAAA continues to make significant progress towards developing additional evidence based pharmacotherapies. NIAAA's Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG), established to rapidly test candidate compounds (within 12-18 months), is streamlining the medications development process for AUD. NCIG recently completed a multisite clinical trial that showed the anti-smok-ing medication varenicline (Chantix \u00ae) significantly reduced alcohol consumption and craving in both smokers and non-smokers with AUD. Going forward, NCIG will test both repurposed and novel compounds often working in collaboration with ex-tramural scientists and the pharmaceutical industry. NIAAA also supports prom-ising pharmacotherapy research outside of NCIG. In an independent study, the widely prescribed anti-seizure medication gabapentin, used to treat pain and used off-label for migraines, reduced heavy drinking and other related symptoms in alco-hol dependent patients. A study to replicate the gabapentin finding within NCIG is anticipated. It is important to note that currently available medications are very ef-fective for many, and that NIAAA is working to make clinicians and the public aware of the range of available treatment options for AUD, as well as promoting research into more effective implementation of treatment. Given that AUD often co-occurs with other substance use and/or mental health disorders, major priorities of the Institute are to understand the complex relation-ships between and develop effective treatments for alcohol misuse and co-occurring disorders. For example, AUD frequently co-occurs with post-traumatic stress dis-order (PTSD), thereby complicating treatment for both conditions. PTSD is preva-lent among military personnel and veterans, and also among individuals who have 49 experienced sexual assault\u2014a far too common occurrence on college campuses, and one often associated with excessive drinking by both perpetrators and victims. PTSD increases risk for AUD; conversely, chronic alcohol use may increase the risk for PTSD by altering the brain's ability to recover from a traumatic experience. Using an animal model of PTSD, NIAAA intramural researchers discovered that chronic alcohol exposure altered neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex region of the brain, making the animals slower to suppress a conditioned fear response. Differences in the ability to handle fear responses could help explain differences in vulnerability to PTSD among humans, and lead to new therapeutic approaches and diagnostic risk biomarkers. NIAAA also supports other promising studies on co-occurring PTSD and AUD. The consequences of binge drinking for all ages range from acute, e.g. injuries and blackouts, to long term, e.g. severe AUD and organ damage. Recent results of NIAAA-supported research have revealed that binge drinking may be harmful in more ways than previously thought. For example, in results published this year, a single episode of binge drinking (which in the study raised the blood alcohol con-centration to 0.08 g/dL, the legal limit for driving while intoxicated, within 60 min-utes) increased leakage of bacterial endotoxins from the gut into the bloodstream and elicited an immune response, demonstrating that binge drinking produces acute damage in the body, even in healthy people. Notably, women had higher blood alco-hol levels and circulating endotoxin levels than men. Often viewed as a rite of pas-sage, binge drinking is pervasive among our Nations' youth with 1.7 million young people ages 12-20 engaging in this behavior five or more times per month according to SAMHSA. NIAAA's current studies on the effects of alcohol on the developing brain will inform a more extensive study under CRAN to assess the effects of drugs and alcohol, alone and in combination, on the adolescent brain. College and Univer-sity Presidents are especially concerned about the rampant heavy use of alcohol among their students resulting in an estimated 1,825 deaths, 696,000 assaults, and 97,000 sexual assaults annually. NIAAA will soon release a decision tool to help col-lege administrators select effective evidence-based interventions appropriate for their campuses. NIAAA also promotes screening and brief intervention (SBI) for youth, and launched an online course with Medscape to provide continuing medical education for healthcare professionals to help them conduct fast, evidence-based al-cohol SBI with youth. To date, over 14,000 healthcare providers have been Medscape certified. Preventing, diagnosing, and treating alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is also a major priority. NIAAA funds four research consortia to pursue new clinical approaches to treat alcoholic hepatitis, a severe form of ALD. NIAAA will also continue to pursue biomarkers of liver injury to facilitate earlier diagnosis. NIAAA has significantly advanced our understanding of the health and social im- pacts of alcohol use and misuse. NIAAA will continue to pursue opportunities lead-ing to better outcomes for alcohol-related problems, and support a diverse bio-medical research workforce that is equipped to tackle these public health challenges. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DONALD A.B. L INDBERG , M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 budget of $372,851,000 includes an increase of $5,628,000 over the comparable fiscal year 2014 level of $367,223,000. The National Library of Medicine, the world's largest biomedical library, builds and provides electronic information resources used billions of times each year by millions of scientists, health professionals and members of the public. Many health information searches that are initiated on the Internet actually retrieve information from an NLM Web site. NLM is crucial in the dissemination of biomedical research results\u2014DNA sequences, clinical trials data, toxicology and environmental health data, research publications, and consumer health information to scientists, health professionals, and the public. A leader in biomedical informatics and information technology, NLM also supports and conducts research, development, and training in biomedical informatics, data science, and health information technology; and coordi-nates the 6,100-member National Network of Libraries of Medicine that promotes and provides access to health information in communities across the United States. NLM's programs and services directly support NIH's key initiatives in basic re- search, precision medicine, research training, as well as in data science and Big Data. NLM's National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a focal point for ''Big Data'' in biomedicine and a leader in organizing and providing rapid access to massive amounts of genetic sequence data generated from evolving high-through-50 put sequencing technologies. NCBI serves more than 30 terabytes of biomedical data to more than 3.3 million users daily. Some of the largest datasets, such as those from NIH's 1000 Genomes Project, are also available in the Amazon cloud. This al-lows faster access and analysis by researchers who may be otherwise hampered by insufficient bandwidth or computing power. Additionally, the Library organizes and provides access to the published medical literature; assembles data about small mol-ecules to support research and therapeutic discovery; provides the world's largest clinical trials registry and results database; and is the definitive source of published evidence for healthcare decisions. NLM's PubMed Central (PMC) provides essential infrastructure for the NIH Public Access Policy, making published NIH-funded re-search freely and permanently available to the public. NLM/NCBI databases are cited in laws and Congressional legislation (e.g., Public Law 110-161,Consolidated Appropriations Act and HR 4186, the Frontiers in Innovation, Research, Science, and Technology) as a model for facilitating public access to federally funded data and publications. Research supported or conducted by NLM underpins today's electronic health record systems. The Library has been the principal funder of university-based informatics research training for 40 years, supporting the development of today's leaders in informatics research and health information technology. NLM's databases and its partnership with the Nation's health sciences libraries deliver research re-sults wherever they can fuel discovery and support health decisionmaking. BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATION SERVICES NLM's PubMed/MEDLINE database is the world's gateway to research results published in the biomedical literature. It links to full-text articles in PubMed Cen-tral, including those deposited under the NIH Public Access Policy, and on pub-lishers' Web sites, as well as connecting to vast collections of scientific data. PubMed contains more than 23 million references to articles in the biomedical and life sciences journals providing high quality information to about 2.3 million users per day. NLM is a primary source for results of patient-centered outcomes research, pro-viding access to evidence on best practices to improve patient safety and healthcare quality. NLM is also a hub for the international exchange and use of data utilized in molecular biology, genomics, and clinical and translational research. Many NCBI databases, including dbGaP, the Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), and ClinVar are fundamental to the identification of important associations between genes and dis-ease, and to the translation of new knowledge into better diagnoses and treatments. NLM's Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications operates ClinicalTrials.gov, the world's most comprehensive clinical trials database. It con-tains registration data for more than 160,000 clinical studies with sites in 185 coun-tries and summary results for more than 11,000 trials, including many results that are not available elsewhere. STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS For 40 years, NLM has supported seminal research on electronic patient records, clinical decision support, and health information exchange, including concepts and methods now reflected in electronic health record (EHR) products and personal health record tools. EHRs with advanced decision-support capabilities and connec-tions to relevant health information are essential to improving healthcare and help-ing Americans manage their own health. As the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) coordinating body for clinical terminology standards, NLM works closely with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Tech-nology and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to facilitate adoption and ''meaningful use'' of EHRs. NLM supports, develops, and distributes key termi- nology standards now required for U.S. health information exchange. To help EHR developers implement standard terminologies, NLM produces related software tools, frequently used subsets, and mappings to administrative code sets, and provides the authoritative versions of terminology value sets for required clinical quality meas-ures. NLM's MedlinePlus Connect also supports meaningful use by providing a way for EHR products to link patients to high quality health information relevant to a specific health conditions, medications, and tests, directly from their EHRs. HEALTH INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC The NLM has a wide range of outreach programs to enhance awareness of NLM's diverse information services among biomedical researchers, health professionals, li-brarians, patients, and the public. To improve access to high quality health informa-tion, NLM works with the 6,100 institutions of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, a network of academic health sciences libraries, hospital libraries, pub-51 lic libraries, and community-based organizations and has formal partnerships with tribal colleges and other minority serving institutions. In fiscal year 2013, dozens of community-based projects were funded across the country to enhance awareness and access to health information, including in disaster and emergency situations, and to address health literacy issues. The Library's MedlinePlus Web site provides integrated access to high quality consumer health information produced by all NIH components and HHS agencies, other Federal departments, and authoritative private organizations. It serves as a gateway to specialized NLM information sources for consumers, such as the Genetic Home Reference and the Household Products Database. Available in English and Spanish, with selected information in 40 other languages, MedlinePlus averages well over 750,000 visits per day. Mobile MedlinePlus, also in both English and Spanish, reaches the large and rapidly growing mobile Internet audience. The NIH MedlinePlus print and online magazine, in English and Spanish, is an outreach effort made possible with support from many parts of NIH and the Friends of the NLM. Distributed free to the public via physician offices, community health centers, libraries and other locations, the print magazine reaches a readership of up to 5 million nationwide and the online version reaches millions more. Each issue focuses on the latest research results, clinical trials and guidelines from the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers. The Library diversifies access to all its information resources, through mobile de- vices and ''apps.'' NLM continues to be a leading player in social media amongst HHS agencies with active Facebook, Twitter, and You Tube accounts, including the very popular @medlineplus Twitter feed and a Spanish-language counterpart, sev-eral online newsletters, and its National Network of Libraries of Medicine, which covers the United States and hosts eight Facebook pages, 10 Twitter feeds and 12 blogs. NLM is consistently ranked among the most liked, most followed, and most mentioned organizations amongst small government agencies with social media ac-counts. In conclusion, the Library is a trustworthy source of health information for the public and vital to the practice of 21st century medicine and the progress of science. NLM's information services and research programs serve the Nation and the world by supporting scientific discovery, clinical research, education, healthcare delivery, public health response, and the empowerment of people to improve personal health. The Library is committed to the innovative use of computing and communications to enhance public access to the results of biomedical research. PREPARED STATEMENT OF JONR. L ORSCH , PH.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget for the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 budget of $2,368,877,000 includes an increase of $6,983,000 above the comparable fiscal year 2014 level of $2,361,894,000. NIGMS considers its public funds a precious resource and focuses on efficiency and effectiveness in making investments in research and training. The Institute spends 97 percent of its budget outside of the NIH, funding biomedical re-search and training at universities and other institutions across the country\u2014where creative minds are at work every day producing new knowledge about health and disease. Scientific discovery is the engine for advances in medicine, as research results lead to new treatments and refine current standards of care. Biomedical research relies on attracting and retaining a creative and well-trained workforce. NIGMS re-mains committed to enabling researchers throughout the United States to answer important scientific questions in fields such as cell biology, biophysics, genetics, de-velopmental biology, pharmacology, physiology, biological chemistry, biomedical technology, bioinformatics, computational biology, selected aspects of the behavioral sciences and specific cross-cutting clinical areas that affect multiple organ systems. To assure the vitality and continued productivity of the research enterprise, NIGMS also provides leadership in training the next generation of scientists as well as in developing and increasing the diversity of the scientific workforce. BACK TO BASICS The high value of investigator-initiated research has stood the test of time. This approach, in which scientists decide what questions are important to study, ulti-mately leads to major advances in medicine and technology. Examples include: \u2014Studies of virus-resistant bacteria led to the discovery of restriction enzymes, which act like highly specific scissors for cutting DNA. This discovery launched 52 the multi-billion-dollar biotechnology industry, starting with the laboratory- based production of life-saving medicines like insulin and now extending even beyond biomedicine into agriculture and biofuels. \u2014Seemingly esoteric studies of how electric fields affect DNA replication in bac- teria lead directly to the discovery of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin, which has saved thousands of human lives. \u2014Studies of enzymes that copy DNA and RNA and that cut proteins enabled the development of drugs to treat HIV infection. To ensure a continued pipeline of fundamental scientific advances that will lead to future medical and technological breakthroughs, NIGMS is rebalancing its port-folio to renew and reinvigorate its support for question-driven, investigator-initiated research. This rebalancing has received strong support from stakeholder organiza-tions, including the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, an umbrella group representing 26 scientific societies and over 115, 000 researchers. PLANNING CAREFULLY FOR THE FUTURE NIGMS has begun a new strategic planning process that is focusing on enhancing the efficacy, efficiency, and adaptability of the Institute's internal processes and the mechanisms through which we support biomedical research. In particular, we are exploring the development of new grant mechanisms that would increase stability and flexibility for researchers and maximize the scientific return on taxpayers' in-vestment. These mechanisms will focus on the efficient use of funds, encouraging scientists to undertake ambitious and creative projects that may be the break-throughs of tomorrow. NIGMS is also developing new strategies to strengthen and maintain the pipeline of talented, creative, diverse and highly skilled young investigators. This segment of the biomedical workforce is essential for the future of scientific research in the United States, which is in turn essential for the future health and economic com-petitiveness of our Nation. Specific strategies we are considering to address the challenges facing young investigators include outcomes-based enhancements of our training programs and efforts to improve the competitiveness of young investigators in obtaining and keeping research grants. SUPPORTING A DIVERSITY OF IDEAS NIGMS is proud to be the home of the IDeA program, which ensures that cutting- edge research is conducted in every region of the country. This strategy is critical to the strength of our biomedical research enterprise, as it meets the need to involve the most diverse set of minds, experiences and approaches for solving difficult health-related problems. Last year, NIGMS funded or co-funded 58 competing grants to IDeA researchers, this included 25 competing Centers of Biomedical Re-search Excellence awards. Particularly exciting research developments funded by the IDeA program include the demonstration by Kentucky researchers that elec-trical stimulation of the spinal cord can restore some motor function in individuals with paraplegia; a study by scientists in South Carolina showing that nanoparticles coated with antioxidant proteins can protect against stroke-related damage; and a neonatal telemedicine center in Arkansas that has contributed to a significant de-crease in statewide infant mortality. As requested by both the House and Senate and required by the Consolidated Ap- propriations Act of 2014, NIH has submitted a response to the National Academies' Report on EPSCoR and related programs. As part of the NIGMS strategic planning process, we are developing plans for enhancing access to resources for moving dis-coveries and innovative ideas from laboratories in IDeA states into commercial prod-ucts. In particular, we are exploring support for regional biotechnology incubators that would give faculty in IDeA states access to laboratory space, equipment, exper-tise, and advice required to make their work competitive for SBIR/STTR and ven-ture capital funding. ADVANCING HEALTH THROUGH DISCOVERY This past year, NIGMS-funded scientists broke new ground in a range of areas relevant to health, including chemistry, microbe-host interactions, computer mod-eling, and metabolism. Selected examples include: \u2014A Tennessee researcher developed a chemical method to shave the cost of manu- facturing expensive drugs, including those used to treat HIV/AIDS. The method is also environmentally friendly in that it employs natural molecules called en-zymes instead of synthetic chemicals that are often hazardous. \u2014A scientist from Vermont created the first-ever interaction map of human pro- teins that attach to proteins from arenavirus and hantavirus, providing poten-53 tial new targets for therapies to treat the often deadly illnesses caused by these classes of viruses. \u2014A Pennsylvania researcher found compounds that block a recently discovered pathway for preventing production of damaged proteins. These chemicals have antibiotic activity, suggesting they might eventually be developed into a new class of antibacterial drugs. \u2014A scientist from California learned from mouse studies that a high-fat diet in- fluences the internal body clock controlling liver metabolism. The team also dis-covered that the effect was reversible by returning to a balanced, low-fat diet. These discoveries are a small subset of the productivity of the nearly 4,000 sci- entists NIGMS supports throughout the United States. Our public investment to fuel their curiosity-driven exploration of biomedicine is growing knowledge, and local economies, as well as improving the health of all Americans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be pleased to answer any questions that the Committee may have. PREPARED STATEMENT OF YVONNE T. M ADDOX , PH.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 budget of $267,953,000 is the same as the fiscal year 2014 enacted level of $267,953,000. INTRODUCTION As the primary Federal agency for leading, coordinating and facilitating research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities, NIMHD impacts the lives of millions of Americans burdened by disparities in health status and healthcare delivery, including racial and ethnic minority groups as well as rural and low-income populations. A population is a health disparity population if it is deter-mined that there is a significant disparity in the overall rate of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, or survival rates in the population as compared to the health status of the general population. The elimination of health disparities re-quires a multidisciplinary approach, with collaboration, coordination, and integra-tion across NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs), other Federal agencies and private- sector organizations to fully understand and solve the underlying biological and non- biological causes of health disparities. FUNDAMENTALS OF HEALTH DISPARITIES In order to understand the social, behavioral, biological, and environmental fac- tors influencing health disparities, NIMHD is studying the fundamental causes of diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect individuals from health dis-parity backgrounds. For example, one project studies the higher incidence and mor-tality of breast cancer in African American women through research that examines the role genetic differences in the tumor suppressor protein, p53, plays in the dis-parity. Researchers hypothesize that some racial/ethnic groups have dispropor-tionate p53 variants that may contribute to breast cancer health disparities in the age of onset, incidence, and lack of pregnancy protection in African American women. Another study takes knowledge about causal pathways learned at the bench and extends the findings to social, behavioral, health services and/or policy ap-proaches to test ways to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities. This project examined unconscious stereotyping of Hispanic patients among medical and nursing students. The study found that students endorsed stereotypes that His-panic patients would be non-compliant or likely to engage in high-risk health behav-iors, even if the students reported trying consciously to avoid biased thinking. This unconscious bias of medical providers can be one factor in the disparity in healthcare delivery faced by minority patients. COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH FRAMEWORK Comprehensively addressing health disparities requires a transdisciplinary frame- work that fosters an integrated approach involving biology, behavioral and social sciences, environmental science, public health, healthcare delivery, economics, public policy, and many other disciplines. It also requires strong collaborations between re-searchers and community organizations, service providers and systems, government agencies, and other stakeholders to ensure that contextually appropriate and rel-evant research is conducted, and that findings can translate into sustainable indi-vidual, community, and systems level changes that improve the health of the U.S. 54 population. The NIMHD supports two programs that focus on transdisciplinary and translational research: the Centers of Excellence (COE) and the Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers for Health Disparities Research (TCC). The COEs, which were established as partnerships between academic institutions and community organiza-tions, have been in place for over a decade and have reached more than 102 sites, across 31 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The COEs are addressing health disparities research along the translational spec-trum from basic science to clinical research, with information dissemination a re-quired component. The TCC Program, established in fiscal year 2012, supports research, implemen- tation, and dissemination of activities that transcend customary discipline-specific approaches conducted at the local level. Transdisciplinary research collaboration at the regional level provides opportunities for academic institutions, community-based organizations, and other partners to conduct targeted research to respond to specific population-based, environmental, sociocultural, and political factors that influence health within a particular region. The Collaborative Research Center for American Indian Health is bringing to- gether tribal communities and health researchers from a variety of disciplines to work together to address the significant health disparities experienced by American Indians in South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota, particularly the social de-terminants of health and its application to programming public health interven-tions. The National Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for African American Men's Health is addressing unintentional and violence-related injuries as well as chronic diseases that affect African American men across the life course, as part of a national initiative. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Active community involvement in biomedical and behavioral research is essential to improving the health of the public. The NIMHD Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Initiative supports the development, implementation, and evalua-tion of intervention research that utilizes the principles of community engagement as partners in the full spectrum of research. A number of CBPR planning phase and dissemination phase projects are under way. The Partnerships to Improve Lifestyle Interventions and Partners in Care programs tested the effectiveness of a culturally adapted diabetes self-management intervention among Native Hawaiians and Pa-cific Islanders. The study found improvements in weight loss, physical capacity, and diabetes self-management. Another CBPR project focused on a culturally appropriate, church-based Hepatitis B screening and vaccination intervention program for Korean Americans which found increased screening and immunization rates in the intervention group com-pared with the control group. Academic-community partnerships were essential in balancing science and community needs in the design and conduct of the needs as-sessment, pilot and full-scale clinical trial. RESEARCH TRAINING AND INFRASTRUCTURE In order to advance the science and speed translation of discoveries into better health outcomes for all Americans, it is critical to expand and diversify the Nation's workforce of well-trained scientists who are dedicated to improving minority health and eliminating health disparities. A diverse biomedical workforce will improve the quality of the educational and training environment, balance and broaden the per-spective in setting research priorities, improve the ability to recruit subjects from diverse backgrounds into clinical research protocols, and improve the Nation's ca-pacity to address and eliminate health disparities. NIMHD-supported programs to train researchers to conduct minority health and health disparities research are fo-cusing on providing educational, mentoring, and/or career development programs for individuals from health disparity populations that are underrepresented in the bio-medical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. NIMHD continues to support re-search training and infrastructure through its Research Endowment Program, Building Research Infrastructure and Capacity Program, and Research Centers in Minority Institutions Program. CONCLUSION NIMHD has a unique and critical role at the NIH as the focal point for conducting and coordinating research on minority health and health disparities, raising na-tional awareness about the prevalence and impact of health disparities, and the dis-semination of effective individual, community, and population-level interventions to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities. NIMHD is looking forward to 55 identifying new opportunities to accelerate the pace of research and to advance its mission through strengthening partnerships and enhancing its role in the commu-nity. PREPARED STATEMENT OF RODERIC I. P ETTIGREW , PH.D., M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bio-engineering (NIBIB) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 NIBIB budget request of $328,532,000 is $2,173,000 more than the fiscal year 2014 enacted level of $326,359,000. NIBIB is dedicated to improving human health through the integration of the physical and biological sciences. NIBIB's mission spans the entire health spectrum and is not limited to a single disease, group of illnesses, or population. Working with doctors from every field of medicine and bringing together teams of scientists and engineers from many different backgrounds, NIBIB aims to develop innovative ap-proaches to healthcare. Our research focus is to improve the understanding, detec-tion, treatment and ultimately, the prevention of disease. INNOVATION IN TREATING SPINAL CORD INJURY : NEW HOPE FOR THOSE WITH PARALYSIS Building on a long history of research on restoring function in spinal cord injury, researchers have discovered a fundamentally new intervention that led to voluntary movement in individuals with complete paralysis. This outcome, initially seen in a single individual, has now been reported in three successive patients, all of whom had been paralyzed for more than 2 years. This achievement is a significant mile-stone in spinal cord injury research. In the approach, electrical stimulation is ap-plied to the surface of the spinal cord through a surgically implanted device that is normally used for the suppression of back pain. After just a week of stimulation, on average, the patients were able to voluntarily move their legs and flex their feet and toes when the stimulator was turned on. With continued daily stimulation and extensive physical training, the patients saw improvements in their movements and could initiate them with decreased stimulation. With their stimulators turned on, the patients are now able to stand for about an hour. Restored function was accom-panied by increased muscle mass. In addition, these individuals have regained blad-der and bowel function and experienced improvements in autonomic responses such as sweating and return of sexual function in some cases. IMMUNOENGINEERING TO MODIFISCAL YEAR IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSES The immune system is the body's defense against an array of infectious agents. However, the immune system can also trigger many diseases such as diabetes, rheu-matoid arthritis, lupus or multiple sclerosis; this occurs when immune cells are di-rected against an individual's own cells and is referred to as autoimmunity. As our understanding of the immune system increases, we are approaching a point where the immune response can be engineered to enhance or reduce specific responses. Two recent examples highlight this ''immunoengineering'' approach. In the first case, the problem being addressed is improving targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumors. Nanoparticles can be used to ferry chemotherapy directly to tumors, minimizing exposure of these toxic medications to healthy tissues in the body. Researchers have found a way to ferry nanoparticles carrying chemo-therapy drugs past cells of the immune system, which would normally engulf the particles, preventing them from reaching their target. The technique takes advan-tage of the fact that all cells in the human body display a protein on their mem-branes that functions as a specific ''passport'' in instructing immune cells not to at-tack them. By attaching a small piece of this protein to nanoparticles, scientists were able to get immune cells in mice to recognize the particles as ''self'' rather than foreign particles, and thereby not attack them. The nanoparticles also have other labels that can concentrate the drugs in the tumors, so higher doses of chemo-therapy are delivered to the tumor. In a second example, researchers have developed a strategy to modulate the im- mune system to halt the progress of a disease model of multiple sclerosis in mice. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the myelin sheaths that surround nerve cells. To stop this attack, engineered nanoparticles are coated with myelin antigens, and these nanoparticles are presented to another set of cells in the im-mune system that re-identifies myelin as 'self' rather than 'foreign'. The result is that the immune system stops attacking myelin as a foreign body, and the disease progression is halted. This approach begins to take advantage of the complex control 56 of immune response which contains multiple positive and negative feedback loops in order to selectively turn off one specific inflammatory response. It holds promise for treating multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases that previously have escaped effective therapies. CANCER DETECTION FROM A ROUTINE BLOOD SAMPLE Most cancers spread by way of the circulatory system. As a result, there are can- cer cells present in blood samples. The number of cells, however, is so low that they have been difficult or impossible to find. The problem is to find and isolate the few cancer cells from the billions of other cells that are present in the blood. Researchers over the past several years have developed new techniques to find these cells, but those techniques have generally been destructive to the cancer cells. Now, with a new sorting technology, researchers have demonstrated the ability to sort the cancer cells and, of equal importance, to collect them for further analysis. After collection, the circulating tumor cells can be subjected to the full array of analysis techniques available to normal tissue biopsies of a tumor. This technology also permits sorting, using a variety of markers that allow, for example, the identification of triple nega-tive breast cancer cells. Successful isolation has been demonstrated in several other cancers including lung, prostate, pancreas, breast, and melanoma. This new tool has the potential to improve both the early diagnosis and effective treatment of cancer. AN IMPLANTABLE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY HOLDS PROMISE FOR PATIENTS ON DIALYSIS Expenditures in the United States for end stage renal disease exceed $40 billion annually. Treatment of end stage renal disease includes renal transplant and thrice- weekly, in-center hemodialysis. Renal transplant is limited to a small fraction of po-tential recipients by a shortage of donor organs. As a result, more than 400,000 Americans are on dialysis, which is expensive, inconvenient, and over time associ-ated with significant morbidity and mortality. Researchers are developing an implantable bioartificial kidney called the Implantable Renal Assist Device (iRAD), in which a patient's blood will be filtered through an artificial kidney consisting of silicon nanopore membranes and a bioreactor of cells to mimic the functions of a healthy kidney. Such a device could offer numerous advantages for patients includ-ing: freedom of mobility, decreased infection risk due to a permanent vascular con-nection, and continuous treatment, which avoids the build-up of toxins that occurs between in-center hemodialysis visits. In addition, incorporation of the patient's own cells could provide normal renal metabolic function that would be more physiologic than dialysis and not require anti-rejection drugs used for transplant. This com-bined filtration and metabolic treatment has been shown to work using a room-sized external model. Multi-day animal model testing to demonstrate hemofilter biocompatiblity has been conducted. Although human studies have not been initi-ated with the iRAD, these researchers are working with the Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) on an initiative that facilitates new ways for FDA staff and innovators to jointly bring breakthrough medical device technologies to patients faster and more efficiently. SMART HOMES FOR HEALTHY INDEPENDENT LIVING AT ALL AGES The population is aging and, increasingly, medical treatment involves the man- agement of chronic and/or degenerative diseases. Management of such conditions re-quires monitoring and early intervention to prevent more severe complications. The rapid development and ever expanding capabilities of smart phones, advanced sen-sors, point-of-care diagnostics, and integrated Internet connectivity provides a framework on which new healthcare models can be developed to provide this moni-toring and intervention. Investigators are testing real-time home observation of high-risk patients for early signs of illness, using a built-in camera, computer tablet and a smart phone for simultaneous monitoring of daily activities by family mem-bers and health professionals. This includes analysis of daily habits, mobility pat-terns, and gait rate and rhythm as indicators of change in health status. Developing automated technologies to help identify early indicators of changes in health status will extend the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes. PREPARED STATEMENT OF GRIFFIN P. R ODGERS , M.D., M.A.C.P. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's fiscal year 2015 budget request for the National Institute of Diabetes and Di-gestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 57 The fiscal year 2015 budget includes $1,743,336,000, which is $1,462,000 above the comparable fiscal year 2014 appropriation of $1,741,874,000. Complementing these funds is an additional $150,000,000 authorized in fiscal year 2015 from the Special Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research. NIDDK supports re-search on a wide range of common, chronic, costly, and consequential diseases and health problems that affect millions of Americans. These include diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases; blood diseases; obesity; and nutrition disorders. TODAY 'S BASIC SCIENCE FOR TOMORROW 'S BREAKTHROUGHS NIDDK-supported basic research is achieving remarkable progress and building the foundation for previously unimaginable strategies to improve health and quality of life. For example, recent research has better defined human brown adipose (fat) tissue in the neck, and has further elucidated the role of a family of proteins as mo-lecular signals regulating brown fat physiology\u2014findings that could help inform new approaches for altering metabolism to clinical advantage. The microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract are important factors in maintaining or tipping the balance between health and disease. A recent study of young twin pairs in Malawi revealed that gut microbes may play an important role in causing severe malnutri-tion in children that persists in spite of nutritional interventions. Gaining new in-sight into gastric bypass surgery, scientists studying a mouse model found that re-structuring of the digestive tract leads to weight loss and metabolic benefits in part by altering the communities of bacteria that normally live in the intestines. Another study has shown that deletion of the protein olfactomedin-4 in white blood cells im-proves their ability to eradicate infections with the harmful bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in an animal model of the immune disorder chronic granulomatous disease. Scientists supported by our Institute have used a series of genetically engineered mice to identify the contribution of different kidney cell subtypes to the process of fibrosis that follows kidney injury, confirming myofibroblasts' contribution to fibrosis and tracking their developmental origins\u2014results that could inform future treat-ment strategies. Scientists have discovered a link between two proteins known to contribute to the most common form of polycystic kidney disease and a cell-surface structure in a subset of kidney cells in mice. NIDDK-supported researchers con-ducted a study in mice showing that chemotherapy damages nerves that regulate bone marrow niches responsible for making new blood cells; future research in hu-mans could explore ways to reduce nerve damage and improve blood cell regenera-tion after chemotherapy. A new study has shown that it may one day be possible to treat people with cystic fibrosis (CF) using a combination of medicines that work cooperatively to stabilize an aberrant form of CFTR, the protein that is defective in CF. NIDDK will continue support for basic research across the Institute's mission, to gain further insights into health and disease and propel new ideas for interventions. Areas of emerging opportunity include research on generating or repairing nephrons that can function within the kidney; diet-host microbiome interactions in auto-immune and metabolic diseases; and a collaborative research network on disease modeling and tissue repair and regeneration. CLINICAL SCIENCE AND PRECISION MEDICINE Through innovative design and rigorous testing of interventions\u2014whether in the operating room, doctor's office, or home or community settings\u2014NIDDK-supported researchers are improving lives with new approaches to prevent, treat, and reverse diseases and disorders. For example, researchers studying type 1 diabetes have used smartphone technology to move a step closer toward developing an artificial, bionic, pancreas. Scientists reported data on insulin resistance and secretion that suggest early and rapid deterioration of pancreatic beta cell function in youth with type 2 diabetes, underscoring the need to intervene early and aggressively. Researchers have found that patients with irritable bowel syndrome show an improvement in symptoms following a short course of group therapy involving psychological and edu-cational approaches. Recent research has shown that in dialysis patients with diabe-tes, measuring another set of modified blood proteins may better predict the risk of death and cardiovascular disease than the current standard test to assess blood glucose control. The NIDDK supports research aimed at tailoring treatments for disease to the in- dividual characteristics of each patient. For example, a detailed genetic study has now identified rare mutations of the SLC30A8 gene that sharply reduce risk for type 2 diabetes in several different racial/ethnic populations, suggesting that inhibi-tors of the Slc30A8 protein may one day be therapeutically valuable. New research 58 has greatly expanded knowledge of the specific genetic mutations capable of causing CF, leading to much more comprehensive CF genetic testing. A recently discovered set of mutations in the DGKE gene may be behind some cases of the serious blood disorder hemolytic uremic syndrome. Scientists participating in NIDDK's Childhood Liver Disease Research and Education Network have utilized patient samples and an animal model to identify a genetic deletion in the GPC1 gene that may play a role in the development of biliary atresia. NIDDK researchers have created and con-firmed the accuracy of a mathematical model that predicts how weight and body fat in children respond to adjustment in diet and physical activity. NURTURING TALENT AND INNOVATION NIDDK will continue programs to train and support researchers at all stages of their careers, and to ensure that we benefit from the best scientific minds. One major objective of the Network of Minority Health Research Investigators is to en-courage and facilitate participation of members of underrepresented population groups and others interested in minority health in the conduct of biomedical re-search. In addition, several NIDDK-sponsored programs provide opportunities for minority students to obtain research experience. The NIDDK's Short-Term Edu- cation Program for Underrepresented Persons, or STEP-UP, provides research edu-cation grants to seven institutions to coordinate high school and undergraduate STEP-UP programs that enable students to gain summer research experience and training. INTEGRATING SCIENCE -BASED INFORMATION INTO PRACTICE NIDDK also will continue to support education, outreach, and awareness pro- grams. Research clearly shows that communications alone about the seriousness of diabetes will not reverse the diabetes epidemic. The NIDDK is committed to focus-ing more efforts to promote the theme of moving from awareness to action, by pro-viding behavior change tools and other resources to help people with diabetes and those at risk make and sustain lifestyle changes. For example, the NIDDK-CDC Na-tional Diabetes Education Program has developed the Diabetes HealthSense Web site, an online library of tools and resources developed by partners from around the country to address a wide array of psychosocial and lifestyle challenges. The NIDDK's National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) works to identify people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and promote the implementation of evi-dence-based interventions, focusing on populations at highest risk for CKD and the providers who serve them. In addition, through collaborative community partner-ships with organizations such as the Chi Eta Phi Nursing Sorority and the Amer-ican Diabetes Association, NKDEP brings NIH science-based information to the grassroots. In closing, NIDDK's future research investments will be guided by five principles: maintain a vigorous investigator-initiated research portfolio; support pivotal clinical studies and trials; preserve a stable pool of new investigators; foster research train-ing and mentoring; and disseminate science-based knowledge through education and outreach programs. PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL A. S IEVING , M.D., P H.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 budget proposal is $675,168,000, which is $0.9 million more than the fiscal year 2014 enacted level of $674,249,000. As the director of the NEI, it is my privilege to report on the many research opportunities that exist to reduce the burden of eye disease. NEI AUDACIOUS GOAL INITIATIVE Vision research is often on the cutting edge of biomedical research, from the first successful gene therapy clinical trials that restored some visual function in patients with an inherited form of blindness, to clinical trials for macular degeneration using tissue derived from embryonic stem cells, to a retinal electrical prosthesis, approved this past year by the FDA, after years of development by Second Site, a small busi-ness that received research support from both NEI and the Department of Energy. NEI is now starting a new chapter in its ambitious research agenda. I have launched a new initiative\u2014The NEI Audacious Goal Initiative in Vision Research and Blindness Rehabilitation\u2014to identify a groundbreaking long-term research goal that will markedly improve prevention and treatment of common eye diseases. 59 We started this effort over a year ago by soliciting audacious ideas from scientists, stakeholders, patients, clinicians, and the public through a Challenge Competition. After a thorough scientific review of more than 500 submissions, we chose 10 win-ning entries, which were presented and intensively discussed at the NEI Audacious Goals Development Meeting last year. In May, I announced that the NEI Audacious Goal will be to Regenerate Neurons and Neural Connections in the Eye and Visual System. To kick start this initiative, we will soon release funding opportunities fo-cusing on different components of this goal. Implementation of work toward the goal will include oversight, guidance, and direction from non-governmental consultant experts. This goal will focus on two types of retinal neuronal cells that underpin many of the leading causes of visual impairment. One such target is photoreceptor cells, the specialized neurons in the retina that detect light and initiate the neural response. Blindness in some diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, is a direct result of photoreceptor cell death, whereas in other diseases such as diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration, damage elsewhere in the retina indirectly causes photoreceptor cells to die. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the second cell type targeted in this program. These neurons reside in the retina but send long projections (axons in the optic nerve) that connect to the brain. When RGCs degenerate and die in diseases such as glaucoma and multiple sclerosis, vision signals from the eye can't get to the brain. Two of the primary scientific challenges of this initiative include protecting newly regenerated cells from dying, and inducing them to form appropriate neural connections in the brain. Success in achieving this goal will not just revolutionize how we approach diseases in vision, but all of neuroscience. NEI is also a key contributor and participant in the President's BRAIN initiative, which seeks to decode the brain, just as the Human Genome Initiative decoded DNA. While NEI's Audacious Goal is independent from the BRAIN initiative, the eye is the gateway to the brain\u2014it is the most accessible part of the central nervous system. There is good opportunity for synergy between these exciting initiatives. NEW AREAS OF EMPHASIS In the process of identifying our Audacious Goal, we also identified two high-pri- ority, complementary areas of emphasis, for which we have released two funding op-portunities and are currently reviewing grant applications: Molecular Therapy for Eye Disease; and the Intersection of Aging and Biological Mechanisms of Eye Dis-ease. With recent advances in genomics, we now have a good understanding of genes and molecules that are altered in many diseases. The National Ophthalmic Disease Genotyping and Phenotyping Network (eyeGENE), is a critical resource created by NEI for identifying the mutated genes in patients with inherited eye disorders and giving researchers access to DNA samples (over 4,000 collected since 2006), clinical information, and patients looking to participate in research studies. But the current tools at our disposal to treat genetic diseases are limited. Building on our recent successes in gene therapy, the exciting potential of designing personalized therapies to correct mutant genes lies in the research ahead of us over the next decade. Many eye diseases are associated with aging: from cataracts and presbyopia, which are common in all adults as they age, to some of the leading vision impair-ment diseases, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma. Under-standing what aspects of the aging process contribute to eye disease has the poten-tial to delay the onset of vision loss or even avert the disease. NEI REGENERATIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM Also contributing to the Audacious Goal Initiative are researchers at NEI, work- ing with the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine to create retinal tissues from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for several basic and translational research ap-plications. iPS cells can be generated from any adult cell, and then converted into virtually any other type of cells. A major thrust of this program is to derive iPS cells from patients with retinal diseases. Then, the iPS cells are differentiated to form retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells or photoreceptors and studied to identify dis-ease-causing molecular pathways. Diseases of interest currently include AMD, Best disease, late-onset retinal degeneration, Stargardt's disease, and retinitis pigmentosa. This program is exploiting these techniques to develop high-throughput drug screens to identify potential therapeutic compounds for treating retinal degen-erative diseases. Another potentially powerful application of iPS cell technology is to generate iPS cells from normal tissue and then differentiate those cells into monolayer sheets of RPE for tissue transplants. NEI intramural investigators are engineering a bio-de-60 gradable scaffold in order to grow the RPE tissue and transfer it to patients with RPE-associated retinal degenerative diseases. In fiscal year 2015, the stem cell pro-gram will also use stem cell technologies to evaluate synaptic connections in 3-D retinas derived from iPS cells. As I reflect on the remarkable progress the vision community has made in these past few years, I can hardly anticipate the exciting opportunities that lay ahead. PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARTHA SOMERMAN D.D.S., P H.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 NIDCR budget of $397,131,000 includes an increase of $29,000 over the enacted fiscal year 2014 level of $397,102,000. In keeping with its mission to improve the Nation's oral health, the breadth of NIDCR's research touches the lives of nearly all Americans. Our research spans multiple disciplines, scientific approaches, and research directions, all focused on the goal of improving people's lives. Today, I will highlight selected areas of par-ticular promise in our efforts to understand the development of tissues of the face and head, conquer oral infectious diseases through better understanding of the body's own defenses, help people facing chronic orofacial pain conditions, and de-velop new approaches to improve oral cancer survival. DEVELOPMENT AND REGENERATION The human face is among the body's most distinctive structures. NIDCR is the leading supporter of research on the development of the human face and skull, col-lectively known as the craniofacial region. By defining the complex web of environ-mental and genetic instructions that drive craniofacial development, the hope is that scientists one day will learn to repair damaged or malformed facial structures such as cleft lip and palate by harnessing the body's ability to heal itself. Five years ago, NIDCR began assembling information on the genetic code that in- structs facial development with the launch of its FaceBase Consortium. Through this endeavor, scientists have assembled nearly 500 publicly available datasets in-volving the biological instructions for the middle region of the human face, which includes the nose, upper lip, and palate, or roof of the mouth. FaceBase begins a second phase this year, as it expands its focus to include studies on additional re-gions of the face. This new phase will add to our knowledge about the genetics that underlie craniosynostosis, a birth skull defect that may result in severe and perma-nent problems if not corrected. NIDCR is also translating knowledge about craniofacial development into tools to re-grow bone and cartilage damaged by disease or injury. Ongoing studies are using the power of stem cells to regenerate tissues, improve wound healing, and help con-trol inflammatory-associated diseases of the mouth. Related research uses specially designed stable small molecules modified from naturally occurring molecules called resolvins that control inflammation in a wide range of conditions to target oral in-flammatory diseases such as periodontitis. We envision a future where natural tool kits are used to regenerate and repair damaged teeth, diseased gums, and broken or defective bones by utilizing stem cells and adapting natural molecules and proc-esses. ORAL INFECTIONS , IMMUNITY AND THE MICROBIOME The NIH's human microbiome project has reinforced that no man is an island. Al- though human beings coexist with a plethora of microorganisms, microbial cells out-number human cells by 10 to 1, living on surfaces of our body in sticky layers of polymicrobial communities called biofilms. Under normal circumstances, these mi-crobial guests coexist with us and even contribute to sustaining human health. But, if conditions in some part of the body are altered, the balance is disrupted, and the disease-causing organisms that live on our gums and teeth can overwhelm our nat-ural immune defense systems causing oral infectious diseases such as tooth decay and periodontal diseases. NIDCR-supported scientists are beginning to assemble the precise molecular details of how select oral pathogens destabilize the immune sys-tem to cause oral diseases. For example, individuals with leukocyte adhesion defi-ciency (a rare genetic disorder affecting the body's immune system) suffer from fre-quent bacterial infections, including severe periodontitis. New research has dem-onstrated that blocking certain molecules that are part of the individual's own im-mune system can reverse this inflammation and resulting bone loss. 61 In combination with these discoveries, we have made great strides in under- standing how an individual's own microbiome affects his or her health and disease. NIDCR continues to invest in microbiome research, supporting a database of infor-mation on oral microbes that will one day allow dentists to visualize the microbes within a patient's oral biofilm in real time\u2014offering new tools to diagnose and treat oral disease. For example, a dentist might observe an overgrowth of a particular type of bacteria that uniquely predisposes a patient to tooth decay, and could treat that bacterial imbalance to prevent the individual from developing cavities. These emerging leads will not only guide future personalized dental treatment for millions of Americans; they will help scientists throughout biomedical research to inform bet-ter treatment approaches for other microbe-host diseases such as colitis. TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT DISORDERS Thousands of Americans this year will be diagnosed with a painful and debili- tating disorder of the jaw called temporomandibular joint and muscle disorder (TMD). Some of these individuals will recover after a single bout of TMD, while oth-ers will go on to develop chronic disease\u2014and their healthcare providers, currently, are unable to predict the likely outcome for any individual patient. NIDCR-sup-ported research is providing key insights that could identify people at risk for devel-oping TMD, and predict the likelihood of progression to chronic disease. In 2006, NIDCR launched the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study. The study's latest findings present the most in-depth picture to date of the factors that may contribute to a person's developing an initial bout of painful TMD. Among the many interesting findings is that there is almost no dif-ference in the rate at which men and women develop TMD for the first time. And yet, females are far more likely to progress to chronic TMD than males. Researchers will continue to examine potential causes of this difference, such as hormonal regu-latory factors, leading to more targeted strategies for detecting and managing TMD in the future. Although TMD specifically afflicts the jaw, OPPERA researchers found only about 15 percent of OPPERA participants diagnosed with chronic TMD have orofacial pain only. The other 85 percent have additional ailments, many of which are painful in nature, including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia headache, and low back pain. This finding demonstrates that first-onset and chronic TMD are complex dis-orders that must be understood within a biological, psychological, and social model of illness. NIDCR will continue to help lead the way for all those battling these chronic conditions to find relief through a more accurate diagnosis and more person-alized care. ORAL CANCER AND HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) When many people hear the acronym HPV, they think of its association with cer- vical cancer. But over the last decade, various types of this virus also have been shown to contribute to head and neck cancers. In fact, the incidence of HPV-related head and neck cancer has risen steadily over the last decade and if the pace con-tinues, it will soon surpass the incidence of cervical cancer. This trend is particu-larly alarming because no effective diagnostic test currently exists to detect early HPV-related head and neck cancer. Tools are needed to screen those at increased risk of the condition and to test for possible persistence of the condition following therapy. NIDCR will help to fill this public health need by launching an initiative to de- velop a viable diagnostic test. The initiative will identify DNA markers associated with HPV-related head and neck cancer, develop and validate saliva and plasma- based diagnostic tests, and evaluate and test the biomarkers in humans. Clinical studies are also ongoing to establish the safety and feasibility of administration of a DNA vaccine in certain HPV-associated head and neck cancer patients. NIDCR scientists recognize the urgency of developing innovative approaches to detect oral cancer early, when personalized treatment can be more successful, leading to better patient outcomes. There has never been a better time to take advantage of the remarkable opportu- nities in science and technology waiting at our doorstep. Seizing this moment brings us closer to preventing and treating dental, oral, and craniofacial conditions as well as other diseases that share risk factors and therapeutic strategies. 62 PREPARED STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE A. T ABAK , D.D.S., P H.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for the Office of the Director (OD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The fiscal year 2015 OD budget of $1,451,786,000 includes an in-crease of $51,033,000 above the comparable fiscal year 2014 level of $1,399,753,000. The OD promotes and fosters NIH research and research training efforts in the prevention and treatment of disease through the policy oversight of both the extra-mural grant and contract award functions and the Intramural Research program. The OD stimulates specific areas of research to complement the ongoing efforts of the Institutes and Centers through the activities of several cross-cutting program offices. The OD also develops policies in response to emerging scientific opportuni-ties employing ethical and legal considerations; provides oversight and management of peer review policies; coordinates information technology across the Agency; and, coordinates the communication of health information to the public and scientific communities. Moreover, the OD provides the core management and administrative services, such as budget and financial management, personnel, property, and pro-curement services, ethics oversight, and the administration of equal employment policies and practices. The fiscal year 2015 request will also support activities managed by the OD's operational offices. OD Operations is comprised of several OD Offices that provide advice to the NIH Director, policy direction and oversight to the NIH research com-munity and administer centralized support services essential to the NIH mission. The functions and initiatives of the OD's research offices are described in detail as follows: DIVISION OF PROGRAM COORDINATION , PLANNING , AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES (DPCPSI) DPCPSI provides leadership for identifying, reporting, and funding trans-NIH re- search that represents important areas of emerging scientific opportunities, rising public health challenges, or knowledge gaps that merit further research and would benefit from collaboration between two or more Institutes or Centers (ICs), or from strategic coordination and planning. The Division includes major programmatic offices that coordinate and support re- search and activities related to HIV/AIDS, women's health, behavioral and social sciences, disease prevention, dietary supplements, research infrastructure, and science education. DPCPSI serves as a resource for the ICs and the NIH Office of the Director for portfolio analysis by developing, using, and disseminating data-driv-en approaches and computational tools. The fiscal year 2015 budget for DPCPSI, including the immediate Office of the DPCPSI Director, the Offices of Portfolio Analysis and Program Evaluation and Per-formance, and the Office of Strategic Coordination is $11,138,000. OFFICE OF RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS (ORIP) ORIP provides support for a variety of research infrastructure needs, including animal models and facilities; research models, human biospecimens, and biological materials; training and career development for veterinarians engaged in research; the acquisition of state-of-the-art and shared and high-end instrumentation; and re-search resources grants to expand, re-model, renovate, or alter existing research fa-cilities. The ORIP budget for fiscal year 2015 is $275,654,000. SCIENCE EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP AWARDS (SEPA) The goal of the Science Education Partnership Awards (SEPA) program is to in- vest in educational activities that enhance the training of a workforce to meet the Nation's biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs. The SEPA program en-courages the development of innovative educational activities for pre-kindergarten to grade 12 (P-12), teachers and students from underserved communities with a focus on Courses for Skills Development, Research Experiences, Mentoring Activi-ties, Curriculum or Methods Development or Informal Science Education (ISE) ex-hibits, and Outreach activities. In fiscal year 2015, the SEPA Program will be co-ordinated with the Department of Education to ensure that program activities are aligned with ongoing P-12 reform efforts included in the President's budget request. In fiscal year 2015, the budget for SEPAs is $18,541,000. THE OFFICE OF AIDS RESEARCH (OAR) OAR plays a unique role at NIH by serving as a model of trans-NIH planning and management, vested with primary responsibility for overseeing all NIH AIDS- related research. OAR coordinates the scientific, budgetary, legislative, and policy 63 elements of the NIH AIDS research program. OAR's response to the AIDS epidemic requires a unique and complex multi-institute, multi-disciplinary, global research program. This diverse research portfolio demands an unprecedented level of sci-entific coordination and management of research funds to identify the highest pri-ority areas of scientific opportunity, enhance collaboration, minimize duplication, and ensure that precious research dollars are invested effectively and efficiently, al-lowing NIH to pursue a united research front against the global AIDS epidemic. The fiscal year 2015 budget for OAR is $61,923,000. THE OFFICE OF BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES RESEARCH (OBSSR) OBSSR furthers the mission of the NIH by emphasizing the critical role that be- havioral and social factors play in health, healthcare and well-being. OBSSR serves as a liaison between NIH and the extramural research communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our Nation. OBSSR also coordinates and helps support the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network, a trans-NIH initia-tive to expand the agency's funding of basic behavioral and social sciences research. The fiscal year 2015 budget for OBSSR is $26,094,000. THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH ON WOMEN 'S HEALTH (ORWH) Since its creation in 1990, ORWH has worked to ensure the inclusion of women in NIH clinical research, to advance and expand women's health research, and to promote advancement of women in biomedical careers. ORWH is the focal point for NIH women's health research and works in partnership with the NIH ICs to incor-porate a women's health and sex differences research perspective into the NIH sci-entific framework. ORWH activities are guided by the 2010 NIH Strategic Plan for Women's Health Research. This strategic plan outlines six goals to maximize impact of NIH research effort. The NIH strategic plan for women's health and sex dif-ferences research serves as a framework for interdisciplinary scientific approaches. The fiscal year 2015 budget for ORWH is $40,903,000. THE OFFICE OF DISEASE PREVENTION (ODP) The ODP is responsible for assessing, facilitating, and stimulating research in dis- ease prevention and health promotion, and disseminating the results of this re-search to improve public health. Research on disease prevention is an important part of the NIH mission because the knowledge gained from this research leads to stronger clinical practice, health policy, and community health programs. In early fiscal year 2014, ODP released its first strategic plan. This plan outlines the prior-ities that the Office will focus on over the next 5 years and highlights the ODP's role in advancing prevention research at the NIH. The fiscal year 2013 budget for ODP is $5,861,000. The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) is within the ODP or-ganizational structure. The mission of the ODS is to strengthen knowledge and un-derstanding of dietary supplements by evaluating scientific information, stimulating and supporting research, disseminating research results, and educating the public to foster an enhanced quality of life and health for the U.S. population. The fiscal year 2015 budget for ODS is $26,786,000. THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC COORDINATION (OSC) AND THE COMMON FUND OSC oversees the management of the Common Fund (CF), working with trans- NIH teams for each of the more than 30 Common Fund programs. These teams en-sure that each program meets the criteria of Common Fund programs to synergize with IC funded research. The NIH CF was created by the 2006 NIH Reform Act which codified the approach of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research to support cross-cutting, trans-NIH programs that require participation by at least two NIH ICs or would otherwise benefit from strategic planning and coordination. CF pro-grams tackle major challenges in biomedical research that affect many diseases or conditions or that broadly relate to human health. The CF provides limited-term funding for goal-driven, coordinated research networks to generate data, solve tech-nological problems, and/or pilot resources and tools that will stimulate the broader research community. The fiscal year 2015 budget for the Common Fund is $583,039,000. 64 1U.S.DHHS. The Health Consequences of Smoking\u201450 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General.

LOAN REPAYMENT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS The mission of the NIH Intramural Loan Repayment Programs is to seek to re- cruit and retain highly qualified physicians, dentists, and other health professionals with doctoral-level degrees. These programs offer financial incentives and other ben-efits to attract highly qualified physicians, nurses, and scientists into careers in bio-medical, behavioral, and clinical research as employees of the NIH. The Under-graduate Scholarship Programs (UGSP) offers competitive scholarships to excep-tional college students from disadvantaged backgrounds that are committed to bio-medical, behavioral, and social science health-related research careers at the NIH. The fiscal year 2015 budget for ILRSP is $7,145,000. I am happy to answer any questions you may have about the OD's programs and activities as well as our plans for the upcoming year. PREPARED STATEMENT OF NORA D. V OLKOW , M.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2015 President's budget request for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The fiscal year 2015 budget request for NIDA is $1,023,268,000, which re-flects an increase of $7,514,000 over the fiscal year 2014 level of $1,015,754,000. The impact of substance abuse in this country is daunting; the economic toll alone exceeds $700 billion 1a year in healthcare, crime-related, and productivity losses. NIDA strives to translate the returns of its investments in genetics, neuroscience, pharmacotherapy, and behavioral and health services research into new strategies for preventing and treating substance abuse and addiction. This scientific invest-ment is crucial if we are to tackle rapidly evolving public health threats such as the increase in marijuana use among young people and the growing prevalence of opioid addiction and overdose deaths. TODAY 'S BASIC SCIENCE FOR TOMORROW 'S BREAKTHROUGHS There is a fundamental need to understand the complex steps of how body chem- istry influences behavior and how their disruption can lead to addiction. A more de-tailed and personalized account of these steps will lead to a more effective and pre-cise medicine to prevent and treat this complex brain disorder. In this context, and thanks to recent technological developments, we've made im- portant advances in linking genes with behavior. As a result, we now have an un-precedented capacity to screen for thousands of genetic variations and catalogue how they modulate abuse/addiction risk by influencing brain maturation, its neural architecture, and behavioral patterns. NIDA researchers are also pursuing genome and whole individual sequence analysis to identify genes that modulate addiction risk (e.g., genes that regulate drug metabolism), advancing their understanding of how environmental factors (e.g., parental style, drug exposure) can affect the expres-sion of those genes to either strengthen or weaken behavioral patterns through epi-genetic changes. The systematic identification of genetic, environmental, and neurocircuitry variations that modulate abuse/addiction risk will revolutionize our prevention and treatment capacities. BIG OPPORTUNITIES IN BIG DATA Big data sets are essential platforms for the analysis of complex systems in genet- ics and epigenetics, proteomics, brain imaging and clinical science. Vast amounts of data are being produced by the overlaying of structural and functional brain imag-ing information that links the molecular and cellular data with the expression of higher level brain function. A prime example is the new fMRI-based approach to generating images of the functional connectivity (FC) among brain regions in the ab-sence of any specific task, so called resting state (rs) FC. This technique offers a powerful window into circuit-level functions that may generate behavioral responses underlying vulnerability or a diseased state. Open access to such massive databases could lead to the identification of biomarkers of psychiatric illness risk including ad-65 2Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2012 Na- tional Survey on Drug Use and Health: Summary of National Findings, NSDUH Series H-46, HHS Publication No. (SMA) 13-4795. Rockville, MD: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-ices Administration, 2013. diction, their trajectories, and treatment responses that could be translated for clin- ical use and the optimal management of patients. Similarly, NIDA is funding the development of an open source, open framework, free National Pain Registry that collects patient demographic and treatment infor-mation from around the Nation. This information can be used to identify which pain management interventions are most effective for specific chronic pain patients and predict which patients might be at higher risk for opioid addiction. Combined with concerted efforts in the pharmacogenomics of prescription opioids, pain registries are poised to help us maximize the effectiveness of pain treatments while mini-mizing the likelihood of prescription opioid abuse and addiction. NURTURING TALENT AND INNOVATION NIDA currently supports a great deal of innovative research on drug addiction and related health problems such as pain and HIV/AIDS and will continue to be at the forefront of training the next generation of innovative researchers. The 6-year old Avant-Garde award is a good example of a program that stimulates high\u2014im-pact research that could lead to groundbreaking opportunities for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS in substance users. NIDA is now crafting a new kind of award, which blends NIH's Pioneer and New Innovator award mechanisms. This new opportunity, called the ''AVENIR'' award, is designed to attract creative young investigators to genetic research on substance use disorders and HIV/drug abuse re-search. Another example is NIDA's Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA), designed to foster highly innovative or conceptually creative research that advances our understanding of drug abuse and addiction. The latest results of this effort in-clude three independent studies exploring the potential benefits of neurofeedback training, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and meditation on facilitating smoking cessation. BETTER PAIN MANAGEMENT : A MAJOR GOAL OF ADDICTION RESEARCH Pain management is an important component of high-quality, compassionate med- ical care. Opioid analgesics are among the most effective medications for the man-agement of severe pain and frequently used for pain treatment. Unfortunately, the benefits of long term opioid analgesic treatment are accompanied by significant risk of developing drug tolerance (and the need for escalating doses) and hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity). Exposure to potentially rewarding substances, like opioid analgesics, may reinforce drug taking behavior for persons with risk factors for addiction and trigger relapse in those that are in recovery. These are intrinsic liabilities of opioid analgesics that clearly increase the risk for diversion, abuse, ad-diction and overdose. NIDA recognizes it has a critical role in ensuring the availability of safe and effi- cacious chronic pain management options while minimizing risk of abuse. This is why we are committed to supporting research to better predict who is at risk of ad-diction and to develop new classes of effective, non-addicting pain medications. Par-allel to these efforts, NIDA is proactively pursuing methods to minimize the risk of overdose with existing medications. For example, NIDA and Lightlake Therapeutics Inc. have partnered to develop an intranasal delivery system of naloxone (an opioid receptor blocker that can rapidly reverse the overdose of prescription and illicit opioids), which could greatly expand its availability and use in preventing opioid- related deaths, a public health problem of epidemic proportion in the U.S. HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF MARIJUANA USE There is a dangerous and growing misperception that marijuana use is harmless, resulting in its status as the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States with about 12 percent of people aged 12 and over reporting use in the past year. 2 Marijuana use has been associated with significant adverse effects, including addic-tion, cognitive impairment and car accidents. The key to minimizing negative out-comes lies with the intensification of our efforts to educate the public about the dan-gers of marijuana use and, with the deployment of multipronged, evidence-based strategies to prevent and treat the abuse of and addiction to marijuana and other drugs. To meet this challenge, NIDA has released several funding announcements to encourage research on the impact of changing marijuana policies; and, in partner-ship with other NIH institutes, is planning a large-scale, prospective study that fol-66 lows children prior to drug use into early adulthood to determine whether and how marijuana and other commonly used substances (e.g., alcohol, tobacco) affect the de-veloping brain. MEDICATIONS DEVELOPMENT Our current approaches to develop next-generation pharmaceuticals take advan- tage of new technologies using immunotherapeutic or biologic (e.g., bioengineered enzymes) approaches for treating addiction. The goal is to develop safe and effective vaccines or antibodies that target specific drugs, like nicotine, cocaine, and heroin, or drug combinations. If successful, immunotherapies\u2014alone or in combination with other medications, behavioral treatments, or enzymatic approaches\u2014stand to revo-lutionize how we treat, and maybe even someday prevent addiction. CONCLUSION The field of addiction research continues to benefit from the explosion in genetic knowledge, the advent of precise technologies to probe neuronal circuits, and the emergence of openly accessible big data platforms. NIDA's research is strategically poised to take full advantage of these and other emerging opportunities to develop the knowledge base that can be used to reduce drug use in this country. PREPARED STATEMENT OF JACK WHITESCARVER , PH.D. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the Presi- dent's budget request for fiscal year 2015 for the trans-NIH AIDS research program, which is $3,004,973,000. This amount is $19,882,000 above the fiscal year 2014 en-acted level of $2,985,091,000. The authorizing law requires that the Office of AIDS Research (OAR) function as ''an institute without walls'' and allocate all dollars associated with this area of re-search across the NIH. Therefore, the total for AIDS research includes both extra-mural and intramural research (including research management support, manage-ment fund, and service and supply fund), buildings and facilities, training, and eval-uation, as well as research on the many HIV-associated co-infections and co- morbidities, including TB, hepatitis C, and HIV-associated cancers. It also includes all of the basic science underlying this research. Other disease areas are not re-ported this way. Therefore the total for AIDS-related research is not comparable to spending reported for other individual diseases. NIH AIDS RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS In the three decades since AIDS was first reported, NIH continues to be the global leader in research on HIV and its many related conditions. New avenues for dis-covery have been identified, providing possibilities for the development of new strat-egies to prevent, treat, and potentially cure HIV. Recent accomplishments include: \u2014Development of new treatments for many HIV-associated co-infections, co- morbidities, malignancies, and clinical manifestations; \u2014Development of strategies for the prevention of mother-to-child trans- mission; \u2014Demonstration of the first proof of concept that a vaccine can prevent HIV infec- tion and identification of potential immune markers for protection; \u2014Discovery of more than 20 potent human antibodies that can stop up to 95 per- cent of known global HIV strains from infecting human cells in the laboratory; \u2014Demonstration that the use of antiretroviral therapy by infected individuals can dramatically reduce HIV transmission to an uninfected partner; and that the use of antiretroviral drugs by uninfected individuals can reduce their risk of HIV acquisition; \u2014Discovery that genetic variants may play a role in enabling some individuals, known as ''elite controllers,'' to control HIV infection without therapy; and \u2014Advances in basic and treatment research aimed at eliminating viral reservoirs in the body that for the first time are leading scientists to design and conduct research aimed at a cure for HIV/AIDS. In just the past several months, NIH intramural and extramural researchers have produced a number of exciting new advances. NIH researchers published the results of studies utilizing potent human neutralizing antibodies that successfully sup-pressed a form of HIV in primates. This important research could potentially result in a new form of treatment for HIV that could be used as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy and could lead to opportunities for novel research to treat and potentially cure HIV. NIH-sponsored researchers also have made tremendous 67 strides in producing and analyzing proteins that may provide an important new pathway in AIDS vaccine design. A team of NIH-funded investigators recently reported the first case of a newborn in Mississippi who was ''functionally cured'' of HIV infection. The infant received antiretroviral therapy immediately after being diagnosed at birth but was then lost to follow-up and treatment. The now nearly three year-old child has re-entered care with no indication of HIV disease and no detectable virus in the absence of therapy. Additional studies are under way to better understand this case and may lead to clinical trials to see whether a similar approach could be used to achieve a ''func-tional cure'' for other HIV-infected newborns. NIH is leading global research efforts to capitalize on all of these advances, move science forward, and begin to turn the tide against this pandemic. THE AIDS PANDEMIC Despite this progress, the HIV/AIDS pandemic will remain the most serious global public health crisis of our time until better, more effective, and affordable preven-tion and treatment regimens\u2014and eventually a cure\u2014are developed and available around the world. UNAIDS reports that in 2012, more than 35 million people were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS; 2.3 million were newly infected (half of them women); and 1.6 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses. In the United States, HIV/AIDS continues to be an unrelenting public health cri- sis, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic populations, women of color, young adults, and men who have sex with men. The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention estimates that approximately 1.1 million people are HIV-infected; approxi-mately 50,300 new infections occur each year; and one in four people living with HIV infection in the U.S. is female. COORDINATED TRANS -NIH AIDS RESEARCH PROGRAM The NIH AIDS research program is coordinated and managed by the OAR, and carried out by nearly every NIH Institute and Center (IC). Through its unique trans-NIH planning, budget, and portfolio review processes, OAR identifies the highest priority areas of scientific opportunity and ensures that precious research dollars are invested effectively. Scientific priorities for AIDS research are constantly reassessed and reflected in the budget. The annual trans-NIH AIDS strategic plan, developed by OAR in collaboration with both government and non-government ex-perts, guides the development of the trans-NIH AIDS research budget. Each year, the state of the science is reviewed, newly emerged and critical public health needs are assessed, and scientific opportunities are identified. This annual process cul-minates with the identification of the highest strategic priorities and critical re-search needs. OAR develops each IC's AIDS research allocation based on the Plan, scientific opportunities, and the IC's capacity to absorb and expend resources for the most meritorious science\u2014\u2014not on a formula. This process reduces redundancy and ensures cross-Institute collaboration. The fiscal year 2015 budget request reflects the priorities of the fiscal year 2015 strategic planning process. AIDS RESEARCH PRIORITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES The advances made by NIH investigators have opened doors for new and exciting research opportunities to answer key scientific questions that remain in the search for strategies to prevent and treat HIV infection both in the United States and around the world. The fiscal year 2015 budget priorities are: \u2014Basic research that will underpin further development of critically needed pre- vention methodologies, including vaccines; \u2014Innovative multi-disciplinary research and international collaborations to de- velop novel approaches and strategies to eliminate viral reservoirs that could lead toward a cure for HIV; \u2014Research to develop better, less toxic treatments and to investigate how genetic determinants, sex, gender, race, age, nutritional status, treatment during preg-nancy, and other factors interact to affect treatment success or failure and/or disease progression; and \u2014Studies to address the increased incidence of co-morbidities, including AIDS-as- sociated malignancies; cardiovascular, neurological and metabolic complications; and premature aging associated with long-term HIV disease and antiretroviral treatment. 68 SUMMARY The NIH investment in AIDS research has produced groundbreaking scientific ad- vances that have benefited not only patients with HIV, but those with other dis-eases as well. For example, the development of protease inhibitors to treat HIV has led to development of a new drug combination that can cure hepatitis C, which af-fects about 150 million people globally. That advance in hepatitis C research may, in turn, provide important knowledge toward an HIV cure. Drugs developed to treat HIV-associated opportunistic infections are benefiting the more than 28,000 Ameri-cans who receive an organ transplant each year. Research on HIV-associated neurologic and cognitive manifestations ultimately will benefit millions of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other aging and dementia issues. Despite these advances, however, AIDS is not over, and it is far too soon to de- clare victory. Serious challenges lie ahead. The HIV/AIDS pandemic will remain the most critical public health crisis of our time until improved and affordable preven-tion and treatment regimens are developed and universally available. NIH will con-tinue to search for critical solutions to prevent, treat, and eventually cure AIDS. Thank you for your continued support for these efforts. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Dr. Collins. We will start a round now of 5-minute questions. As I said at the NIH, I have never come away from a conversation or listening to you, Dr. Col-lins, without being more enlightened and more hopeful about the future. I like that ''National Institutes of Hope.'' Let me just ask you a question about the BRAIN Initiative, if I can start with that. I have got two or three questions on the BRAIN Initiative. Paint for me a picture of how you see the re-search going ahead in the BRAIN Initiative. And we have some partners, four outside partners, right now that are also putting money into this, and you have an advisory group from DARPA (De-fense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and NSF (National Science Foundation). Paint for me the picture of how you see this developing in the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. And sort of what do we hope to get from this? BRAIN INITIATIVE Dr. C OLLINS . Well, we are enormously excited about this, and I am going to ask my colleague, Story Landis, who is a major leader at NIH in the BRAIN Initiative, to say a word. But just very briefly from my perspective, this is one of those moments that comes along once in a long time where the technology to be able to tackle a truly important problem, understanding how the circuits in the human brain work, has arrived at the point where we have this kind of push, bringing disciplines together that have not nec-essarily found each other, and making this a priority. We believe we can transform our understanding of this incredible organ with its 86 billion neurons, each of which has maybe a thousand connec-tions. But, Story, say where we are and where we are going. Dr. L ANDIS . So we are very excited about the opportunity to real- ly understand how neural circuits in the human brain work\u201486 billion neurons, each of which are connected in complicated circuits and pathways that process information, that allow us to see an image and interpret it, to hear words and understand what they mean, to remember, to reason. We have some understanding now of how those 86 billion neu- rons are organized into circuits, but we do not nearly have enough detail, and we do not know enough about how information is proc-essed. And the goal of the BRAIN Initiative in the first five or so 69 years is to really develop the tools that will allow us to probe those questions. There will be early on potential opportunities to trans-late to disease, and I could give you some examples if you would like. Senator H ARKIN . Let me ask you this, Dr. Landis. Are you work- ing with the National Institute on Aging? Is there any connectivity between the BRAIN Initiative and Alzheimer's research? Dr. L ANDIS . Absolutely, although the understanding that we will gain from the BRAIN Initiative will then be applied to under-standing how circuits are perturbed in Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's disease nerve cells die. We would like to prevent that death, but in the absence of tools yet to do that, the circuits reorganize when cells are lost. And the BRAIN Initiative will give us a better under-standing of why that reorganization occurs and how we can poten-tially use the neurons that remain to have much more function. Senator H ARKIN . Well, I asked that because, you know, we have a lot of things confronting us in the future. I will get to Dr. Varmus and cancer. But if we do not do something about Alzheimer's, that is a tsunami that is going to hit us big time. And so I just really wanted to get that on the record that the money that we are put-ting into the BRAIN program, BRAIN research program, also has a connectivity to Alzheimer's research. Dr. L ANDIS . Absolutely. Senator H ARKIN . Okay. Dr. C OLLINS . Think of the BRAIN Project as a foundation for all neurological diseases, just like the Genome Project was a founda-tion for all genetic diseases. It lifts all of those boats of research to go higher and faster. Senator H ARKIN . Sure. Dr. L ANDIS . And psychiatric diseases and drug abuse, all the brain disorders. FUTURE OF CANCER RESEARCH Senator H ARKIN . Exactly. Dr. Varmus, again, I would be remiss if I did not thank you for a lifetime of devotion and dedication to biomedical research, stewardship of the NIH for a lot of the time I was either chairman or ranking member. And it is good to have you back as the head of the National Cancer Institute. Here is my question: What excites you the most right now? In all of cancer research and stuff, what is it that gets you up in the morning right now that you are looking ahead to do? Dr. V ARMUS . Thank you. And before I give you a brief answer to that question, let me first of all compliment you on your service. You and I have been facing each other across the dais like this for 20 years off and on, and I have always admired your passion, your commitment to the NIH, your honesty. And even on those rare oc-casions when we disagreed on a few issues, we have had a collegial and constructive relationship. And your departure from this Con-gress is a heavy blow to the NIH and to its supporters. Senator H ARKIN . I appreciate that. Dr. V ARMUS . What most excites me at the moment is the deep intellectual understanding we have about how cancer arises and how the body tries to respond to it. And the connection between 70 basic science and its very near apposition to what we can do prac- tically is thrilling. Over 40 years ago, I have to confess when I began doing cancer research, the application of what we were trying to learn with chicken viruses and mouse viruses was very far away. Today we use tools of genomics and immunology and biochemistry in a way that is very closely connected to what we are doing in the clinic. So when we discover a new gene that is involved in cancer, it is not long before we find some drug, perhaps an existing drug, that can be applied to patients whose tumors are being analyzed with the instruments of genomics to identify exactly what is wrong with that cancer, and to carry out in a precise fashion a clinical trial that is designed in entirely new ways. Similarly, we have learned from basic immunology the kind of thing that Dr. Collins just illustrated is also being applied in imme-diate ways to try to interfere with the breaks on the immune sys-tem that have kept the immune system from attacking cancer cells. Senator H ARKIN . My time has run out, but I will have a follow- up on that on immunotherapy and Dr. Rosenberg and what he is doing out there. Okay. Senator Moran. ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Dr. Col- lins, Dr. Landis, and others, thank you very much for attending the recent hearing we had in regard to Alzheimer's in particular. Sev-eral members asked that day if we would reach the goal of a cure for Alzheimer's by 2025 and how much money it would take to do so. I understand how difficult it must be to quantify such an answer, but I think it is important for us to know if our Alzheimer's re-search funding is on track. Therefore, I am looking for your profes-sional opinion or opinions as to how much money does NIH need in fiscal year 2015 to keep pace with the goal of a cure for Alz-heimer's by 2025. Dr. C OLLINS . Well, thanks for the question, Senator, and that was an excellent hearing that was held by this subcommittee. And we had a great opportunity there to look at the challenge and also the scientific opportunities, which are really coming forward in very exciting ways, recognizing that the challenge here in terms of both the economic and human cost of this disease can hardly be overstated. As you have pointed out, we have an action plan for Alzheimer's disease, part of the legislation that put in place this project\u2014plan. And the National Institute on Aging, directed by Dr. Hodes, has been deeply engaged in that, running a research summit at NIH, and polling the entire community about where the research oppor-tunities would be. It is wonderful that in fiscal year 2014, largely due to this subcommittee's efforts, $100 million has been appro-priated for the National Institute on Aging, the bulk of which will be put into promising Alzheimer's research. I have looked carefully at the way in which the Alzheimer's plan maps across the various years. As you know, science tends not to operate in 1 year intervals. Many of the components of the plan are 71 more in a 3-year kind of timetable. I could show you a Gantt chart that goes on for many pages about how each of these components might start and hopefully reach a milestone. It is very difficult, though, with all the multiyear aspect of this to say, well, what do we need exactly in fiscal year 2015? And I have sort of tried with Dr. Hodes to come up with that kind of esti-mate, and I am afraid it would not be a reliable one. Part of that is, of course, we do not have the ability in science to know exactly what is going to happen next month or the month after that. And a lot of the research in Alzheimer's is being developed by investiga-tors out there in our wonderful brain trust, the universities that are doing this research. And we might wake up tomorrow and find that something has happened that completely changes the direction we want to go. So while this plan is a good one to work with, it will undoubtedly evolve over time. So I know I am sounding like I am not giving you an answer, and I guess I am trying to say I think to put a dollar figure right now on fiscal year 2015 would be to overstate what I really can predict to be necessary for this purpose. Again, we are thrilled with $100 million in 2014. We were delighted to see in the President's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative another $100 million would come to Alzheimer's disease should that become possible. Senator M ORAN . You have the capability, Dr. Collins, I assume, of telling us or telling me that the $100 million in fiscal year 2014 was not too much. Dr. C OLLINS . It was not too much. You are quite right about that. And, you know, you are asking about Alzheimer's. You could be asking about many other areas of NIH research as well, and I would tell you we do not have too much money to work on anything that we are working on. We are not limited by ideas. We are lim-ited by resources, whether it is cancer, infectious disease, heart dis-ease, whatever. That is our current state. Senator M ORAN . Doctor, let me take this question in a broader step. But first let me say that my expectation would be as those scientific developments occur, a reason that we should have the kind of hearings that we have on an ongoing basis is so that you can then come to us and say this development has happened in some university in the country or here at NIH. And, therefore, if you would invest additional dollars in this area, we believe we can advance the outcomes more quickly. And so, my continued effort, I think, will be to try to get you to help us prioritize spending based upon science, based upon success in research where we ought to put the dollars that we have to allo-cate within the 27 Institutes and Centers that you and NIH engage in. Dr. C OLLINS . Senator, I would welcome those kinds of conversa- tions at any time, and appreciate your leadership in that kind of planning process. DISEASE SPECIFIC FUNDING Senator M ORAN . I have 28 seconds left for a follow-up question, which is this: You have\u2014you, NIH\u2014has historically opposed dis-ease-specific funding. You want the allocations to occur based upon science, not on politics, and I certainly share that goal. If we are 72 underfunding in an area of research\u2014if we start with low funding in a particular area of research, it is harder to have the develop-ments that then allow you to come to us and say we have had a breakthrough, we need more. We need to accelerate the funding of that research. How are you\u2014I mean, can you give me examples\u2014I do not have the history that Senator Harkin has, but does it happen from time to time in which you come to Congress and say we need to prioritize the research in this area, and are you willing then to tell us that we reduced the priority someplace else? How do we ever get into the circumstance in which any of us are willing to say our money should go into this basket, knowing that it is not infinite? The money has to come out of some other basket. Dr. C OLLINS . Well, again, I appreciate the question. And this is the kind of conversation we have around the table at NIH all the time with the 27 Institute and Center directors, each of whom has a strategic plan that they are constantly refreshing and revising. The good news is that the boundaries between those institutes are very porous. And if we collectively identify an opportunity that demands additional investments in a particular direction, we often can figure out how to do that without having to go through a long lead time to try to adjust a future year's budget. And we are quite capable of doing so. And increasingly, that is a good thing because the next break- through in cancer might come from the Diabetes Institute, and the next breakthrough in infectious disease might come from the Cen-ter that is looking at translational sciences. So we are really, more than we ever have been, a unit, a whole here that thinks about bio-medical research collectively, not in a series of buckets. Senator M ORAN . Thank you very much. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Moran. And our distin- guished Chair of the entire Appropriations Committee, who hap-pens to have a real interest in NIH, I can tell you that. Senator Mikulski. Senator M IKULSKI . Thank you very much, Senator Harkin, and we are so glad that you are holding this hearing. And I think it shows the significance of the way we think about the National In-stitutes of Health, which we all affectionately and with great admi-ration do call the National Institutes of Hope. The fact that Sen-ator Shelby is here, the vice chairman of the Appropriations, and myself shows our commitment to really trying to make sure that NIH has the resources it needs to continue to be the premiere glob-al agency for biomedical research, and to do it on a bipartisan basis. I know you spoke earlier, if I could. You were kind of emotional about this hearing, and I am emotional about this hearing for you. I recall coming to the United States Senate. I was sworn in 1987, working with then the beloved Nancy Kassebaum, you, and Ted Kennedy, when women were not even included in the protocols, many of the research things, at NIH. There were many reasons. Many were just flawed sociology rather than good biology. Imagine in those years when we were not even included, and then we advocated for the Office of Women's Health. The funding then for breast cancer was quite spartan and skimpy. Again, we 73 turned to you. And then as we made steady advances, George Her- bert Walker Bush appointed Bernadine Healy to be the head of NIH. Dr. Healy also reached out again to us to ask us to look for a famous longitudinal study on hormone therapy. That hormone therapy study resulted in the change in the way hormones are treated in terms of hormone therapy for women, and it resulted in breast cancer coming down by 15 percent. I recall with great emotion my last call with Bernadine Healy, and this is what she said. I called her, and there was an article in the New York Times, Dr. Varmus, that said breast cancer rates have come down 15 percent. And I said, ''My god, Bernadine, can you believe that?'' She said, ''Yes, Barbara. Can you believe because we worked together we are saving lives a million at a time?'' That is what we are trying to do here with this hearing. We are trying to look at these issues. And I am going to say to you, Sen-ator Harkin, the Catholic nuns had a phrase when they taught peo-ple like me. They had a phrase in Latin called ''exegi monumentum aere perennius aedificabo.'' It means we will build a monument more lasting than bronze. I feel our monument to you, to both you, to Senator Specter, to Bill Frist, Ted Kennedy, is the way we walked across the aisle is to build a monument more lasting than bronze, and that is to make a significant public investment this year in the National Institutes of Health to get it right back on track to where it was, and to have a steady growth plan of action so that at the end of the day, at the end of the year, at the end of our terms, we know that we have been working together to save lives a million at a time. So I want to just shake your hand and thank you. And, Moran, you are from Kansas. Senator M ORAN . Yes. Senator M IKULSKI . You know what Nancy did shoulder to shoul- der here. Senator Shelby has been a great advocate. I have many questions that I am going to ask. We could hold a hearing on each and every one of those people\u2014distinguished peo-ple here. We are lucky to have them. Their combined years of serv-ice are stunning. Many of them at this table could be in such lucra-tive careers in the private sector. I remember working with Dr. Fauci when there was this un- known disease in which men were dying all over the country. It was called AIDS. A little boy named Ryan White came here with his mother when he had been targeted by his classmates for taunts and isolation. Now look at where we are. We could take item after item, issue after issue, and it really shows what we need to do. So we need to not only fund the research, we need to support the people who do the research. And to those young people out there right now thinking about careers that there is hope in trying to find cures to give people hope. And so, this is where we really need to work on a bipartisan basis, hands across the aisle, hands across the dome. And I think we can make a significant difference. So we want to help build a monument more lasting than bronze. I yield back my time. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much. That was a very poign- ant statement, and I thank you for that. The only thing I would add is we have to come to grips with the funding, and I am open for any and all suggestions. 74 Senator M IKULSKI . I know we are all going to get into this. Senator H ARKIN . I just met yesterday with a couple of people who had an interesting idea on funding for translational science. Gordon Gund and Karen Petrou from the Foundation for Fighting Blindness have come up with\u2014I do not need to go into that now, but there are ideas being spawned out there on how we might raise more money for NIH. So anybody that has got suggestions, we need to keep looking. PREFERRED METHOD OF FUNDING Senator M IKULSKI . And, Mr. Chairman, if I could, if Dr. Collins could comment. We had a great hearing on Alzheimer's, and also that is an epidemic in our country, as is autism, quite frankly. And again, many here could comment on it. And then there are those things that seem benign and not too scary, but then along comes flu. But when we look at the ''A'' words\u2014autism\u2014there was talk of, like, do we need, like, a Manhattan Project. And I wonder to Dr. Collins and the esteemed panel, what is it that is the best thing for NIH, sustained, steady growth with kind of an agreement across the aisle and across the dome of steady in-creases to the way we had the concept of\u2014I understand if we added\u2014kept pace with inflation at 3 percent, and then another 5 percent, we could get to almost doubling NIH\u2014we do not want to use that phrase anymore\u2014to $40 billion. Is that better rather than a concentrated big buck expenditure on one particular area for\u2014\u2014 Dr. C OLLINS . I really appreciate the question. And I wanted to show you a graph\u2014\u2014 [The graph follows:] 75 Senator M IKULSKI . In other words, does the idea of a Manhattan like project really have efficacy, or does it sound good, but\u2014\u2014 Dr. C OLLINS . What you see on the screen here is the projection over the past years since 1990 of the NIH support corrected for in-flation because we have to deal with that. That is the yellow line. You see the blue bar is there for the Recovery Act, those 2 years of an increment which helped with sort of pent-up need. But notice the doubling, which happened there between 1998 and 2003, then encountered essentially flat budgets, which inflation has eroded ever since. And you can see interestingly, the dotted line is the trajectory we were on before the doubling, which if you go back to 1970, we were on a period of about 3.7-percent annual growth. If we had stayed on that steady trajectory, we would now be $10 billion almost higher than we are. Very interesting to sort of con-template this. Now, the doubling was wonderful. The doubling did huge things for biomedical research. But what came after has been really quite painful. And to answer Senator Mikulski's question, the worst thing you can do, I think, to biomedical research is to create an area of uncertainty, of ups and down, of a roller coaster. Science operates not as a spring, but a marathon. You need confidence that there is going to be support there so that young scientists can tack-le really innovative risky projects. And this up and down cir-cumstance now hitting historic lows in terms of opportunities to get support is really quite damaging. And what would be vastly better, Senator, would be for us to be able to count on a more or less stable trajectory of inflation plus some percentage that you could be fairly confident was going to be maintained. I understand how hard that is in the current fiscal sit-uation, but if you are asking my judgment about what NIH needs in order to flourish and in order to contribute to this Nation what we think we can contribute and to the world, that would be it, that kind of steady trajectory that you could be confident in. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Dr. Collins. Senator Shelby, our ranking member of the entire committee. Used to be the ranking member of this subcommittee. Senator S HELBY . Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Harkin, and thank you for all your service here and advocacy for NIH. I believe as a veteran member of the Appropriations Committee looking at all the aspects of the various requests for money that the NIH, I think, by far is the best investment we have made. And we should make sure that it is properly funded and not let it be eaten up with inflation. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Dr. Collins, tell us the economic impact of biomedical research, including pharmaceutical research\u2014NIH is the leader, but going on elsewhere, too, in the private sector\u2014in this country, and how important is it not to just our health, but to our economy and our leadership in the world. You have some numbers there? Dr. C OLLINS . I have some numbers. I could go on all day with numbers because\u2014\u2014 Senator S HELBY . How about taking a few minutes? Because the chairman will gavel\u2014\u2014 76 Dr. C OLLINS . I will try to rein it in here. Senator S HELBY . Thank you. Dr. C OLLINS . I will tell you when I came to this job to be Director of NIH, I did not realize how important it was going to be to have this kind of case in front of the public and in front of the Congress in order to justify what we are doing because the main reason I am excited about being at NIH is the advances in research that are going to help people. But there is another great story here, which is that every $1 that we give out in grants to all 50 States, by most estimates, returns more than two-fold in terms of economic\u2014\u2014 Senator S HELBY . It is a huge multiplier, is it not? Dr. C OLLINS . It is about $2.21 per $1 according to one\u2014\u2014 Senator S HELBY . In GDP (gross domestic product) and jobs, right? Dr. C OLLINS . And in jobs. We directly support about 432,000 jobs through our grants. But if you figure out how NIH is sort of part of the ecosystem that creates jobs in biotech and in pharma, the estimate is something like 7 million jobs are dependent upon the progress that NIH makes, and are somewhat jeopardized by our current circumstance. And when you look at the competition issue, which is another one that people raise, certainly America has led the world in bio-medical research for the last 20 or 30 years, but that is gradually eroding, and, in fact, eroding more quickly these days, especially after sequester. And if we are interested in seeing those kinds of returns like were talked about with the Genome Project, a 141 to 1 return on those dollars, do we really want those returns to go somewhere else, or do we want them to happen right here? AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Senator S HELBY . Absolutely not. We want to keep it here. Let me ask you a question. I am limited in time. We have a chairman with a good gavel here. In the autoimmune area that I have worked with you before, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, are you cutting back on the money there? It seems like you are. And if so, why? Dr. C OLLINS . We are only cutting back because we have to cut back everywhere. Senator S HELBY . Because of lack of money. Dr. C OLLINS . Even with the wonderful things you all did with the fiscal year 2014 omnibus, we did not recover everything we lost in the sequester. I will say one bit of good news about lupus is the development of this partnership with industry called the Accel-erating Medicines Partnership, AMP, because lupus is one of the targets that we are going after. Senator S HELBY . They are kind of matching you on money, right? Dr. C OLLINS . They are, $230 million over 5 years, half of it from us, half from them, and bringing scientists around the same table who would not normally be talking to each other, and having this all done in an open access fashion. This is an interesting experi-ment, but it may very well get us that next generation of drug tar-gets for lupus. Senator S HELBY . Doctor, how important is not just for lupus, but all the autoimmune diseases\u2014the whole spectrum affects so many of the areas of research that you are working on, does it not? 77 Dr. C OLLINS . Absolutely, and maybe Dr. Fauci would want to say a word about this since he is the most distinguished immunologist in the room. Senator S HELBY . We know. Dr. F AUCI . Thank you for the question, Senator. Indeed, I think the issue with autoimmunity is really an example of how funda-mental basic research and understanding how the immune system is regulated over the last several years have provided extraor-dinary insight into how we can better manage, diagnose, and ulti-mately treat, and in some cases even prevent, autoimmune dis-eases. Whenever you think about autoimmunity, the terminology itself is descriptive, namely an immune response against oneself that is inappropriate, and that is what is studied at the very basic level. At the NIH, we now are developing consortia where, as you hinted, multiple institutes are involved in immunology\u2014the Cancer Insti-tute, the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, our institute, the Ar-thritis Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Institute, et cetera. They all are, and we have a consortium now\u2014\u2014 Senator S HELBY . Immunology kind of transcends it all, does it not? Dr. F AUCI . It is one of those disciplines that essentially touches to a greater or lesser degree virtually everything we do. CYSTIC FIBROSIS Senator S HELBY . Dr. Collins, in another is lim- ited, just a few seconds\u2014but cystic fibrosis. We have come a long way there. We are a long way from a cure, but we have extended a lot of the children's lives, you know, beyond, gosh, what we thought. Where are we today, and what are some of the hopes there? Dr. C OLLINS . Well, cystic fibrosis is a wonderful example of how knowing the molecular basis of a disease can get you to a point with a great deal of hard work to a targeted therapeutic that is not just hoping something will work, but designing it to work. So cystic fibrosis, where my lab had the privilege of being in- volved in that and found the gene in 1989. Just a year ago, the first really effective therapeutic for about 5 percent of cystic fibro-sis patients that have a particular mutation in that gene was ap-proved by the FDA, infact. And it is truly dramatic the stories you hear from those individuals. I have heard stories of kids who were on the lung transplant list who are now not on it anymore. The main challenge now is to find an equivalent therapy for the majority of cystic fibrosis patients that have a different mutation, the so-called Delta F508, and there is a clinical trial very actively underway by Vertex. The drug is called VX-809. We are all holding our breath to see what the results of that will look like. The initial glimpse with a smaller phase two study looked pretty promising. So you have gone\u2014it took a long time. And one of the things that NCATS, and my colleague here, Dr. Austin, is charged to do is to try to shorten what would be a 20-year timetable into something much faster. But the pathway here that was charted by cystic fi-brosis in a collaboration with the CF Foundation that was a major 78 partner here is truly exciting. It is a paradigm. We could do this again. Senator S HELBY . Thank you very much for the work you do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Shelby. Senator Kirk. REHABILITATION STANDARDS Senator K IRK. I want to ask Story a question as a stroke sur- vivor. We have two members\u2014senators on this committee who are stroke survivors. I would like to take you into the world of our rehab standards, which Senator Johnson and I have both intro-duced legislation, S. 1027, to speak on behalf of the 900,000 Ameri-cans who will survive stroke we expect this year. We know that roughly one-third of them will never return to work. And Tim Johnson and I have a belief that we could set a national standard of returning those stroke survivors to work. That would unlock a hell of a lot of Americans to pay taxes and be productive. Let me just burrow in for rehabilitation standards. My under- standing is out of the $3 billion NIH, about $66 million is spent. I think the country would do well to have NIH establish a rehabili-tation standard. Dr. L ANDIS . So, NINDS (National Institute of Neurological Dis- orders and Stroke) recently established a stroke network of clinical centers that will undertake stroke trials. And one of the major rea-sons we did this was to have a balance in our investment in pre-vention, acute treatment, and stroke rehabilitation. We have re-cently finished one trial, which has shown that it is not\u2014never too late to start rehabilitation for stroke, that significant gains can be made even after 6 months. We have another trial underway. But this has clearly been an area where there has not been sufficient investment, and this clinical trials network will enable us to do more trials better and faster, which will create the kind of stand-ards that you are asking for. Dr. C OLLINS . Could I add one thing, that the number you men- tioned is the funding for the National Center for Medical Rehabili-tation Research, NCMRR, which is actually within the National In-stitute of Child Health and Human Development. But that is not the sum total of all that we spend on rehabilitation research. Much of what Dr. Landis was just talking about is in a different part of the budget. So the total expenditures on rehabilitation research are several times that number, just to clarify. JOHN PORTER MEMORIAL Senator K IRK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to\u2014could I follow up and thank you for honoring my political mentor, Con-gressman John Porter, the other day, the man who on a bipartisan level led to the doubling of funding for this institution. You guys honored a great man who really put together an awesome team with Speaker Gingrich on that. Dr. C OLLINS . And, Senator, let me thank you for sending a won- derful video that the 400-some people who were there for that dedi-cation watched and were touched by. And I appreciate very much your contributing to our event. This was a grand moment for NIH. 79 Let me say one other thing about rehabilitation research. We are very much in the process now of seeking a new director for this Na-tional Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, someone who will be particularly forward looking in identifying opportunities, how to work with the institutes, how to build the case here for re-habilitation research to be even more vigorous than it has been. And we are looking for the very best person on the planet to do that. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much. We will start another round. FUNDING HISTORY AND SUCCESS RATES Dr. Collins, do you still have that chart that showed where that doubling was? You showed that line for the constant inflationary increase of, I think it was $3.7 or something. That one right there. [The graphic follows:] Senator H ARKIN . Again, just for the record\u2014there may be people who were not here at that time. Here is how we came about that doubling. In the 1990s, we saw the rate of approval of grants per-centage going down and down and down from what it had been in the 1980s. And so, meeting with people at the Institute then\u2014it was Dr. Varmus at that time, if I remember right, others. We were talking about what would it take to sort of get back up to that level where we were in the 1980s for the percentage of\u2014what is the phrase I am looking for\u2014grant approvals, right? Dr. C OLLINS . Success rate. Success rate. 80 Senator H ARKIN . Yes, success rate. And so, we got that. And what that would take would be\u2014what it meant was to double the funding over a period of 5 years. Our thought was that once we did that and got up there, that blue would then start up there where the top was, and we would go on\u2014\u2014 Dr. C OLLINS . That is what we were hoping for, too, believe me. VOICE . The soft landing. Senator H ARKIN . This was never meant as some transitory type of a funding bump. Now, maybe the Recovery Act was. That was sort of a transitory bump, but the doubling was to get us back up to that level and then continue on. Dr. C OLLINS . Yes. Senator H ARKIN . And so, we sat here through the 2000s and saw what happened. Again, I do not mean to speak politically, but just factually. We had two wars going on. 9/11 had happened. More and more money was being siphoned off for that. I am not making a judgment call on that. That is just what happened. And we were in a situation where we were not raising revenues, but more and more money was going for the War on Terrorism, and that is what happened. We just did not have the resources, and we came back down, and that is where we are today. It pains me, and it pains a lot of people to think that that hap- pened. We deliberately did that to get that line back up there and to keep it going. And, well, other things happened, and so we are back in this situation now, and we are scrambling to find the re-sources that we need to do this. We need more revenues. That is just my own thing. We need revenue. I think the taxpayers of this country would not mind paying a little bit more in their taxes or the wealthy or the corporations, everybody, to know that this was going to help NIH and that is where the money was going. And so, somehow we have just got to get the revenues in for this, and like I said, I am open for any other thoughts and suggestions on how to do it. Senator Hatfield at one time had an ingenious idea of doing that. I joined him in that. That did not get very far, but it was a proposal that we would take, I think it was 1 cent out of every $1 that went for healthcare premiums. See, a lot of people do not know that when you go to a drugstore and you buy a pre-scription, and when you get a prescription drug or something like that, some of that money goes for research. But we do not do that in our healthcare policies. When you buy a healthcare policy, none of that goes for research. So the idea that Hatfield came up with was that 1 cent out of every $1 that would be\u2014go into a fund that would come to this committee. That would go to NIH as long as we funded NIH at last year\u2014at the previous\u2014\u2014 Senator M IKULSKI . Maintenance of effort. Senator H ARKIN . Maintenance of effort, thank you. That phrase, ''maintenance of effort,'' then that money would be available to NIH. That would have been a great deal to have, but we did not get it. And I am still thinking that there is something out there in that realm of healthcare policies where people who are buying healthcare policies would say, ''Yes, I would like to have a half a penny or something go to biomedical research and come into a fund.'' I think people would support that if they knew that is where 81 it was going. It was going to NIH. They would support that. So I have not quite totally given up on that idea, but there may be oth-ers. RETIREMENT OF CHIMPANZEES Dr. Collins, I have one other question I want to ask sort of off of what we have been talking about here, but it is one that I hear a lot of about, people keep asking me about. There is a great inter-est in this country about what is happening to our chimpanzees. As you know, we have had a great partnership with you, with the Humane Society, on retiring these chimpanzees from research. I know Senator Landrieu has been kind of in the forefront of this, and I know she wants me to also ask this question. I was one of three Senators who requested the IOM (Institute of Medicine) re-port that revealed that chimpanzee research could not be justified except for a very few conditions. Again, Dr. Collins, you are to be commended for adopting the IOM recommendations so promptly, the very day the report was released. Your decision to retire ap-proximately 310 of the 360 Government-owned chimpanzees cur-rently in laboratories was a bold maneuver, and I thank you for that. As a long-time appropriator, however, I know that the work takes far longer than the issuing of a policy or the signing of a bill. I am keenly aware of the complexity of creating sanctuary space, grouping, transporting chimpanzees, arranging for their care. Many of these chimpanzees suffer from illnesses and conditions we gave them for the sake of research. So could you please update the sub-committee on the plan for retiring these chimpanzees? Can you highlight the challenges and considerations involved, including any funding challenges that we need to be cognizant of? Dr. C OLLINS . Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your leadership on this issue in many steps along the way, includ-ing asking the IOM to conduct that study, which concluded that the need for chimpanzees in research had now been greatly re-duced and that we could, in fact, get by just fine by keeping a small group of 50 available for emergency needs or special things where only chimpanzees could be used for research. And you also helped us with a fix on what had been a legislative problem about a cap on the amount of funds that NIH was allowed to spend on chimps in sanctuaries, and that made it possible for the retirements that we very much wanted to go forward. But you are quite right, we have a long way to go here in terms of the num-ber of chimps that need to be moved into sanctuaries. And at the present time, that space does not exist. We have moved many already into Chimp Haven, which is al- ready now pretty close to capacity. We are looking vigorously at other\u2014\u2014 Senator H ARKIN . Is that the one in Louisiana? Dr. C OLLINS . Yes, and we are vigorously looking at other alter- natives because there are other chimp sanctuaries to make sure that they meet the standards that you would want to see so these chimps are well cared for. And there is much interest in philan-thropy in helping out with this, and the Humane Society has been a wonderful partner as well. My dear friend, Jane Goodall, who 82 will turn 80 years tomorrow, has been very helpful in raising the consciousness of everyone about what an important issue this is. I would not tell you that we have this solved. I think it is going to be several years before the space can be identified, the funds can be found, and the completion of the retirements can be achieved so that we are left with just those 50 chimps for research. And we will be re-evaluating that regularly as well to see whether those are even needed at that level. But I appreciate your interest and this committee's interest in this, and we are going to keep you regularly briefed on what the needs might be. Senator H ARKIN . This started back in the late 1990s, and that is when Jane Goodall came to see us. And Senator Bingaman I know was involved. The Senator on the Senate side that introduced the bill on saving the chimps was Senator Bob Smith from New Hamp-shire. I remember that. I forget who the other one was, but there was a strong bipartisan effort. And so, it has taken a long time. I know we got that cap removed. It was a $30 million cap if I am not mistaken. We got that removed. Dr. C OLLINS . Yes. Yes. Senator H ARKIN . But there is a great deal of interest in moving ahead on this. And maybe if you cannot today, could you get to the committee sort of the timelines you see and what more do we need to do to kind of expedite this? Dr. C OLLINS . I am glad to do that. [Clerk's Note: The information requested can be found in the ''Additional Com- mittee Questions'' for Senator Harkin.] Dr. C OLLINS . And, Mr. Chairman, again, when I came to this job as NIH Director, I did not imagine that this issue would become so prominent. And yet it has turned out to be, I think, one of the more gratifying opportunities to work across many different con-stituencies and do the right thing for these special animals, who are our closest relatives. Senator H ARKIN . Our closest cousins. Dr. C OLLINS . Absolutely. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much. Senator Moran. DISEASE FUNDING PRIORITIZATION Senator M ORAN . Chairman, again, thank you. Dr. Collins, I am going to ask one more question about prioritization, and then a couple of questions for a couple of your directors. What are the criteria\u2014when you say this is an ongoing conversa- tion about how to prioritize funding within NIH among the various diseases\u2014that you look at? Is it the likelihood of success, the next opportunity for a breakthrough? What role does it play about the cost of the disease? How many people are afflicted, what the cost of care and treatment are? Is it a more scientific exercise in trying to prioritize how to spend money correctly, or is it a broader con-cept that you pursue? Dr. C OLLINS . That is a great question, and it is something that we work on every day. It is a mix of all those things. Certainly the public health impact has to be a concern for us, the number of peo-ple affected, and the severity of the illness, and what it does in 83 terms of quality of life or premature death. Those are all factored in. But if we only thought about those things, then rare diseases would get neglected, and we have learned so much from studying rare diseases. And if it is your family, it does not matter so much to you that it is a rare disease than if it is your child who is suf-fering from it. We also think about scientific opportunity because that has got to be a major reason to decide to make a push in a particular direc-tion, that something is emerging that is possible and maybe it was not a year or two previously, and you do not want to lose the oppor-tunity to push forward on that. On top of that, of course, a lot of our portfolio is not top down managed, and it should not be. It comes from the insights, the in-genuity, the creativity, the bold vision of those investigators out there and the universities across this country who are remarkable in their abilities to think of things that we could not have thought of. And, we, therefore, have a very substantial fraction of our port-folio that is not targeted or directed based on anybody's idea about public health need or about scientific opportunities other than the fact that they are proposing something scientific. Those then go through a peer review process. If the idea does not measure up, it does not make it into the next tier. I would tell you, though, that peer review, while it is critical, it is not the only part of what we do. And all of the Institute directors you see here, once we have had the peer review, look across that, and the things that are somewhere near the pay line, decide what is the highest program priority based upon the issues that I just talked about\u2014public health need, scientific opportunity\u2014and also is our portfolio well balanced, or do we have a big pile up of things in one area and neglect in other areas. All of that calculus folds into this every day that these institute directors and I are strug-gling with. And I think we do a reasonable job of it, but we are always trying to do better. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS Senator M ORAN . Thank you for your answer. Dr. Varmus, NCI's budget request includes information on expanding access to clinical trials for patients treated in community settings and expanding ac-cess to trials by minority and underserved populations. One of those underserved populations is rural Americans, and I was inter-ested in knowing if you could talk about the goals of that program and how many new NCI community oncology research programs, projects you might expect to find. Dr. V ARMUS . Well, Senator, I cannot give you an exact number for that, but as you were rattling off the names suggested, you are aware that we have just amalgamated two of our community-based programs into one called NCORP for Community Oncology Re-search Program, in which we are paying special attention to minor-ity populations and rural populations and trying to bring hospitals that are not in our NCI designated cancer centers into the network of organizations that organize our clinical trials and provide more patients. And indeed, many of these centers that compete particu-larly effectively for money to support clinical trials have been in these areas\u2014have been producing large numbers of patients to ac-84 crue them into our trials over the last several years. That is an im- portant factor in making a decision about who will get support. As you know, we have constraints across the board because our fiscal levels are not what they used to be, so I cannot promise you any specific number until we have fully competed and awarded those grants. But our intention is to recruit as many patients as we need to carry out a new style of clinical trial that we are en-couraging; that is, trials that are based as much on the genetic damage that has driven the cancer as in the organ on which the cancer has arisen. So, there is a new style of doing trials that is more costly because it requires more preliminary testing. And we are also under the direction from a report from the Insti- tute of Medicine to pay our investigators a higher fee for each pa-tient accrued to those trials, so our trials have become more costly. So our interest in expanding our trials, especially with all the new therapeutics, not just drugs, but also antibodies and immune strat-egies, and radiotherapy that have come our way, is difficult to meet under current conditions because we cannot simply do trials. We also have to be investing, and this is part of the prioritization ques-tion in the basic research that fuels new therapeutic approaches. And indeed, I would just make a footnote to your question about making priority judgments about what we spend our money on by pointing to a new initiative at the NCI, despite our declining budg-et, that targets one particular mutant gene called RAS that is mu-tated in over a quarter of all cancers. So here is a major target against which, despite knowing about this target for 30 years, we have made very little progress. So we have started what is called a hub and spoke project cen- tered in Senator Mikulski's favorite location, Frederick, Maryland, where we have a contract program called the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. We have recruited somebody from the University of California at San Francisco to come and lead this effort, which involves grantees around the country working shoul-der to shoulder with a hub of people at Frederick who are leading the charge on six specific new opportunities for advancing our un-derstanding of cancers that are driven by RAS mutations. And this is a way to lead to new kinds of compounds that can then be tested nationwide in trials that are specifically directed to cancers that have mutations in that specific gene. CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE AWARDS Senator M ORAN . Doctor, thank you. My time has expired. Dr. Austin, I will submit a question in writing to you. I am interested in the recommendations by the Institute of Medicine in June of 2013 on the Clinical and Translational Science Awards, and I am interested in hearing how things are going to develop. So I look for-ward to having a conversation with you. Thank you. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you. Senator Mikulski. IMPACT OF FUNDING ON U .S. INNOVATION Senator M IKULSKI . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I just want to say to you and to all the Institute directors and every-one who works at NIH, we are fortunate to have you. But again, 85 I want to come back to your longevity, which shows really your dedication, and we view it as a blessing. I also want to just comment that we\u2014many of us here are wor- ried about the innovation deficit both at NIH and in others. There is an effort that is being led by Senator Durbin in this area, and to that end, we on the Appropriations Committee are going to hold a full committee hearing on innovation to make sure that budget cuts and possibilities of future sequester does not dampen our standing as a world innovation leader. Yes, we worry about the def-icit, but we also worry about the innovation deficit. So, we are going to be holding that hearing on April 29. Dr. Collins will be tes-tifying, the science advisor. We are going to be listening to NSF, DARPA, and also the Energy Secretary. So we will be doing that. WOMEN 'S HEALTH In the short time I have because others are now here, I want to raise the issue of the Office of Women's Health, that which I ref-erenced earlier. It has been flat funded for 3 years at $40 million. Now, what I would like to get a picture of is: What do you need to have the Office of Women's Health, number two, kind of the way we are thinking about running it because each and every one of those institutes does important work with women. So when we em-barked upon our initial endeavor that I referenced with Dr. Healy, breast cancer was our preoccupation. Those rates are coming down, but lung cancer in women is high. Dr. Gibbons could tell me that women with heart disease are now escalating, and our symptoms are different, but are early diag-noses there? We could go to Dr. Landis and we think about some-thing like atrial fib that is there, but if you do not take your blood thinner, you could end up with a stroke and wondering where are you, et cetera. And then, of course, autoimmune is several things, one of which is lupus for which only recently the first drug\u2014thera-peutic drug in 50 years, of course, came out of Human Genome in a Maryland company. So it is across all the institutes, which was the idea why we never wanted an institute on women; we wanted an office that would work. So could you tell us really with the $40 million, how is it going, do you need more, and then how do you see this working across the institutes? Dr. C OLLINS . Thanks for the question. I very much resonate with what you are saying, and we have made a lot of progress, Senator, thanks to you and others for raising this issue to the attention of NIH 20 years ago. We have been fortunate in the Office of Re-search on Women's Health (ORWH) to have remarkable leaders in Vivian Pinn, who recently retired, and now Janine Clayton, who is a terrific leader for that effort who I just met with day before yes-terday to go over the status of her portfolio. And she has been, as Vivian was, very effective in building partnerships across NIH to support special efforts that focus on women's health. There are particular programs in ORWH, particularly the Spe- cialized Centers of Research on Sex Differences, the SCORE Pro-grams, as well as training programs that have done a good job, I think, in increasing both research on women's health and also in-creasing the proportion of researchers who are women. And I would 86 say if you look at the statistics, it looks reasonably good, but there are obviously things that we need to do better. In fiscal year 2013, 57 percent of those enrolled in NIH clinical research trials were women\u201457 percent. And you know what that was 20 years ago, in phase III trials, 73 percent. So, we have really come a long way. Many of those trials are, of course, disease spe-cific and may, therefore, be sex specific, for instance in breast can-cer. But many of them as in heart disease are balanced. What we are currently particularly concerned about is actually that this same idea has not trickled down in animal models, and there is clearly a problem in that many of the investigators who are studying models of disease are studying only males\u2014male rats, male mice\u2014for reasons that are not defensible. And Dr. Clayton and I are about to publish an exhortation to the community about this, and we are going to start looking very closely at grants to see whether this can be corrected because if you did not learn about those sex differences in your complete clinical, you are going to miss out on an inference that might be really important. How much money do we need? Well, we need more money as you have heard from all of us in every area of what we are doing. I would say Dr. Clayton has been quite effective in brokering the dol-lars that her office has to build relationships and get a lot done, but there is a lot more we could be doing. Senator M IKULSKI . Well, as you know, the health data on women are changing, and the recent IOM report over the last 2 years shows that mortality and morbidity among women is on the rise. Anyway, a longer topic. Dr. C OLLINS . I would love to converse further with you about this at any time. It is a passion of mine as well. Senator M IKULSKI . Thank you. Senator H ARKIN . I just want to publicly again thank Senator Mi- kulski. When she first came to the Senate opened our eyes and got the NIH to do internal studies to show that women were not being included in clinical trials. So it was Senator Mikulski who really moved the ball forward on that. That has been over 20 years ago. Senator M IKULSKI . It has been a long time. Senator H ARKIN . A long time ago. And so, we thank you for mov- ing in the right direction. Senator Shelby. ANIMAL RESEARCH Senator S HELBY . Just for the record, I want to touch on some- thing Senator Harkin brought up, and that is the research on chimpanzees, animals, and so forth. As a kid growing up in the Bir-mingham area in Alabama, I tried to rescue every dog in the neigh-borhood. I still love dogs. I still rescue them. But my parents could only feed so many. And I was brought to reality, but that did not change my caring about animals as all of us do. On the other hand, we are all used in research, you know. I have been used by permission in research because you gather information that helps everything. But is there a real substitute\u2014none of us want to be cruel and inhumane to animals. You have used animals in biomedical research as you 87 have used us, you know, in different aspects. But is there a real substitute for that? Dr. Collins, do you want to pick up on that? Dr. C OLLINS . I will, and I appreciate your making the point that research\u2014\u2014 Senator S HELBY . Because we all love\u2014I love dogs still. Dr. C OLLINS . So do I. Senator S HELBY . But I do not collect them anymore, you know. Dr. C OLLINS . And we have learned enormous amounts from the study of animals in research, and we will continue to depend heav-ily on those insights for advances in human medicine, no doubt about it. With the chimpanzees, the IOM basically felt that there was nothing unique that would justify the continued maintenance of hundreds of chimpanzees. Senator S HELBY . Oh, I totally agree. Dr. C OLLINS . We could shrink this back to a small group. But your question about a substitution, I am going to ask Dr. Austin to say something about an approach to studying toxicity of drugs, which traditionally has used animals, and maybe now we have got a better way to do this. Dr. A USTIN . Yes, thank you for the question. So this is common saw in the translational world that the best animal model is the human. And so, what we are trying to do is move more of this work to human models, and one of them I actually have sitting right in front of me. This is a kidney, but it is a kidney on a chip, and it is populated by human kidney cells, which is a wonderful model and a much better model of testing drugs than in a rat or a chim-panzee and predicting which drugs\u2014\u2014 Senator S HELBY . Because it is a human being which you are working on ultimately to help save, right? Dr. A USTIN . Right. And so, this is part of a tissue chip program, that you have probably heard about, that is developing so-called organoids. They are three-dimensional micro organs on a little micro fluidic platform, a human on a chip. To be able to represent human organs in this sort of format that will dramatically change, but we believe, both the accuracy and the speed with which this testing is done and will make animal models irrelevant, obsolete. We are not there yet. We have got a lot of work to do. And actu-ally\u2014\u2014 Senator S HELBY . But you are going down the right road, are you not, Dr. Austin? Dr. A USTIN . Yes. Senator S HELBY . You are going down the road. Dr. A USTIN . Yes, absolutely. Senator S HELBY . Well, a lot of my lawyer friends are probably glad to hear this because, you know, people have said tongue-in- cheek, ''Gosh, if we run out of basic research, we could use lawyers as a surplus.'' I said, ''Do not do that.'' Thank you. Dr. C OLLINS . Well, fortunately induced pluripotent stem cells came along to save the lawyers because we have this amazing new technology, which this committee has heard about, but I just got to say it gets better every day. A skin biopsy or a blood sample from any one of you could be used to make those kidney cells on that chip by doing all of this clever manipulation that has only 88 come to light in the last 5 years of turning genes on or off. And that means that we could generate not just any old kidney chip, but your kidney chip, and find out whether that drug that you are going to get is going to be good for you or it is going to make your kidneys not so good. BIG DATA TO KNOWLEDGE Senator S HELBY . Dr. Austin referred to something that I just want to pick up on with you, Dr. Collins. The data that is collected from all of us in biomedical research willfully and knowingly will help to cure diseases and so forth. How important is that in the research field, whatever it might be, immunization, or neurological, cancer, you name it. Dr. C OLLINS . It is critical, and of course we have this challenge to both keep track of increasingly enormous databases, but also to be sure we are protecting the privacy of the individuals' data so that it is not exposed in a way that they would not have given con-sent for. I am glad you raised this because NIH has just this year initi- ated a new program we are calling BD2K, Big Data to Knowledge. We have enormous opportunities from genomics, from imaging, from electronic health records, from everything you can think of to make insights about health and disease. Unless we focus on the problem of data itself, the sort of new science called data science, we are going to get all drowning in the data that we have produced instead of making inferences from it. So we are putting an unprecedented amount of effort into it, and this omnibus for fiscal year 2014 has given us a nice push in that regard. We aim to ramp that up to $100 million on the big data initiatives over the next couple of years, and I hired a remarkable scientist from San Diego to lead that effort, Dr. Philip Bourne. Senator S HELBY . Mr. Chairman, one last observation and ques- tion to Dr. Collins. You mentioned earlier about how important it was for scientific investigators to go down the right road. Some-times you do not know you are on the right road, and sometimes you are on the wrong road and discover something else, though, do you not\u2014that is worthwhile to mankind. Is that a question of supervision of more investigators, or is it a question of better education correlation with what people are doing? There may be no answer to it because a lot of scientific breakthroughs have come from finding something or they did some-thing backwards. Hey, you all know it better than I do. Do you want to comment on that? Dr. C OLLINS . Absolutely. I think you are quite right that many of the most dramatic observations that have led us to insights about life and life sciences have come in directions that nobody would have predicted were going to be the case, you know, from Pasteur on. And serendipity does sort of favor the prepared mind. But I worry that at the present time with our young scientists feel-ing so constrained by anxieties about support that they may be less inclined when faced with an unexpected result to think of that as an opportunity to go down a new path because of the necessary kind of need to keep pursuing something that they think is in the mainstream and more likely to get supported. 89 This is one of those secondary effects of a difficult budget situa- tion that worries all of us, that creativity, that innovation, that risk taking, that sort of seeking a different pathway than you had planned to is more difficult. We are funding a certain set of grants that aim to try to make that possible. The Pioneer Awards are per-haps the best known where investigators basically get 5 years of support. And if they encounter something they did not expect, they can go after it. But many of the other grant systems are not quite so favorable for that. Senator S HELBY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Durbin. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH FUNDING Senator D URBIN . Thank you very much. Thank you for dedicating a major part of your professional life to medical research at the premiere biomedical research agency in the world. And we are proud of it, and thank you for that. I also want to acknowledge\u2014 he will have plenty of tributes paid, but when the history is written of the NIH, there will be a chapter that is entitled ''The Porter- Harkin-Specter'' chapter when they made a decision to move for-ward in a dramatic way and double the appropriation for the Na-tional Institutes of Health over a 10-year period. Tom, of all of your accomplishments, you probably created more good for the world with that undertaking, although there are lot more that would compete. So I thank you for your leadership. Dr. Collins, when I met with many of you just a few months ago, I sat down and said where do we go next. I am not sure I can come with a straight face to Congress and say double it again. I am not sure they will do it. And we had a conversation about what it takes each year to increase an investment in research in NIH and CDC, Department of Defense, healthcare, VA health research. And you first noted that when we fall behind the cost of living, it really ties your hands in the long term to award grants. The fail-ure to provide a regular cost of living adjustment (COLA) to NIH, as I understand it, has cost you 22 percent in terms of your ability to award grants for research over the last 10 years. The President's budget proposed for your agency for the next fis- cal year gives you, I believe, 0.7 percent COLA. We know that the actual cost of living increase will be 1.7 percent. So built into the President's budget is a further decline, falling behind more when it comes to the actual cost of living. And at that time, I said, ''Give me an idea of what it would take in real growth to build this agency forward.'' And you said\u2014for the record I am going to ask you to comment on this\u2014''Give us 5 per-cent real growth per year for 10 years over the cost of living and we will show you the kind of growth in research that America and the world needs.'' So here you are on the record, and I am going to remind you of that conversation since I took it to heart and introduced a bill. So please tell me if you still believe that. Dr. C OLLINS . Senator, thank you for the question and for intro- ducing that bill, and it was a wonderful opportunity to talk with you when you came to NIH. And your taking on this leadership is deeply appreciated. 90 I am showing you here this graph that I think we talked about when you came to visit, and, yes, it is exactly as you have said. [The graphic follows:] Dr. C OLLINS . The blue bars there are the appropriations for NIH, but the yellow reflects the effect of the biomedical research and de-velopment price index (BRDPI). It is sort of like a cost of living, but it is our cost of living for doing research, the ''BRDPI'' as we call it. And you can see what has happened since 2003. At the end of the doubling, those yellow bars have been dipping down steadily ever since. Earlier when you were at another hearing, I showed another version of this graph that basically says if we had stayed on the same pathway we were back in sort of 1970 to 1995, which was sort of steady growth of inflation plus about 4 percent, we would now be at about $40 billion as far as the total NIH budget, $10 bil-lion more than what we currently have. To get back on that pathway, which would be a wonderful way to encourage research to really move forward at the pace that it could because we are not limited by talent or by ideas. Putting this NIH trajectory on a steady path where you could count from year to year on inflation plus a percentage\u2014and five would be wonder- ful\u2014would get us back to where perhaps we really need to be in a few years, and would give such a jolt of confidence and excite-ment to frankly a fairly demoralized biomedical research commu-nity. Senator D URBIN . And you have told me about it, and we know the young investigators are disappearing. Three percent are under the age of 36 today. Back 30 years ago it was 19 percent. And the other thing that struck me when we talked about AMP was you 91 were asking for\u2014asked for and received a commitment of $150 mil- lion, if I remember correctly, from the top 10 pharmaceutical com-panies to be matched by NIH to pursue cures and whatever in the areas of Alzheimer's, type 1 diabetes, if I am not mistaken, and rheumatoid arthritis. To put that in perspective, what I have called for in the Amer- ican Cures Act is $140 billion over a 10-year period of time for the four agencies to get real 5-percent growth\u2014$140 billion. Last year alone we spent over $200 billion in Medicare and Medicaid on Alz-heimer's\u2014$200 billion. If we could delay the onset of that disease, it would more than pay for all of the increased investment in re-search. We have got to step back and take stock of what we are doing here. As we short change you, we add to the cost of our healthcare programs instead of reducing that cost. And just to put it in a glob-al perspective, other countries are not waiting. Europe is moving forward. The United Kingdom is moving forward. In 8 years China will pass us in real dollars spent on research. And that ought to be sobering, and I hope it will awaken us. I know the chairman has a meeting to go in a few minutes as I do, too, so I will not dwell on this other than to say I am going to keep pursuing this. I really believe that what you are doing is really a great credit to this country and will alleviate suffering and pain around the world. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. C OLLINS . Thank you, Senator. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Durbin. Thanks for your kind words. I appreciate that. Senator Cochran. Senator C OCHRAN . Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to join you and other members of the committee at this hearing. We appreciate your attention to the appropriations request for NIH, and we con-gratulate Dr. Collins and his team for the excellent work they con-tinue to do in biomedical research, and the benefits that flow from that to our great country. POTENTIAL CARE FOR AIDS Last year it came to my attention that at the University of Mis- sissippi Medical Center, a pediatrician, Dr. Hannah Gay, reported that a patient of hers who is now more than 3 years old remained HIV-free after receiving anti-retroviral therapy within hours of her birth. We have recently heard about a similar case in California. I am impressed with the research being done in my State and am hopeful that this could be good news for continued research efforts, not only in Jackson, Mississippi, but throughout the country. What do we know or what do you know about these cases that you can share with us in terms of their impact? And what does this mean for research and treatment as far as a potential cure is con-cerned? Dr. C OLLINS . Well, we have the world's expert in the room, Dr. Fauci. Dr. F AUCI . Thank you, Francis. Thank you for the question, Sen- ator Cochran. This is truly a very important case because, as you described accurately, this was a mother who came into a clinic in Mississippi who was HIV-infected, who had no prenatal treatment 92 for her HIV, which put the child at very high risk. The astute phy- sicians, pediatricians in Mississippi, instead of treating the baby in a prophylactic way to prevent infection, they immediately aggres-sively treated the baby as if the baby were infected. After that very rapid application of full-blown aggressive therapy as opposed to waiting for a few weeks for the diagnosis, the baby turned out actu-ally to be infected. By a series of circumstances after several months on therapy, there was a discontinuance in care. The mother dropped out of the healthcare system, came back several months later, and the baby had not been on therapy for several months. The physicians watched because they could not find any virus in the baby, and now 3 years out the baby is well, growing well, and has no evidence of infection, which is likely the first real cure of HIV infection. That has now triggered an NIH-funded study in which a large number of babies who are born of high-risk mothers, namely moth-ers who have not been treated, will be put on aggressive therapy to see if, in fact, you can cure babies. Now, the reason that is im-portant is that the risk to benefit ratio of treating babies aggres-sively very early on has weighed on the side of waiting because you are not sure if you are ever going to have the opportunity of curing someone, so you say let us not expose the baby to aggressive ther-apy because you might actually hurt the baby if the baby is not in-fected. And all you are doing is going to be saving a few weeks of treatment. Now that you know you can actually cure a baby if you are ag- gressive, then the risk benefit ratio switches all the way over to the possible benefits. So it was a very important case, and it has trig-gered a study which will begin in the middle or end of May, a multicenter study to see if we can verify that and apply it to a larg-er number of babies. Senator C OCHRAN . Thank you. That is very exciting, Mr. Chair- man. And I hope we learn from that that we need to listen to these witnesses when they come before our committee. We are all going to learn something, and it may be reflected in direct appropriations that really do improve not only the lives of American citizens, but actually saves their lives. Thank you very much. CONCLUSION Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Cochran. Well, listen, thank you all very much again. It is always enlightening. Always a pleasure to hear about the National Institutes of Hope and what you are doing. I hope that our subcommittee can meet the obliga-tions of funding that you have talked about here that is in the President's budget, maybe even go beyond that in some cases I hope in terms of funding for NIH. We just have to recommit our-selves to breaking this logjam of the funding for NIH. We have got to get back to the success rate that is less than 20 percent across the board. We have got to get down to that 15 percent level some time. I think that is what we did after we doubled it. It was down around that area, if I am not mistaken. And so, as I said before, I think the American people support that. I do support it. And we just have to meet our obligations to do all we can to fund it and, as I said earlier, to find any ideas 93 on ways of funding and getting more money for NIH. We just can- not give up on this. We just cannot. Too much is at stake. I often think there are so many young people out there with keen minds, want to get into science, biotechnology. We need to give them the hope that if they want to pursue that as a life career like so many of you have had, that they are going to have the oppor-tunity to succeed. They are going to have the opportunity to put those keen minds to work and investigating and asking those ques-tions of how and why and what happens. Basic research to me has always been the most stimulating. I often put it in the past in terms of if you have\u2014let us say you have 10 doors to a potential cure. Well, if you open one door, the odds are, what, 10 to 1, 9 to 1\u2014I am not too good at math\u2014that you are not going to find the right door. If you open five doors, the odds become even better, or eight or nine. That is what basic research is, is opening those doors. A lot of times it may not lead to where you think it is going to lead, but sometimes that basic research leads to something else. I always remember John\u2014Dr. Enders and the kidney cells, and the Salk polio vaccine. That is not where he was headed, but that is what happened later on. And so, to me basic research needs to be\u2014we just have to fund it. It always pains me when people say, ''Oh, we put all that money into basic research, but, you know, when are we going to have an end date? When are we going to find this cure and stuff?'' I say, ''Well, that is not a legitimate question to ask of basic research. The legitimate question to ask of basic research is do you have a question. Does something stimulate your curiosity that you are willing to spend some time to investigate it and take it as far as you can without knowing exactly what the end result is going to be?'' That is what basic research is. And we need to stimulate that kind of thinking in America, that kind of excitement about basic research. And if we do not fund NIH, we are telling young people and these keen minds do some-thing else maybe. Maybe there is something else for you to do. So to me, the funding for NIH is not only the here and the now, but it is the next generation, the generation after that we encourage to take this up and to devote their lives to science and to basic re-search. We will do whatever we can to make sure that that hap-pens. ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS And I thank you all for all of your dedication\u2014your lifetime dedi- cation to exploring the frontiers of science and health, finding so many cures and therapies. It has been amazing, amazing thing to see what has happened in the last 25, 30 years that I have been here. There next 30 years can be even better. Let us make it so. Thank you very much. I am supposed to\u2014we will keep the record open\u2014the record will remain open until April 9 for Senators to submit other questions and for responses to questions. [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but were submitted to the Department for response subsequent to the hear-ing:] 94 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR TOMHARKIN CHIMPANZEE RETIREMENT Question. Dr. Collins, I want to thank you for the partnership you have had with this subcommittee and the Humane Society on the process of retiring chimpanzees from research. As you know, I was one of three Senators who requested the Insti-tute of Medicine (IOM) report that revealed that chimpanzee research could not be justified except for a very few conditions. You are to be commended for adopting the IOM recommendations so promptly\u2014the very day the report was released. Your de-cision to retire approximately 310 of the 360 government-owned chimpanzees cur-rently in laboratories was suitably bold. As a long-time appropriator, however, I know that the work takes far longer than the issuing of a policy or the signing of a bill. I am keenly aware of the complexity of creating sanctuary space, grouping and transporting chimpanzees, and arranging for their care. Many of these chimpanzees suffer from illnesses and conditions we gave them for the sake of research goals. Can you update the subcommittee on the plan for retiring these chimpanzees? Can you highlight the challenges and considerations involved, including any funding challenges? Answer. Thank you for your leadership in working with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to resolve issues related to NIH-owned or supported chimpanzees in research. An update on the NIH plan for chimpanzee retirement follows. Many factors must be considered to ensure a suc-cessful chimpanzee retirement process: Availability and complexity of creating the physical sanctuary space, grouping of animals based on individual and group behav-ioral characteristics, transporting chimpanzees (which requires healthy animals and temperate weather), and arranging for the care of an aging population. NIH has re-tired approximately 270 chimpanzees. At the present time, there is insufficient space in the Federal chimpanzee sanctuary system to accommodate all of the chim-panzees that will eventually be transferred. Sufficient and appropriate sanctuary space is one of the major hurdles to retiring more animals. Another is the need to select carefully the 50 most suitable research animals prior to retiring the remain-der. Since 2005, NIH has moved nearly 270 chimpanzees into the Federal Sanctuary System. Our plan to transfer all remaining NIH-owned chimpanzees from the New Iberia Research Center has been completed. The last group of nine chimpanzees was moved to the Federal Sanctuary System on June 12th. Currently, Chimp Haven, Inc. is the only facility in the Federal Sanctuary System, and it is nearing capacity. As a result of natural attrition and careful planning of group composition, we antici-pate retiring approximately 30 more chimpanzees by the end of 2014. We are ac-tively looking for alternate sites that meet, or can be modified to meet, the high standards required to ensure that these chimpanzees are well cared for. These re-quirements include adherence to PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Labora-tory Animals, the CHIMP Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-551); Chimp Haven is Home Act (Public Law 110-170); the CHIMP Act Amendments of 2013 (Public Law 113- 55); and the sanctuary specific regulations at 42 CFR Part 9. Chimp Haven, Inc. meets these requirements. A Request for Information NOT-OD-14-067 (April 7, 2014) was issued to solicit information from facilities potentially qualified to join the Federal Chimpanzee Sanctuary System. Responses identified three potential options for additional sanc-tuary space, but all would require additional and potentially costly construction. NIH is looking at all options to develop sufficient sanctuary space but cannot yet estimate the time required. Second, a major hurdle is the determination of the 50 chimpanzees most suitable for critical research. This selection must occur prior to retirement because the Chimp Act, as modified by the Chimp Haven is Home Act, mandates that retired chimpanzees cannot be returned to invasive research. These research chimpanzees will be chosen after an extensive NIH review of experimental protocols to ensure that all IOM criteria are met. These protocols, and the final selection of research animals, may require a period of several years. No chimpanzees will be used for NIH-supported invasive biomedical research unless chosen as part of the group of 50. Chimpanzees will stay at their current facilities, receiving high-quality medical and dental care, in their social groups, and under the care of familiar staff. Once the 50 have been chosen, remaining animals will be transferred to the Federal Sanc-tuary System as space permits. NIH will regularly reevaluate research needs and reduce the number of research animals as warranted. 95 Some chimpanzees at the research or reserve facilities will be available to move to the Federal Sanctuary System almost immediately because they will not be suit-able for research protocols. The professional staff at each facility is currently identi-fying these animals based on many criteria. We are making progress, but it is not yet possible to specify a timeline for the disposition of all chimpanzees. It is likely to be several years before the completion of all chimpanzee retirements. DISEASE PREVENTION Question. I don't have to tell anyone here about my passion for disease prevention. NIH has an important role to play in conducting research on disease prevention\u2014 after all, it is the National Institutes of Health, not the National Institutes of Treat-ment. I was very pleased to see that NIH recently released its first 5-year strategic plan for the Office of Disease Prevention, within the Office of the Director. How will this new plan help advance disease prevention research? I'm particularly interested in how the plan will address gaps in research that are identified by the U.S. Preven-tive Services Task Force. As you know, the ACA included a provision that requires insurance companies to cover any preventive service recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) with no deductible, no co-pay. When the USPSTF review interven-tions, they often find that there is not enough research to make a recommendation. In those cases, they publish a number of questions that need to be answered before a recommendation could be made. NIH does not currently use these questions in their research agenda planning process. The Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) was created in 1986 in response to the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 which required the creation of an Associate Director for Prevention. ODP includes the Office of Dietary Supplements, the To-bacco Regulatory Science Program, and supports NIH's Prevention Research Coordi-nating Committee. On January 3, 2014, NIH adopted its first-ever strategic plan for disease preven- tion research, which had the following priorities: \u2014Systematically monitor NIH investments in prevention research and assess the progress and results of that research. \u2014Identify prevention research areas for investment or expanded effort by the NIH. \u2014Promote the use of the best available methods in prevention research and sup- port the development of better methods. \u2014Promote collaborative prevention research projects and facilitate coordination of such projects across the NIH and with other public and private entities. \u2014Identify and promote the use of evidence-based interventions and promote the conduct of implementation and dissemination research in prevention. \u2014Increase the visibility of prevention research at the NIH and across the country. Some examples of grants funded by ODP in 2013 are: \u2014Transforming Cancer Health Messaging: Engaging Alaska Native People Through Digital Storytelling \u2014Cyber Partners: Harnessing Group Dynamics to Boost Motivation to Exercise \u2014Uganda Working Group on Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors \u2014Psoriasis and the Risk of Diabetes \u2014Financial Incentives for Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women \u2014Mood and Insulin Resistance in Adolescents at Risk for Diabetes \u2014Natural Disaster Effects on Aggressive Children and Their Caregivers \u2014Biomarkers in HPA Axis and Inflammatory Pathways for Suicidal Behavior in Youth \u2014Collaborating to Measure the Effects of Stroke Preventive Interventions Answer. In February 2014, the NIH Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) released its first Strategic Plan which outlines the priorities that the Office will focus on over the next 5 years. The goal of this effort is to increase the scope, quality, dissemina-tion, and impact of prevention research supported by NIH. The ODP will achieve this goal by providing leadership for the development, coordination, and implemen-tation of prevention research in collaboration with NIH Institutes and Centers and with other partners. While the priorities and objectives outlined in the plan are de-signed to benefit the broader NIH prevention research community, the plan itself was developed as a tool for the ODP and does not represent a trans-NIH plan for prevention research. The ODP strategic plan includes six strategic priorities that will allow the Office to expand its influence by, for example, providing training in prevention method-96 ology and developing new strategies for identifying research needs\u2014activities that may not otherwise be addressed by a single NIH Institute or Center but are impor-tant for advancing disease prevention research more broadly. Interest in disease prevention has grown, and NIH has a responsibility to ensure that the best preven-tion science is supported to inform clinical and public health initiatives at the indi-vidual, organizational, community, and policy levels. The strategic priorities in-cluded in the plan will allow the ODP to play an important role in that process while giving NIH Institutes and Centers the flexibility to support prevention re-search within its extramural and intramural programs that best reflects its mission and state of the science of their programs. Strategic Priority II supports the identification of prevention research areas that may benefit from investment or expanded effort by NIH. In addition to utilizing re-sults of new portfolio analysis tools that are under development (Strategic Priority I), the ODP will achieve this goal by working closely with the NIH Institutes and Centers, as well as other Federal and non-Federal partners such as the U.S. Preven-tive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to identify and prioritize gaps in prevention science and promote research in these areas to broaden the knowledge base. The USPSTF conducts scientific evidence reviews of a broad range of clinical preventive healthcare services (such as screening, counseling, and preventive medications) and develops recommendations for primary care clinicians and health systems. As part of its clinical recommendation process, the USPSTF identifies significant gaps in key areas of knowledge that may limit the full realization of the benefits of evi-dence-based preventive services recommendations. Of particular concern to the re-search community are areas that receive an Insufficient or ''I'' recommendation by the USPSTF, which indicates that current evidence is insufficient to assess the bal-ance of benefits and harms of the service under consideration. As the NIH liaison to the USPSTF, the ODP refers Insufficient or ''I'' recommendations made by the USPSTF to NIH scientific program staff. The NIH Institutes and Centers can use this information to help them make decisions during the post peer-review process to further expand knowledge within a given research area. To further advance Strategic Priority II, the ODP is also developing a systematic process that can be used by NIH Institutes and Centers to report recent advances or on ongoing research that addresses the research gaps identified by the USPSTF and other partners. This information, along with identified gaps, will help to high-light research areas that are in need of additional support. In addition to dissemi-nating this information to our colleagues, the ODP will incorporate this information into its own efforts to promote collaborative prevention research projects and facili-tate coordination of such projects across NIH and with other public and private enti-ties (Strategic Priority IV). REHABILITATION RESEARCH Question. I was pleased to hear that NIH is implementing many of the rec- ommendations of the 2012 Blue Ribbon panel on rehabilitation research. This is a critical area of research to improve the functions and abilities of people with severe injuries, illnesses or conditions so that they can live independently. This research is done across many Institutes and Centers, but there is no con- sistent definition of rehabilitation research. Without a common definition, it is dif-ficult to ensure that core priorities are being addressed and to accurately track the science across all of the Institutes and Centers. In the fiscal year 2012 Labor-HHS bill, this subcommittee asked that NIH adopt an NIH-wide definition. A year later, the Blue Ribbon panel went a step further to recommend that NIH adopt the WHO definition. What steps is NIH taking to address this issue? Rehabilitation research is cross-cutting and focuses on improving the ability of people with severe injuries, illnesses, disabilities and chronic conditions to improve skills and functions and live as independently as possible. Medical rehabilitation research is conducted at NIH through numerous Institutes and Centers. The research is intended to be coordinated by the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) within the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). One of the main difficulties in coordi-nating the work being done at the various Centers and Institutes is that NIH does not have a consistent definition of ''rehabilitation research''. The fiscal year 2012 Senate LHHS report language: Rehabilitation Research .\u2014The Committee commends NIH for appointing a blue-ribbon panel to evaluate rehabilitation research at the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research [NCMRR] and across all of NIH. The Com-mittee requests a copy of the panel's report when it is available. The panel is urged to identify gaps in the field of rehabilitation research and recommend 97 which ICs or other Federal agencies should be responsible for addressing them. In addition, the Committee recognizes the improvements that have been made in delineating rehabilitation research as part of NIH reporting mechanisms es-tablished since the passage of the NIH Reform Act. However, the Committee encourages NIH, through the leadership of NCMRR, to further clarify a con-sistent definition of rehabilitation across all institutes and centers and to seek ways to delineate between physical, cognitive, mental and substance abuse re-habilitation when characterizing NIH-supported research. Finally, the Com-mittee encourages NCMRR to explore the broader social, emotional and behav-ioral context of rehabilitation, including effective interventions to increase social participation and reintegrate individuals with disabilities into their commu-nities. The December 2012 report from the Blue Ribbon Panel on Medicare Rehabilita- tion Research further emphasized the importance of taking action to clarify the defi-nition of ''rehabilitation research'' by recommending the following: ''The study of mechanisms and interventions that prevent, improve, restore or re- place lost, underdeveloped or deteriorating function, where function is defined at the level of impairment, activity and participation according to the WHO-ICF model (World Health Organization's International Classification of Function, Disability and Health).'' Answer. Since enactment of the 1990 law authorizing the establishment of the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), NIH has been using the definition of medical rehabilitation research included in the statement of purpose for the Center (Sec. 452 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 285g-4), which states that the purpose of the Center is to support research, training, and health information dis-semination ''with respect to the rehabilitation of individuals with physical disabil-ities resulting from diseases or disorders of the neurological, musculoskeletal, car- diovascular, pulmonary, or any other physiological system (hereafter in this section referred to as ''medical rehabilitation''). This definition, which is used consistently across NIH, has allowed medical rehabilitation research to be distinguished from other rehabilitation research efforts, such as those that involve mental health or ad-dictive disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) definition was adopted since that time; while NIH has no objections to using the WHO definition, the law would need to be amended to replace current language. If the definition were changed, it would need to be translated into an operational definition to allow appropriate characterization of the more than 11,000 competing grants that NIH currently funds each year. NIH uses its ''Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC)'' system\u2014a sophisticated text-data mining soft-ware\u2014to categorize and cluster words and phrases that reflect agreed-upon defini-tions. See http://report.nih.gov/rcdc/. NIH has already started to develop an RCDC ''fingerprint'' for medical rehabilitation research, which will allow NIH to track the research portfolio as it changes over time, and to understand the breadth and depth of the portfolio as part of the upcoming effort to develop a strategic research plan. MEDICATION IN PREGNANCY Question. Each year more than four million women give birth in the United States and more than 3 million breastfeed their infants. Nearly all of these women will take a medication regularly or receive a vaccine, but little is known about the effect of most drugs on the woman or her child. For most drugs, we don't know the impact on child development and we don't know the impact on the effect of the medication. A study in the American Journal of Medicine illustrated that fewer than 10 percent of medications approved by the FDA since 1980 have enough information to deter-mine their risk for birth defects. Women and doctors are forced to guess whether to continue their treatment. This gap in understanding has become increasingly problematic as more women delay childbearing and rates of chronic disease rise. More expectant mothers than ever before are requiring medications to manage conditions such as diabetes, hyper-tension, depression, and asthma. What types of research activities is NIH engaged in to fill these research gaps? What is the state of our understanding of the effect of drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding? Answer. Primarily through its Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology and Thera- peutics Branch (OPPTB), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development takes a range of approaches to support research 98 activities on medication use in pregnancy and during breastfeeding, collaborating with other NIH Institutes and Centers as appropriate for their areas of expertise. The Obstetric-fetal Pharmacology Research Units (OPRU) Network was estab- lished in 2004 with four academic research institutions to improve the safety and effectiveness of the medications commonly used (but often never having been tested) in women during pregnancy and postpartum. The OPRU Network has provided crit-ical research infrastructure for a multidisciplinary collaboration of researchers to perform basic/translational studies and phase I/II clinical trials aimed at character-izing and evaluating the impact of medications on metabolism and physiological, cel-lular, and molecular changes during pregnancy. The OPRU Network also conducted opportunistic studies of medications in women who were already taking these medi- cations during pregnancy. More than 100 research articles from these studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Some study results have directly informed clinical practice. For example, a study of the anti-diabetes drug glyburide use during pregnancy showed that glyburide can cross the placenta and that the drug's concentrations are about 50 percent lower in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes than in non-pregnant women with type 2 dia-betes, suggesting that a higher dose may be needed to achieve optimal therapeutic effects. A study of oseltamivir, a medication for treating and preventing influenza, indicated that the drug plasma concentrations are much lower and apparent clear-ance significantly higher in pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women, suggesting an increased dose may be necessary to achieve comparable effects. The OPRU Network currently supports a randomized clinical trial to determine the pharmacologic effects of anti-diabetic drugs (glyburide and metformin) sepa-rately, and in combination for management of gestational diabetes, a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the effect of early treatment with pravastatin for prevention of preeclampsia, and an exploratory study to identify vaginal biomarkers of response to progestin treatment of preterm birth. The Network also is funding several inves-tigator-initiated grants on nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation dur-ing pregnancy and safety and effectiveness studies on anti-hypertensive medications in pregnancy. In addition, to encourage young investigators working in this area of research, the OPPTB supports several postdoctoral training programs. CANCER AND DISTRESS Question. I know first-hand that a cancer diagnosis can be devastating for pa- tients and families. Studies show that half of all cancer patients experience psycho-logical and social distress as a result of their cancer diagnosis. But there is good news: a study conducted by Dr. Barbara Andersen and published in the Journal of Oncology showed that patients with breast cancer who receive distress screening and social and emotional follow-up care have a 45 percent reduced risk of cancer recurrence, a 56 percent reduced risk of death; and a 59 percent reduction in breast cancer death even WITH recurrence. These are remarkable outcomes. Yet the Institute of Medicine has consistently concluded that cancer care provides state of the art biomedical treatment but does little address the psychological and social needs of cancer patients. What requirements, if any, does NCI have on its intramural and extramural re- search programs to screen patients for distress and ensure follow up care? What kind of research is being done, either at NCI or at the Mental Health Institute, to further this promising area of research? Answer. As the Federal agency that supports the Nation's cancer research enter- prise, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts and facilitates research and the development of valid tools that can inform standard clinical practice and medical de-cisionmaking. However, NCI does not establish standards of care or place require-ments on care-givers. Other Federal agencies and private-sector organizations (such as specialty societies and cancer-specific groups) develop medical recommendations for cancer, building upon NCI's research and the work of these other agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop guidelines or rec-ommendations about all aspects of medical practice related to cancer care. Still, it is important to emphasize that both NCI and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) support research related to screening for emotional distress experienced by patients who receive a cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment. In this area, NCI's role is to fund and support research that shows the efficacy and impact of systematic screening for emotional distress on cancer survivors' subse-quent health and function. Historically, we have funded\u2014and we continue to sup-port\u2014randomized controlled trials that test the ability of psychosocial and behav-ioral interventions to reduce psychological distress and promote adaptation to ill-ness. This research has shown that a wide variety of interventions (both at the indi-99 vidual and group levels and varying in content) are effective in improving under- standing of illness and adherence to treatment, reducing depression, fatigue, and stress, and adopting healthy behaviors. A key response by NCI to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Cancer Care for the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs, was to include attention to survivorship and palliative care in the funding of NCI's Community Cancer Cen-ters pilot program (NCCCP). One of the deliverables for funded NCCCP sites was to develop the capacity to screen for distress and refer individuals to appropriate psychosocial care as needed. NCCCP sites also had to expand their psychosocial pro-grams, as well as training of staff to identify and manage these issues in patients being treated at each institution. In addition, NCI solicited information from the clinical-investigator community about the tools they are using to screen for distress, as part of the Grid Enabled Measures (or GEM) initiative. The GEM database col-lects questions that measure unmet needs, depression, and anxiety. These are avail-able for clinicians and researchers to access, evaluate, and (with the exception of copyrighted instruments) be used to care for patients under active treatment and other cancer survivors. NCI is initiating collaborations with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Commission on Cancer. In 2012, the Commis-sion gave member sites until 2015 to implement psychosocial distress screening in their centers. NIMH has funded several studies in recent years investigating psychological dis- tress and depression associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment. For example, NIMH has supported the development of the Mental Health Assessment and Dy-namic Referral for Oncology software, which enables oncology treatment providers to screen for and monitor several patient care domains, including: (1) mental health functioning; (2) cancer-related symptoms and side effects; (3) the patient-provider partnership; (4) barriers to treatment; and (5) adherence with medical regimen and lifestyle change recommendations. Another team of NIMH-funded researchers has studied whether depression can be prevented in patients with head and neck cancer during treatment (with relevance to other cancers), as well as whether initiating prophylactic antidepressant treatment can improve timely completion of the cancer therapy and preserve quality of life. Other NIMH-funded researchers have studied the impact of cancer treatment, as opposed to diagnosis, on mental health\u2014for ex-ample, whether antidepressants can prevent the impact of melanoma treatment on the brain, endocrine, and immune systems. In addition to these extramural efforts, the NIMH Division of Intramural Re- search Programs conducted a multiyear study investigating biological, psychological, and social factors that affect living with a chronic life-threatening illness such as cancer, HIV, or other rare diseases, as well as suicide risk and palliative care deci-sionmaking procedures for treating children and adolescents with life-threatening conditions. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD J. D URBIN AMERICAN CURES ACT Question. In 1965, the U.S. spent more than 25 percent of our non-defense discre- tionary budget on research and development\u2014last year that number was 10 per-cent. Between 2003 and 2012, the NIH budget has not even kept up with inflation, resulting instead in a 22 percent decline in real purchasing power. The number of research grants at NIH has declined every year for the past 10 years. Dr. Collins, you have warned that continuing this trend of funding will cause some of America's best young researchers to take their talents to other industries\u2014 or other countries. What promising breakthroughs or developments do you think are at risk of delay due to the U.S. Federal Government failing to keep pace with inflation in funding the NIH? Answer. NIH-supported researchers make scientific discoveries every day, advanc- ing research related to countless health and disease issues. While it is impossible to predict exactly when breakthroughs will occur in a particular scientific field, the pace of discovery will be delayed if funding fails to keep pace with inflation. For ex-ample, this could cause delays in the significant progress that researchers are mak-ing in developing a universal flu vaccine that could offer protection against any flu virus strain, including those that may cause pandemics. Similarly, NIH efforts to develop a vaccine for HIV or even a cure for AIDS may be hampered. In cancer research, recent results indicate that immunotherapy may be a new and effective form of treatment. However, opportunities to expand this research to in-100 1http://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2014/03/05/comparing-success-award-funding-rates/ #sthash.aM0tN2GL.dpuf 2NIH's definition of ''award rate'' is the number of awards made in a fiscal year divided by the absolute number of applications. clude additional patients and other types of cancer may not be possible if NIH fund- ing remains stagnant. NIH also is engaged in extensive efforts to respond to the emerging public health threat from antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including sup-port for basic research, development of new and faster diagnostics, and creating a national database of genomic sequence data. These efforts could be hampered if NIH funding does not keep pace with inflation. NIH efforts to leverage its resources in partnerships with the private sector also could be disrupted, such as the new Accel-erating Medicines Partnership (AMP) that brings biopharmaceutical companies and several nonprofit organizations together with NIH to identify and validate biological targets of disease for future drug development. Please describe the biomedical discoveries, training of junior scientists, and eco- nomic benefits that could result if NIH was provided with a steady source of funding that increased year after year to keep up with inflation? Answer. A steady source of funding helps support biomedical scientists. Having a budget that keeps pace with inflation would help to reassure scientists that they will have the necessary support for the duration of their projects. Steady investment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) helps enable our researchers to achieve their full scientific potential in all research areas, fueling biomedical discoveries from autism to Alzheimer's disease to cancer to diabetes. Inflation-adjusted budgets also may enable NIH to award more grants to fund investigator-initiated research, thereby allowing the country's most innovative scientific thinkers to chart the best path forward in their research areas. Promising young scientists who have chosen career paths outside of biomedical re- search in recent years due to uncertain funding also would be encouraged by a sta-ble funding model and may reconsider pursuing research careers. Coupled with NIH's commitment to fund new investigators at success rates equal to those of es-tablished investigators, this scenario would enable NIH to attract and sustain a tal-ented biomedical research workforce. NIH investments reap substantial economic benefits; the agency directly supports about 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 institutions in every state, and these investments spur additional job creation in those communities as well. In 2012, United for Medical Research estimated that NIH investments supported more than 402,000 jobs and resulted in $57.8 billion in economic output nationwide. A report from the Milken Institute indicates that a $1 increase in NIH funding can increase the bioscience industry output by $1.70 in a given year, and the long-term effects could be even greater. Given these short-term economic effects, an inflation-adjusted budget for NIH could spur job growth across the country, increase economic output, and reduce health spending by producing better, more cost-effective treatments and prevention strategies. Over the long term, increased support for NIH will lead to reductions in disease, longer lifespans, and improved quality of life for all Ameri-cans. SEQUESTRATION AND GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN Question. The National Institutes of Health is the Nation's medical research agen- cy and the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world. More than 80 per-cent of the NIH's budget goes to over 300,000 research personnel at more than 2,500 universities and research institutions through the United States. Last year, seques-tration cut the NIH's $30.7 billion budget by almost $1.6 billion. The deleterious ef-fects of sequestration were compounded by the government shutdown which took place October 1 to October 16 of 2013 and temporarily curtailed most of NIH's oper-ations. Please summarize the impact that sequestration and the government shutdown had on NIH's ability to award grants and support the training and education of sci-entists. Please describe the impact that sequestration and the government shutdown had on biomedical innovation and how the cuts in funding impacted patients cur-rently enrolled in clinical trials. Impact of Sequestration Answer. Sequestration dampened NIH's ability to support biomedical research. The overall award rate for NIH research project grant applications in fiscal year 2013 fell to approximately 15 percent, a historic low. 12Compared to fiscal year 2012, in fiscal year 2013, NIH funded approximately 750 fewer competitive research project grants (e.g., new or renewal applications) that were determined to be highly 101 3Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and The Science Coalition. Survey on Sequestration Effects: Selected Results from Private and Pub-lic Research Universities. November 2013. meritorious in grant review, including over 200 fewer competing renewal applica- tions. Competing renewal applications represent promising follow-on research stem-ming from previously funded grants. Lack of continued funding diminishes the NIH's ability to leverage previous investments and capitalize on recent scientific progress. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) were also forced to reduce funding for non- competing, ongoing research grants. Reductions varied by IC, but the NIH-wide av-erage was \u00a54.7 percent. Further, at least ten new funding initiatives (''request for applications'' or ''request for proposals'' concepts) were planned but not published, including cancer studies that could have improved our ability to distinguish accu-rately non-lethal tumors from life-threatening ones, and autism studies to inves-tigate genetic and environmental factors that affect the risk of autism in preterm infants. Many of the NIH ICs also reduced their funding for training grants and fellow- ships. For example NIGMS, which sponsors the majority of NIH-supported pre-doc-toral trainees, funded 186 fewer trainees than it would have without sequestration. Trainees who were already funded also were affected, as there was no increase in stipend levels for National Research Service Award recipients in fiscal year 2013. Sequestration also diminished NIH's ability to conduct research at the Clinical Center. Approximately 750 fewer new patients were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center, a decrease from 10,695 new patients in 2012 to approximately 9,945 new patients in 2013. This reduced the number of patients who could have benefitted from enrollment in clinical protocols, as well as slowed the pace of important clinical research. Note that while much of the decrease in enrollment numbers is due to funding, patient recruitment is dependent on multiple factors. Funding cuts driven by sequestration have had ripple effects throughout the bio- medical research community. One recent survey examined sequestration's impact on research conducted by universities across the country. 3The most commonly cited impacts of the sequester among survey respondents were a reduction in the number of new Federal research grants (70 percent of responding universities), delayed re-search projects (also 70 percent), personnel reductions (58 percent), reduced re-search activity (81 percent), admission of fewer graduate students (23 percent), as well as tuition reductions and reduced stipend levels for students (14 percent). Impact of Government Shutdown The Government shutdown impacted NIH and the biomedical research commu- nity. Approximately 75 percent of the NIH workforce was furloughed during shut- down. For the community of NIH's extramural investigators, shutdown caused delays in grant review and funding processes. Typically, NIH receives the largest number of grant applications in October. Because of the prolonged shutdown, all of the October receipt dates were rescheduled for November, including those for NIH's largest grant activities, such as the investigator initiated R01 applications, Small Grants (R03), Exploratory Development Grants (R21), AREA awards (R15), and Ca-reer Development (K) activities. Reviews of more than 11,000 grant applications were delayed by the shutdown. October is also one of the 3 months with the largest volume of NIH Scientific Re- view Group meetings, the first step of peer review. Over 200 Scientific Review Group meetings had to be rescheduled due to the shutdown; most of the October meetings involved reviewers travelling to meetings scheduled to be convened ''in- person''. These ''in-person'' meetings had to be rescheduled, and travel arrangements had to be cancelled and re-arranged. The NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) was also profoundly affected and lost progress during the shutdown. The Clinical Center did not enroll any new pa-tients in clinical trials or to start new trials. Therefore, approximately 200 new pa-tients were not admitted to the Clinical Center. Of those denied access, 30 were children, including 10 with cancer. Only 15 to 20 percent of IRP staff were ''ex-cepted'' from furlough, so that they could protect life (mostly in the Clinical Center, where 75 percent of the staff were required to work), guarantee safety (infrastruc-ture support including security and the power plant), and protect large investments in materials and property (animals, cell cultures, and expensive equipment). The shutdown took a toll on NIH intramural training programs and trainees, too. In addition to being a biomedical research enterprise, NIH is the largest training facility in the world for biomedical researchers. During the shutdown, there were approximately 4,000 postdoctoral fellows, 800 post baccalaureate students, 500 grad-102 uate students, and 45 medical students who were unable to conduct their research. For many of these trainees, time is of the essence. Their appointments are time- limited (less than 1 year for the medical students, up to 2 years for the post bacca-laureate students, and usually three to 4 years for the postdoctoral fellows and graduate students). Loss of a few weeks of research and mentoring as well as the additional work time needed to regain momentum\u2014while cell lines are started up again, animals are bred, and experiments that may have suffered in the shutdown are repeated\u2014represent a significant proportion of their NIH training experience that could affect their future careers. CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE Question. Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the most prevalent birth de- fects in the United States and a leading cause of birth defect-associated infant mor-tality. Due to medical advancements, more people with congenital heart defects are living into adulthood. The healthcare reform law includes a provision that authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to expand surveillance and track the epide-miology of CHD across the life-course, with an emphasis on adults. The Consoli-dated Appropriations Act of 2014 provided the CDC with $2.9 million in new fund-ing for enhanced CHD surveillance. Recent data suggest that the number of infant deaths related to CHD is decreasing. Successful interventions in infancy and child-hood are resulting in an aging population of congenital heart disease survivors. How is the NIH systematically responding to this new population of survivors reaching adolescence, adulthood, and advanced age? How is NIH utilizing adult congenital heart disease research experts in these ef- forts? How is NIH supporting adult CHD professionals so the field can grow? Is the NIH offering training grants to grow the field? Is the Pediatric Heart Network inclusive to adult CHD experts? Is your agency formally engaging adult populations in CHD research? Answer. Advances in diagnosis and care have led to significant improvement in survival rates for Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) such that more adults than chil-dren are now living with CHD. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) supports research on the causes of CHD and the evolving natural history and co-morbidities in adults with CHD across the lifespan. For example, the Bench to Bassinet Program (B2B) is identifying genetic and epigenetic causes of CHD to help risk-stratify and personalize treatment for children and adults with CHD. The Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) was launched in 2001 to conduct studies to improve outcomes and quality of life in children with heart disease and includes experts in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD). The PHN is following the largest assembled cohort of individuals with single ventricle physiology into adulthood to determine barriers to transitioning to adult care and to evaluate their health status and co- morbid conditions at specific intervals. The PHN is also in the process of launching a trial in adolescents and young adults with single ventricle physiology to assess whether use of a phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor medication will prevent functional deterioration and delay the onset of heart failure. NHLBI also partners with ACHD-themed organizations to advance the field of ACHD research, such as The Health, Education and Access Research Trial (HEART-ACHD) and The Research Empowerment for Adult Congenital Hearts (REACH) project, both funded by NHLBI and conducted in partnership with the Adult Congenital Heart Association (ACHA) and the Alliance of Adult Research in Congenital Cardiology (AARCC). In June 2014, NHLBI and the ACHA will host a working group, ''Adult Congenital Heart Disease: Emerging Research Questions,'' to identify critical research gaps in the care of adults with CHD. This group will build partnerships between ACHD experts and experts in the complementary fields of adult cardiovascular care and pediatric cardiology. Participants will develop meth-odological approaches that leverage recent progress in multicenter ACHD research and existing congenital heart disease data infrastructure, and will develop strate-gies to engage patients in the development and execution of research studies. To ensure a robust community of ACHD investigators spanning basic and clinical research, NHLBI supports institutional training grants for CHD, the PHN Scholars award, to fund small pilot studies, and individual career development awards for ACHD investigators For example, an NHLBI-supported career development awardee is developing, testing, and validating a Quality Assessment Tool for Adults with Congenital Heart Disease (QAT-ACHD) for the outpatient management of selected ACHD conditions to help standardize high-quality ACHD care. Another NHLBI ca-reer development awardee is studying the role of myocardial fibrosis in three ACHD 103 conditions. The same investigator has also secured funding from the Eunice Ken- nedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) for a pilot study on enlarged thoracic aortas in patients with bicuspid aortic valve. Mechanisms such as these are designed to ensure growing expertise in the field of ACHD research, with a strong focus on the long-term implications of CHD and its treatment for the increasing number of persons who survive for many decades after diagnosis. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN OPPNET Question. Can you provide an update about OppNet, the 5-year initiative to sup- port basic behavioral and social sciences research that began in 2010? What can you tell us about the findings of that initiative? When will a report be available? Answer. Between October 2010 and May 2014, the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) provided $64.2 million to fund 152 extra-mural research projects. OppNet lists all its grants by original year of funding at http://oppnet.nih.gov/resources-initiatives.asp. Among the OppNet grants is early in-vestigator Dr. Santosh Kumar's Predicting Smoking Abstinence via Mobile Moni- toring of Stress and Social Context. This study demonstrates that modern sensor technology can obtain a much more detailed and accurate representation of personal and environmental influences on smoking than previously possible. Based partially on this work, Popular Science magazine named Dr. Kumar one of the 10 most bril-liant young scientists. Another project, Neural Mechanisms of Habit Formation and Maintenance, analyzes cellular, molecular, and circuit mechanisms to understand how behaviors become ''automatic'' regardless of outside influences. Dr. Henry Yin found that stimulating mouse neurons to generate dopamine can foster the adoption of healthy behaviors and reduce unhealthy behaviors\u2014all without providing incen-tives (e.g., food rewards). These findings, already appearing in at least five peer-re-viewed publications, suggest exciting possibilities for future studies with important clinical implications. OppNet has expanded both the perspective of researchers and NIH program direc- tors. Nineteen of OppNet's 28 new investigators (68 percent) received non-Federal funding prior to applying, compared with 21 percent of basic behavioral and social sciences research (basic-BSSR) and 39 percent of applied behavioral and social sciences research (applied-BSSR)\u2014an example of the initiative's success at expand-ing NIH's scope of basic-BSSR. NIH program directors report that OppNet has in-creased their knowledge of other NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs)' missions and re-search interests and that OppNet has allowed them to solicit and fund projects that likely could not have occurred without OppNet's infrastructure. Perhaps the best ex-amples to date are the grants funded through the funding opportunity, Basic Behav-ioral Research on Multisensory Processing http://oppnet.nih.gov/resources- 2013fundedapp.asp. These projects explain a visual, auditory, ol-factory, gustatory, non-pain somatosensory, and/or vestibular input influences basic perceptual and behavioral processes. This initiative stimulated new collaborations between ICs that were supporting research on sensory processing, but from the per-spective of single sensory systems, such as vision or audition. ICs are organized somatically or by disease. OppNet's infrastructure facilitates the trans-sensory and transdisciplinary research projects that likely would lack a clear ''home.'' Moreover, OppNet has been so successful at coordinating basic and applied BSSR across the NIH that some ICs decided to fund all or part of 23 addi-tional projects beyond what was planned for in the OppNet budget. As the grants funded under OppNet have not gone through a full five-year funding cycle, a formal and comprehensive program evaluation would be premature at this time. However, OppNet makes its activities and accomplishments available to the public through its Web site at http://oppnet.nih.gov/. DIABETES Question. I understand that, as a result of previous studies, there is evidence of a link between poor blood glucose control and development of diabetes complica-tions, and the tremendous long-term benefits of early, effective blood glucose control, particularly in recent onset diabetes. Can you tell me what the agency is doing to better understand the underpinnings of complications like kidney disease? Answer. Controlling and preventing diabetes are the best approaches to pre- venting or minimizing its many health complications, including kidney disease. Dia-betes\u2014both type 1 and type 2\u2014is the major cause of end-stage kidney failure. The 104 landmark NIH-supported Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and its follow-up study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC), demonstrated how critically important it is to control blood glucose levels early in the course of type 1 diabetes in order to reduce the likelihood of subsequent complications. DCCT participants who intensively controlled their blood glucose lev-els had significantly lower rates of eye, nerve, kidney, and cardiovascular complica-tions than those who received standard care. This effect extended for many years after the study ended. A second landmark NIH-supported clinical trial, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), showed that an intensive lifestyle intervention designed to achieve modest weight loss through a combination of diet and exercise lowered type 2 diabetes rates by 58 percent, and that the generic diabetes medication metformin reduced diabetes rates by 31 percent, relative to placebo. A follow-up study to the DPP, the DPP Out-comes Study (DPPOS), is assessing the long-term effects of interventions used in the DPP on the development of type 2 diabetes and its complications. After 10 years of follow-up, DPPOS found that the lifestyle intervention continued to dramatically reduce the development of type 2 diabetes\u2014and consequently its complications\u2014and also reduced cardiovascular risk factors. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease, followed by high blood pressure. Abnormally high blood glucose levels damage the kidney's filtering units, which pro-gressively and irreversibly impairs kidney function. Thanks to NIH-supported re-search, scientists have made great progress in developing methods, in addition to controlling blood glucose levels, which slow the onset and progression of kidney dis-ease in people with diabetes. Two types of drugs used to lower blood pressure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes or high blood pressure. Because there is no way, at present, to restore kidney function once it is lost, NIH research focuses on early detection of kidney disease and strategies to slow or pre-vent the progression of disease. The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, one of the largest and longest ongoing studies of chronic kidney disease epi-demiology in the United States, is examining the natural history of kidney disease as well as the broad range of illnesses experienced by people with kidney disease. NIH is supporting a study that aims to identify biomarkers that indicate a risk of progression of kidney disease. Research supported by NIH has enhanced our under-standing of the origin of scar tissue that is common in many forms of kidney dis-ease, how it can impair kidney function, and how it might be prevented or treated. A new initiative, currently in development, will address challenges associated with growing nephrons, the kidneys' basic filtering unit. NIH supports several studies that the private sector most likely would not undertake, including pilot studies of novel therapies for kidney disease. EMERGENCY CARE Question. The NIH recently created a new division, the Office of Emergency Care Research. Considering that in New Hampshire, and throughout the United States, there is an epidemic of narcotic prescription abuse and overdose deaths, what can the this new office do to help emergency providers curtail excess narcotic pre-scribing? How can we increase awareness among providers to decrease medically unnecessary narcotic prescriptions? Answer. The Office of Emergency Care Research (OECR) was established in 2012 to coordinate and develop emergency care research across the National Institutes of Health. Emergency departments (EDs) are unique treatment settings in that they serve some patient populations that have little or no access to medical care, and who have few available resources. For example, EDs may be the only facilities at which poor and underserved populations receive care. For substance-using popu-lations, they provide a unique opportunity to assess the overall health needs of the patient and link them to the care and the support required to meet all of their health needs. OECR and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) are con-cerned about the epidemic of narcotic abuse and are aware of the role of the emer-gency care system in reducing this abuse. NIDA is investing in research to develop clinical interventions tailored to the ED setting. The goals of these interventions are to facilitate accurate diagnoses and linkage to long-term care programs to protect the overall health of the individual. Halting accidental or unnecessary opioid prescriptions is a key component to thwart-ing the devastating rise in opioid overdoses. For this reason, NIDA is supporting research that will increase ED physician knowledge when treating opioid patients by: 105 \u2014identifying ways to effectively implement the use of prescription drug moni- toring programs (PDMPs) within the ED to decrease prescription opioid pre-scribing, overdoses, and deaths. Widespread use of PDMPs will provide ED phy-sicians with the information they need to prescribe opioids to those patients who would benefit most from these essential medications, while preventing these medications from reaching populations for which they are not intended. (For more details see NIH grant 1R01DA036522-01.) \u2014developing improved, non-invasive devices that can detect traces of narcotics and alcohol. This will help ED physicians to diagnose and treat patients with substance abuse issues, because an accurate diagnosis of substance abuse is the first step to its treatment. (For more details see NIH grant 5R44DA031530-03.) Since assuming the position of Director of OECR, Dr. Jeremy Brown has met with program officers and senior staff at NIDA to discuss strategies to increase research on drug abuse in the emergency care setting. In addition, in October 2013, OECR, CDC, and NIDA staff were scheduled to attend a special day training session on effective approaches to addressing substance abuse disorders in the Emergency De-partment. This conference was held as part of the annual meeting of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Although the Government shutdown prevented NIH staff from attending in person, this meeting emphasizes the way in which NIDA, OECR and professional organizations are cooperating to address the sub-stance abuse epidemic. Funding for research on the narcotic epidemic is provided by NIDA, and the Office of Emergency Care Research will continue to work with staff from NIDA to support and grow initiatives in this area. ASTHMA Question. In November Congresswoman DeLauro and I wrote to Secretary Sebelius to inquire about a provision in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-tute's (NHLBI) 2007 Expert Panel Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma that recommends that physicians who treat the majority of children with asthma ''determine exposures, history of symptoms in presence of exposures, and sensitivities.'' They make this recommendation so that ''physicians can advise pa-tients on ways to reduce exposure to allergens.'' While it has been many years since release of the guidelines, we are concerned that we are failing to meet this objective. I'd like your assurance that this work will remain a high priority for the NIH and that you will continue to work with all stakeholders to accelerate implementation of this laudable objective. Answer. NHLBI's National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's (NAEPP) Guidelines Implementation Panel Report offers suggested strategies to enhance dis-semination and adoption of key recommendations in the Guidelines. These strate-gies were offered as a list of possible activities for NAEPP member organizations and other professional, private sector, state and local government, and patient groups to consider undertaking within their respective organizations in order to im-prove asthma care, which many organizations have done. All programs address ex-posures to environmental allergens and irritants as part of the comprehensive ap-proach to asthma necessary to achieve and maintain asthma control. National professional societies and patient groups and local healthcare and com- munity groups have made considerable progress in engaging primary care providers, allergists, and representatives of health plans to identify and overcome local bar-riers and accelerate implementation of recommendations in the Guidelines, includ-ing those relating to control of allergens. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Health Care Innovation Awards Program included five awardees that address asthma; all of these programs incorporate attention to environmental allergens. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) vibrant Community Net-work (http://www.asthmacommunitynetwork.org/) and annual EPA leadership Awards program offer outstanding examples of community organizations, clinicians, and healthcare administrators, including Medicaid service providers, across the country working together on programs that incorporate measures to control environ-mental asthma triggers, including allergens, into comprehensive asthma manage-ment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Program and the NHLBI's National Asthma Control Initiative showcase tools and programs developed by state public health and local community clinics that can be adapted by other stakeholders. These tools include home-visit guides, environmental assess-ment checklists, and clinical pathways for assessing, treating, and monitoring all as-pects of asthma care. 106 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JERRY MORAN ACCELERATING MEDICINES PARTNERSHIP Question. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) is expected to address the ''valley of death'' in drug development. How much with the Partnership shorten the current drug development timeline and how much money will be saved? If the Accelerating Medicines Partnership is successful, how will you determine what future disease and conditions will be added to the program? Answer. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) is a unique type of public- private partnership of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), nonprofit organizations, and biopharmaceutical companies. AMP is supporting research focused on identifying and validating biological targets for new therapeutics, a process called target validation. AMP was just launched in February and is beginning with three specific pilot projects, in Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis/lupus. Over half of drugs fail in phase II and phase III clinical trials due to lack of effi- cacy, and improvements in the target validation process should reduce that failure rate. So while AMP may not affect the development timeline for a particular drug, it should increase the success rates of trials by increasing the chances that a par-ticular drug will be effective. If AMP succeeds in validating a drug target for a par-ticular disease, that could reduce drug development costs in that area, since compa-nies should be less likely to conduct costly clinical trials with compounds that will fail in phase II or III because the targets of those compounds don't have the desired effect on the particular disease. The AMP partners intend to consider other project ideas later this year. As in the selection of the pilot projects, the AMP partners would need to agree that there is a scientific opportunity in target validation in a particular disease area with these characteristics: the research project would be amenable to a public-private partner-ship with joint scientific planning and governance; data would be shared broadly and not be patented; and industry or research foundations would be willing to com-mit substantial financial and other support. The Foundation for the NIH has a project proposal form on its Web site at http://fnih.org/work/key-initiatives-0/accel-erating-medicines-partnership to guide interested parties in developing project pro-posals for the AMP members to consider, and the AMP partners will also continue identifying and exploring their own areas of mutual scientific interest. DARPA -LIKE PROGRAM Question. I am concerned that researchers are now reluctant to take risks because of their concern that their research efforts will not be supported. How will NIH's new DARPA-like program address this concern? The new DARPA-like Program is funded at $30 million and would support high risk, goal-driven activities aimed to achieve rapid technology development. While I support this type of research, I am concerned that the funding for the new program is coming from another program that supports exceptionally creative scientists pro-posing innovative and transformative research\u2014High-Risk High-Reward Research. The High-Risk High-Reward Research program's funding is reduced by $21.8 mil-lion. If funding ''maverick'' science is a priority for NIH, why does the budget cut one high risk research program's funding to start a new one? The Guardian ran a letter in March from a group of prominent researchers pro- moting additional funding to support scientific mavericks. The letter stated, ''Agen-cies claiming to support blue-skies research use peer review, of course, discouraging open-ended inquiries and serious challenges to prevailing orthodoxies.'' In a time when budget resources are constrained, how do you balance funding for high-risk research projects with peer-reviewed science? Answer. Scientific progress often advances by building incrementally upon a strong foundation of previous research and preliminary data. However, rapid ad-vances in progress may require approaches that foster innovation and risk taking. For certain objectives, where research teams need to be actively managed to achieve defined, high-risk goals so that new expertise can be added as initial high-risk at-tempts fail or as new discoveries are made, the DARPA-like Other Transaction Au-thority (OTA) provided to the Common Fund can be very helpful. The NIH Common Fund's Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program will use the OTA to support a high-risk, goal-driven endeavor to develop proof of concept for an entirely new class of neural control devices that have the potential to pre-cisely treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions. Neuromodulation to control end-organ system function has been recognized as a potentially powerful way to treat many diseases and conditions, such as hypertension and heart failure, gastro-107 intestinal disorders, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders. However, the mecha- nisms of action for neuromodulation therapies are poorly understood. The SPARC program will support interdisciplinary teams of investigators to deliver neural cir-cuit maps of several organ systems, novel electrode designs, minimally invasive sur-gical procedures, and stimulation protocols, driven by an end goal to develop new neuromodulation therapies. The program is expected to be iterative and dynamic, with the novel technologies informing mapping efforts, and mapping results defining new technology requirements. Rapid progress in this nascent field requires high lev-els of innovation and risk taking as well as aggressive project management to achieve these ambitious goals and capitalize on the therapeutic promise of this emerging research area. In addition to the SPARC program, several other initiatives within the Common Fund specifically support high-risk research. The High-Risk High-Reward program, which includes the Pioneer, New Innovator, Transformative Research, and Early Independence Awards, supports exceptionally creative scientists to undertake bold and innovative research projects in any scientific area relevant to the NIH mission. For these projects, NIH has no pre-defined objective other than to foster innovative, exceptionally high-impact research through investigator-initiated projects. There-fore, for these projects, a grant mechanism, rather than the OTA mechanism, is most useful. Although Common Fund support for the High-Risk High-Reward pro-gram decreases in fiscal year 2015, the successful track record of the High-Risk High-Reward program has moved NIH's Institutes and Centers to increase their support of these awards, providing additional funding beyond the Common Fund in-vestment. All NIH-supported research, including programs designed to support high-risk re- search, undergoes a rigorous peer-review process to identify the most scientifically meritorious projects. Programs designed to support high-risk research may empha-size different criteria during peer review compared to more traditional grant mecha-nisms, weighting innovation and potential impact more heavily than feasibility and preliminary data. Highly innovative ''blue skies'' research and peer review are not mutually exclusive. Although the specific review processes for SPARC and other OTA programs may be different from grant or contract reviews, external input will still be sought to help guide the decisionmaking process. The question of how to balance funding for high-risk research with research that is more grounded by preliminary data is perennial, and the answer varies across the NIH as scientific opportunities and challenges vary between fields of research. However, risk tolerance is a founding principle of the NIH Common Fund so that innovative solutions to the most pressing challenges may be reached. CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE AWARDS Question. How has NCATS implemented the Institute of Medicine's Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) recommendations and how do you see the pro-gram growing over the next several years? Answer. In June 2013, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report following a review of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program. The re-port recommended that the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) take a more active role in the program's governance and direction, for-malize the evaluation processes of the program, advance innovation in education and training programs, and ensure community engagement in all phases of re-search. NCATS leadership is committed to implementing the recommendations of the IOM report. As a first step, NCATS has increased the programmatic and fiscal man-agement of the grants that support this program and streamlined the way the con-sortium is governed, consulting closely with the CTSA Principal Investigators (PIs). For example, we have appointed a new steering committee that includes 12 CTSA PIs with staggered terms to replace the previous 90-member group. In parallel, NCATS assembled a Working Group of its Advisory Council to provide advice on measurable objectives for the CTSA program. The group was tasked with developing clear, measurable goals and objectives for the program that address crit-ical issues across the full spectrum of clinical and translational research (i.e. ''what does success look like?''). The Working Group presented its report (http:// www.ncats.nih.gov/files/CTSA-IOM-WG-Draft-Report.pdf) at the NCATS Advisory Council meeting in May. Its report addressed four of the seven recommendations in the IOM report and focused on: (1) translational workforce development, (2) engage-ment and collaboration with patients and communities, (3) integration of translational science across its multiple phases and disciplines within complex popu-lations and across the individual lifespan, and (4) systemic improvements in meth-108 ods and processes of translation. The measurable goals and outcomes in this report are serving as a guide for NCATS as it moves forward in developing and imple-menting strategies to strengthen the CTSA program and for measuring progress. NCATS recently announced the selection of Petra Kaufmann, M.D., M.Sc., to head the NCATS Division of Clinical Innovation, which includes the CTSA program. Dr. Kaufmann served as Director of the Office of Clinical Research at NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and brings a wealth of ex-pertise across the translational sciences spectrum. With the appointment of a permanent Director for the program, the recommenda- tions of the IOM report, and the results of deliberations by the Advisory Council and its working group, NCATS is poised to work closely with the CTSA community to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the process of translation from sci-entific discovery through clinical research to improved health outcomes. BRAIN RESEARCH THROUGH APPLICATION OF INNOVATIVE NEUROTECHNOLOGIES Question. We discussed the Brain Research through Application of Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative at last year's budget hearing. This is an excit-ing proposal that could revolutionize the field of neuroscience and advance therapies for numerous diseases, including Alzheimer's. The subcommittee provided funding for this initiative in fiscal year 2014 and requested a report on the goals, objectives, budget, and timeline for the BRAIN Initiative. Could you elaborate on the commit-ment we are undertaking and provide specific details on what the 10 year budget picture may entail? Answer. NIH charged a high-level working group of the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) to develop a rigorous plan for the Initiative that includes sci-entific milestones and budgetary projections (roster at http://www.nih.gov/science/ brain/acd-roster.pdf). This working group comprised visionary leaders across neuro-science disciplines that were expertly positioned to delineate bold, yet achievable, multi-year timetables, milestones, and cost estimates. Over the last year, the work-ing group met with the scientific community, patient advocates, and the general public to ensure its plan would be sufficiently informed by stakeholder input. The working group delivered its final report for consideration by the ACD at its June 5-6 meeting. The scientific vision outlined in this report was unanimously sup-ported by the Committee and subsequently endorsed by the NIH Director. In its findings, the group emphasized that the NIH efforts on the BRAIN Initiative should seek to map the circuits of the brain, measure the fluctuating patterns of electrical and chemical activity flowing within those circuits, and understand how their inter-play creates our unique cognitive and behavioral capabilities. The following seven scientific goals were identified as high priorities for achieving this vision: 1. Identify and provide experimental access to the different brain cell types to determine their roles in health and disease. 2. Generate circuit diagrams that vary in resolution from synapses to the whole brain. 3. Produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain by developing and ap- plying improved methods for large-scale monitoring of neural activity. 4. Link brain activity to behavior with precise interventional tools that change neural circuit dynamics. 5. Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental process through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools. 6. Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks. 7. Integrate new technological and conceptual approaches produces in Goals 1-6 to discover how dynamic patters of neural activity are transformed into cog-nition, emotion, perception, and action in health and disease. These scientific goals will be maximized through seven core principles: 1. Pursue human studies and non-human models in parallel. 2. Cross boundaries in interdisciplinary collaborations. 3. Integrate spatial and temporal scales. 4. Establish platforms for preserving and sharing data. 5. Validate and disseminate technology. 6. Consider ethical implications of neuroscience research. 7. Create mechanisms to ensure accountability to NIH, the taxpayer, and the community of basic, translational, and clinical neuroscientists. The first year of the BRAIN Initiative, fiscal year 2014, was seeded by a $40 mil- lion commitment from NIH. The President has requested $100 million in his fiscal year 2015 budget for the second year of the Initiative. For the remaining years, the working group suggests an investment ramping up to $400 million a year for fiscal 109 years 2016-2020 to focus on technology development and validation. They called for $500 million a year for years 2021-2025 to focus increasingly on the application of those technologies in an integrated fashion to make fundamental new discoveries about the brain. The working group emphasized that its cost estimates, which are provisional, assume that the budget for the BRAIN Initiative will supplement\u2014not supplant\u2014NIH's existing investment in the broader spectrum of basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience research. A full copy of the report can be found at http://www.nih.gov/science/brain/2025/ index.htm. ALZHEIMER 'S FUNDING Question. Historically, NIH has opposed disease specific funding to allow research, not politics, to drive scientific funding decisions. However, this appears to cause a chicken and egg scenario. It is difficult for scientists to propose Alzheimer's research when there is not a robust funding stream to support their work, yet there is not a robust funding stream because scientists may not be proposing Alzheimer's re-search projects. So which comes first? The dedicated funding stream or the research ideas? Answer. NIH develops targeted funding initiatives to address areas of scientific need and opportunity as identified by program staff in consultation with experts in the scientific community. The resulting initiatives are strategically deployed to make every dollar count by establishing priorities, setting goals that are both ambi-tious and realistic, and identifying the most promising opportunities for progress through careful planning, coordination, and resource allocation. Although these targeted initiatives have enabled us to support a number of groundbreaking projects, it is important to note that the bulk of NIH's funding, in Alzheimer's disease and elsewhere, goes to investigator-initiated proposals\u2014that is, proposals that are not developed in response to a specific funding initiative. For ex- ample, in fiscal year 2013, fewer than 10 percent of NIH's Alzheimer's-related re-search project grants were awarded under an Alzheimer's-specific funding oppor-tunity announcement (FOA). The majority of Alzheimer's-related studies were either awarded under a more general neuroscience-focused FOA or an FOA in a related area, or were truly investigator-initiated studies reflecting the creativity and inno-vation of researchers seeking to build on scientific advances or offering new ways of thinking about the disease. The importance of Alzheimer's disease research within the overall NIH research portfolio continues to be reflected in our strategic planning process and scientific funding initiatives. Our Alzheimer's-related funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) are carefully developed to advance the field consistent with the priorities es-tablished under the National Action Plan for Alzheimer's Disease and the 2012 Alz-heimer's Disease Research Summit. In addition, in the past 5 years NIH has re-leased over 40 FOAs directly relevant to Alzheimer's, and the response to each of these has been robust. In fact, each year we receive many more applications for meritorious research in Alzheimer's disease than we are able to fund. Question. How do you prioritize funding for a disease when you know, as in the case of Alzheimer's disease, that the disease burden is only going to increase over the next 20 years? Answer. Priority-setting processes at both the NIH and individual Institute levels are designed to maintain a balance among a wide array of diverse and compelling priorities, based on close monitoring of the scientific and medical landscapes by ex-pert program staff and outside advisors. This enables us to use our funds efficiently and effectively in order to have the optimal impact both on the scientific field and on the public health. Alzheimer's disease is one such high-priority research area. Our planning, priority-setting, and funding initiatives fully take into account the projected increase in disease burden in this area. The NIH Director is responsible for program coordination across the NIH Insti- tutes and Centers (ICs) and for ensuring a balanced overall research portfolio. In turn, each IC has a process for establishing research and funding priorities based on its specific mission and the long-term research goals articulated within relevant strategic plans. These priorities are reflected in the ICs' plans to distribute re-sources. To ensure that these priorities are harmonized with the wider NIH mission, the NIH Director provides centralized coordination and communication across NIH. During biweekly meetings with the IC Directors, the NIH Director considers the en-tire biomedical research landscape and discusses with his colleagues ways that NIH can be most effective with its investments. They hear from innovative scientists 110 about cutting-edge results and deliberate potential new initiatives that could signifi- cantly advance the science in a particular field. NIH receives input from many sources when setting research and funding prior- ities for Alzheimer's. In addition to scientific workshops, international conferences, and other interactions with the scientific community, these sources include the Na-tional Advisory Council on Aging and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, established under the 2011 National Alzheimer's Project Act. In addition, input from the 2012 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit and the 2013 workshop on Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias has been instrumental in fa-cilitating the development of our Alzheimer's research agenda. QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR THAD COCHRAN JACKSON HEART STUDY Question. Dr. Collins, the Jackson Heart Study, located in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest-ever investigation of cardiovascular disease in African Americans. In the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's congressional budget justification for this year, one of your focuses is on preventing and pre-empting chronic heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders. Can you tell me how the Jackson Heart Study's recent collaboration with the Framingham Heart Study can be leveraged to specifically ad-dress this particular theme? Answer. Since it began in 1998, the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) has provided ex- tensive information on the causes of cardiovascular disease in African Americans. JHS is also one of the largest studies of the genetic factors that affect high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other diseases that disproportionately affect African Americans. A recent JHS-related paper, for example, showed that the gene APOL1, which is known to contribute to chronic kidney disease, was found to also increase risk of cardiovascular disease in African Americans. Genetic analyses such as this provide promise for targeted therapies that can pre-empt disease. In August 2013, NHLBI contracts supporting the JHS were renewed for another 5 years. A new collaborative research relationship has been established between the Amer- ican Heart Association (AHA) and the University of Mississippi and Boston Univer-sity, the academic coordinating center homes of the JHS and Framingham Heart study (FHS), respectively. The AHA-led study, called the Cardiovascular Genome Phenome Study (CVGPS), will expand upon the research taking place within the Framingham and Jackson Heart studies by investing in parallel genomic and ge-netic analyses among other research subjects, expanding diversity and enhancing new approaches to find more ''personalized'' treatment and prevention interventions that could pre-empt chronic cardiovascular disease and other conditions. The CVGPS will also seek to make new data available for analysis by qualified inves-tigators. More generally, NHLBI is taking the necessary steps to transform its epidemi- ology research efforts in a way that builds on emerging scientific tools and data platforms. NHLBI has established an Advisory Council Working Group on Epidemi-ology Research to strategically examine how to maximize the potential of our epide-miological studies by joining complementary data across cohorts such as the FHS and the JHS for new scientific investigations. Leveraging our available resources, through strategic partnerships and collaborations, offers the best hope to address critical needs that will not only improve treatment but also change the course of disease before irreversible consequences occur. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD C. S HELBY SCIENCE , TECHNOLOGY , ENGINEERING , AND MATHEMATICS Question. The fiscal year 2015 budget request, once again, proposes a reorganiza- tion of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. While the STEM proposal kept the Science Education Partnership Awards program at NIH, the budget proposes to eliminate four other STEM initiatives throughout the agency. What metrics were used to decide these programs should be eliminated? Answer. The President's budget for fiscal year 2015 proposes a reorganization of all Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education programs. Consistent with the Government-wide STEM reorganization, NIH decided to phase out four of its smaller STEM programs and notified grantees of the dis-continuation of future new STEM programs supported by the National Institute on 111 Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This decision to discontinue or eliminate these programs follows the recommendations of the Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan (Appendix Table A6: STEM Education Funding in Millions by Agency, page 98). Consistent with the report language ac-companying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Public Law 113-76), NIH is continuing support of the Science Education Partnership Award program and the Office of Science Education. CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE AWARDS Question. Dr. Austin, can you tell me how the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program is helping underserved populations, for example in my home state of Alabama, and in other underserved states in the Deep South? Answer. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) CTSA began a new program in 2010 called, ''The Deep South Network for Translational Research (DSNTR).'' It involves the UAB CTSA as the organizing hub, with participation of other institutions in the Deep South that do not have a CTSA including, Louisiana State University, Tulane University, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama- Tuscaloosa, University of South Alabama, and University of Mississippi Medical Center. It makes the sophisticated research capabilities of UAB available to inves-tigators at these other institutions for use in multi-institutional collaborative re- search projects, especially those that focus on underserved populations. Further, in collaboration with Alabama's Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the UAB CTSA has built an extensive network for training the next generation of health dis-parities researchers. The University of Arkansas Translational Research Institute (TRI) aims to trans- late successful healthcare research projects directly to patient care delivery regard-less of where they live. The TRI partners with key community organizations across the state to facilitate research contacts and clinical care connections among rural and medically underserved populations. The TRI has leveraged and built upon Ar-kansas' statewide telemedicine program, in particular the Antenatal and Neonatal Guidelines, Education, and Learning System (ANGELS) program, which links obste-tricians across the state to UAMS maternal-fetal medicine specialists. Its partner-ship with the Tri-County Rural Health Network has connected elderly and adult disabled citizens with home and community-based services as alternatives to nurs-ing homes. Finally, a nascent partnership with the Philips County Faith Task Force has enabled development of a community-based program for rural veterans in Jef-ferson County to build capacity to conduct participatory research. The project's over-arching goal is to establish a community-linked infrastructure that will increase mi-nority participation in translational research intended to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities. At the Atlanta CTSA, experts in community engagement seek out community healthcaregivers that can articulate the heath needs of the local population, espe-cially those who face disproportionately higher health risks. The Atlanta CTSA in-cludes Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Morehouse School of Medicine, which is dedicated to improving the health and well-being of in-dividuals and communities with emphasis on the underserved urban and rural pop-ulations in Georgia. Morehouse provides leadership in developing programs that specifically address healthcare needs in the Atlanta region. Examples include ''e- Healthy Strides,'' which partnered with Big Bethel AME Church to collect health data and transmit it to the parishioners' physicians; ''i-Adapt,'' a program designed to provide instruction and motivation to people with diabetes to facilitate self-care; and EPICS (Educational Program to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening), a pro-gram aimed at teaching primary healthcare teams about screening more effectively for colorectal cancer. ACCELERATING MEDICINES PARTNERSHIP Question. Under the new Accelerating Medicines Partnership program, rheu- matoid arthritis and lupus will receive $41.6 million in research funding over 5 years, with about half of this funding coming from the NIH and half from pharma-ceutical companies. I am concerned that the funding for lupus is not new NIH funds, but redirected funding from current research projects. Are you concerned that AMP is taking away from current lupus research resources as opposed to allocating additional resources towards lupus? Will data generated as a result of the Accelerated Medicines Partnership be avail- able to other scientists studying these diseases? 112 What other diseases and conditions will this program be supporting in the future? Answer. The Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) is a unique type of public- private partnership of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), nonprofit organizations, and biopharmaceutical companies. AMP is supporting research focused on identifying and validating biological targets for new therapeutics, a process called target validation. AMP was just launched in February, and as noted, is beginning with three specific pilot projects, including a rheumatoid arthritis and lupus project. The AMP program offers an exceptional opportunity to leverage NIH investments in lupus research with substantial funds and intellectual support from industry and non-profit organizations. Recognizing the need and opportunity, NIH, after con-sulting with the research community, released two Requests for Applications (RFAs) to implement the AMP program in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The RFAs will not take money away from existing lupus projects. We expect that a number of re-searchers studying lupus will apply and be funded through the AMP. Because a major goal of the AMP is to generate pre-competitive, disease-specific data that will be accessible to the broad biomedical community, the program will also facilitate research by lupus investigators not funded through the AMP. AMP partners have also agreed that the research findings should not be patented. The AMP partners intend to consider other project ideas later this year. As in the selection of the pilot projects, the AMP partners would need to agree that there is a scientific opportunity in target validation in a particular disease area with these characteristics: the research project would be amenable to a public-private partner-ship with joint scientific planning and governance; data would be shared broadly and not be patented; and industry or research foundations would be willing to com-mit substantial financial and other support. The Foundation for the NIH has a project proposal form on its Web site at http://fnih.org/work/key-initiatives-0/accel-erating-medicines-partnership to guide interested parties in developing project pro-posals for the AMP members to consider, and the AMP partners will also continue identifying and exploring their own areas of mutual scientific interest. QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM BREAST CANCER SCREENING Question. From 1990 to 2010, deaths from breast cancer decreased by 34 percent. However, in 2013, 230,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States and almost 40,000 women died from breast cancer. Recent news coverage has focused on studies that called into question the value of screening for breast cancers. Although the majority of scientific studies have cor-roborated the value of early detection of breast cancers through screening, these re-cent articles have created a less clear picture of the benefits of screening and may lead women to avoid periodic mammography, an experience some women already view as uncomfortable. Given these current controversies, do you think the NCI should undertake a new study to clarify the benefits of screening so that women and their doctors will have a better idea of how breast cancer screening should fit into a woman's overall pre-ventative health program? Answer. We are aware of the growing concerns about the balance of benefits and harms associated with screening mammography. Some of these concerns have re-cently been outlined by the Swiss Medical Board in its recommendation to end the national Swiss breast cancer screening program (Reference: Biller-Andorno N and Juni P: N Engl J Med 2014;3760:1965-1967). The concerns fall into two categories. First, the reduction in cancer mortality by early detection of breast cancer using mammography may decline as more effective adjuvant chemotherapy has been de-veloped for treatment of early- and mid-stages of breast cancer. (Much of this un-equivocal progress in treatment came from NCI-sponsored randomized trials of adju-vant therapy.) Nearly all of the randomized trials testing the efficacy of mammog-raphy were conducted decades ago, in the pre-adjuvant therapy era. A recently re-ported and widely publicized Canadian trial started early in the era of adjuvant therapy and showed no reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with mam-mography screening as opposed to screening by physical examination (Reference: Miller AB, et al.: BMJ 2014; doi: 10.1136/bmj.g366). Second, new evidence of harms associated with mammography has emerged in recent years, particularly one known as overdiagnosis\u2014the detection of non-life threatening tumors that caused anxiety and were treated with measures that carry risks, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (Reviewed in: Pace LE and Keating NL: JAMA 2014;311:1327-1335). 113 The emerging evidence has led to calls for additional studies in the current mod- ern era of breast cancer therapy that would clarify the balance of benefits and harms of breast cancer screening. The ideal or ''gold standard'' test would be a large randomized trial comparing screening mammography to a control group that does not receive screening mammography, but such a study would not be feasible in the United States. National surveys show that a large proportion of American women continue to get routine screening mammography, with no change in usage after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued its recommendations against routine screening for women ages 40-49 and for spacing mammography for women age 50- 74 from annually to every 2 years (Reference: Pace LE, et al.: Cancer 2013;119:2518-2523). Given current practice, a true control group for an optimally informative ''gold standard'' trial appears to be impossible. Therefore, NCI is actively funding and planning other types of studies to learn more about the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening, and to try to maxi-mize any benefits while limiting the harms. First, NCI is taking several approaches to improve on the benefits of mammography as currently practiced. NCI funds a multi-institutional Breast Cancer Screening Consortium, a collaborative network of seven research registries designed to track outcomes of screening mammography in the community, including recall and biopsy rates, and tumor stages at diagnosis. A goal is to explore ways to achieve optimal and reproducible mammography reading in the community. A recently developed inter-divisional NCI request for applications (RFA) will focus on studying the process of screening and subsequent therapy, with a focus on overdiagnosis, which, as noted above, often leads to inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment. This project will compare tumor biology and clinical aggressiveness with the method of detection, including breast imaging, and with the criteria used for diagnosis. The research aims to identify ways to ensure timely fol-low-up of abnormal findings and institution of effective therapy when necessary. Additionally, in an effort to minimize the harms of overdiagnosis, several other methods for screening are under investigation. The Early Detection Research Net-work (EDRN) is studying new methods to identify the molecular ''fingerprints'' of screen-detected tumors with little lethal potential, so that more patients can be fol-lowed without institution of unnecessary aggressive treatments. A funding oppor-tunity announcement (FOA) for a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists specifi-cally focused on identification of early screen-detected ''non-progressor'' lesions that can be safely followed is under consideration, with breast cancer as one of the four primary areas of emphasis of the proposed consortium. A related research area involves the study of other imaging modalities to detect breast cancer. The balance of benefits and harms of breast MRI in the general popu-lation is not known, so it is not usually considered to be suited to general screening. However, some experts have recommended it as an adjunct screening tool for women at extremely high risk of breast cancer, such as women who have high-risk inherited mutations of their BRCA 1 or 2 genes, a history of ionizing radiation treat-ments to the chest (administered to treat other malignancies), or a family history of breast cancer. The screening recommendations for these women include both an annual mammogram and MRI for the BRCA mutation carriers and an optional MRI or ultrasound for the rest. (An update on breast cancer screening and prevention. Cruz MS, Sarfaty M and Wender RC; Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice Vol. 41, Issue 2, June 2014, Pages 283-306.). FDA has approved digital breast tomosynthesis or 3-D mammography devices, which use low dose x-rays for breast cancer screening but experts do not agree on its clinical use. A few small studies have shown that adding digital breast tomosynthesis to standard mammography screening may result in a significant re-duction in patients being recalled for additional testing compared to routine screen-ing mammography alone, but more research is needed. NCI is considering potential studies to see if breast tomosynthesis can improve sensitivity and lower recall rates. SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much. [Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., Wednesday, April 2, the sub- committee was recessed, to reconvene subject to the call of the Chair.] (115) DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 2014 U.S. S ENATE , SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS , Washington, DC. The subcommittee met at 10:06 a.m., in room SD-192, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Tom Harkin (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Harkin, Merkley, Moran, Alexander, and Johanns. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS E. PEREZ, SECRETARY OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOM HARKIN Senator H ARKIN . The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies will come to order. Today, we welcome to our subcommittee our Secretary of Labor, Secretary Tom Perez. Again, I want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, for joining me in Iowa this past weekend. We had an interesting visit with the Job Corps Center in Ottumwa, one of the newer Job Corps Centers. It is kind of unique in how it is combined with the community college. It is one of those new setups, and it is working out really well. So I ap-preciate you coming out and looking at that, Mr. Secretary. I also want to say your commitment to working Americans is re- flected in the subject we will discuss today, and that is the Presi-dent's budget for fiscal year 2015 for the Department of Labor (DOL). This budget proposes critical investments that will equip Ameri- cans with the skills they need for today's jobs, something I know that you have been a great leader on. It recommends also increased funding to ensure that working Americans are paid what they have earned and not denied benefits to which they are entitled. As the Secretary knows, there are some tough choices to be made in our nondefense discretionary spending cap. The fiscal year 2015 116 spending cap is roughly the same as for the current fiscal year. It is tough. It is not draconian, but it is tough. Again, I hope that we can continue on with that budget, rather than the budget set forth by the Budget Committee in the House, which would cut nondefense discretionary spending by $43 billion, or 9 percent, in fiscal year 2016. That would make it very, very tough on this subcommittee to do its job, and for you, I think, to do your job, if we were to have that kind of a huge cut in 1 year. Now, I won't be in the Senate for the fiscal year 2016 appropria- tions process, but I think we can and must do better than to just continue to disinvest in programs critical to working families. I might, just at the outset, say I think one of the good places to start would be to replace the sequester. I have advocated for a long time just get rid of the darn thing, get it over with, and move on. I am also pleased to see several proposals in the department's budget request that address important priorities for working fami-lies, increases for protecting the rights of workers to take family and medical leave, ensuring that workers are paid what they have earned, enhancing oversight of the subminimum-wage program for workers with disabilities. I will have a question about that. These are important investments that build on key accomplish- ments of this department and this subcommittee. For example, the department's Wage and Hour Division has re- turned over $1 billion. Think about that. The Wage and Hour Divi-sion has returned over $1 billion in wages to more than 1.2 million workers who have earned it, but had not been paid. This includes over 100,000 workers who had not been paid the minimum wage for all of the hours that they had worked. The budget also continues to invest in key employment and training activities, including increased funding to build on the suc-cess of the Reemployment and Eligibility Assessments (REAs) pro-gram. Since 2005, this subcommittee has provided more than $400 million for this activity. Research shows that REAs can help connect unemployment in- surance beneficiaries with jobs faster. The budget request would expand and enhance services to help prevent these workers from joining the ranks of the long-term unemployed. I look forward to hearing more about this. Again, this is something that has endured through both Republican and Democratic administrations. So again, Secretary Perez, I want to thank you for your dynamic leadership of the Department of Labor and for being here today to discuss how the budget impacts American workers and what we can do to assist them in helping strengthen the middle class in America. And with that, I will turn to Senator Moran for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JERRY MORAN Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Secretary, it was a pleasure to meet you this morning and I look forward to developing a good working relationship with you and your department. And we would welcome you to visit Kansas so that I can have stories to tell like the chairman does. Thank you very much. 117 We all know we have a struggling economy and unemployment remains way too high. And my concern is that the administration's budget is not prioritizing employment and training programs that put Americans back to work. The unemployment national rate is 6.7 percent, and the fiscal year 2015 budget request provides virtually level funding for Work-force Investment Act programs, which are the cornerstone of our Nation's employment training. There have been significant increases during this administra- tion's time in office that fund regulatory aspects of the Department of Labor, such as OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-tration) and mine safety, and the Wage and Hour Division. But in looking at those numbers, there is a stark contrast to em- ployment and training programs, which have decreased by 10 per-cent. And I just want to emphasize that, for getting Americans back to work, we will be looking toward employment and training programs to help accomplish that goal, and that too often it seems to me that the regulations are part of the problem in creating job opportunities for Americans. It seems to me that really since 2010, the primary function and responsibility of Congress and the President is to put together an effort to create an environment in which more jobs are created, which Americans feel more secure and safe in their jobs and have a sense that they have an opportunity for economic mobility. And we want to make certain that the focus is on training and job cre-ation, to begin with, and then training people to meet those jobs and their qualifications. A couple things that have happened in the last few months that I would like to highlight, and we can visit about during the ques-tions, is the President's executive order directing the Department of Labor to redefine and expand current overtime regulations. I am worried that this move could drastically increase Labor costs and uncertainty for employers as well as employees. And also, it seems to me you have taken some steps to address this issue, and I am interested in hearing about it, the regulatory action that OSHA took against a Nebraska farm that has a con-sequence that is based upon, perhaps, a redefinition of what a farm is, as exempted under those labor laws. Again, 5 years of high unemployment, it seems to me that we have to focus on finding ways to work with employers to create a safe environment without creating penalties and fines and uncer-tainty. And I look forward to hearing your thoughts about the role of those regulators in that regard. Again, I look forward to working with you as we try to find ways to make certain that Americans feel safe and secure, have greater job opportunities, and can advance to the benefit of themselves and their families. Thank you for your presence today. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Moran. It is my honor to welcome Secretary Perez to his first appearance before this subcommittee. Secretary Perez became the 26th Secretary of Labor on July 23, 2013. Secretary Perez has experience serving in all levels of gov-ernment, both at the county level, in Montgomery County nearby, 118 also at the State level as the Secretary of Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. He was a member of the Montgomery County Council. And then at the Federal level, Sec-retary Perez served as a career attorney at the Department of Jus-tice, as well as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Clinton administration. And just before this appoint-ment, he was Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, again, at the Department of Justice. And again, the most important part of Secretary Perez's entire career was when he worked for this committee\u2014no, on the HELP (Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions) Committee, not this com- mittee. I always get confused which committee I am chairing here. On the HELP Committee. So, Secretary Perez, thank you very much for your lifetime of de- votion to public service and for your stewardship now at the De-partment of Labor. Your statement will be made a part of the record in its entirety, and please proceed as you so desire. SUMMARY STATEMENT OF HON . THOMAS E . PEREZ Secretary P EREZ . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Senator Moran. It has been an honor to meet you, and I look for-ward to sitting down with you. Senator Alexander, it is great to see you again. Senator Harkin, Mr. Chairman, thank you for the visit last weekend to Iowa. And much more importantly, thank you for your service. As I said to the kids at the Job Corps Center, they have a Sen- ator who has done great service to Iowa, has done a great service to America, and has done great service to vulnerable people around the world. And we will miss you dearly. Your common decency is one thing that I will always take away from you, and my experience being mentored by you. So thank you for everything that you have done for so many people. We also have a retirement. This woman to my right, Teri Bergman, has been around. This is her last approps cycle before she enters retirement; she refuses to allow me to tell you how many years of service. So I will just say she has been here awhile as well, and I want to thank Teri for her service. Senator H ARKIN . She is smiling. Secretary P EREZ . She is smiling. I asked if she was happy or sad today, and she said probably happier than sad. But we have valued from her service. You all know that you are only as good as your staff, and we have a great staff at the Department of Labor. We are going to miss Teri. FISCAL YEAR 2015 PRESIDENT 'S BUDGET The budget that we present today, like any other, is more than a compilation of dollar figures; it is an expression of our values. The Labor Department's values include helping people acquire the skills they need to succeed in the jobs of today and tomorrow, help-ing employers to get those skilled workers so they can grow their business; ensuring nondiscrimination in the workplace; making sure hard work is rewarded with a fair wage; and enhancing our 119 enforcement capacity to protect workers' wages, benefits, and safe- ty on the job. Our budget calls for the funding necessary to make meaningful progress toward these goals, and I would like to take a few minutes to highlight some of the key items. We continue our investment in training and employment services to more than 20 million Americans at our 2,500-plus American job centers nationwide. At the height of the recession, these centers were the Nation's emergency room for jobseekers, administering the critical care nec-essary to restore economic health and get people back to work. The American Job Centers are resources for businesses as well. During the State of the Union, the President singled out Andra Rush, a small-business woman from Detroit. Her manufacturing firm is thriving because she found roughly 700 of her workers through the local American Jobs Center. We effectively served as her human resources department. I often like to think of the De-partment of Labor as playing a Match.com kind of role, helping workers and employers find the right fit. And in that case, we were able to find the right fit for over 700 people who are now thriving and have punched their ticket to the middle class. REVIEW OF THE NATION 'S TRAINING PROGRAMS During my 8 months on the job, I have spent a lot of time speak- ing to dozens of business leaders and CEOs (chief executive offi-cers). And to a person, they are bullish about the future. They also tell me that in order to grow and expand, they need a steady pipeline of skilled workers. So we need to build on our success, and we need to fix what is in need of being fixed. And that is why the President has tasked Vice President Biden with conducting a review of our Nation's training programs. I was with the Vice President recently, in New Hampshire, as part of this initiative. This review will be guided by the principle of job driven work- force investment. The goals of this effort are, number one, expand-ing employer engagement and ensure that our system is truly de-mand driven. If you are going to create jobs, you have to talk to the job creators. No more train and pray. We are not going to train widget makers if no one is hiring widget makers. We learn who is hiring for what by making sure we expand and sustain our em-ployer engagement. Number two, making it easier for people to acquire those in-de- mand skills necessary to punch their ticket to the middle class. Number three, spurring innovation at all levels of the workforce system. Number four, promoting what works in the workforce settings and fixing what isn't working. And number five, growing and transforming registered appren- ticeship programs to meet the increasing and exciting needs. I have had the good fortune of working on these issues at the local, State, and Federal level. In my experience, these issues have never been partisan issues. They don't need to be partisan issues. Senator Moran, I listened to what you said very carefully, and I would love to have a conversation with you, not only today, but 120 in the weeks and months ahead, about how we can work together in a bipartisan fashion on the critical issue of making sure people have the skills to succeed. Our Opportunity, Growth, and Security Fund addresses many of the training concerns that you have brought to our attention here today. COMBATING LONG -TERM UNEMPLOYMENT One of the most vexing challenges we are confronting is the plight of the long-term unemployed. Frankly, having met so many long-term unemployed, it is probably the one issue on my plate that keeps me up at night more than anything, because they keep telling me how hard they are working, in terms of looking for work. I had a guy in Cleveland last week who said to me, ''I have got no quit in me.'' When someone says that to you, and looks you in the eye, you are not going to quit on them. I had another person in New Jersey who said, ''I fought and licked cancer. Fighting can-cer was far easier than fighting long-term unemployment.'' So, I applaud the efforts in the Senate and the passage of the bi- partisan bill on Monday. I hope the House follows suit. Unemployment benefits like this, while very important, certainly, aren't the end of the story. We need to work together on ways to get people back on the job and back in the workforce. Toward that end, I am very excited about the $158 million re- quest for an enhanced, integrated, and expanded Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment and Reemployment Services program, which will use an evidence-based approach to help long-term unem-ployed workers and returning veterans find work faster. We also request $15 million in grants to support sector strate- gies, helping the long-term unemployed, and other targeted popu-lations, receive the training or other services they need for careers in these areas. These recommendations are built on a growing un-derstanding of what works. You can be assured that the budget as-sumes that we are incorporating rigorous evaluations in everything we do. We are measuring what we are doing to make sure it works. If it doesn't work, we either fix it, or we don't do it anymore. I hope we can work together to invest in these and other pro- grams that have a demonstrated record of effectiveness in helping people get back on their feet. OPPORTUNITY , GROWTH , AND SECURITY INITIATIVE Although it is not before the committee, the President's 2015 budget also sets forth an Opportunity, Growth, and Security initia-tive that includes a robust investment in our community colleges, one-third of which would be used to promote greater use of appren-ticeships, a proven workforce development strategy that is still un-dervalued in the United States. We really need to change the national mindset on apprentice- ships. A 4-year college degree is the right choice for so many peo-ple, but it isn't the only way to punch your ticket to the middle class. So, we need to let young people and their parents know that there is a bright future in America for people who want to work 121 with their hands. Training and skills development is just one piece, an important piece, of the Labor Department's work. PROTECTING EMPLOYEE WAGES , SAFETY , AND RETIREMENT SECURITY As I have said before, we play a critical role in making sure that Americans get paid the wages they are due, that they are safe on the job, and that their benefits are secure. Our budget includes an increase of almost $30 million for the Wage and Hour Division to cover the cost of hiring new investiga-tors. These resources will be used to ensure that people who work get paid a fair wage, and that employers who play by the rules aren't undercut by those who don't. No worker should have to sac- rifice their life for their livelihood. So the 2015 budget calls for substantial investments in the abil- ity of OSHA and its State partners to keep workers safe. To safeguard the retirement of American workers, we also re- quest $188 million to protect more than 141 million people covered by the benefits plans together, which hold over $7 trillion in assets. Mr. Chairman, we have come a long way since the depths of the great recession. The private sector has now created roughly 9 mil-lion jobs over the past 49 months of consecutive private sector job growth. The economy is moving in the right direction, but there is no doubt that we need to pick up the pace. PREPARED STATEMENT We need to do more. We need to invest in more skills for workers so they can get back on their feet. And the Labor Department stands ready to play a critical role in creating and expanding that opportunity. And with that opening statement, I look forward to hearing your questions and responding. Thank you very much, and thank you for your leadership. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS E. P EREZ Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to testify today. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you to discuss the fiscal year 2015 budget request for the Department of Labor. President Obama's 2015 budget builds on his vision of opportunity for all Ameri- cans of which he spoke in January in the State of the Union address. The Presi-dent's budget sets forth concrete, practical investments and proposals to achieve his vision by growing the economy, strengthening the middle-class, and empowering all those hoping to join the ranks of the middle-class. It is an agenda of opportunity, action, and optimism. It is the agenda for our work at the Department of Labor over the next 3 years. The core principle is as American as they come\u2014if you work hard and play by the rules, you should have the opportunity to succeed. In America, your ability to get ahead should be determined by hard work and personal responsibility\u2014not by the circumstances of your birth. Making good on the promise of opportunity has always been central to the Labor Department's mission to help create jobs and build a stronger middle class, to invest in human capital to build a skills infrastructure that supports business growth, to give every American the chance to retire with dignity and a measure of economic security, to promote a fair wage and safe working conditions, to help our Nation's veterans find a place in the civilian economy, and to help historically marginalized populations, like immigrant communities and people with disabilities, move into the economic mainstream. But now, more than ever, as the President's agenda is our 122 agenda, working to fulfill the promise of opportunity is fundamental to what we do, and the budget proposal would provide the investments necessary to enable us to help fulfill the promise. We have come a long way since the depths of the Great Recession. We have seen 48 consecutive months of private sector job growth, which has added 8.7 million jobs, and the unemployment rate has reached its lowest point in over 5 years. More-over, our manufacturing sector is experiencing the largest and most consistent growth since the mid-1990s. Over 600,000 manufacturing jobs have been added since February 2010. We have cut our deficits by more than half to their lowest share of GDP since before President Obama took office. By those measures, we are well on our way to a full recovery. But the statistics do not tell the whole story as economic growth is still hamstrung by stubbornly high unemployment. They are cold comfort to the underemployed construction worker who continues to be laid off in between sporadic jobs. They do not encourage the factory worker whose application never gets a second look after the human re-sources department sees she has been unemployed for 6 months; or the waitress or bank teller who works full-time but must depend on public assistance to feed her family. They do not help the country's youth for whom so much depends on that critical first job. So while we have come a long way, much work remains. The President's budget outlines a comprehensive agenda to make America a mag- net for middle class jobs and business investment. Equipping workers with the skills they need and for which employers are hiring is not just a workforce development issue, it is an economic development issue. No matter what your political party, we can all agree on one thing: good jobs and low unemployment are good for the coun-try. As part of the effort to achieve this shared goal, the President is acting on a set of specific, concrete proposals that will make sure American workers have the skills they need for in-demand jobs of today and the jobs of tomorrow. These initia-tives will allow industry to identify the skills and credentials required for jobs they are seeking to fill now and tomorrow; give workers and job seekers access to edu-cation and training that meets those needs; and provide employers with easy ways to find workers who have or can acquire those skills. Some of these proposals will require new legislation while others can be done within existing program authori-ties. I am eager to work with all who are willing to roll up their sleeves with me to enact these critical programs. The President's budget also supports the extension of emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed. If not extended, 3.6 million additional people are estimated to lose access to extended UI benefits by the end of 2014, despite re-maining unemployed and looking for work. As I will explain, the President's budget request creates opportunity for all Ameri- cans while continuing long term deficit reduction through: \u2014Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative. \u2014Investing in a Competitive Workforce. \u2014Protecting American Workers and their Income and Retirement Security. OPPORTUNITY , GROWTH AND SECURITY INITIATIVE While the 2015 budget will adhere to the spending levels agreed to in the Bipar- tisan Budget Act of 2013 and reflect the tradeoffs that are required to maintain those levels of spending, the budget also presents the President's vision for an econ-omy that promotes opportunity for all Americans. As part of this vision, the budget sets forth a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative (OGSI), which will include additional policies to grow the economy and create jobs without adding a dime to the deficit. The OGSI would increase the fiscal year 2015 discre-tionary caps to make room for priority defense and nondefense investments, paying for $56 billion in funding with a balanced package of spending reforms and closed tax loopholes. It will increase employment, while achieving important economic out-comes in education, research, manufacturing and public health and safety. Although not included in our budget totals before the Committee, the OGSI envisions a sig-nificant role for the Department. At DOL, the OGSI includes: \u2014Community College Job-Driven Training Fund .\u2014The OGSI includes $1.5 billion per year to support a 4-year investment in a Community College Job-Driven Training Fund that will offer competitive grants to partnerships of community colleges and other entities to reform curricula and launch new training pro-grams. Of this amount, $500 million per year will go toward a dedicated ap-prenticeship training fund to provide grants to States and regional consortia to work with employers to create new apprenticeships and increase participation in existing apprenticeship programs. Apprenticeship is a strategy that we know works to provide good jobs and paths to the middle class. This 4-year invest-123 ment will support doubling the number of high quality, registered apprentice- ships in America over the next 5 years. \u2014Supporting and Improving Training and Employment Services .\u2014The Initiative would provide $750 million to fully restore prior cuts in job training and em-ployment services, invest more intensively in innovation, and target resources to populations that face significant barriers to employment. \u2014State Paid Leave .\u2014The OGSI also proposes an additional $100 million for the State Paid Leave Fund to support States that wish to establish paid leave pro-grams. Currently, only California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island offer such pro-grams, which they call family leave insurance. More States should have the chance to follow this example. INVESTING IN A COMPETITIVE WORKFORCE To continue the economic recovery, the 2015 budget proposes a set of initiatives that would reduce long-term unemployment and hasten reemployment including the New Career Pathways program (formerly the Universal Displaced Workers initia-tive), reemployment services and eligibility assessments and services, and the three- pronged Job-Driven Training legislative proposal comprising the following programs: Bridge to Work; Back to Work Partnerships; and Summer Jobs Plus. \u2014New Career Pathways .\u2014The 2015 budget proposes mandatory funding for a New Career Pathways (NCP) program that will provide workers with a set of core services by combining the best features of both the Trade Adjustment As-sistance for Workers (TAA) and Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Dislocated Worker (DW) programs. Upon enactment, NCP will streamline administrative steps and integrate proven practices, service delivery platforms, and infrastruc-ture of the TAA and WIA DW programs to offer a universal suite of training and reemployment services to a broader number of displaced workers. To invest in the Nation's youth and the long-term unemployed, the 2015 budget also includes a package of mandatory funding for job-driven training proposals. These proposals would be designed with employer needs in mind, putting an end to what I call the ''train and pray'' era of training workers for jobs with limited de-mand or with credentials employers do not value. This $8.5 billion package of pro-posals includes: \u2014Bridge to Work .\u2014The $2 billion Bridge to Work program is designed to provide States with flexible funding to implement Bridge to Work and other innovative reemployment initiatives targeted to the long-term unemployed and to design, develop, and implement their own path-breaking strategies to encourage reem-ployment. \u2014Back to Work Partnerships .\u2014The Back to Work Partnerships will support part- nerships between education and training institutions and businesses to get the long-term unemployed back to work. Funded with $4 billion over 2 years, the program would provide competitive grants that support promising and innova-tive local work-based job and training strategies to place low-income adults and youth in jobs quickly. Such strategies include on-the-job training; sector-based training; training in collaboration with an industry sector partnership; connec-tions to immediate work opportunities; career academies; and/or adult basic education and integrated basic education and training models. \u2014Summer Jobs Plus .\u2014This is a $2.5 billion one-time investment to support op- portunities for hundreds of thousands of low-income youth. The first component is a $1.5 billion formula grant program that will provide funds to States, avail-able up to 2 years, to support summer and year-round jobs for 600,000 youth. The second component is a $1.0 billion innovation fund to provide competitive grants to support promising and innovative employment and training strategies designed to improve outcomes for low-income youth. I am working closely with the Vice President to continue other evidence-based ef- forts to replicate approaches that have been proven to work, move funds from those that have not, and continue to encourage and evaluate innovative and promising strategies. As that process unfolds, there are steps that we can take right away. The budget proposes to maintain a strong foundation with funding for existing programs, while taking steps to foster innovation and improvement. The budget includes: \u2014Training and Employment Services .\u2014The 2015 budget includes more than $3 billion in formula and other grants to States and localities to provide training and employment services to more than 20 million Americans at over 2,500 American Job Centers across the country. The budget maintains the State-wide reserve at 8.75 percent, as enacted in fiscal year 2014. \u2014Workforce Innovation Fund .\u2014The 2015 budget proposes $60 million to support innovative State and regional approaches to the design and delivery of employ-124 ment and training services that generate long-term improvements in the per- formance of the public workforce system, both in terms of employment outcomes and cost-effectiveness. \u2014Incentive Grants .\u2014The 2015 budget requests $80 million for revamped Incen- tive Grants for States and tribal governments. These funds will be used to re-ward States and tribal governments that demonstrate the greatest success in their WIA programs serving subpopulations facing significant barriers to em-ployment, such as the long-term unemployed, disconnected youth, individuals with disabilities, and veterans. A limited number of grants would be awarded based on the extent to which eligible entities improve their performance relat-ing to employment outcomes. Combined with the Workforce Innovation Fund, the grants would invest an amount equal to 5 percent of WIA formula grants to drive innovation and better performance at the State and local level. \u2014Reemployment and Eligibility Assessments/Reemployment Services (REA/ RES) .\u2014For those who have lost their jobs, the budget request would reconnect unemployed workers to jobs more quickly through an investment of $158 million in discretionary funds for reemployment and eligibility assessments and reem-ployment services (REA/RES), an evidence-based approach to speed the return to work of UI beneficiaries. Research has shown that when reemployment eligi-bility assessments are delivered seamlessly with reemployment services, they are significantly more effective, with claimants less likely to exhaust their UI benefits, shorter UI durations and lower benefits paid, and faster returns to work with higher wages and job retention. Savings attributable to the program were almost three times higher than the cost. Included in this proposal is dedi-cated funding to ensure that all recently separated military personnel receiving Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX) get these services to help them successfully transition to the civilian workforce. The request is also sufficient to provide services to the top quarter of UI beneficiaries most likely to exhaust benefits. \u2014Sector Strategy .\u2014The Department requests $15 million for grants to States, consortia of States, or regional partnerships to develop employment and train-ing strategies targeted to particular in-demand industry sectors in regional economies. These grants will help ensure that the long-term unemployed and other targeted populations receive the training they need for careers for in-de-mand industry sectors. \u2014Job Corps .\u2014The 2015 budget proposes $1.7 billion for the Job Corps program to prepare disadvantaged young people for jobs in high-demand occupations with good wage potential and to further their education and training as well as their responsibilities of citizenship and adulthood. The 2015 budget includes $13.8 million to open and fully enroll students in two new Job Corps centers in New Hampshire and Wyoming, the last two States without centers, and con-tinues the Administration's commitment to improving and reforming the Job Corps program. These reforms include closing a small number of underper-forming Job Corps centers; focusing the program on the older youth for whom it has been demonstrated to be effective; improving procurement and financial oversight; modernizing operations with a revised Policy and Requirements Handbook; and ongoing cost-savings reforms. PROTECTING AMERICA 'S WORKERS AND THEIR INCOME AND RETIREMENT SECURITY Worker protection programs are crucial to protecting the health, safety, wages and working conditions of America's workers. The American people rely on the De-partment to fulfill our responsibility to make these protections not just words in the statute books, but real safeguards against threats to their lives and livelihoods. The budget includes nearly $1.9 billion for the Department's worker protection agencies. Some highlights of our worker protection request include: \u2014Wage and Hour .\u2014The 2015 budget proposes an increase of almost $30 million for the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) to hire 300 new investigators to target the industries and employers most likely to break laws that ensure workers re-ceive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, including the minimum wage and overtime pay, as well as the right to take leave to care for their own or their families' medical needs. Included in this increase are funds transferred from the Women's Bureau to enhance enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act, two laws of critical importance to women. An additional $0.8 million will be used to strengthen the agency's training and professional development program, ensuring that all new and existing investiga-tors have the information and skills they need to be effective. The budget also provides $5.8 million for WHD to develop a new integrated enforcement and 125 case management system that will allow investigators to better employ data analysis in identifying violations, targeting investigations and compliance as-sistance efforts, and evaluating the impact and quality of enforcement. \u2014State Paid Leave Fund .\u2014Too many American workers must make the painful choice between the care of their families and a paycheck they desperately need. While the Family and Medical Leave Act allows many workers to take job-pro-tected unpaid time off, millions of families cannot afford this. A handful of States have enacted policies to offer paid leave, but more States should have the chance to follow their example. The budget includes a $5 million State Paid Leave Fund to provide technical assistance and support to States that are con-sidering paid leave programs. In addition, as discussed above, the Administra-tion's Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative includes $100 million in ad-ditional funds for this Fund. \u2014Employee Misclassification .\u2014The 2015 budget provides nearly $14 million to help identify and combat the misclassification of workers as independent con-tractors, which deprives workers of the benefits and protections to which they are legally entitled, such as minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment in-surance, and antidiscrimination protections. This includes $10 million in contin-ued grants to States to recover unpaid unemployment taxes and $3.8 million of the WHD increase for personnel to investigate violations. \u2014Occupational Safety and Health Administration .\u2014No worker should have his or her life on the line for a paycheck. Workers need the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to enforce their right to a safe and healthful workplace. The vast majority of employers want to keep their workers safe and they need OSHA to have the resources necessary to help them find the best way to do so. The 2015 budget provides $565 million for OSHA to inspect hazardous workplaces and foster employer compliance with safety and health regulations. The request includes an increase for State grants to ensure that State Plan States can do the same. In addition, the request includes an additional $4 mil-lion to strengthen OSHA's enforcement of the 22 whistleblower laws that pro-tect workers against retaliation for reporting unsafe and unscrupulous practices and to centralize the agency's audit function and improve the information tech-nology used by investigators to collect case data. \u2014Mine Safety and Health Administration .\u2014The 2015 budget requests $377 mil- lion for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), to build on the re-markable progress MSHA has made to bring the incidence of fatal injuries in the mining industry to an all-time low in fiscal year 2013. The request includes funding increases to improve the timeliness of special assessments, support rulemaking activities, improve systems and data analytics that support enforce-ment functions, and reform Federal training delivery to help protect workers in one of our Nation's most dangerous industries. \u2014Federal Contract Compliance .\u2014The 2015 budget proposes an additional $1.1 million to strengthen efforts by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Pro-grams (OFCCP) to combat pay discrimination. OFCCP works to eliminate em-ployment discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, and sex, to eliminate employment discrimination for our Nation's veterans and workers with disabilities, and to secure equal employment opportunity for work-ers. \u2014Defined Benefit Pension System .\u2014The budget proposes to give the Board of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) the authority to adjust pre-miums to take into account the risks that different sponsors pose to their retir-ees and to PBGC. The Board would be able to adjust premiums in both the sin-gle employer and multiemployer programs. These premium increases are crucial to improving solvency but will not be sufficient to address the complex chal-lenges facing these plans, and the Administration looks forward to working with Congress on a more comprehensive solution. \u2014Employee Benefits Security Administration .\u2014To protect the health and retire- ment benefits of America's workers, the Department is requesting $188 million for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). These funds will protect more than 141 million people covered by an estimated 684,000 private retirement plans, 2.4 million health plans and a similar number of other em-ployee welfare plans, which all together hold $7.8 trillion in assets. In addition, the budget request includes legislative proposals to modernize two worker benefit programs to improve the operation of both programs. \u2014Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) .\u2014The fiscal year 2015 request for the Department of Labor proposes once again to act on longstanding rec-ommendations from the Government Accountability Office, Congressional Budg-et Office, and DOL's Inspector General to improve the Federal Employees' Com-126 pensation Act (FECA), which has not been substantially updated since 1974. These reforms will help workers return to the dignity of work and will generate government-wide savings of more than $340 million over 10 years. \u2014Unemployment Insurance (UI) Reform .\u2014The combination of chronically under- funded reserves and the economic downturn has placed a considerable financial strain on States' UI operations. It is important to enhance the UI system's sol-vency and financial integrity while maintaining benefits for job seekers. The budget proposes to provide immediate relief to employers to encourage job cre-ation now, improve State fiscal responsibility going forward, and work closely with States to eliminate improper payments. ADDITIONAL PRIORITIES The Department's budget request also includes other programmatic increases out- side the training and employment services and worker protection areas that support the well-being of American workers. \u2014Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) .\u2014BLS is the principal Federal statistical agen- cy responsible for measuring labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy. Its mission is to collect, analyze, and disseminate essential economic information to support public and private decisionmaking. These policies and decisions affect virtually all Americans. The budget request of $610 million includes an increase of $1.6 million to add one annual supple-ment to the Current Population Survey that would collect information relevant to labor force trends, including data on contingent work and alternative work arrangements, and workplace flexibility and work-family balance. The budget also includes an increase of $2.5 million for the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey to support the Census Bureau in its development of a supplemental sta-tistical poverty measure using CE data. \u2014Information Technology Modernization .\u2014The goal of the Department's IT Mod- ernization effort is to provide the foundation for the technology needed to trans-form the way the Department provides services to, and interacts with, the American public. It continues the integration of the Department's many infra-structures and consolidation of data centers to provide a more robust, reliable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient computing environment. Additional resources are being requested for a new Digital Government Integrated Platform, which will be used to provide a foundation of mobile computing and open data services that can be leveraged by agencies to enhance and deploy mission-specific appli-cations and capabilities. These services will contribute to improved customer service and collaboration opportunities and maximize the return on investment in technology to support agency business operations. \u2014Evidence and Evaluation .\u2014The Department continues its evidence-based ap- proach incorporating rigorous evaluation in all agencies and in every discre-tionary grant program, ensuring the best and most secure technology is used to make administrative data available for program management and evaluation. The 2015 budget proposes to continue the provision for a setting aside funding for Departmental evaluations, preserves dedicated funding for Labor's Chief Evaluation Office, and also includes an additional $2.4 million and 5 FTE to create a department-wide data analytics unit, to create the capacity for the De-partment to use its administrative data to assess performance, analyze trends, and better target it work. \u2014Legal Services .\u2014The 2015 budget proposes an increase of $6.6 million to sup- port initiatives proposed for the Wage and Hour Division, OSHA's Whistle-blower Protection Program, EBSA's Health Benefits Security project, and to en-able SOL to continue to provide a full range of legal services to OWCP's Divi-sion of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation. \u2014Adjudication .\u2014The 2015 budget proposes an increase of $2.0 million for the Of- fice of Administrative Law Judges to support productivity increases and allevi-ate the growing backlog of cases before the judges; an increase of $1.3 million from the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund to fully fund adjudication of claims under the Black Lung Benefits Act; and $0.2 million for the annual mainte-nance and support funding of the DOL Appeals Management initiative for the Adjudicatory Boards. CONCLUSION In fiscal year 2015 the Department of Labor will strive to advance our mission of serving American workers and employers and to build the foundation for our next 100 years. Our request helps create opportunities for working Americans by invest-ing in skills and our enforcement infrastructure. The budget will help ensure that 127 the Department has the resources to lead the job-driven workforce system to hone the job skills of American workers; bolster efforts that address long-term unemploy-ment; maintain safe and healthy workplaces; strengthen worker voice in the work-place; safeguard critical minimum wage and overtime protections for workers; and ensure secure retirements. The Department's budget request is really a request to invest in the opportunity and potential of the American people. That's why I am so eager to tackle these challenges every single day. As it's been for all 101 years of our existence, I believe the work of the Labor Department is the work of America. Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me today. I look forward to working with you during the coming year and I am happy to respond to any questions that you may have. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Mr. Secretary. We will begin with a round of 5-minute questions. IMPROVING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES Mr. Secretary, I would just like to lead off with something I am sure you know has been an intense interest of mine for all my adult life, and that is the employment of people with disabilities. We worked together in fiscal year 2010 here to initiate the Dis- ability Employment Initiative. This effort is helping to improve the physical and programmatic accessibility of our Nation's workforce system for individuals with disabilities. More than $80 million has been awarded to 26 States under this effort, from this committee. Last year, the Department of Edu-cation awarded grants for 11 States to undertake the PROMISE (Promoting the Readiness of Minors in Supplemental Security In-come) Initiative, a more than $200 million effort. Your department has collaborated on this important initiative designed to improve education and employment outcomes for 14- to 16-year-olds with disabilities and their families. Now, again, we are working very hard. Senator Alexander and I and others have been working for a long time on the Workforce Investment Act bill to get it reauthorized. We are still working on it. Our staffs will be working on it while we are gone for the next 2 weeks. We hope to have something together shortly on this. Part of that will be focused on this issue of making sure that young people with disabilities get access to, or encouragement for, support for, integrated what we call competitive employment. I would just like to get your thoughts on the Department of Labor and how can we be more helpful to realize employment out-comes for people with disabilities, and ensuring that they just aren't all in 214(c) or 14(c) subminimum wage programs. I would just like to hear your thoughts on what the Department of Labor is looking ahead to do. Secretary P EREZ . Sure. Well, first of all, thank you for your lead- ership on this issue, Senator. You take a backseat to no one on this. When I think of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), I think of Tom Harkin. I remember the 10-year anniversary when I was working in the Clinton administration. It was at the FDR Memorial, and you did your entire speech, you signed it, and I will never forget that. I will never forget the 20th anniversary where I got to celebrate it when I was in my old job with Governor Thornburgh, because he has become a good friend and he was a champion because this 128 issue has always been bipartisan. And I want to commend Presi- dent George Herbert Walker Bush for his leadership. And that tradition continues. Senator H ARKIN . Just to interrupt you, I want to say, last Friday, I was at the George H.W. Bush Library in College Station, Texas, for the 25th anniversary of the Bush presidency. You might say, what were you doing there? Secretary P EREZ . I know exactly what you were doing there. Senator H ARKIN . I was invited down by Fred McClure, who runs that, and Boyden Gray, and others. The first panel they had on Friday was on the ADA, so we had Lex Frieden, John Wodatch, Boyden Gray, and myself on the panel, talking about it. The Presi-dent was there. And Barbara, the First Lady, was there. A huge crowd. And it was just wonderful to see the old crowd together again. The Dick Thornburghs and Lou Sullivans and the people who worked so much on getting the ADA passed. It was just an uplift-ing day last Friday. I just wanted to throw that in. Secretary P EREZ . We have come such a long way, not only elimi- nating physical barriers, but attitudinal barriers, and it is a result of the bipartisan leadership. However the area where I think we have a long way to go is in the area of employment of people with disabilities. Just yesterday, the Department of Justice, my old office, we had been working together with them on this, announced a statewide settlement with the State of Rhode Island. I want to commend Gov-ernor Chafee, because he was a big proponent of the settlement, which addresses the exact issue that you are talking about: People with disabilities, who can do so much more, were basically seg-regated into the sheltered workshops. What I have said repeatedly, and you said it last weekend when we were together, people with disabilities don't want pity; they want opportunity. The settlement yesterday that we reached, which has gotten a lot of good coverage, is based on the notion that if you can do the work, you should be allowed that opportunity to do so. And we have given people a significant raise, because they are no longer in the subminimum wage. WORKING WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES Other things that we are doing, in addition to cases like that, is the 503 reg. I am very proud of the work we have done there. I am very appreciative of the leadership in our OFCCP (Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs) office. Frankly, we have been doing a lot of outreach to the business community on this. Governor Ridge wrote an op-ed talking about how the process in the 503 reg is a model of how regulations should be produced. We are continuing to work there, and I want to commend Walgreens, because I have visited their place in Connecticut. This is their distribution center, Senator, that distributes all the Walgreens products from Maine down to Baltimore, and I think 45 percent of their employees are people with disabilities. It is the 129 most productive facility that they have. Everyone is making a min- imum of, I think, $14 an hour plus benefits. It was a remarkable experience, and I again commend the CEO of Walgreens, who has made an unflagging commitment to the em-powerment of people with disabilities. Senator H ARKIN . Greg Wasson. He is wonderful, the CEO of Walgreens. My time is running out, but looking ahead, the business commu- nity has really stepped forward on this. I am having the CEO of Procter & Gamble in tomorrow at our hearing. A lot of them have visited that facility up there in Connecticut. I have been there my-self. And so the business community is really moving ahead. I just would like to say, again, I hope you and the department will join together with the business community in making sure that they have people with disabilities that they can hire when they get out of school. There is a role for the Department of Labor to play in that, and I hope that we can join forces with these great leaders in the busi-ness community. Secretary P EREZ . And I will be meeting with many of them at the end of the month, because we are continuing that outreach. And Greg, I refer everybody to him, because if he can do it, you can do it. That is our mantra. Senator H ARKIN . Exactly. Thank you. Senator Moran. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Secretary, thank you again. I want to refer first to the farming activities and OSHA regulations, and then I want to talk to you about the fiduciary rule and ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act). APPLICATION OF THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT TO FARMING OPERATIONS WITH LESS THAN 10 EMPLOYEES From 1976 forward, Congress has included specific appropria- tions language prohibiting OSHA from using taxpayer funds to apply requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Act to farming operations with less than 10 employees in our Labor- HHS bill. In 2011, the director of OSHA's enforcement program issued a memorandum indicating that rider did not preclude OSHA from conducting enforcement activities, regardless of the type of oper-ation performed on the farm. You have heard from 43 Senators in an effort led by the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Johanns, regarding this policy, expressing some concerns. And my question really is, and my understanding is: You have taken a step back, indicated that you do not want to change the intent of that rider, that the department is not intending to expand or to violate the intent of that rider since 1976. And I just would like for you to bring me up-to-date on where this issue is within the department and in OSHA. Secretary P EREZ . Sure. Yes, sir. We have removed the memo, that is the 2011 memo, which was the source of confusion. We take these riders very, very seriously. 130 We have instructed the team at OSHA that when you are in a cir- cumstance where you discover that it is a family farm under 10 employees, that is the end of statement, and case closed. Senator M ORAN . I appreciate that answer. REWRITING THE RULE DEFINING FIDUCIARY UNDER EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT Let me then turn to the fiduciary rule. This goes back to a pro- posed rule in 2010. The Department of Labor proposed regulations regarding the definition of a fiduciary, which is regulated under ERISA. According to the department, the intent of the proposed rule was to define more broadly the circumstances under which a person or entity is considered a fiduciary when giving investment advice to an employee benefit plan or the plan's participants. There was significant bipartisan opposition concerns raised with expanding the definition of fiduciary. And again, a rider was in-cluded in the Labor-H appropriation bill. That rider prohibited the department from moving forward with its proposed rule. And my questions here are, because of that rider\u2014I assume you would say the same thing; you take those riders seriously; you can't go forward with that rule\u2014but does the department intend to pro-pose a rewrite of the rule? Secretary P EREZ . The original proposed rule was withdrawn, and the process has been slowed down at my direction significantly, be-cause we wanted to take a step back, listen, and learn from every-one. The issue that we are trying to address, Senator, is the following: The most important two financial decisions that people make in their lives are the decision to buy a home, and now with the trans-formation from defined benefit plans to 401(k) and others, the deci- sion of how to invest your retirement nest egg. In both contexts, we want to make sure that people make in- formed decisions and that the person giving you that advice is working in your best interest. And so that is the needle that we are trying to thread. That is the goal that we are trying to achieve. The reason that we slowed this process down is that I want to make sure that we hear from everybody. We have been engaged in a significant amount of outreach, and I have met with a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle, and a number of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. We are going to continue to do that, because I am learning a lot. As I mentioned before, when Senator Ridge wrote about the work that we did, and the process that we undertook in the section 503 reg, that is the process that we want to undertake in everything we do. I am a big believer that you get the best results when you build a big table and make sure that everyone's voice is heard. Senator M ORAN . I appreciate that. How would you describe the status of that process now? You are taking input. Is there a draft of a rule in the works? Secretary P EREZ . We continue to take input, and again, I have had a number of meetings with folks in Congress, et cetera, and we are looking carefully at the best way to address this issue. 131 One thing I would say to you, or ask of you, really, is, if you have a constituent that contacts you and says, ''I have been trying to talk to DOL, and I have been having trouble,'' I hope you will let me know, because I want to make sure that we hear every voice. Senator M ORAN . Let me ask this, I think for a second time, but maybe I wasn't clear the first time: Is there a rule that is being written now, or are you only in the stage of soliciting information about the possibility of a rule? Do you plan on writing a rule? Secretary P EREZ . Well, we are taking in all the information right now, because I want to hear from people in terms of what their perspectives are, what their thoughts are. The rider language al-lowed for a re-proposal, as I read it. This is different from the farm rule, which I interpret as pretty clear in terms of what you can and can't do. I think this is equally clear. That is what we are doing right now, trying to listen and learn. Senator M ORAN . No rule is being written at the moment? Secretary P EREZ . Well, again, we are taking in information right now, so that we can figure out what the best course of action is, and that is exactly where we are in the process. Again, we are also consulting with the SEC (Securities and Ex- change Commission), because one of the sets of feedback I heard, Senator, was that the SEC has equities in this. I agree. The SEC has equities, and as recently as a week ago, I had a conversation with Chair Mary Jo White, and we continue to talk on a regular basis. We will continue to do that. I have read all the letters of concern. I have had numerous meetings on this. I probably have spent as much time on this as just about any issue, because I appreciate the stakes. Whenever you do a rulemaking, you have to be concerned with what I call the doctrine of unintended consequences. You are trying to solve a problem. In the course of solving a problem, you don't want to create new problems. Senator M ORAN . I almost appreciate your entire answer, and par- ticularly appreciate the part about unintended consequences. I think we use that excuse way too often in Congress, in the ad- ministration. ''Well, that is an unintended consequence.'' ''Well, our job is to determine what the consequences\u2014\u2014'' Secretary P EREZ . Anticipate them. Senator M ORAN . Correct. Secretary P EREZ . Absolutely. I couldn't agree more. Senator M ORAN . So I appreciate your answer. I know that work- ing with the SEC is important. They had some criticism of the pro-posed rule in the first place. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Secretary P EREZ . Thank you, Senator. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator. I will go to Senator Alexander, and then I will go to Senator Merkley, and then Senator Johanns. Senator A LEXANDER . Welcome, Mr. Secretary. Secretary P EREZ . Good morning. Good to see you again, Senator. Senator A LEXANDER . Good to see you again. 132 I want to use my 5 minutes to talk just a little bit more about the fiduciary rule and some about what is going on with the over-time letter from the President. Secretary P EREZ . Sure. Senator A LEXANDER . On the fiduciary rule, this seems to me to be the case, you talked about you have a background in States. And my experience is, with all respect, that States have a way of being more pragmatic. Sometimes up here, we are more ideological in Washington. And your experience in the State might be well- served as you try to deal with this fiduciary rule. Without relitigating an old issue, one of the unintended con- sequences we may have learned from the Affordable Care Act is that even though it sounds like a good idea to require people to buy more benefits with a health insurance policy, they end up costing more and get outside their budget. STRATEGIES FOR REWRITING THE DEFINITION OF A FIDUCIARY And in thinking about the fiduciary rule and the way you work on this, I think about the difference between the Government as an enabler and the Government as a mandater. I mean, we have maybe 75 million households who get invest- ment advice from somebody. And what we are really talking about is the difference between the conversation they might have with an investment adviser and the conversation they might have with a fi-duciary, someone who has a duty\u2014a legal duty\u2014to them to give them a certain amount of responsibility. Now all these people can have a fiduciary responsibility, if they want to pay for it. I mean, it is available, if they want to pay for it. But many don't want that much advice. Or they don't need that kind of fiduciary advice, and they can't afford that kind. So it would seem to me that one of the strategies for dealing with this might be to let people know that a higher level of advice is available to them, if they want it and if they want to pay for it, but not to suddenly turn just your everyday investment advice con-versation into one that is fraught with all the legal responsibilities of the fiduciary duty, which is available to anybody who wants to pay for it, and who can afford to pay for. Is that a promising strategy? Secretary P EREZ . Senator, I very much agree with what you said at the outset, when you said that working at the State level some-times is a useful set of experiences. What was useful about my ex-perience as the Labor Secretary in Maryland is I was the Gov-ernor's point person on the foreclosure crisis. Working together with all the stakeholders, we enacted a series of forward-leaning reforms, all of which had virtually unanimous support in the State Senate and the State House and the support of the industry. The way we got there was: We built a big table. Points like the point you are making, I spent a lot of time with mortgage brokers, because there were a lot of concerns raised about whether brokers were providing information to potential lenders that was in that lenders' self-interest, or if they were trying to, frankly, line the brokers' pockets. We had a lot of open and frank conversations about this. We were able to thread the needle in a way that had the support of 133 the brokers at the end, the support of the lenders, the support of the consumer groups. That is the process that we are undertaking here, listening to your points\u2014\u2014 Senator A LEXANDER . I have about 30 seconds to ask\u2014\u2014 Secretary P EREZ . No, no. So your point is very well-taken, and those are examples of the types of things that we need to consider moving forward. Senator A LEXANDER . I would encourage that. We have some big ideological differences on this committee, but we also get a lot done, sometimes unanimously, because we go through that process. Secretary P EREZ . I agree. UPDATING REGULATIONS ON OVERTIME Senator A LEXANDER . Now, what is going on here with the over- time? Normally, under the law, if you are going to change overtime regulations, which affect a maximum of 130 million\u2014you know, ev-erybody, working Americans. The law says you are supposed to come out once in the spring and once in the fall with these big regulatory changes. And you typically, I am paraphrasing here, but basically, you summarize what you are about to do, and you often indicate a schedule of when you are going to do it. And it lets people all over the country know what you are going to do. But here came a memo from the President that was outside the law that was basically making it look like it came from his State of the Union Address, where he said, if Congress won't do it, I am going to do it anyway. There is a law here that says if you are going to affect overtime rules, there is a way to do it. Why aren't you doing it that way? Secretary P EREZ . Well, we are. In fact, it is my understanding that the day the President announced this, we contacted your staff and offered to brief them. Senator A LEXANDER . Well, that has nothing to do with a law that says twice a year these kinds of regulations are supposed to be in-cluded in a document that is public to everybody, once in the spring and once in the fall. Shouldn't you get this back on that kind of track? Secretary P EREZ . Well, Senator, we are moving forward with the overtime rule, and we are doing so, and will continue to do so, in a way that is very consistent with how we did 503, and with how we are doing the other issue that you asked about, in terms of the conflict of interest. We have a long way to go. I have spoken to a lot of business leaders. I have spoken to other informed stakeholders, because I want to make sure that we get it right. We received your letter last night asking about this. We, cer- tainly, intend to respond to you in short order. I read that letter at roughly 8 o'clock or so last night, and I will make sure that we respond to all your questions on the overtime rule. Senator A LEXANDER . But what about the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Shouldn't you be doing this within the terms of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which is a law? 134 Secretary P EREZ . Well, we intend to have, and will continue to make sure that we are compliant with all of the regulatory\u2014\u2014 Senator A LEXANDER . It is a yes or no, isn't it? Shouldn't you only be doing that within the terms of the law and not freewheeling this? Secretary P EREZ . Well, I wouldn't describe anything that we are doing as freewheeling, sir. Again, there is a reason why we offered to brief you the day that we announced it, because we wanted to go on a bipartisan basis\u2014\u2014 Senator A LEXANDER . It does not say in the law, ''Go brief Senator Alexander.'' Secretary P EREZ [continuing]. And we went above and be- yond\u2014\u2014 Senator A LEXANDER . This is a law. Do this according to the terms of this act. And so far as I know, you haven't done it. If you are doing it, I would like to know it. Secretary P EREZ . Well, sir, we received your letter last night, and we will respond as soon as possible to your letter. I am confident that this process is going to mirror the processes that we undertake in all of our regulatory work. Senator A LEXANDER . Thank you. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you. Senator Merkley. Oh, I am just told we have a vote at 11 a.m. So Senator Merkley and then Senator Johanns. Senator Merkley. Senator M ERKLEY . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Secretary. Secretary P EREZ . Good morning, Senator. PROHIBITING WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY Senator M ERKLEY . Last month, I joined more than 200 Members in the House and Senate to send a letter to President Obama re-newing our request that the President issue an Executive order banning contractors from receiving Federal Government contracts unless they have a policy of prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. According to various reports, your department has completed its preparatory work, and that decisionmaking now rests with the White House. Understanding that the department would play a critical role in implementing any Executive order, are there any additional actions the department is taking to prepare or that it could take to prepare for the possibility of such an order? Secretary P EREZ . I recall the letter. I read the letter. I believe we actually responded to the letter, if my memory serves me, or we are in the process of responding. I appreciate your longstanding leadership not only on ENDA (Employment Non-Discrimination Act), but on the whole issue of nondiscrimination. We are working very hard on this issue. I worked very hard on this issue at the Department of Justice (DOJ). The first hearing I 135 had after I was confirmed to DOJ was on ENDA, the bill that you introduced, and was one of the original cosponsors of. We are going to continue those efforts, because I want to make sure that everybody gets judged by the content of their character and the quality of the work that they do and no irrelevant factors. This matter continues to be a matter of significant importance to the administration, to me, and to the Department or Labor. Senator M ERKLEY . Thank you. I appreciate that. And I will just use this occasion to continue my urging that\u2014I was very pleased that the Senate, on a bipartisan, 2-to-1 basis, said it was time to end discrimination in the workplace. It doesn't appear that bill is going to get a vote in the House. I wish there would be a vote. There should be a vote on something as key to our Constitution as equality and opportunity. But in the absence of such action, I want to continue my encour- agement for the President to consider issuing an Executive order in this regard. IMPLEMENTING REASONABLE BREAK TIME FOR NURSING MOTHERS PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT Let me turn to a second issue. The Affordable Care Act included a section called Reasonable Break Time for Nursing Mothers. It is a provision I took from work that I have done in Oregon State, that women going back to work who have just had babies have the pri-vacy and flexibility and break time to express breast milk, which is not only wonderful for the health of the baby but is also wonder-ful for the health of the mother and has been widely embraced in Oregon. We have a clause that allows a company to exempt itself, and not a single company has exempted itself. They have all found ways to make this work. So it has been implemented at the national level through your department, and I just want to check in to see if appropriate re-sources for educating companies, assisting companies to find a way to make sure that this bill could work, are occurring, and whether you have any insights in the implementation. Secretary P EREZ . Well, again, thank you for your leadership on this. This is one of those really important issues that confront working mothers. I recall, when I was at DOJ, we took steps prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act to address these issues, because it was the right thing to do, and it was the smart thing to do. We continue to take our responsibility in this regard very seri- ously. I would say that our experience has been identical to how you describe your experience in Oregon, Senator, which is that tech-nical assistance and education have been very, very successful. Em-ployers recognize that this is, again, the right thing to do, the smart thing to do, and they are doing it. Senator M ERKLEY . Thank you. And if there are challenges that arise, I, certainly, would like to hear about them, as we think about how to expand this, not just from the current law, which is for wage-earning workers, but we like to expand it to cover salaried workers as well. 136 And I won't ask you now, but if you have any thoughts on chal- lenges on such an expansion, it would be appreciated. Secretary P EREZ . Sure. CONVERTING THE EXPERIMENTAL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR THE ELDERLY INTO AN OFFICIAL PUBLISHED INDEX Senator M ERKLEY . With the balance of my time, I wanted to ask about the Consumer Price Index (CPI)-E (for the elderly). I would like to see the Department of Labor convert the experimental CPI- E into a fully official published index. The CPI-W (Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers) only represents about 32 percent of the U.S. population. It doesn't re-flect the inflation experience of older Americans. And according to the Congressional Research Service, the cost of living under CPI- W rose at an average rate of 2.9 percent over that period of time, while the cost of living for seniors rose at 3.2 percent, or roughly, if you will, a 0.3 percent difference. Over time, that makes a difference, a significant difference, as we think about having accurate indexes for areas that it might be applied, such as in Social Security. So I just would like to express this interest in seeing the depart- ment pursue that conversion from the experimental to the officially published index, and whether you have any insights or comments on that. Secretary P EREZ . Sure. Well, this is not the first time I have heard this, and it is an important issue. I appreciate you bringing it to our attention. I meet regularly with the head of BLS (U.S. Bu-reau of Labor Statistics) to have this discussion. One of the challenges that we are working through is that there are some design issues, cost issues. However, I also recognize the point that you are making, and I look forward to talking to you and really getting your insight as we move forward to figure out what the best course of action is in this area. Senator M ERKLEY . Thank you very much. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Johanns. Senator J OHANNS . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary P EREZ . Good morning, Senator. Senator J OHANNS . Good to see you, Mr. Secretary. Secretary P EREZ . Good to see you, Senator. FAMILY FARM EXEMPTION UNDER THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT Senator J OHANNS . Let me, if I might, just ask a question or two to follow-up on the questions that Senator Moran asked you about the family farm exemption. I thank the Senator from Kansas for bringing this up, because this is a very important issue, and not just in Nebraska, but across the country. As Senator Moran pointed out, for about 35 years, Congress has looked at this area and put language in that basically said, if you employ more than 10 outside employees, then you are subject to OSHA. If not, then you are not. 137 And lo and behold, that world changed, and I appreciate the fact that the memorandum has now been pulled back, and I know the enforcement actions have been pulled back. Let me ask you this, just so I understand your testimony relative to what you were asked by Senator Moran. You said that if there are fewer than 10 outside employees, the inquiry is over. Is that the current position of the Department of Labor? So you are working with a farm, fewer than 10 outside employ- ees, you take no further action? Secretary P EREZ . If it is a farming operation with fewer than 10 people, that is my understanding of what the rider was intended to get at, and that is the end of the story. Senator J OHANNS . Okay. And so long as that language is in the rider, that will continue to be the position of the Department of Labor? Secretary P EREZ . Yes, sir. Senator J OHANNS . Okay. Do you have any current plans, as you know, I would say, you were attempting or your department was attempting to get around this language by classifying certain pieces of the farming operation as not a part of the farming operation. In this case, it would be grain storage. Theoretically, it could be a whole host of things. Do you have any current plans that your goal would be to sepa- rate certain operations that I would regard as farming operations from that definition and thereby go in and regulate? Secretary P EREZ . We don't have current plans. What I have learned from my experience getting up to speed on this is that sometimes answering the question of whether you are a family farm is easier said than done. I spend a lot of time in rural Wisconsin. That is where my in- laws live, and we go up there two or three times a year. It is all farm country. And what we have seen in some cases is that when we go in, there was one facility that had a tomato canning oper-ation on the side. There were others where their grain silos were actually servicing a number of other farms in the area. There was another case where when they were asked to define their operation, they used a code that was above and beyond what the definition of a family farm was. One of the things I have learned from this is that it is easier said than done. What we are trying to do, and make sure we do a better job of, is determine, at the outset, what is the operation that we are seeking to go into, and get that answer. If the answer is as we just discussed, then that is the end of the issue. The thing that was motivating us in this case, and I think we all have a shared interest, is making sure that we prevent deaths in grain silos; that was the issue that was out there. We have done a lot of work, very collaboratively, with farmers and associations to prevent these very tragic deaths that were the impetus for some of this work. Senator J OHANNS . Yes, and we, certainly, share that. I grew up on a farm myself. I have been around grain bins, power takeoff shafts, all of those things. Secretary P EREZ . Right. 138 Senator J OHANNS . But having said that, here is what I am get- ting to: When it comes to family farms, haven't we, as Congress with this rider language, basically told you what we believe the sit-uation is in terms of how to define a family farm? We have said, if you have more than 10 outside employees, guess what, you are no longer a family operation. According to our view of the world, you are something else, and subject to OSHA jurisdiction. If you are under 10, on the other hand, you are a family farming oper-ation. Would you agree with that? Secretary P EREZ . I would agree with that. I would also note that you instructed us to consult with USDA (U.S. Department of Agri-culture) on this issue and make sure that we have guidance that is consistent with your directive. I can tell you that we are in the middle of doing that as well, and that we have begun that process, pursuant to your request. That has been very, very helpful, so that we can make sure that we understand the situations that you have clearly defined, that the Department of Labor, OSHA should not be in, and that we can ensure we are in compliance. Senator J OHANNS . Right. Here is my thought on that, and I am out of time, so I will wrap up here very quickly, no one wants these deaths to occur. They are just hugely tragic. Oftentimes, they in-volve young people, and we don't want that to happen. I think if you would work with us, USDA, the Farm Bureau, FFA (Future Farmers of America), 4-H, on and on, about a program that says, look, here are some practices we would like to talk about in terms of protecting yourself, and kind of a self-education, edu-cation awareness program. I was in FFA growing up, 4-H, both. And I just think they would embrace it. I think they would say to you, yes, that makes so much sense to us. And they probably have programs like that going on anyway. That is where I really want you to focus your attention, because I think we have defined family farms as something less than 10 employees, outside employees. So I will continue to encourage you the way I did in my letter. Reach out, work with us. That is really what we are trying to achieve here, a safer environment for that kind of process. Secretary P EREZ . I look forward to working with you on that, be- cause we have learned a lot and we have actually had some success working collaboratively. I would like to go to school on your experi-ence, so that we can really fulfill our shared interest in preventing tragic deaths. Senator J OHANNS . Great. Thank you. Secretary P EREZ . Thank you. FARM SAFETY FOR JUST KIDS ORGANIZATION Senator H ARKIN . If I might, I just want to add to that, I would encourage you, Mr. Secretary, and your staff, to reach out to an or-ganization called Farm Safety for Just Kids. It was started by Marilyn Adams about, oh, about 30 years ago, I guess. Her son lost his life in a grain silo accident. So she started an organization to start teaching farmers about farm safety. A lot of kids work on farms. And kids, nothing can 139 hurt you when you are a kid, you know. They take all kinds of chances. They have built up a great deal of expertise over the years. It has become a national organization. I don't know if their head-quarters are still in Iowa or not, or where it is. Senator J OHANNS . I think in Iowa. Senator H ARKIN . It is still there? They have done great work in teaching farmers and farm families how to set up systems so that kids don't get hurt, young people don't get hurt. I will just say, as long as you are pursuing this thing, to check with that group. They really have developed a lot of expertise. Secretary P EREZ . I will make sure that we do that. Senator J OHANNS . Mr. Chairman, I am so glad you mentioned that, because she is outstanding. I met with her when I was Sec-retary of Agriculture. Senator H ARKIN . Is that so? Senator J OHANNS . This came about because of a very tragic event, but she has taken that as kind of a catalyst to really engage here. She has laid a tremendous foundation. I wasn't thinking about that when I was talking about whom to partner with here, but that would be perfect. Senator H ARKIN . Yes. I just found out she retired, so now the or- ganization has taken on different people. It was taken over and continues, so she built quite an organization. But I just say, have your people look at that, because they have a lot of good background information on this. Secretary P EREZ . We have been doing a lot, and we can learn a lot more from all of you. So we look forward to doing that. Senator H ARKIN . I know we are going to be called for a vote pret- ty soon. I just have one short question, and that is on employee misclassification. Secretary P EREZ . Yes. IDENTIFYING AND COMBATING EMPLOYEE MISCLASSIFICATION Senator H ARKIN . You mentioned that the budget provides for $14 million to identify and combat misclassification, and you say this includes $10 million in continued grants to States to recover un-paid unemployment taxes at $3.8 million of the Wage and Hour Di-vision increase for personnel to investigate violations. Is the total amount that you are putting in for employee misclassification $14 million? Or is it $27 million or $28 million? I am trying to figure out\u2014\u2014 Secretary P . $14 million, sir. Senator H ARKIN . $14 million. Again, I just want to encourage you, I hear so much about employee misclassification, both as the chairman of the authorizing committee, but as a Senator from Iowa, too. I just hear a lot about this, about misclassification, and how workers are really, well, I will say it frankly, being cheated out of what they should be paid, because of misclassification. I en-courage you to really pursue this. Secretary P EREZ . Thank you. I hear this as much as anything from business owners. There was a guy, he develops residential housing, and he tells me, ''Tom, I am playing by the rules. I am paying my employees. I pay their workers comp. I do all that. The 140 guy down the road who is competing with me is paying everyone under the table. I keep getting undercut. I can't do this, and I don't want to cheat.'' There are three victims: There is the worker, himself or herself; there are the business owners who are playing by the rules; and there is the tax collector. And I saw this in Maryland. We called it workplace fraud in Maryland. Senator H ARKIN . That is what it is. Secretary P EREZ . Because ''misclassification'' feels like a clerical error. You have to call it what it is. We are doing partnerships with States. We have MOUs (memo- randa of understanding) with States across this country, and it is not a red state/blue state thing. We have partnerships with Utah. We have partnerships with other States, because it is a real issue across this country. Senator H ARKIN . A big issue. That is all I have. Senator M ORAN . Do I have time for one more? Senator H ARKIN . Sure you do. IMPROVING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS Senator M ORAN . Mr. Secretary, what do we need to do to signifi- cantly improve the opportunities for veterans' employment? You have a number of tools. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) works on these issues. But we continue to have a significant chal-lenge in this country with our veterans returning, with our military men and women returning and becoming veterans and unable to find employment. Secretary P EREZ . This is one of those things that I spend as much time on as any, Senator. There are a lot of tools in the tool- box. One of the tools, as it relates to the fiscal year budget request for this coming year, is the enhanced RES (Reemployment Serv-ices)/REA, that is targeted at two populations. It will enable us to target two populations, veterans coming out of service and the long-term unemployed, so that we can help them get the training they need. One other thing we are doing, and I know you have to run to a vote, but we are working very closely with the VA and DOD (De-partment of Defense) to get people further upstream. With the mandatory discharge, as the drawdown in Afghanistan picks up, what we are trying to do now is get them 6 months before they are actually out of the service, and then figure out, what are your goals? We don't want to get them for the first time when they are doing transition assistance a week before they are leaving. We want to get them 6 months upstream, so that we can help connect them perhaps to the apprenticeship program, so when they leave, they are ready to work. We are doing a lot of work upstream. We are doing a lot more work through the First Lady's office with the business community. We just had an event with the construction industry, and we have a lot of individual employers who stepped up. 141 However, in the construction industry, what they did was they said that we are going to embed veteran hiring into the DNA of all of what we do, not just the ABC Company, but every employer. You have Helmets to Hardhats that the labor unions and others have put forth. I am really heartened by what I see in terms of the level of inter- est. The demand is growing and growing, and that is why this has been an all-hands-on-deck enterprise for the administration. I welcome any ideas you have about how we can do it better, be- cause nobody has a monopoly on good ideas in this. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Secretary, let me suggest to you that a con- cept that I have a lot of interest in is entrepreneurship, the ability to start a business. We have worked with the Department of Vet-erans Affairs in trying to have them focus some of the benefits that a veteran is entitled to for education, for training, on the ability to create the capital necessary to start a business. And if there are ways that we can work with the Department of Labor to create an environment in which a startup, a new business origination, it very well may be a veteran's choice, but may not have the tools to accomplish that. So while I ask about employment, and that would lend itself to thinking about training and education, in addition to that, if you put into your broad thinking, are there ways to help a veteran who has an entrepreneurial idea pursue the American dream in their garage or their barn, take an idea to market? We want to explore those opportunities with the Department of Labor as well. Secretary P EREZ . I love it, and I would love to brainstorm with you. Senator M ORAN . Thanks very much. Secretary P EREZ . Great. Thank you. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. CLOSING STATEMENTS First, before you all leave, I also want to recognize Terri Bergman for all your years of public service, both at DOL, but also on the Hill when you were here and working with us and when you were over on the House side. You have been, I shouldn't say, just a familiar face; you have been an integral part of a lot of our appro-priations processes for a long, long time. I understand you are retiring and relocating to Cape Cod. Let me know how it is up there. I am retiring next year, myself. But again, you have been a tremendous asset as the Deputy As- sistant Secretary on our Congressional and Governmental Affairs. And I know I can speak on behalf of all of our staff in saying we are going to miss you. You have been a great asset to the smooth functioning of this process, and we thank you for your years of pub-lic service. We wish you well in your retirement. ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS Now, Mr. Secretary, thank you again for being here, for your forthrightness and your openness in responding to our questions. 142 The record will remain open for additional statements and ques- tions for 10 days. [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but were submitted to the Department for response subsequent to the hear-ing:] QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR TOMHARKIN BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS EFFORTS TO COMBAT CHILD LABOR ABUSES ABROAD Question. Mr. Secretary, as you know, I have been a strong supporter of the Bu- reau of International Labor Affairs' (ILAB) efforts to protect labor rights and combat the worst forms of child labor around the world. In fact, you and I were together last week with the Ivorian and Ghanaian government representatives assessing some of the progress with have made in reducing the worst forms of child labor in the cocoa sector as a result of some technical assistance programs funded through ILAB. I want to give you an opportunity to comment on an element of ILAB's work that is particularly close to my heart: ILAB's technical assistance projects. Would you please share some of the ways that these projects are making a difference on the ground and, discuss some of the safeguards in place to ensure that project funds are well spent on this critical mission? Answer. ILAB's technical assistance funding is an essential element of its success- ful efforts to advance worker rights and livelihoods throughout the world. Since 1995, DOL has funded 278 projects in 94 countries to address child labor. Currently, DOL is funding 37 active projects in 64 countries, worth over $240 million. These projects use an integrated approach that helps remove and prevent children from exploitative work, while offering them schooling alternatives and livelihood support for their families, so that they can overcome reliance on the labor of their children to meet basic needs. To date, DOL-funded child labor reduction projects have res-cued approximately 1.7 million children from exploitative child labor. DOL projects also play a major role in building the capacity of governments and other key actors to combat child labor at the national, district, and community levels. In addition, DOL projects train labor inspectors and law enforcement officials to improve child labor law enforcement. In addition, ILAB funds technical assistance projects that address broader worker rights issues, particularly in those countries with which the United States has free trade agreements and trade preference programs. These projects promote the effec-tive enforcement of labor laws by strengthening labor inspections systems, raising awareness and capacity of employers to comply with labor law and of workers to exercise and claim their rights, improving occupational safety and health, promoting productive labor-management relations, and strengthening social safety nets for vul-nerable workers. We consider oversight of technical assistance funding to be one of ILAB's most im- portant responsibilities. We use a variety of tools to ensure proper oversight. Projects funded by DOL are required to submit regular technical and financial progress reports. DOL uses these reports to track the grantees' use of funds and im-plementation of agreed upon project activities. DOL also contracts with inde-pendent, external evaluators and auditors, who are charged with assessing project performance and compliance with required regulations. Through the use of this com-bination of oversight tools, DOL seeks to ensure proper use of USG funds and to maximize project benefits for workers, children, and families in target communities. WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION PLANS TO PREVENT ABUSES OF WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES Question. Mr. Secretary, the Department plays a critical role in promoting ramps and ladders of opportunity for all Americans and in protecting their rights in the workplace. That's why I know you share my outrage about the abuse of workers with disabilities that occurred in Atalissa, Iowa. Please tell me what your specific plans are for making sure we never have another situation like that at Henry's Tur-key Service? Answer. Since 2010, the Department has initiated a full review of its procedures for enforcement and administration of section 14(c). A number of changes have al-ready been made. For example, Henry's Turkey Service allowed their certificate au-thorizing the payment of subminimum wages pursuant to section 14(c) to lapse and indicated they would choose to pay the full minimum wage equivalent to all work-ers, but we later learned that they did not do so. The Department's strategic en-forcement protocols for 14(c) now includes a sampling of lapsed certificate holders 143 1http://wdr.doleta.gov/research/keyword.cfm?fuseaction=dsp lpuListingDetails&pub lid= 2487&mp=y&start=21&sort=7 to ensure these former certificate holders are not continuing to pay subminimum wages in violation of the law. In addition, the Department has initiated action to revoke certificates in certain circumstances, and is currently developing standard-ized protocols for dissemination to all staff on revocation of certificates for egregious or willful violations of the law. With an increase in FTE for the enforcement of sec-tion 14(c), the Department will be able to increase its directed enforcement activity and further develop strategies to address the most egregious violators. The Department also partners with other Federal agencies such as the Depart- ment of Justice, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that employers with 14(c) certificates provide adequate protections to individuals with disabilities. These collaborations help to ensure that all protections are available to workers with disabilities as a part of a comprehen-sive and vigorous enforcement program. In addition to its enforcement efforts, the Department is committed to ensuring that all our stakeholders\u2014employers, community rehabilitation programs, advo-cates, and workers\u2014fully understand the rules that apply to employing workers with disabilities at subminimum wage rates. We have increased our outreach to stakeholders, conducting at least 10-day-long seminars on section 14(c) each year since 2012. These seminars are free and open to all interested parties. Finally, the Department has recently added a senior advisor to enforcement agency staff to help promote and connect the work we do in section 14(c) with national, regional, and local organizations who work with people with disabilities. This key staff member will help ensure the agency has an open line of communication for workers and their advocates. REEMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENTS Question. Mr. Secretary, since 2005, this subcommittee has provided more than $400 million to support Reemployment and Eligibility Assessments (REAs). As you know, the President's budget request includes $158 million, an increase of $78 mil-lion, to expand the existing REA program to include reemployment services. This enhanced model would provide personalized assistance to unemployed workers and target services to UI claimants most likely to exhaust their benefits and to all re-turning service members who are receiving unemployment benefits. Can you explain why the model of combining REAs and reemployment services as proposed in the President's budget is effective in helping people get jobs faster and preventing long- term unemployment? Answer. There is a compelling rationale for supporting an expanded integrated Reemployment Services and Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment (REA) pro-gram to support rapid reemployment of UI claimants and to reduce UI improper payments. Research has shown that both REAs and the provision of reemployment services to UI claimants\u2014and particularly the combination of the two\u2014are effective at reducing UI costs. Both models reduce UI duration and save UI trust fund re-sources by helping claimants find jobs faster and eliminating payments to ineligible individuals. REAs have been found to be effective in reducing duration and total benefits received by claimants in Florida, Idaho, and Nevada. Nevada's model was particularly effective in reducing benefit costs. A further study of the Nevada model, which delivered REAs seamlessly with reemployment services, found it to be signifi-cantly more effective than the other states studied in the following ways: 1 \u2014Claimants were significantly less likely to exhaust their benefits; \u2014Claimants had significantly shorter UI durations and lower total benefits paid (1.82 fewer weeks and $536 lower total benefits paid); \u2014Claimants were more successful in returning to work sooner in jobs with higher wages and retaining their jobs; and \u2014The savings from the program were almost 3 times higher than the cost. This integrated approach was also explored in the implementation of the Emer- gency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program when it was extended through December of 2013. In addition, on February 14, 2014, Nevada's REA model was recognized as a ''Near Top Tier Initiative'' by the nonprofit, non-partisan Coalition for Evidence- Based Policy. 144 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JACK REED JOB CORPS PROGRAM YEAR 2012 SURPLUS Question. The Job Corps Program ended Program Year (PY) 2012 with a substan- tial surplus. In January, 20 of my colleagues and I sent a letter urging the Employ-ment and Training Administration (ETA) to prioritize increasing the number of stu-dents served with the surplus funds. We also asked that ETA develop a plan for increasing On Board Strength (OBS) in a transparent manner, in collaboration with Job Corps stakeholders. Please provide information on: \u2014The exact dollar amount of the PY 2012 surplus; \u2014The factors that led to the surplus; \u2014How the surplus funds will be utilized, including the dollar amounts that will be allocated for specific activities; \u2014The plan for increasing OBS, including the timing and allocation by Job Corps center of additional OBS; and \u2014The steps that the Department is taking to maximize OBS for PY 2013 and PY 2014. Answer. The Exact Dollar Amount of the PY 2012 Surplus .\u2014In consultation with the contractors, the Department determined that there were PY 2012 funds that re-mained unspent and uncommitted on the center operators' contracts for PY 2013. After an evaluation of the balances remaining on the contracts and negotiations with the contractors, we were able to reduce center operators' funding PY 2013 needs by $40,060,523 due to funds remaining available on these contracts and the ability to spend funds across fiscal or program years. This reduction in center oper-ator needs in PY 2013 allows Job Corps to use the funds to address additional crit-ical needs. The Factors That Led to the Surplus .\u2014The underrun occurred due to cost savings measures implemented in Program Year (PY) 2012 and the slower than anticipated enrollment of students after the enrollment suspension was lifted in April 2013. Ex-penditures by contractors were, in a majority of cases, less than what was obligated to the contracts, and that funding remained available on those contracts after the end of PY 2012. DOL worked with the contractors to quantify how much funding remained available on their contracts, as well as to determine their funding needs for the remainder of both the contract year and PY 2013. This collaborative process resulted in the identification of approximately $40 million in obligated but unspent and uncommitted funds that remained on the contracts. We reached agreement with the contractors that this amount would be reduced from their remaining PY 2013 allocations, allowing Job Corps to repurpose the money for the remainder of PY 2013. How the Surplus Funds Will Be Utilized, Including the Dollar Amounts That Will Be Allocated for Specific Activities .\u2014As a result of the cost savings, Job Corps will re-allocate some PY 2013 funds for crucial needs, including ramping up on-board strength (OBS) to the proposed PY 2014 level, improving Job Corps infrastructure, examining program design, and strengthening procurement support. Because we are committed to ensuring that the Job Corps program serves as many students as affordable under the appropriation, we have allocated a portion of the recaptured funds to begin to ramp up to the PY 2014 OBS level supported by the Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act (Public Law 113-76). We recently announced the plan for increasing OBS to the PY 2014 levels, and have begun work-ing with the Job Corps operators to implement it. The methodology considers per-formance, center capacity, and prioritization of high-performing Career Technical Training (CTT) programs. In addition to increasing OBS to the level that can be afforded in PY 2014, we are using the recaptured funds to make important investments in the Job Corps program that have not occurred in recent years due to the budget constraints. These program investments include: \u2014Job Corps Infrastructure .\u2014Job Corps has implemented a much-needed mod- ernization of equipment and technology at Job Corps Centers. A recent survey of Job Corps operators indicated specific equipment needs at Job Corps Centers, many of which were items that are worn, broken, outdated, or have created safety concerns. These equipment purchases were prioritized to help ensure that our students have a safe and effective learning environment where the stu-dents are trained on equipment that can continue to meet accreditation stand-ards. This investment includes not only training equipment, but educational and information technology (IT) upgrades that will benefit current and future students. 145 \u2014Program Redesign and Streamlining .\u2014The Program and Requirements Hand- book (PRH), the key guiding document for Job Corps activities, is cumbersome and outdated. We are reexamining the program's design to create a more cost- effective program model, while also updating operational standards to better serve today's students. We are dedicating a small portion of the funds to a com-plete review of the program design and a revision of the 1,371-page PRH. This will be a collaborative and open process, and we have already begun collecting input from Job Corps' many stakeholders. \u2014Procurement Support .\u2014A small portion of the funds is being invested towards responding to a recommendation from the Office of the Inspector General's Job Corps financial audit. This funding will be used to acquire expert assistance through contractors to assist with the preparation of Independent Government Cost Estimates (IGCEs). See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.404-1. An IGCE is the government's own assessment of what a particular scope of work, activity, service, or product needed should cost based on an evaluation of a similar scope of work, activity, service, or product available in the private marketplace. As part of the acquisition process, this expertise will improve the Department's estimate of the operating costs of contracts for Job Corps centers, outreach and admissions, and career transition assistance for students. This is one of many steps we continue to take to ensure contracting integrity and sound financial management. \u2014Contract Closeouts .\u2014ETA is working with Job Corps center operators to rec- oncile historical obligations to actual costs incurred, such as direct costs for serving students and adjustments to indirect cost rates. We are currently work-ing to review close-out claims submitted by contractors and want to ensure we have funds available to pay all liabilities owed. The Plan for Increasing OBS, Including the Timing and Allocation by Job Corps Center of Additional OBS .\u2014ETA recently announced the plan for increasing OBS to the PY 2014 levels, and we have begun working with the Job Corps operators to implement it. The Steps That the Department Is Taking to Maximize OBS for PY 2013 and PY 2014 .\u2014The reduction in contracted OBS in PY 2012 was a critical step undertaken to ensure financial stability within the program and establish an OBS level for PY 2013 that was supportable under the fiscal year 2013 appropriation, including se- questration. We are continuing to monitor contractor expenditures against OBS lev-els as we evaluate the efficacy of our OBS levels and contract amounts. Based on an increased appropriation in fiscal year 2014 and reviews of the contract expendi-tures and OBS levels, DOL plans to increase OBS levels to a level supportable in PY 2014 to ensure the program serves the most students possible within the appro-priation. REVISION OF PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS HANDBOOK FOR JOB CORPS Question. The Department has indicated that it plans to undertake a full revision of the Program Requirements Handbook for the Job Corps program. Please provide a detailed plan for the review process, including timelines, staffing requirements, and the estimated cost. Answer. Job Corps has launched an initiative to re-examine its policies and prac- tices to create a more streamlined, focused and efficient system for the delivery of essential residential, job-based training services to youth to ensure they are pre-pared with the industry-recognized education and technical credentials to enter and remain attached to the workforce. The process is collaborative, leveraging the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience within the Job Corps community. It will result in a full revision of the program's Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH). The process, timeline, staffing requirements and estimated costs are as follows.

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JERRY MORAN INSPECTOR GENERAL 'S REPORT /CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR JOB CORPS Question. Mr. Secretary, the Job Corps program ran significant funding shortfalls in Program Year 2011 and 2012. As a result, enrollment freezes and reductions in on-board strength occurred at Job Corps centers. The Department of Labor's Inspec-tor General released an audit report in May 2013 that reviewed the internal con-trols in place and found that programmatic, budgetary, and managerial problems as a well as a lack of proper program integrity controls contributed to the budget short- falls. The fiscal year 2014 Senate Labor/HHS report directed the Department to pro-vide a report no later than December 1, 2013, on the progress of the Department's implementation of the Inspector General's recommendations. While this report is de-layed, I hope you can update us on the Department's progress. What changes have been made in the financial system after the budget shortfalls? Answer. The Department has implemented strong oversight and cost-saving measures to ensure that the Job Corps program remains solvent and is able to de-liver education and vocational services to participants served. ETA's Office of Finan-cial Administration (OFA) has instituted several initiatives to strengthen and co-ordinate existing controls and create new controls to ensure that obligations stayed within budget and to track contractor expenditures against their submitted spend plans. Working closely with ETA's Office of Contracts Management (OCM), which was created in 2010 to consolidate all ETA contracting in the national and regional offices, OFA ensures that Job Corps' centers cost reimbursements are accounted for in a more timely and accurate way. The added coordination between OFA and OCM has resulted in significant improvements in the financial oversight of Job Corps. In addition, funds have been set aside to integrate the Job Corps program's financial reporting systems with those of ETA to further this critical coordination. Finally, additional training has been provided to staff members who monitor Job Corps con-tracts to enable them to provide better oversight and improve their ability to mon-itor these contracts. Progress toward resolving the issue has been a priority. Of the six recommenda- tions in the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) report, four are classified by the OIG as ''Resolved and/or Closed.'' ETA is committed to resolving the remaining two 147 recommendations as soon as possible. Below is the status of the six recommenda- tions. Additional details are available on the Job Corps Web site: http:// www.jobcorps.gov/AboutJobCorps/performance lplanning/oigreport.aspx. 1. Resolved .\u2014Establish necessary criteria and thresholds for detecting poten- tial financial and program risks to be routinely documented and communicated, and identify the appropriate personnel within DOL to receive this periodic infor-mation. 2. In Progress .\u2014Develop and implement formal policies and procedures or en- hance existing policies and procedures. 3. Resolved .\u2014Conduct a formal assessment of human capital resources needed for processes and internal controls over Job Corps funds, and periodically up- date the assessment. 4. In Progress .\u2014Periodically review and update the policy for developing cost models applied in determining the IGCE used in Job Corps center contracting activities to incorporate the use of more current guidance and assumptions. 5. Resolved .\u2014Formally reconcile data on a routine basis between NCFMS, JFAS, and JC-FMS. 6. Resolved .\u2014Evaluate the system interfaces between NCFMS, JFAS, and JC-FMS. ETA currently is refining the process for OJC planning, requirements determina- tion, budgeting, and evaluation in order to enhance internal controls beyond the ac-tions already taken. This effort will lay out a more defined process for all aspects of OJC financial and contractual activity for a program year well in advance of the start of the year and allow for a more rapid response to OJC budget changes. Question. What assurances can you give us that additional budget shortfalls will not occur? Answer. In recent years, we faced a serious challenge when the Office of Job Corps projected a funding shortfall and was temporarily forced to suspend new stu-dent enrollment. Job Corps has adopted recommendations made by the Office of In-spector General (OIG) and has undertaken a variety of measures to strengthen con-tract oversight and financial management of the program. In particular, Job Corps and the Department's Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) have established mechanisms for detecting potential financial and program risks to improve related policies, procedures, and internal controls, and to routinely reconcile accounting sys-tems data. In addition, Job Corps has adjusted student on-board strength OBS to levels that are sustainable within its appropriation and is using improved processes to prevent similar issues in the future as DOL takes steps to increase the OBS. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has developed a new on-board strength cost model to help the Job Corps program better track operational costs by center and project differences between centers' spending plans and actual ex-penditures. These actions, taken together, will ensure that Job Corps can prevent future issues and correct for past deficiencies. We are also committed to reviewing the contracting approaches for the program, and determining what type of contracts will allow us to deliver services at the lowest risk and best value to the Federal Gov-ernment. Question. What steps have been taken to prevent Job Corps' financial problems from re-emerging? Answer. ETA has undertaken a variety of measures to strengthen contract over- sight and financial management of the Job Corps program. These include thorough analysis and monitoring of programmatic and financial data; aligning the number of students with the levels supportable under the program's appropriation; improv-ing communication between program, contracting, fiscal, and agency leadership; and improving contract administration and oversight as well as providing additional training for contracting staff. These necessary changes will ensure that we will not have this problem in the future. JOB CORPS CENTER CLOSURES Question. The Administration has stated in both the fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 budget requests that it plans to close a ''small number of centers that are chronically low-performing.'' In January 2013, the Department issued a notice seeking public comment on the proposed methodology for closing centers. However, no further public action has been taken. Yet, the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request assumes a savings for the Job Corps program of $11.6 million resulting from the closure of centers. Mr. Secretary, does that figure mean that the Department will close centers in fiscal year 2015? Answer. The Department continues to finalize the closure methodology and plans to issue a Federal Register Notice responding to comments received from the public 148 and announcing the revised proposed methodology as the next public action. The Department has not yet established a date for publication of the final closure meth-odology. Question. If so, how many centers will close? Answer. The Department continues to finalize the closure methodology and has not yet determined the exact number of centers for closure or the individual centers that will be closed. Question. What methodology will be adopted for closing centers? Answer. The Department continues to finalize the closure methodology and will issue a Federal Register Notice responding to comments received from the public. Question. How will the slots at the centers closing be redistributed throughout the Job Corps program? Answer. We have not yet made a final decision about slot redistributions. As we move forward with this process, we will work with the Job Corps stakeholder com-munity to take these considerations into account. JOB CORPS NEW ON -BOARD STRENGTH MODEL Question. In Program Year 2012, the Employment and Training Administration formulated a new on-board strength model. How will the new on-board strength model help the Job Corps program to better account for operational costs and pre-vent future budgetary shortfalls? Answer. The new on-board strength (OBS) model recognizes the relationship be- tween students and costs. The key results of this recognition allowed Job Corps to create a methodology to better account for operational costs, prevent future budg-etary shortfalls, and avoid a repeat of past ''savings drills.'' The model provides a new method for Job Corps' budgeting, provides a logical basis for decisionmaking, and recognizes that the center funding level should be based on OBS level\u2014i.e. number of student slots. This model was developed and implemented in February- March 2013. The assumptions of the model are listed below: \u2014Relationship between center costs and the number of students; \u2014Variation by each of Job Corps' 29 cost categories for each Center; \u2014Tie inflation increases to projected increases in the budget; \u2014Restore reductions to critical academic support areas; \u2014Base Job Corps student slots on the appropriation level in each Program Year. While the new model is essential to the continuity of operations, it requires a sta- ble program of operation and accurate and timely submission of costs by Job Corps contractors to be evaluated. The Department continues to work on refining and im-proving the model. Question. Were stakeholders consulted in the process of developing this new on- board strength model? Answer. The on-board strength (OBS) model was developed to identify the afford- able levels of OBS based on data supplied by contractors and the appropriated budg-et. A center's OBS level was initially based on the centers' previous OBS level. ETA and the Job Corps community have established a workgroup to examine current fi-nancial management reporting practices in the Job Corps community. ETA has shared the OBS model with that workgroup, though no decisions will come from the workgroup. This workgroup is comprised of Job Corps contractors and other stake-holders. Job Corps is committed to continued open communication with the Job Corps community to harness their expertise. Question. If so, how were they consulted? Answer. ETA and the Job Corps community have established a workgroup com- prised of Job Corps contractors and other stakeholders to examine current financial management reporting practices in the Job Corps community, and ETA has shared the OBS model with that workgroup, though no decisions will come from the group. In addition, the Department has briefed Congressional staff on the model and con-tinues to work with the contractor community on improving the data used in the model. SECTOR STRATEGIES Question. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget requests $15 million for a new Sector Strategies competitive grant initiative that would encourage development and implementation of sector strategies, or partnerships, of local businesses, re-gional workforce boards, and educational organizations to support and develop the workforce needs of specific industries in that area. A January 2012 GAO report enti-tled ''Innovative Collaborations between Workforce Boards and Employers Helped Meet Local Needs,'' highlighted Sector Strategies as an important workforce ap-proach for meeting the skill needs of workers and employers within local or regional 149 economies. Will you share with us the details of the Department's new Sector Strat- egies initiative? Answer. The Department's request for $15 million for a new Sector Strategies competitive grant initiative will provide funds to states, regions, or localities to im-plement sector-based strategies that meet the needs of small, medium, and large businesses in in-demand sectors. The Department anticipates awarding competitive grants to implement sector- based strategies to meet the dual goals of meeting the needs of businesses while providing training and career advancement opportunities for targeted populations. These grants would support the development of partnerships between the workforce system, business, community colleges, economic development, and others such as or- ganized labor, the adult basic education system, and supportive service providers. The grants also would be used to modify existing training based on business de-mand as well as train and provide career advancement opportunities for targeted populations such as acutely or chronically long term unemployed, low-wage workers, new labor market entrants, and veterans. In addition, the Department will award smaller capacity building grants to States to support or promote the development of sector partnerships. State applicants would identify a local or regional area that would pilot the capacity-building activi-ties during the grant period. Question. In particular, how many grants will be awarded and at approximately what amount per grant? Answer. Through the Sector Strategies competitive grant initiative, the Depart- ment anticipates awarding four to five grants potentially ranging in size from $2- 3 million to implement sector-based strategies to meet the dual goals of meeting the needs of businesses while providing training and career advancement opportunities for targeted populations. The Department also anticipates awarding approximately five, smaller capacity building grants to states to support or promote the develop-ment of sector partnerships. Question. How do you plan to involve local industry leaders in this initiative? Answer. Local industry leaders would be partners and valued customers for all Sector Strategies competitive grants. These leaders would identify critical, imme-diate workforce needs, inform curriculum design and delivery, provide work-based learning opportunities, and receive integrated business services that meet their workforce needs. Integrated business services are the range of workforce develop-ment, economic development, regulatory compliance, and other services available from a variety of Federal, State, and local resources that meet business' needs. JOB-DRIVEN TRAINING FOR WORKERS PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM Question. For the last several years, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has cited duplication across job training programs. In addition to GAO's work, con-cerns have been raised by the subcommittee about evaluations of job training pro-grams. It is my understanding that the Department continues to work on a ''Work-force Investment Act Gold Standard Evaluation,'' which it has been undertaking since 2011. However, the evaluation's first findings are not expected until the fall of 2015, and final impact findings will not be released until the summer of 2017. Can you explain how the new Job-Driven Training for Workers Presidential Memo-randum will accomplish in 180 days what your Department has already been work-ing on for 3 years and will not complete for three more? Answer. DOL views the Workforce Investment Act Gold Standard Evaluation and the overall job training review that is directed by the Presidential Memorandum as complementary but not identical efforts. In his State of the Union address, President Obama laid out a vision based upon the principle of opportunity for all. Key parts of that vision are helping people get the skills they need to succeed in good-paying jobs and ensuring that America's em-ployers have the skilled workers they need to successfully compete in the global economy. On January 31, 2014, the President issued a memorandum tasking Vice President Biden to conduct a broad review of our Nation's employment and training programs to make this vision a reality, focusing on making workforce programs and policies throughout the government more focused on imparting relevant skills, more easily accessed by both employers and job seekers, and more accountable for positive employment and earning outcome results. This review is guided by the principle of job-driven training for workers. The review will result in an action plan that identi-fies steps to make sure that programs throughout the Federal Government deliver on the promise of job-driven training for workers and for employers. The Depart-ment of Labor is working with the Vice President and our colleagues at the Depart-ments of Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, and in other agencies 150 to implement this review and identify concrete ways to help more of American's workers on a faster path to valuable skills and credentials, good jobs, and meaning-ful careers. In contrast to the Vice President's review, the Gold Standard evaluation is a long- term evaluation that will determine the impact of services provided to adults and to dislocated workers under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The evaluation will produce the first impact estimates in December 2015 as scheduled, and the final impact results in the summer of 2017. The Vice President's review is also focused on improving the accountability for the outcomes of training programs. I look forward to discussing with the Committee the results of the Vice President's review. Question. Why have the reports from GAO on job training duplication not spurred any significant budget proposals from the Department on consolidation? Answer. The GAO report does not recommend that training and employment pro- grams be consolidated. Rather, it recommends better collaboration across programs. The Administration is focused on improving coordination and alignment in the workforce system as GAO has suggested. The Vice President is currently leading an across-the-board review of employment and training programs. One of the key goals of that review is to improve workforce system coordination across program funding streams. The Administration is also taking steps to improve service delivery and increase coordination and alignment within its current authority as well as through pro-posals in the President's budget. For example, the Workforce Innovation Fund, launch last year, supports State, regional, and local efforts to wok across program silos to produce better employment outcomes for job seekers and workers. The latest solicitation for grant applications was released in mid-May of this year. The 2015 President's budget requests $60 million for the Workforce Innovation Fund in 2015. In addition, the budget requests $80 million for WIA Incentive Grants, which would provide grants to states that demonstrate strong performance in serving populations with barriers to employment. Since these individuals are likely to be served by mul-tiple programs, States that improve program coordination and alignment will be more likely to receive these grants. The Administration has also sought greater flexibility to blend funding in exchange for greater accountability for outcomes. The proposed Performance Partnership authority was enacted in the 2014 and will per-mit greater cross-program work to achieve better outcomes for disconnected youth. A slightly expanded version of this authority was reproposed in the 2015 budget. The 2015 President's budget also includes some proposals to consolidate employ- ment and training programs in a targeted way that protect the most vulnerable pop-ulations. The public workforce system, authorized by the Workforce Investment Act, provides States and local areas flexibility in determining how best to implement their job training and employment programs by tailoring the system to meet the needs of local jobseekers and employers and support regional economic growth. Fur-ther, the Department's job training and employment programs are geared to serve diverse individuals with specific needs, including veterans, dislocated workers, indi-viduals with disabilities, women, low income youth, Indians and Native Americans, and migrants and seasonal farmworkers. The Department is committed to working with its Federal partners to ensure access to services. Further, the fiscal year 2015 budget request includes several plans to streamline or align workforce and training services, and it also emphasizes building on what is working and encouraging innovation to improve service delivery and performance. We have proposed to transfer the Senior Community Service Employment Program to the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Community Living, placing the program in an agency that shares the mission of helping older Americans maintain their independence (both economic independence and living ar-rangements) and actively participate in their communities. Additionally, the budget proposes to consolidate the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers and the WIA Dislocated Worker programs into a single New Career Pathways program that will streamline the delivery of training and reach as many as one million displaced workers a year with a set of core services. The Department has also already eliminated some employment and training pro- grams that it viewed as duplicative, including the Community-Based Job Training Grants and the Veterans Workforce Investment Act programs. COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS PROGRAM Question. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget requests $380 million in funding for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program. The budget also proposes transferring the program to the Department of Health and Human 151 Services, which the subcommittee has consistently rejected. Mr. Secretary, how does this budget request account for the President's proposed minimum wage increase? Answer. The number of participants that can be served under the Senior Commu- nity Service Employment Program (SCSEP) depends on minimum wages at the na-tional, State or local levels. Consistent with standard practices, the fiscal year 2015 Budget request assumes current law in estimating the number of participants served. As Congress considers raising the minimum wage, the Department of Labor, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services, would be glad to discuss with Congress how various implementation and timing options for a min-imum wage increase would affect SCSEP slots. Question. How would an increase in the minimum wage affect the number of slots available to program participants? Answer. At the fiscal year 2015 request level, an increase in the Federal min- imum wage would increase the participant wage rate and decrease the number of participant slots in areas where the current minimum wage is not at least $10.10. As Congress considers raising the minimum wage, the Department of Labor, in con-junction with the Department of Health and Human Services, would be glad to dis-cuss with Congress how various implementation and timing options for a minimum wage increase would affect SCSEP slots. H-1B VISA PROGRAM Question. As part of the H-1B visa program, the Department of Labor currently receives a portion of the fees assessed to companies who apply for these temporary, high-skilled worker visas to provide training to U.S. workers. These training pro-grams are designed to assist American workers in gaining the skills needed to ob-tain or advance employment in high-growth industries. In addition to annual H-1B fees, the Department of Labor received additional funds from the American Recov-ery in Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to train Americans. Please provide the sub-committee the following information: What is the dollar amount distributed from H-1B fees to the Department of Labor for the past 5 fiscal years? Answer. The Department of Labor collected $668,231,275 in H-1B fees from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013 for the Job Training for Employment in High Growth Industries program. The distribution of collections by year follows: Fiscal year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 H-1B collections .............................. $110,820,955 $114,026,359 $130,975,268 $161,232,760 $151,175,933 Question. What is total amount of money provided to the Department of Labor from the ARRA? Answer. The Department of Labor received $4,806,000,000 in discretionary funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Question. What evidence is there to demonstrate the training funds\u2014both H-1B fees and the ARRA funds\u2014have resulted in meaningful employment for Americans? Answer. Since 2008, the Department has funded approximately $1.539 billion through the following competitive grants using H-1B fees and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds appropriated for high-growth and emerging industries (HGEI). (Approximately $750 million of ARRA funds were des-ignated for HGEI grants, compared to over $4 billion in total ARRA funding for Training and Employment Services programs.) Several of these training grants in-clude program evaluations, as described below: High Growth Job Training Initiative (HGJTI) The High Growth Job Training Initiative, which began in 2001 and ended in 2013, engaged business, education, and the workforce investment system in the develop-ment of integrated solutions to the workforce challenges facing high-growth indus-tries. These industries included Advanced Manufacturing, Geospatial Technology, Aerospace, Health Care, Automotive, Hospitality, Biotechnology, Information Tech-nology, Construction, Retail, Energy, Transportation, and Financial Services. This program was funded by H-1B the national initiative, describes the structure and implementation of projects by selected grantees, and provides non-experimental analysis of the early training outcomes of HGJTI-funded programs, including some information on early impacts of job training activities. Some of these early impacts reported by the grantees demonstrate evidence of meaningful employment for par-ticipants. For example: 49 percent of 593 trainees in the Chicago Women in Trades program were placed in jobs with an average earnings of $17.62 per hour; 81 per-cent of 1,098 dislocated workers in the Community Center Learning Center entered jobs as full-time entry-level aircraft assembler positions earning $10 per hour, and 78 percent retained those jobs; and the High Plains Technology Center had 2,162 training completers of which 74 percent were placed in jobs with an average wage of $14-$18 per hour for floor hands and $26 per hour for derrick hands. H-1B Technical Skills Training (TST) The H-1B TST Grant Program, which began in November 2011, provides edu- cation, training, and job placement assistance in the occupations and industries for which employers are using H-1B visas to hire highly-skilled foreign workers on a temporary basis, and the related activities necessary to support such training. This program is intended to raise the technical skill levels of American workers so they can obtain or upgrade employment in high-growth industries and occupations. Over time, these education and training programs will help businesses reduce their use of skilled foreign professionals permitted to work in the U.S. on a temporary basis under the H-1B visa program. The grants represent significant investments in sec-tors, such as information technology, advanced manufacturing, and healthcare. These grants are currently active. The Department is funding an implementation study of this program that will provide a cross-cutting summary of grantees' pro-gram operations, including participant recruitment and enrollment practices, pro-gram services, and key partner roles and responsibilities, as well as detailed infor-mation on special topics of interest and lessons learned. The draft Final Report is expected in the spring of 2018. H-1B Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge (JIAC) The Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge (JIAC), which began in October 2011, is designed to help regions achieve the demonstrated benefits of collaborative, cluster-based regional development. This initiative represents the implementation of Administration policy priorities to accelerate bottom-up innovation in urban and rural regions, as opposed to imposing ''one-size-fits-all'' solutions. The JIAC also meets Administration goals for smarter use of government resources through reduc-tion of Federal silos and promotion of coordinated Federal funding opportunities that offer more efficient access to Federal resources. The three Federal funding agencies for this project include the Department of Labor, Employment and Train-ing Administration (ETA); Department of Commerce, Economic Development Ad-ministration; and the Small Business Administration. These grants are currently ac-tive. The study being conducted of the JIAC is a process evaluation that focuses on the regional industry cluster implementation plans, as well as processes and strategies used to develop and accelerate regional economic development that translate into new jobs and increased wages through these regional partnerships. The draft In-terim Report is due to ETA in November 2014, and the draft Final Report is ex-pected in the spring of 2016. H-1B Make it in America (MIIA) The Make it in America (MIIA) grant program, which began in October 2013 and is funded by H-1B fees, seeks to encourage foreign and domestic businesses to build or expand their operations in the United States. This is intended to accelerate job creation by encouraging re-shoring of productive activity by U.S. firms, foster in-creased foreign direct investment, encourage U.S. companies to keep or expand their businesses\u2014and jobs\u2014here at home, and train local workers to meet the needs of those businesses. The MIIA also meets Administration goals for smarter use of gov-ernment resources through reduction of Federal silos and promotion of coordinated Federal funding opportunities that offer more efficient access to Federal resources. The three Federal funding agencies for this project include the Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration; U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) and National Institute of Standards 153 and Technology Manufacturing Extension Partnership (NIST MEP); and, Delta Re- gional Authority (DRA). These grants are currently active. The MIIA evaluation will examine partner infrastructures, strategic planning, technical assistance, workforce development resources used for workers to develop the needed skills, as well as the local community clusters. The evaluation will docu-ment successes in measureable project outputs, capacity-building outcomes, and re-alized outcomes that lead to building a highly skilled and diverse workforce to meet employer demand. ARRA High growth and Emerging Industries (HGEI) Awarded through the Recovery Act, ARRA High Growth and Emerging Industries (HGEI) grants that focused on training and placement activities included the En-ergy Training Partnership Grants, Pathways Out of Poverty Grants, State Energy Sector Partnership and Training Grants, and Health Care Sector and Other High Growth and Emerging Industries Grants. These grants ended June 2013. ETA funded a random-assignment impact evaluation of four grants awarded from two of the ARRA Solicitations for Grant Applications (SGA): Pathways Out of Pov-erty/Green Jobs and Health Care Sector and Other High Growth and Emerging In-dustries SGA. The overall aim of this study is to determine the extent to which grantees' participants achieve increases in employment, earnings, and career ad-vancement as a result of their participation in the training provided by the grant-ees, and to identify promising best practices and strategies for replication. The draft Interim Report is due to ETA in June 2015 and the draft Final Report is expected in December 2016. Youth Career Connect These grants, awarded in April 2014, are designed to provide high school students with education and training that combines rigorous academic and technical cur-ricula focused on specific in-demand occupations, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) related fields. An evaluation of these grants is in the early stages of planning at the Department. H-1B Ready to Work Partnership Grants These grants, totaling approximately $150 million, are being competed in spring 2014 and expected to be awarded in fall 2014. They will be focused on providing long-term unemployed workers with individualized counseling, training and sup-portive and specialized services leading to rapid employment in occupations and in-dustries for which employers use H-1B visas to hire foreign workers. The grants will support public-private partnerships that include the workforce investment sys-tem; training providers, such as community colleges and community-based and faith-based organizations; and businesses including at least three actively engaged employers. As part of its commitment to producing strong evidence on effectiveness its programs, the Department is requiring full participation in a planned impact evaluation as a condition of all grants awarded in this competition. Quarterly Performance Reporting Grantees for the above programs report key outcomes (entered employment rate, employment retention rate, and average earnings) each quarter for participants who have exited the program. These outcome data are not yet available for the H-1B, TST, JAIC, or MIIA programs, as grantees complete a mandatory planning period before enrolling any participants, and most participants have not yet exited training programs. Quarterly performance outcomes from these programs will be posted as they become available at: http://www.doleta.gov/performance/results/#etaqr. Archived outcome data are available at: http://www.doleta.gov/performance/results/ Archive lReports.cfm for the HGJTI (see December quarterly reports for 2008-2012 and March 2013) and ARRA HGEI programs (see June 2013). Question. What percentage of individuals receiving H-1B funded training obtains employment after completing that training? Answer. Through the High-Growth Job Training Initiative (HGJTI) grants, which operated from 2003 through 2013, 63,716 participants completed training activities. Of these, 28,753 were placed into positions of new employment. The Entered Em-ployment Rate for completers is 45 percent. Prior to new reporting requirements im-plemented in the quarter ending December 31, 2011, grantees only reported results for individuals who entered employment if those participants entered employment and completed training in the same quarter. As a result, the total number of indi-viduals that ultimately entered employment and training-related employment are actually higher than the results above indicate. The current H-1B funded training grants, awarded at different times since Octo- ber 2011, have served 43,606 participants as of December 31, 2013, including 9,967 154 who were unemployed at enrollment. Of these unemployed participants, 8,835 began training by December 31, 2013, including 3,762 who completed training. Of these training completers, 1,990 (52 percent) entered employment by December 31, 2013. These H-1B grants are at different stages of their grant periods of performance, in-cluding some that were still in the planning and startup phase and had not yet en-rolled participants during the latest (December 2013) reporting period. Question. What is the average timeframe for receiving employment after receiving H-1B funded training? Answer. The Department cannot calculate an average time from training comple- tion to entering employment because it does not collect data on individual hire dates. The Department tracks an entered employment rate based on the number of participants who are employed in the quarter after the quarter in which they exited the program. (See http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEGL17-05 lAttachA.pdf.) Question. Does the Department collect data on whether individuals receiving H- 1B funded training remain employed 1 year after they are trained? Answer. The Department collects employment retention data using the Common Performance Measures. The Employment Retention Rate is based on the number of people who were employed in the first quarter after they exited the program and are still employed up to 9 months after exit. For the current H-1B funded investments, the Employment Retention Rate (which includes both unemployed and incumbent worker participants) is 99 percent for the quarter ending December 31, 2013. Question. How does H-1B training help the long-term unemployed? Answer. Of the more than $340 million awarded in two rounds of H-1B Technical Skills Training (TST) grants in fiscal year 2012, the Department designated more than $200 million for grantees serving the long-term unemployed. In addition, in February 2014 the Department announced the Long-term Unem- ployed H-1B Ready to Work (Ready to Work) Partnership grant program, currently open for solicitation of grant applications. The Ready to Work grant program will utilize approximately $150 million in H-1B funds for projects that recruit long-term unemployed workers and employ strategies that are effective in getting them back to work in middle to high-skill occupations. The Department is planning a rigorous evaluation of these grants. GOVERNOR 'S SET -ASIDE Question. The fiscal year 2014 omnibus increased the Governor's Set-Aside to 8.75 percent. This program has been successful with states that use the funding for state-wide or regional employment initiatives. In Kansas, it is my understanding that the State intends to use the additional funding from fiscal year 2014 to support employment services for veterans. Specifically, Kansas plans to hire a point person at Fort Riley, the state's largest military installation, to provide case management services to exiting service members. With improved coordination of services, the State is confident it can improve the employment outcomes of its veterans. However, there is concern from the State that until the Governor's Set-Aside is restored to its authorized level of 15 percent, limited resources will prevent the State from as-sisting more veterans in finding jobs as they transition to civilian life. Why does your Department not support restoring the Governor's State Set-Aside to its fully authorized level so that states will have the resources and flexibility they need to pursue promising ventures such as the one I have referenced? Answer. The 2015 budget adheres to the spending levels agreed to in the Bipar- tisan Budget Act of 2013, which was an important first step toward replacing the damaging cuts caused by sequestration with sensible long-term reforms. However, remaining at these levels necessitates difficult decisions, and means that we cannot accommodate additional investments in key areas like the job training formula grants. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative proposed in the 2015 budget acknowledges this, and included funds to restore prior cuts in the formula grants. The fiscal year 2015 budget does, however, request the continuation of the reserve at the fiscal year 2014 level, which allows for fundamental state oversight and accountability activities. Increasing the State reserve without increasing for-mula funding would cut into local funding. The Department will continue to work with States to identify ways to operate within these funding levels while continuing essential activities.

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR THAD COCHRAN GULFPORT , MISSISSIPPI JOB CORPS CENTER Question. Secretary Perez, the Job Corps center in Gulfport, Mississippi was badly damaged during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The former Secretary of Labor, Sec-retary Solis, committed to work with me to ensure that the Gulfport Job Corps Cen-ter is rebuilt and able to return to serving the number of young people that it once served. Here we are, nearly 9 years later, and this center has yet to be fully re-paired. Is this acceptable to you? Answer. The Gulfport Job Corps Center was closed due to extensive damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in late 2005. The center occupies the former 33rd Ave-nue High School, which is eligible for inclusion in the National Registry of Historic Places as it dates back to 1921 as the only Gulfport high school that served African- American students until Gulfport schools were integrated in 1968. The property and buildings are owned by the City of Gulfport and leased to Job Corps. Work began in 2006 to determine whether existing buildings could be repaired and renovated. A determination was made in 2007 that this option was not feasible due to the con-dition of the structures and environmental remediation costs. DOL contracted a de-sign/build contractor in 2008 to include demolition and construction of temporary modular facilities to reopen the Center. Temporary center facilities were completed in late 2009, a contract for a Center operator was procured, and the Center re-opened with a reduced student population in 2010 (the current OBS is 107). The construction design of the new permanent Center was completed and a construction contract was awarded in 2011. However, alumni of the 33rd Avenue school objected to the demolition of the historic buildings and invoked the historic preservation laws. DOL conducted extensive negotiations and meetings with the community, but when no agreement was reached, the construction contract was cancelled in March 2012. At the community's request, DOL hired a local contractor to assess issues re-garding renovation and preservation, and the report was received in December 2013. Before the structural analysis can be completed, the site needs significant remedi-ation to determine whether any of the buildings (or parts thereof) are structurally sound enough to be preserved. We are currently revising the scope of work for the assessment and stabilization of the buildings. Once the scope is completed, we an-ticipate issuing a request for proposal by June 30, 2014. Question. What are you doing to fix it? Answer. Job Corps has worked extensively to address the historic preservation concerns of the community. At the community's request, DOL hired a local con-tractor to assess options for renovation and preservation, and the report was re-ceived in December 2013. The site needs significant remediation before the struc-tural analysis on whether any of the buildings (or parts thereof) are structurally sound enough to be preserved as part of the new Center can be completed. We are currently revising the scope of work for the assessment and stabilization of the buildings. Once the scope is completed, we anticipate a request for proposal by June 30, 2014. Question. Secretary Perez, we have three Job Corps centers in Mississippi that serve hundreds of underprivileged young people. How does the Department's budget request seek to resolve issues in the Job Corps program caused by poor planning by the Department so that Job Corps centers are not forced to continue to lay off employees and reduce the number of students they serve? Answer. In recent years, we faced a serious challenge when the Office of Job Corps projected a funding shortfall and was temporarily forced to suspend new stu-dent enrollment. Job Corps has adopted recommendations made by the Office of In-spector General (OIG) and has undertaken a variety of measures to strengthen con-tract oversight and financial management of the program. We have made necessary changes that will prevent similar issues in the future. In particular, Job Corps and the Department's Office of the Chief Financial Offi- cer (OCFO) have established mechanisms for detecting potential financial and pro-gram risks to improve related policies, procedures, and internal controls, and to rou-156 tinely reconcile accounting systems data. Improvements implemented since 2013 in- clude thorough analysis and monitoring of programmatic and financial data; align-ing the number of students with the levels supportable under the program's appro-priation; improving communication between program, contracting, fiscal, and agency leadership; and improving contract administration and oversight as well as pro-viding additional training for contracting staff. The reduction in contracted on-board strength (OBS) at the end of the enrollment suspension in April 2013, was undertaken to ensure financial stability within the program and establish an OBS level for Program Year (PY) 2013 that was support-able under the fiscal year 2013 appropriation, including sequestration. Reducing OBS was a critical step in ensuring that we started PY 2013 with Job Corps' total financial and budgetary commitments aligned with our appropriation. We are con-tinuing to monitor contractor expenditures against OBS levels as we evaluate the efficacy of our OBS levels and contract amounts to inform future discussions about increasing OBS system-wide. Question. Have you planned accordingly for the upcoming fiscal year? Answer. Yes, the reduction in contracted on-board strength (OBS) in 2013 was un- dertaken to ensure financial stability within the program and establish an OBS level for PY 2013 that was supportable under the fiscal year 2013 appropriation, in-cluding sequestration. Reducing OBS was a critical step in ensuring that we started PY 2013 with Job Corps' total financial and budgetary commitments aligned with our appropriation. We are continuing to monitor contractor expenditures against OBS levels as we evaluate the efficacy of our OBS levels and contract amounts. Based on an increased appropriation and reviews of the contract expenditures and OBS levels, DOL plans to increase OBS to a level that is supportable in PY 2014. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD C. S HELBY H-2B RULES Question. The Department has repeatedly proposed H-2B rules that would add regulatory burdens and costs to American businesses. In particular, the 2011 wage rule could have increased H-2B hourly wages by upwards of 50 percent. Many small businesses that use the H-2B program cannot afford this regulation and may ulti-mately close, which will result in more job losses, including putting the American jobs at those businesses at risk. The fiscal year 2012 Labor/HHS appropriations bill prohibited the Department from moving forward with this dangerous rule. That pro-hibition was continued through fiscal year 2013. However, since that time, the De-partment announced it will move forward with a re-proposal of the 2011 wage rule. Mr. Secretary, why is your Department moving forward with a re-proposal of the 2011 wage rule, despite overwhelming opposition from Congress, industry leaders, and stakeholder interests who feel this rule is unworkable and will ultimately un-dermine the program? Answer. The Department does not plan to ''re-propose'' the prevailing wage rule issued in 2011, but will work off of its provisions in developing a proposal for consid-eration by the regulated community and other interested parties on a final wage rule in the H-2B program. Following litigation in which a court invalidated the reg-ulatory provision setting forth skill levels to set the prevailing wage in the H-2B program, the Department issued an interim final rule in April 2013 (2013 IFR) that eliminated the use of skill levels in setting the prevailing wage. Instead, where there is not a collective bargaining agreement that governs the wage determination, the Department will set the prevailing wage as the mean of the wages of similarly employed workers in the geographic area of employment. Under the 2013 IFR, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) Survey is used to determine the mean wage of similarly employed workers in the geographic area, unless the employer requests a wage determination based on another source, such as wage surveys for workers employed under Federal government contracts or statistically sound private surveys. The Department invited public input on the 2013 IFR and received over 300 public comments. In light of those public comments, recent developments in the H-2B program, Congressional actions, and judicial deci-sions, the Department has determined that further notice and comment on setting the prevailing wage in the H-2B program is warranted. Therefore, DOL intends to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking on the proper wage methodology for the H- 2B program, working off of the 2011 Wage Rule as a starting point. The Department will review comments on the 2013 IFR, along with comments we receive after we publish the notice of proposed rulemaking prior to issuing a final rule. 157 GOVERNOR 'S SET -ASIDE Question. The Governor's Workforce Investment Act set-aside allows 15 percent of Workforce Investment Act funding to be used by the Governor, at the state-level, to pursue creative workforce development initiatives. Limiting the amount of funds available to Governors' workforce training initiatives stifles state-wide and regional employment training efforts. Governors are uniquely equipped to identify and ad-dress the workforce training needs of their state's local employers and should be given the tools necessary to do so. Why does the Department not support increasing the set-aside to 15 percent? Answer. The 2015 budget adheres to the spending levels agreed to in the Bipar- tisan Budget Act of 2013, which was an important first step toward replacing the damaging cuts caused by sequestration with sensible long-term reforms. However, remaining at these levels necessitates difficult decisions, and means that we cannot accommodate additional investments in key areas like the job training formula grants. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative proposed in the 2015 budget acknowledges this, and included funds to restore prior cuts in the formula grants. The fiscal year 2015 budget does, however, request the continuation of the reserve at this level, which allows for fundamental state oversight and account-ability activities. The Department will continue to work with States to identify ways to operate within these funding levels while continuing essential activities. Question. Are you concerned that under the reduced set-aside Governors no longer have the flexibility to implement innovative statewide projects? Answer. Investments in innovation are essential to helping the public workforce system identify and implement more efficient and effective ways of equipping work-ers with the skills employers' need. The Department is committed to spurring inno-vation in the public workforce system, and the fiscal year 2015 budget request in-cludes several initiatives that directly support innovation, such as the Workforce In-novation Fund. The Department has taken care to design these initiatives in ways that ensure states are positioned to compete for or otherwise leverage these re-sources through partnerships. In addition, the 2015 budget proposes a revamped WIA Incentive Grant program, which would provide grants to states that dem-onstrate the ability to achieve positive outcomes for populations with barriers to em-ployment. States that are innovative and work across program siloes will be best positioned to receive these grants. Although structurally different from the Gov-ernor's reserve, these national initiatives support significant increases in partner-ship, flexibility, dissemination, and coordination of strategies. BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL LABOR AFFAIRS (ILAB) Question. Mr. Secretary, since this Administration took office in 2009, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs' (ILAB) has grown significantly. Comparing fiscal year 2009 funding to the budget requested in fiscal year 2015, ILAB's budget will have increased 6.2 percent, with the office growing by 22 full-time employees, a 26.5 per- cent increase. In this constrained budget environment, wouldn't the Department's funding be better spent on training workers in the United States as opposed to using taxpayers' dollars to establish labor unions abroad? Answer. The Department of Labor is committed to supporting workers in the United States and ensuring that those workers, and the businesses in which they are employed, have a fair playing field with respect to worker rights in the global economy. These efforts seek to prevent workers and businesses in the United States from facing unfair competition based on the violation of worker rights. ILAB pro-motes respect for internationally recognized worker rights, improves working condi-tions and workplace safety, and combats exploitive child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking in other countries, particularly among key trading partners. The increases in ILAB's budget beginning in fiscal year 2009 were preceded by several years of sharply declining budgets for the bureau\u2014from nearly $150 million in fiscal year 2003 to $82.5 million in fiscal year 2008. These budget reductions oc-curred in the context of an increasing workload for ILAB related to expanded trade agreement monitoring, congressionally required reporting, and ongoing technical as-sistance oversight responsibilities. In fiscal year 2009, ILAB's budget was increased to enable it to more effectively carry out its mandates and to address strategic areas. Since fiscal year 2010, ILAB's budget has remained stable or has declined. The budget request for fiscal year 2015 of $91.3 million and 105 FTE remains at approximately the same level as the fiscal year 2014 appropriations. To meet its mandates and address strategic areas, ILAB has added full time em- ployees since fiscal year 2008 primarily to the following three areas: \u2014Research and analysis to meet statutory reporting responsibilities related to child and forced labor; 158 \u2014Monitor labor conditions in current or prospective U.S. trading partners, en- forcement of labor provisions of free trade agreements, and labor eligibility cri-teria of trade preference programs; and \u2014Monitor, evaluate, and audit grant-funded projects to ensure effectiveness, im- pact, and management and financial accountability. WORKFORCE INNOVATION FUND Question. Mr. Secretary, I remain concerned that as more workforce training pro- grams become competitively awarded they will not reach those for whom training programs are intended. I also have reservations specific to the competitively award-ed Workforce Innovation Fund. The fiscal year 2015 budget requests a fifth year of funding for a program whose outcomes are unknown. In a time when our national unemployment rate is 6.7 percent, the Workforce Innovation Fund does not provide any direct services to jobseekers. Wouldn't funding be better utilized on programs that directly serve jobseekers? Answer. Almost all WIF grants directly serve job seekers, youth, and/or business customers, with the exception of two grants focused on the delivery of workforce in-formation and integration of performance data systems. The Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) invests in innovative approaches to the design and delivery of employ-ment and training services that generate long-term improvements in the perform-ance of the public workforce system, outcomes for job seekers and employers, and cost-effectiveness. The 28 current WIF grantees are testing a variety of innovations in four categories: sector strategies and business engagement (including entrepre-neurship training); career pathways and system alignment; data systems and online service delivery; solutions for targeted populations; and Pay for Success, an innova-tive funding model. In addition, WIF grants leverage significant funds from Federal, state, and local workforce development programs, to support long-term sustain-ability of effective innovations. The goal of these grants is for these innovations, products, and models to help make the broader workforce system more effective, leading to better, more cost-effective services for individuals across the system. Because the WIF grants are testing a variety of innovations, performance meas- ures vary by project. Examples include the DOL common performance measures (entry to employment, employment retention, and 6 months average earnings), cre-dential attainment, businesses started, number of businesses served, employer satis-faction with job candidates, and participants that attain permanent housing. In ag-gregate, the current WIF grantees are expected to serve nearly 38,000 adults, 2,800 youth, and 6,600 businesses. Details about the WIF grants can be found at innova-tion.workforce3one.org. Question. Are you concerned that the Workforce Innovation Fund siphons off funding that could otherwise be distributed to every state for training efforts, but now is instead only awarded to a few grantees? Answer. The Workforce Innovation Fund (WIF) makes efficient use of scarce re- sources by awarding funds competitively to experiment and build information about effective approaches, and disseminating this knowledge to the broader workforce system. WIF findings, products, models, and results are then shared widely with the workforce investment system. The resources are improving the quality and effi-ciency of the entire workforce system. For example, through the ''Eye on Innovation Stakeholder Engagement Series,'' the Employment and Training Administration will share promising practices from WIF grantees on business services, systems align-ment and career pathways, data systems, and online service delivery with other WIF grantees and the public workforce system throughout this summer. Technical assistance provided to the WIF grantees is available to the entire workforce system at innovation.workforce3one.org. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION 'S REGIONAL EMPHASIS PROGRAM Question. Mr. Secretary, it is my understanding that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has announced formation of a Regional Emphasis Program targeting auto parts supply manufacturers in Alabama, Georgia, and Mis-sissippi. OSHA is looking at excessive ''workplace exposures to safety hazards'' in the Southern states' auto parts manufacturing industry. What defines ''excessive workplace exposure to safety hazards,'' what data do you have to support this claim, and how is that data collected? Answer. OSHA has been conducting Regional Emphasis Programs (REPs) since the early 1980s. They are designed to focus OSHA's resources in areas where a re-gional or local office has determined that special attention is needed. In order to determine which industries may need special attention, OSHA uses a combination of data resulting from OSHA's recent inspection activity in the indus-159 try in that area, as well as injury and illness rates, when available. Over the past 5 years, OSHA has been responding to worker complaints, fatalities, and injuries in the automotive parts manufacturing industry in Georgia, Alabama, and Mis-sissippi. In response to the complaints and referrals, OSHA conducted inspections in these regions. For example, in 2013 a worker employed at a plant in Alabama that had been inspected by OSHA on more than one occasion since 2006, suffered a double ampu-tation. OSHA found eight violations of safety standards in those inspections. An-other plant covered by the emphasis program had seven inspections since 2009, with findings of serious and willful violations. Inspections like these led to the decision to start the Regional Emphasis Program. Worker injury and illness data supports the decision to focus on worker safety in the auto supply parts industry. The most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data show that the auto parts supplier industry in Alabama has a higher injury and illness rate\u20144.6 per 100 full-time workers\u2014than the same industry nationwide, which had a rate of 3.0 per 100 full-time workers. Below are the rates for the auto supply industry, both nationally and in Alabama (2010 was the last year that Alabama data was available for this industry.) DART Rates Annual 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 NAICS 3363 US .............................................. 5.1 4.5 4.4 4.3 3.7 3.3 2.6 3.0 2.7 2.8 NAICS 3363 Alabama .................................... ........ Source: BLS SOII The all-industry private sector average injury and illness rate in Alabama and the United States in 2010 was 1.8 per 100 full-time workers, meaning that the Alabama auto supply industry has an injury and illness rate more than two and a half times higher than the overall injury and illness rate for all private workplaces in Ala-bama. Question. Your Department claims to have undertaken efforts to address these hazards through cooperative efforts and compliance assistance ''for several years'' prior to announcing formation of a Regional Emphasis Program. In exact terms, how many years did your department provide compliance assistance to these manufac-turers? Answer. OSHA always stands ready to provide compliance assistance to busi- nesses that request it. Most of OSHA's Area Offices have a Compliance Assistance Specialist whose sole job is to provide assistance to organizations that request as-sistance. You may also be aware that OSHA funds a free on-site consultation pro-gram for small and medium-sized businesses. (https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/ smallbusiness/consult.html) The REP was initiated after a long period of working cooperatively with the in- dustry to address the safety and health problems in the workplace. OSHA began a partnership in 2005 with an auto manufacturer (Hyundai) and its suppliers. Dur-ing the partnership, OSHA provided the auto supplier manufacturing industry with a great deal of compliance assistance and education to help correct serious safety and health hazards. OSHA, however, continued to find a high number of serious safety and health hazards during inspections (resulting from complaints or refer-rals) in the auto supplier manufacturing industry, so OSHA ended the partnership in 2010. OSHA's emphasis programs begin with compliance assistance. Employers are no- tified of the program and offered information and training on OSHA standards and the tools they need to assure that they can come into compliance before an OSHA inspection. Thirty days prior to launching the Regional Emphasis Program, OSHA sent a let- ter offering information about the hazards we were targeting, as well as training and presentations about how to prevent injuries and illness related to these haz-ards. This provided the employers the opportunity to seek assistance or contact the consultation services. The REP was also included in speeches presented by OSHA to different groups and organizations in the Southeast. 160 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR LAMAR ALEXANDER PROPOSED SILICA RULE Question. My staff has heard from many different stakeholders who have testified during Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) public hearing ses-sions, and each of these industries have signaled how difficult it would be to comply with the proposed rule. How can you assure us that OSHA will actually produce a Final Rule that reflects the concerns expressed at these hearings? Answer. OSHA carefully considers the concerns expressed by all stakeholders, along with supporting data and other evidence, in developing a final rule. The Occu-pational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act) mandates that any final rule issued by OSHA must be feasible for affected industries, and must be supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(5); 29 U.S.C. 655(f)]. Accordingly, OSHA will consider the concerns expressed by stake-holders regarding their ability to comply with the proposed rule in developing a final rule. Question. When do you expect OSHA to issue a Final Rule? Answer. OSHA has not established a target date for issuing a final silica rule. The Agency is accepting post-hearing comments on the proposed rule from hearing participants until June 3, 2014, and will be accepting post-hearing briefs until July 18, 2014. OSHA will then review the evidence in the record as a whole and develop a final rule, if appropriate, based on that evidence. Question. What would it cost a manufacturing plant, which operates in an en- closed environment, and employs 1,000 people, to comply with this proposed regula-tion? Answer. OSHA did not develop a cost estimate specific to the facility you describe. Manufacturing establishments vary enormously in their costs per employee depend-ing on the nature of their operations. Question. The proposed rule requests commenters to submit information about their financial backers if they submit scientific or technical data. How many com-menters have done that? Answer. After searching the public comments submitted to the silica docket, we found very limited information pertaining to such disclosures. Several commenters have either disclosed funding sources or indicated that they did not receive funding. We have also received general comments both supporting and objecting to OSHA's request for disclosure. Question. In what way has this information contributed to the rulemaking? Answer. The request for this information is voluntary, and not required for sub- mitting comments. OSHA has a legal responsibility to review and consider all mate-rial submitted to the rulemaking record in its development of a final rule and sup-porting analyses and will do so. The Agency believes that this voluntary request will only serve to enhance the transparency of the process. WAGE DETERMINATIONS ON MILITARY BASES Question. The National Restaurant Association said in a March 20 letter to DOL, that the Wage and Hour Division, for the first time instituted a new health and wel-fare benefit of $3.81 per hour on fast food occupations under the Service Contract Act. These fast food franchises that operate on military installations, like Fort Campbell in Tennessee and Kentucky, or Fort Bragg in North Carolina provide mili-tary personnel and their families a fast alternative to eating at the cafeteria, while not to mention, employ a few dozen young workers at each location. This new health and welfare benefit, coupled with the President's Executive order increasing the minimum wage, has some fast food operators facing a 50 percent increase in wages. What is the reason for the first time application of this fringe benefit? Answer. The Department's Wage and Hour Division is responsible for determining what prevailing wages and benefits are under the Service Contract Act. In reviewing the fast food wage determinations last summer, the Wage and Hour Division determined that those fast food workers should receive fringe benefits. Ac-cording to our long-standing regulations, we generally apply a standard fringe ben-efit amount of $3.81 to the wages of all workers covered by the Service Contract Act, and did so for fast food workers. Our regulations also provide that government agencies with contracts covered by the Service Contract Act may ask us to reconsider application of that nation-wide fringe benefit rate if they think that because of the special circumstances of a par-ticular industry, a variation in fringe benefits is necessary and proper in the public interest or would avoid the serious impairment of government business. On May 16, 161 2014, we responded to a request from the Department of Defense that we review the wages, fringe benefits, and vacation/holiday pay for fast food workers on Federal contracts. After careful consideration of DOD's request, our regulations, and the rel-evant data, the Department determined that we will no longer require a fringe ben-efit rate of $3.81. Instead, contractors employing fast food workers on Federal con-tracts will be required to pay $.66 in fringe benefits, $.17 in vacation pay for work-ers who have been employed for more than a year, and $.09 in holiday pay. We be-lieve that these wage and benefit rates more accurately reflect the conditions in the industry and the definitions of prevailing rates embodied in the statute. Question. Are you concerned that some fast food operators will have to close their location on military installations? And what will this do to small business operators? Answer. On May 16, 2014, we responded to a request from the Department of De- fense that we review the wages, fringe benefits, and vacation/holiday pay for fast food workers on Federal contracts. After careful consideration of DOD's request, our regulations, and the relevant data, the Department determined that we will no longer require a fringe benefit rate of $3.81. Instead, contractors employing fast food workers on Federal contracts will be required to pay $.66 in fringe benefits, $.17 in vacation pay for workers who have been employed for more than a year, and $.09 in holiday pay. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR MIKEJOHANNS NEW WHD RULE AND ELIMINATION OF COMPANIONSHIP EXEMPTION Question. In September 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced a final rule that essentially eliminated the Companionship Exemption (minimum wage and overtime exemption for non-medical companion care workers). The new regulation is scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2015. The final rule posted in the Federal register indicated that this new rule is likely to have an annual effect on the economy in excess of $100 million. Does your Department intend to issue fur-ther guidance to state Medicaid programs and other stakeholders on the complex implementation of this rule? If so, when does it plan to do so? Answer. The Department has been very active in providing compliance assistance to all stakeholders since issuing the companionship services rule, including webinars and meetings specifically for state Medicaid programs. The Department has also had a number of meetings and other communications with representatives from various states to discuss the regulation's impact on their particular Medicaid programs, and anticipates having more such conversations as implementation con-tinues. The Department has engaged with the disability community around issues of particular importance to them, including the Medicaid services designed to allow people living with disabilities to remain in their homes and communities. The De-partment continues to develop and issue guidance, including the recent Administra-tor's Interpretation specifically regarding shared living arrangements, most of which are funded through Medicaid programs, and has additional webinars and meetings scheduled to further inform the regulated community about implementation mat-ters. The Department will develop additional guidance as issues are brought to us for clarification. In all of these efforts, we continue to work closely with our col-leagues at the Department of Health and Human Services, and in particular the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Question. Do you think that states will have enough time to implement this final rule without undermining quality and access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries? Answer. The Department adopted a 15-month delayed implementation when it published the regulation on October 1, 2013. This delayed effective date was in-tended to allow state Medicaid programs sufficient time to make adjustments to their programs so neither the quality of, or access to, the programs will be dis-rupted. Question. Would you consider delaying the rule if states assert that they will not have time to implement the rule without disrupting quality and access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries? Answer. The Department is constantly monitoring implementation of the compan- ionship services rule and will make appropriate adjustments as indicated. Question. Under this final rule, do you believe it is likely that home care recipi- ents will attempt to control costs by independently hiring caregivers other than those employed by home care companies? Answer. We have no information that indicates that consumers will hire home care providers directly rather than continuing to purchase these services through home care agencies. 162 Question. If so, will this result in fewer caregivers being in a position to receive healthcare through an employer? Answer. We have no information that would indicate this result. UNION PRESENCE DURING OSHA INSPECTIONS Question. According to a February 2013 OSHA letter of interpretation, an unspec- ified number of employees in a nonunion workplace may designate a union as their representative during safety inspections, even though the majority of workers have not authorized the union as their representative for any purpose. Do you believe that OSHA inspectors can remain neutral enforcers of the law if they are accom-panied by outside union organizers when they inspect nonunion employers' private property? Answer. The status of OSHA inspectors as neutral enforcers of the law does not change when they are accompanied by third party ''walk-around'' representatives. Section 8(e) of the OSH Act provides that ''[s]ubject to regulations issued by the Sec-retary, a representative of the employer and a representative authorized by his em-ployees shall be given an opportunity to accompany the Secretary or his authorized representative during the physical inspection of any workplace . . . for the purpose of aiding such inspection.'' Allowing a third party representative to accompany OSHA compliance officers on an inspection is solely related to protecting workers by achieving an effective and thorough health and safety inspection and consistent with the law and long-standing OSHA regulations. OSHA INSPECTION OF FAMILY FARMS Question. Regarding the inspection of family farms, in the letter I received from you dated February 10, 2014, you said ''DOL will issue new guidance after con-sulting with USDA and with organizations representing farmers.'' Could you provide me with a list of meetings and discussions you or your staff have had with USDA, farm organizations, and other relevant groups regarding revisions to the guidance on postharvest activities on farms with more than 10 employees? Please include the name of the entity and the date of contact. I encourage you to actively consult with as many of the farm groups and producers throughout the country as possible before moving forward in this area. These are the people who know best what happens on a daily basis on America's farms. Finally, I encourage you to ensure that any re-vised guidance draws as bright a line as possible between OSHA regulations and farming operations with 10 or fewer employees in order to ensure that the agency abides by the law. Answer. On January 31st, Department of Labor staff met with representatives from the USDA to consult with them regarding OSHA's guidance defining farming operations. OSHA has developed draft revised guidance to ensure that OSHA in-spectors understand the limitations on OSHA's authority to conduct enforcement ac-tivities involving farming operations and will consult with USDA and other groups before finalizing the guidance. OSHA is currently in the process of contacting other farming groups such as the Farm Bureau to discuss its revised guidance. REDEFINING FIDUCIARY UNDER EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT Question. As you know, there has been a lot of concern surrounding the Depart- ment of Labor's proposed rule to redefine who is a fiduciary for plans regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). A rule was proposed and then withdrawn, and Assistant Secretary Borzi is reportedly working on a re- proposal. My colleagues and I, in a strong bipartisan fashion, have expressed con-cern about the rule's potential impact on small savers, investor choice and small business. All of us certainly want to ensure that beneficiaries receive unbiased fi-nancial advice and we want to protect investor interests, whether someone is saving for retirement or for a child's college education fund. Thus, we must ensure that a re-proposed rule will not ultimately harm the very beneficiaries we're trying to help. Can you assure us that the Department's re-proposal will not increase the cost of IRA accounts or harm investor choice? Answer. We have not made a decision on the proposed rulemaking, and we would not make any decisions before we had listened to all sides, as we have committed to do. We regularly engage with stakeholders and solicit their views on a range of issues, and we welcome input from those who want to help us improve this market-place before we make any decisions. The President has been clear that he is com-mitted to strengthening retirement security for all Americans and we continue to believe that the most secure retirement requires a three-legged stool of social secu-rity, pensions, and personal savings. 163 Question. Will your expanded definition of fiduciary align with the SEC's defini- tion? It is essential that any rule changes still allow broker-dealers to provide af-fordable financial advice to working class Americans. Answer. ERISA and the securities laws serve important complementary, but dis- tinct, purposes. In July 2013, we renewed our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on sharing information on enforcement, policy, and regulatory projects related to retirement and investment matters. In line with standard process, DOL continues to consult with the SEC, con-sistent with its status as an independent agency. In addition to regular, ongoing staff-level discussions, I have spoken to Chair White on several occasions since I be-came Secretary. Question. Also, Ms. Borzi has said that the re-proposal will be out this year. When can we expect to see it? Answer. We have not made a decision, and we would not make a decision before we have listened to all sides, as we have committed to do. SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS Senator H ARKIN . With that, the subcommittee stands adjourned. [Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., Wednesday, April 9, the sub- committee was recessed, to reconvene subject to the call of the Chair.] (165) DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 WEDNESDAY, APRIL 30, 2014 U.S. S ENATE , SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS , Washington, DC. The subcommittee met at 10:04 a.m., in room SD-192, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Tom Harkin (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Harkin, Landrieu, Merkley, Moran, Alexander, and Kirk. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY STATEMENT OF HON. ARNE DUNCAN, SECRETARY ACCOMPANIED BY THOMAS P. SKELLY, DIRECTOR, BUDGET SERVICE OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOM HARKIN Senator H ARKIN . The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies will come to order. Good morning and welcome, everyone. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET REQUEST Welcome back, Secretary Duncan. It is great to see you again. I am glad to have you here to talk about your Department's fiscal year 2015 budget request. Your budget's proposed $1.3 billion increase is one of the largest of any Federal agency, second only to Veterans Affairs. The in-crease proposed for the Department of Education demonstrates this administration's continued commitment to our Nation's future. And the budget goes a step further with the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Fund, which would fully replace sequester in fiscal year 2015 and the subsequent 6 years of the budget. This stands in stark contrast with the approach of Chairman Ryan's budget. That budget would cut nondefense discretionary spending by $43 billion, or about 9 percent, in fiscal year 2016 and $791 billion over 10 years. 166 FISCAL YEAR 2014 OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL The Ryan budget charts a different course than that established by the 2014 omnibus appropriations bill. Congress passed that bill on a bipartisan basis earlier this year. This subcommittee nego-tiated over $l billion in new funding for early learning programs at Education and the Department of Health and Human Services. We also secured over $1 billion total for title I and IDEA (Indi- viduals with Disabilities Education Act), the core Federal programs for elementary and secondary education. The increases for these programs allowed us to restore most of the sequester cuts in fiscal year 2013. For higher education, we included a new investment of $75 mil- lion for the First in the World initiative to address college afford-ability. Colleges and universities will be able to compete for fund-ing to test and develop strategies that reduce college costs and im-prove student outcomes. This is the first competition to support in-novation in higher education since fiscal year 2010. We made a good start in the bipartisan omnibus bill, and I think we need to continue these important investments, not cut them and leave fewer of our students served. NONDEFENSE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING CAP However, as the Secretary knows, there are some tough choices to be made under our nondefense discretionary spending cap. The fiscal year 2015 spending cap is roughly the same as the funding level for the current fiscal year. As I noted earlier, the Education Department's proposed increase of $1.3 billion is more than the increase allowed for all of non-defense discretionary spending. This makes it very difficult to provide the kind of investments this budget so wisely advocates. But that is not our only challenge. I am hopeful that this hearing will give the Secretary an oppor-tunity to answer those who question the necessity of continuing to support the important work being done by your Department at all levels of education. PREPARED STATEMENT Again, Secretary Duncan, I want to thank you for appearing be- fore the subcommittee. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN TOMHARKIN The Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies will now come to order. Welcome back, Secretary Duncan. It's great to see you again. I'm glad to have you here to talk about your Department's fiscal year 2015 budget request. Your budget's proposed $1.3 billion increase is one of the largest of any Federal agency, second only to Veterans Affairs. The increase proposed for the Department of Education demonstrates this administration's continued commitment to our Na-tion's future. And, the budget goes a step further with the Opportunity, Growth, Se-curity Fund which would fully replace sequester in fiscal year 2015 and the subse-quent 6 years of the budget. This stands in stark contrast with the approach of Chairman Ryan's budget. That budget would cut nondefense discretionary spending by $43 billion, or about 9 per- cent, in fiscal year 2016, and $791 billion over 10 years. 167 The Ryan budget charts a different course than that established by the 2014 Om- nibus appropriations bill. Congress passed that bill on a bipartisan basis earlier this year. This subcommittee negotiated over $1 billion in new funding for early learning programs at Education and the Department of Health and Human Services. We also secured over $1 billion total for Title I and IDEA, the core Federal pro- grams for elementary and secondary education. The increases for these programs al-lowed us to restore most of the sequester cuts in fiscal year 2013. For higher education, we included a new investment of $75 million for the First in the World initiative to address college affordability. Colleges and universities will be able to compete for funding to test and develop strategies that reduce college costs and improve student outcomes. This is the first competition to support innova-tion in higher education since fiscal year 2010. We made a good start in the bipartisan omnibus bill and I think we need to con- tinue these important investments, not cut them and leave fewer of our students served. However, as the Secretary knows, there are some tough choices to be made under our nondefense discretionary spending cap. The fiscal year 2015 spending cap is roughly the same as the funding level for the current fiscal year.

This makes it very difficult to provide the kind of investments this budget so wise- ly advocates. But that's not our only challenge. I am hopeful that this hearing will give the Secretary an opportunity to answer those who question the necessity of con-tinuing to support the important work being done by your Department at all levels of education. Again, Secretary Duncan, I want to thank you for appearing before the Sub- committee. I turn now to Senator Moran for his opening statement. Senator H ARKIN . I turn now to Senator Moran for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JERRY MORAN Senator M ORAN . Secretary Duncan, thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. VALUE OF EARLY LEARNING There is no doubt about the important role education plays in a child's life. As I walk the halls of Kansas schools, I am struck by the faces of students who have such high hopes for their future. Whether opening doors to new opportunities or serving as a cata-lyst to achieving the American dream, it is clear that the founda-tion of our society is access to a quality education. And like you, Mr. Secretary, I believe that begins in the early years of development. Decades of research demonstrate that access to quality early childhood programs produce lasting effects on children's cognitive and social development. Children who are not proficient in reading by third grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school than children who read at or above grade level. A child's brain grows to approximately 85 percent of its full capacity in the first 5 years of life. Simply put, early learning is essential to the success of our students and society. However, as we strive to ensure all students have access to qual- ity early learning and pre-kindergarten through grade 12 pro-grams, we must refrain from simply proposing new programs as the only solution, especially new competitive programs. 168 FUNDING OF COMPETITIVE VERSUS FORMULA GRANT PROGRAMS I remain concerned with this administration's continued empha- sis on competitive grant programs. Once again, this budget directs new or increased funding primarily to competitive grant programs. Of the administration's proposed $1.3 billion increase to the De-partment of Education's budget, no increase is provided for title I of ESEA (Elementary and Secondary Education Act) or Special Education Grants that are distributed by formula to every State. In fact, rather than increasing base funding for Special Education Grants to States, the budget request provides $100 million in new funding for competitive incentive grants under special education. Students in every State should benefit from any increase in fund-ing for the Department of Education, yet that is not what is sup-ported by the Department's budget request. Further, the fiscal year 2015 budget request proposes $300 mil- lion for a new Race to the Top: Equity and Opportunity competition at the expense of an increase in funding for ESEA Title I grants. This new competition, as envisioned by the administration, is aimed at improving academic performance of students in the Na-tion's highest poverty schools by closing opportunity and achieve-ment gaps. Yet rather than increasing funding for ESEA Title I grants, the cornerstone of Federal education funding for disadvan-taged students since 1965, this budget invests in another new com-ponent of Race to the Top, the fifth since the program was created. It is important to note that not one of the Race to the Top compo-nents has yet demonstrated sustainable results. Mr. Chairman, the success of every student in every State should be our goal. The Department of Education should not pick winners and losers by funding only a few States to the detriment of stu-dents in all States. I look forward to working with you and the Department to en- sure that fiscal year 2015 funding is directed toward initiatives that benefit all students and support increased educational oppor-tunities in every State. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. INTRODUCTION OF SECRETARY OF EDUCATION Senator H ARKIN . This is Arne Duncan's sixth appearance before this subcommittee. He became the ninth Secretary of the U.S. De-partment of Education on January 20, 2009. Before his appointment, Secretary Duncan served as the chief ex- ecutive officer of the Chicago Public Schools. Before serving in Chi-cago, he ran the Ariel Education Initiative, which covered college costs for a group of inner-city youth and was instrumental in start-ing a new public elementary school, which ranks among the top schools in Chicago. Secretary Duncan also played professional basketball in Aus- tralia. Secretary Duncan graduated from Harvard University and played basketball at Harvard. He stills plays the game, so I guess you could say he still shoots a mean hoop. Welcome, Secretary Duncan. 169 SUMMARY STATEMENT OF HON . ARNE DUNCAN Secretary D UNCAN . Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and Senators, the story of American education today is a good news/bad news story. GOOD AND BAD NEWS FOR EDUCATION Let me begin by thanking you for your work on the 2014 budget, which increased our investment in education over the previous year. This investment is essential for the ''good news'' side of the story, which is that our students are making substantial progress in graduating from high school and enrolling in college. Our Nation's on-time high school graduation rate reached a record high in 2012 of 80 percent. That is a great testament to the hard work of our Nation's teachers, school leaders, students, and their families. College enrollment is up as well since President Obama took office, with Latino and African-American students leading the way. The bad news is that we still have unacceptable opportunity gaps in America, and it will be very difficult to close those gaps when Federal discretionary funding for education, excluding Pell grants, remains below the 2010 level. Our international competitors are not making the mistake of disinvesting in education, and their students are making more progress than America's students, endangering our country's com-petitiveness and prosperity. In a knowledge-based, global economy, the need to close these op- portunity gaps and strengthen our competitiveness is one of the most urgent challenges facing our Nation. To continue to fall be-hind would hurt our country economically for generations to come. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT NEEDED TO CLOSE OPPORTUNITY GAPS So I appeal to you today to continue America's longstanding, bi- partisan commitment to investing in education. Dating back to our Nation's founding, the Federal Government has provided incentives to State and local governments to invest in education and expand educational opportunity. Before the States ratified the Constitution, the Continental Congress required town-ships to reserve money for the construction of schools and granted Federal lands to States to create and support public schools. PRESCHOOL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GAP Despite the educational progress we have made as a Nation, large opportunity gaps remain at a time when education is more important than ever to accelerate economic progress, increasing up-ward mobility and reducing social inequality. President Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget would increase invest- ment in education to boost that progress and close those oppor-tunity gaps. Sadly, those opportunity gaps start with our youngest learners in early childhood education. If we could look at our first slide, America today is 25th, 25th in the world, in our enrollment of 4-year-olds in preschool. [The graphic follows:] 170 SUPPORT FOR HIGH -QUALITY EARLY LEARNING Secretary D UNCAN . Four in 10 public school systems in the United States don't even offer preschool, setting the stage for a huge gap in school readiness that not only President Obama, but most of our Nation's Governors, find unacceptable. In the real world, outside of Washington, and away from congres- sional dysfunction, this has become a truly bipartisan issue. In fact, last year alone, 30 Governors\u201417 Republicans and 13 Democrats\u2014 increased funding for preschool in their State budgets. In tough economic times, these leaders chose to use scarce tax- payer dollars to expand access to high-quality early learning oppor-tunities. Budgets, not just words, not empty rhetoric, reflect our true values. And these 30 Governors, in a bipartisan way, chose to walk that walk. Just one quick example, this year, Governor Snyder of Michigan committed to putting $65 million more into the State program to ensure children in need of preschool actually have access to it. He said he was going to make Michigan ''a no-wait State for early childhood education.'' PRESCHOOL EDUCATION FUNDS IN FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET We need to help every State to be able to make that claim. And that is why the President requests $500 million for Pre- school Development Grants and $75 billion in mandatory funding for the Preschool for All program; programs essential to our Na-tion's future. They would support State efforts to provide access to high-quality preschool through a mixed delivery system of both 171 public and private providers, for all 4-year-olds from low- and mod- erate-income families. VALUE OF EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS Very encouragingly, a diverse, highly unusual coalition is work- ing together to support these efforts. State attorneys, sheriffs, and police associations all support high-quality early learning because it reduces crime when those young children grow up. Military leaders support it, because a staggering three-quarters of young adults today are not able to serve in our voluntary mili-tary, because they have dropped out of high school, can't pass the entrance exam, are physically unfit for service, or have a criminal record. High-quality early learning reduces all of those problems. Our military has always been our strongest defense. Our edu- cation system must be our strongest offense. In addition, hundreds of hardheaded business leaders and CEOs are big advocates of early learning, because they know high-quality opportunities produce a better workforce and have a high ROI, or return on investment. In fact, Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr. James Heckman found a return of $7 to every $1 of public investment in high-qual-ity preschool programs. I would ask how many other uses of tax-payer dollars have such a high rate of return for the American peo-ple. Unfortunately, opportunity gaps in early learning continue all the way through high school, as new data from our civil rights data collection shows. I will show you the next slide, please. [The graphic follows:] 172 OPPORTUNITY GAP IN ACCESS TO POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION Secretary D UNCAN . Today, students of color, students with dis- abilities, and English language learners simply don't get the same opportunity as their white and Asian-American peers to take the basic math and science courses necessary that figure so impor-tantly in preparing for college and careers. Often, this lack of access means students can't take the required classes they need to apply to 4-year universities. Or it means they go to college but must burn through Pell grants and other financial aid taking noncredit-bearing remedial classes because they simply weren't ready. They weren't prepared. Nationwide, black and Hispanic students are close to 40 percent of high school students overall, but just over a quarter of students taking AP (Advanced Placement) classes and only 20 percent of those enrolled in calculus classes. This dumbing down of expectations is devastating to students, their families, their communities, and ultimately to our Nation as a whole. GAP IN ACCESS TO HIGH -SPEED BROADBAND And the final slide highlights opportunity gaps in access to high- speed broadband in our schools. Most schools today have nowhere near the bandwidth they need to support current applications and instruction. Fully two-thirds of our teachers wish they had more technology in their classrooms. Technology both empowers teachers and engages students in their own learning. Simply put, other nations take these respon-sibilities and these opportunities more seriously than we do here. [The graphic follows:] 173 PERCENTAGE OF U .S. SCHOOLS WITH BROADBAND ACCESS Secretary D UNCAN . In South Korea, for example, 100 percent of schools have high-speed Internet. Here in the United States, it is only about 20 percent, so 20 percent versus 100 percent. So our students, our teachers, and our schools often lack the bandwidth to take advantage of new technologies and tools that could accelerate efforts to close those insidious achievement gaps, to individualize instruction, and ensure that all students graduate from high school truly college- and career-ready. How is that fair to our children or to their hardworking teachers? How is that in our Nation's self-interest? FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET GOAL \u2014CLOSING OPPORTUNITY GAPS Making progress in closing these opportunity gaps is the ribbon, the theme that runs throughout President Obama's 2015 education budget request. It is the overarching goal of the Preschool Develop-ment Grants and Preschool for All. It is behind our request for a $300 million Race to the Top: Equity and Opportunity Fund to help States and districts develop roadmaps to ensure that all students can reach their potential, and our $200 million Connect Educators initiative to provide teachers with the expertise they need to use technology to teach students to high standards and to personalize instruction. RYAN BUDGET IMPACT ON EDUCATION By contrast, the House Republican budget would widen, would increase, opportunity gaps. OMB (Office of Management and Budg-174 et) estimates that the Ryan budget would cut funding for education by 15 percent in 2016, or by about $10 billion. If that 15-percent cut were applied to this year, ESEA Title I would be cut by $2.2 billion, and IDEA grants to States would be cut by $1.7 billion. That is exactly the wrong direction to go for our children and for our Nation's future. We can and we must do bet-ter, and do better together. The American dream has always been about opportunity. Today, our Nation is failing to live up to that core American idea for all of our citizens. We must do more now to level the playing field and make great public education available to every child. That is who we are, and that is who we should be. As former Florida Governor Jeb Bush says, ''The sad truth is that equality of opportunity doesn't exist in many of our schools . . . That failure is the great moral and economic issue of our time, and it is hurting all of Amer-ica.'' So I ask, can we please get back to working together to close those opportunity gaps that we all agree are deeply at odds with the American promise of equal opportunity? LEADERSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHAIRMAN HARKIN And just quickly, Mr. Chairman, before I close, I just want to thank you so much for your leadership. I know this is probably the last hearing that we will do together. I have learned so much from you over these past 5 12years. You have been a lifelong advocate on very tough issues and you have always had a heart for those folks who don't always have the strongest voice themselves. Your leadership in the disability community is just exemplary. Like so many of us doing this work, this work is very personal for you. I have heard you speak eloquently about the opportunities\u2014 or, frankly, the lack of opportunities\u2014your brother missed out on because he was deaf. And you have helped create more opportuni-ties for literally millions of children who needed a voice. PREPARED STATEMENT And finally, both you and Mr. Moran, Senator Moran, spoke as well on this push on early childhood education. And if we think about return on investment, if we think about strengthening our families, strengthening our country, I can make a pretty compelling case that the best investment we can make is in high-quality, early learning opportunities. And no one has been a clearer and more passionate advocate for that than you, so thank you so much. It has been a fantastic journey together. I will miss working with you greatly. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF ARNE DUNCAN I want to begin by thanking Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and other Members of this Subcommittee for your work on the 2014 appropriation for education. I appreciate the funding increases that you included in the fiscal year 2014 appropriation. However, it's important to recognize that total discretionary funding for the Department of Education, excluding Pell Grants, remains below the fiscal year 2010 level, and I worry about the long-term impact of the continuing slide in Federal education funding on the health of our economy and our democracy. 175 PRESIDENT OBAMA 'S 2015 BUDGET REQUEST Turning to 2015, the overall discretionary request for the Department of Edu- cation is $68.6 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 1.9 percent, over the 2014 level. Within this total, we have six key priorities: (1) increasing equity and opportunity for all students; (2) strengthening support for teachers and school leaders; (3) ex-panding high-quality preschool programs; (4) improving school safety and climate; (5) promoting educational innovation and improvement; and (6) ensuring access to affordable and quality postsecondary education. EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY We are requesting $300 million for a new Race to the Top\u2014Equity and Oppor- tunity competition centered on improving the academic performance of students in our Nation's highest poverty schools. RTT\u2014Opportunity grantees would support: (1) developing systems that integrate data on school-level finance, human resources, and academic achievement; (2) developing and retaining effective teachers and lead-ers in high-poverty schools; (3) increasing access to rigorous coursework; and (4) other evidence-based activities that mitigate the effects of concentrated poverty. SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS A second priority in our 2015 request is to provide significant support for school teachers and leaders who are implementing new college- and career-ready (CCR) standards, turning around our lowest performing schools, and using new evaluation systems to improve their practices. A key request in this area is $200 million that would help educators transition to using technology and data to personalize learning and improve instruction, in support of the FCC's ConnectED initiative to equip our Nation's schools and libraries with high-speed connectivity. The program would ben-efit educators and students by creating high-quality, open digital learning resources aligned to CCR standards; using digital tools to personalize learning and implement new assessments; analyzing real-time data to improve student outcomes; using tech-nology to increase student engagement; and providing remote access to effective educators. We are requesting $2.3 billion for Excellent Instructional Teams, which would provide both formula grants and competitive awards to help States and LEAs in-crease the effectiveness of teachers and principals. This total includes $2.0 billion for Effective Teachers and Leaders State Grants to provide flexible, formula-based support for States and LEAs; $320 million for the Teacher and Leader Innovation Fund to reform school leader advancement and compensation systems; and $35 mil-lion for a transformed School Leadership program to expand the Department's focus on current school leaders aimed at strengthening essential leadership skills. EXPANDING HIGH -QUALITY PRESCHOOL The third major priority in the 2015 request is to continue the President's commit- ment to expanding educational opportunity for millions of children through a $75 billion mandatory Preschool for All program that would partner with States to sup-port universal access to high-quality preschool for all 4-year-olds from low- and mod-erate-income families. Our preschool request also includes $500 million to expand the Preschool Development Grants program that would help build State and local capacity to implement high-quality preschool programs. In addition, we are requesting $441.8 million for the Grants for Infants and Fami- lies program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an in-crease of $3.3 million to help States implement statewide systems of early interven-tion services for all eligible children with disabilities from birth through age 2 and their families. AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY IN POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION Our 2015 request also includes key initiatives to improve affordability and quality in postsecondary education. For example, we are asking for $7 billion in mandatory budget authority over 10 years for new College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus grants to reward colleges that successfully enroll and graduate a significant number of low- and moderate-income students on time. This initiative would support innova-tions to further increase college access and success by providing funding to eligible institutions based upon the number of Pell students they graduate on time. The Sat-isfactory Academic Progress initiative would make changes to the Pell Grant eligi-bility provisions by strengthening academic progress requirements to encourage stu-dents to complete on time. The Budget would also provide Pell Grant eligibility to students who are co-enrolled in adult and postsecondary education as part of a ca-176 reer pathway program to allow adults without a high school diploma to gain the knowledge and skills they need to secure a good job. Second, we would use $4 billion in mandatory funding to create a State Higher Education Performance Fund that would make 4-year competitive grants to States to support the successful implementation of performance-based policy and funding reforms that encourage and reward college affordability and ensure that students attend and complete postsecondary education. Third, our 2015 request proposes $100 million to expand support for the First in the World fund to make competitive awards to support improving educational out-comes, including on time completion rates, and making college more affordable for students and families, particularly for low-income students. The request also asks for $75 million for College Success Grants for Minority-Serving Institutions, which would make competitive awards to minority-serving institutions designated under Title III and Title V of the Higher Education Act. Lastly, we are continuing our efforts to help student borrowers with existing debt to manage their obligations through income-driven repayment plans. Our 2015 re-quest proposes to extend Pay As You Earn, which caps student loan payments at 10 percent of discretionary income, to all student borrowers. EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT We continue to support innovation and improvement in elementary and secondary education, beginning with $165 million for Investing in Innovation (i3), an increase of $23.4 million, to maintain strong support for using an evidence-based approach to scale up the most effective approaches in high-need areas. The i3 request would provide up to $49.5 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Edu-cation, an initiative that would pursue technological breakthroughs with the poten-tial to improve the effectiveness and productivity of teaching and learning. Second, we are requesting $150 million for a new High School Redesign program to support the transformation of the high school experience by funding competitive grants to school districts and their partners to redesign high schools to help ensure all students graduate from high school with college credit and career-related experi-ences or competencies. Third, our 2015 request seeks $170 million in new funding for a comprehensive STEM Innovation proposal to transform STEM education. This total includes $110 million for STEM Innovation Networks to provide competitive awards to LEAs in partnership with institutions of higher education, other public agencies, and busi-nesses to help increase the number of students who are effectively prepared for post-secondary education and careers in STEM fields. We also are asking for $40 million to support STEM Teacher Pathways that would make competitive grants for recruit- ing recent college graduates and mid-career professionals in the STEM fields in high-need schools. An additional $20 million would support the activities of a Na-tional STEM Master Teacher Corps, which would identify models to help America's brightest math and science teachers make the transition from excellent teachers to school leaders and advocates for STEM education. In addition, the Budget provides a $100 million increase for Special Education State Grants. This increase would support Results Driven Accountability incentive grants to improve special education services for children with disabilities. States awarded these grants would identify and implement promising, evidence-based re-forms while also building State and local capacity to improve long-term outcomes. Our 2015 request also includes a request of $1.1 billion for a reauthorized Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education program. The reauthorization proposal would build on the experience of the i3 program by creating a discretionary fund aimed at promoting innovation and reform in CTE and replicating the success of proven models. IMPROVING SCHOOL SAFETY AND CLIMATE The 2015 request would continue support for the Now is the Time school safety initiative by providing $50 million for School Climate Transformation Grants to help create positive school climates that support effective education for all students; $45 million for a Successful, Safe, and Healthy State and Local Grants program that would award grants to increase the capacity of States, districts, and schools to cre-ate safe, healthy, and drug-free environments; and $25 million for Project Prevent grants to help LEAs break the cycle of violence through expanded access, school- based strategies that prevent future violence. 177 OPPORTUNITY , GROWTH , AND SECURITY INITIATIVE The Administration's Budget also includes a separate $56 billion Opportunity, Se- curity, and Growth Initiative. Our Education Budget would use this initiative to in-clude additional investments of $250 million for Preschool Development Grants, $300 million for the Connect Educators initiative, and $200 million for Promise Neighborhoods. All of these funds are in addition to the discretionary requests under the caps. CONCLUSION In conclusion, our 2015 Budget reflects the President's determination to make the investments necessary to secure America's future prosperity. I look forward to work-ing with the Subcommittee to secure support for the President's 2015 Budget for education. PRESCHOOL EDUCATION LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT Senator H ARKIN . Well, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. I will respond in kind and just say that it has been great working with you for these last 5 years. You have been a great Secretary. You have really pushed the envelope on a lot of different things. And I think there has been tremendous change for the better in our schools in America because of your leadership. And I especially appreciate your strong and forceful leadership on early education. As you mentioned, that is something that I think we all\u2014bipartisan, bicameral, executive, legislative\u2014all agree on. Hopefully, we can come up with a good funding level for the pre- school program. I think it has finally caught on around America. I did not know the number that you stated about the 30 Governors who have increased their funding for preschool. But I think finally the American people, and, certainly, the business community has been behind this forever. For 25, 30 years, the business community has been pushing for more funding for preschool. So now it is really catching on. It is not too late, but I wish we would have done this 25 years ago. But your leadership has been great on this. I appreciate it very much. And this is the last time I will chair a budget hearing with you, with the Department of Education. And wouldn't you know it, my last year here, we have a tough budget. So we have some tough things to work out, but we will. We will work them out, and we will do our best to meet our obligations and do our best to work out with you and the President a meeting of the minds between the interests of the people on this committee and the legislative branch and the interests of the executive branch. I am sure we will get that done. So again, Mr. Secretary, I thank you for your great leadership. I am going to miss our association a lot. SPECIAL EDUCATION IN FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET REQUEST Mr. Secretary, we will start a 5-minute round of questions now. Let's start with kids with disabilities. We made great progress on access, thanks to IDEA. We are improving quality of services. We have lifted IDEA funding in the Recovery Act. We did up to 33 per-cent, which got us close to the 40 percent, which we had promised so many years ago when I was a House Member. 178 But we have more to do to make sure that students with disabil- ities are graduating with the skills and knowledge needed to suc-ceed in postsecondary education and the workplace. RESULTS DRIVEN ACCOUNTABILITY INCENTIVE GRANTS That is why I was concerned to see the lack of any increase in IDEA formula funds. However, you do have an increase proposed\u2014 targeted to the Results Driven Accountability (RDA) incentive grants, which I am all for, because we are trying to change, as I said to you one time before, the focus on kids with IEPs (Individ-ualized Education Program), so that when they get out of school, they won't feel that the only place for them to go is into submin- imum wage jobs, that they can actually go out for competitive, inte-grated employment in the workplace. So many businesses have found that these people with intellec- tual disabilities can do a lot more than what we thought they could do in the past. And so I want to know more about the RDA incentive grants, and how you are going to work with, let's say, Vocational Rehabili-tation on the HHS (Health and Human Services) side and the De-partment of Labor side to mesh these, to look at what schools can do, how they can work with the States' workforce development pro-grams, to get these kids ready for competitive, integrated employ-ment when they get out of school. CHANGING SPECIAL EDUCATION TO OUTCOMES Secretary D UNCAN . So I really appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. And Michael Yudin, who leads this office, I think is doing extraordinary work, and really challenging us to challenge the status quo. As you know, we try to push States and districts very hard to raise expectations and raise the bar, and we have to do the same internally. And while we have done some really good things and good things together, I think a pretty compelling case can be made that, in this area, there probably has been too much focus on com-pliance, too much focus on checking boxes, and not enough focus on exactly what you are saying. Are we preparing these young people to be successful, to be self-sufficient in a competitive workforce, and focusing not just on inputs and on compliance, but on outcomes? What are we doing to increase high school graduation rates? What are we doing to increase college graduation rates? What are we doing to increase a successful transition into the workforce? We want to challenge people to step up and do more here. We want to identify those best practices. We want to replicate them. We want to take them to scale. So I am happy to talk further off-line. It would be great to have you and Michael Yudin spend some time together. But we think there is a chance to take the hard work that is going on around the country to a different level, and we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I look forward to working with Mr. Yudin and our staff, if not on this committee, on the authorizing side, too. 179 But I am just very interested in this funding for that new initia- tive. COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND GRADUATION BONUS GRANTS Let me just ask about college affordability. As you know, this is one of the key things we are going to be looking at, both on the authorizing level and on the appropriations level, too. We included a new investment of $75 million for the First in the World initiative in last year's omnibus. It will provide competitive grants to colleges and universities to develop and test strategies to make college more affordable and improve student completion rates. The higher education community has not had an opportunity to compete for funds that support innovation since fiscal year 2010. So this recent investment represents a long overdue opportunity to start moving the needle on college costs and student success at campuses across the country. Can you just provide a few details on what the Department hopes to accomplish with the upcoming competition for these funds? Secretary D UNCAN . Well, I think that the cost of college and col- lege affordability is just a hugely important issue and one that we have a lot of work on ahead of us. And hardworking American families, not just in disadvantaged communities, but middle-class families, in far too many places, peo-ple are starting to think that college is for the wealthy, not for them. And I always tell the story\u2014it was actually a visit to Iowa\u2014 where we did a town hall meeting and a young girl came up to me afterward and was talking\u2014very sharp, very committed\u2014and ended up saying, she is a twin. She was a senior in high school, and this is like 2 years ago. But she said her parents had been try-ing to decide which twin to send to college, her or her brother. It was absolutely devastating. And families should not be put in that position. So we all have a lot of work to do to make college more accessible, more affordable. FIRST IN THE WORLD IN COLLEGE COMPLETION What we are trying to do in First in the World is incentivize uni- versities to move in that direction, to focus on keeping costs down, to focus not just on access but completion rates at the backend. The goal is not to go to college; the goal is to complete at the backend. We are going to put out a notice on the First in the World com- petition in probably the next month, in mid-May, and then awards would go out by the end of the fiscal year in September. Senator H ARKIN . Well, that is good. That is good to know. I didn't know that. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Senator Moran. COLLEGE RATINGS SYSTEM CRITERIA Senator M ORAN . Mr. Secretary, let me start with my questions about, in this case, higher education. The President has directed that the Department develop a new college rating system for the 180 2015-2016 school year. And in this budget request, the request is made for $10 million to further develop that program. Let me raise a couple questions and thoughts about this topic. First of all, I would like to know, to date, what has transpired. And if we don't specifically include the $10 million in this appro-priation bill, does the Department intend to continue to develop this college rating system? Secondly, let me raise the topic of performance information for the college rating system that could be used to determine that cri-teria. I know it is in the works. You don't have the criteria in place yet. But I am concerned that, depending upon that criteria or the in- centive that is created by this rating program, will it discourage universities from encouraging students from difficult backgrounds to pursue a college education? I guess they don't discourage the student; they just discourage them from coming to their university. And then finally on this topic, depending upon those metrics, how will you take into account something that I think is very im-portant for us to, certainly, not discourage and if we can encourage, it is good, but if there is any criteria that is based upon the college graduate's income, what we would call financial success, are we not excluding people who enter the military, young people who decide they want a faith-based career, missions work\u2014\u2014 Secretary D UNCAN . Teachers. Senator M ORAN . Teachers. Yes, I almost beat you to that word. Are we not discouraging some things that are very noble in our society, if there is any criteria based upon what we would call ''suc-cess'' by those college graduates? CONSIDERATIONS IN DEVELOPING RATINGS CRITERIA Secretary D UNCAN . Those are all great questions, and we are working through all of those very tough issues as we speak. Again, I would be happy to have these conversations with you and your staff in detail. So to be clear, if we come up with something that does those things that you talked about, then we would have failed. So we ab-solutely want to not discourage, but encourage universities to take young people who are Pell grant recipients, who are first-genera-tion college-goers. And if we do the incentive structure wrong, that will be a problem. We have some very clear thoughts about how to do it, to encour- age universities to do it, and not discourage it. But happy to do that. We need more teachers. We need more social workers. We need more people to go into Government service. We need more people to go into the Peace Corps. And so making sure we encourage that, rather than discourage that, will be key. So we are being very, very thoughtful in how we put this system together. We are taking a huge amount of time. I have said repeat-edly, we are going into this work with a great sense of humility. We have had dozens and dozens of roundtables with college stu- dents and college presidents and boards. I am happy to sit down with you and your staff to work it through. And our only interest is getting this right. 181 Let me talk to you about, as difficult and intellectually chal- lenging as this is, why it is so important. EDUCATION INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION Together, you and I, all of us, we put out about $150 billion in grants and loans to support higher education each year, $150 bil-lion. Similar to the IDEA special education grants conversation, virtually all of that is based on inputs. Virtually none of that is based on outcomes. NEED FOR FOCUS ON COMPLETION AS WELL AS ACCESS So taxpayers are supporting a massive investment each year and have very little sense of whether they are getting a good return on that or not. As you know, some universities do a great job of increasing ac- cess. Others, frankly, don't. Some do a great job of encouraging first-generation college students to come. Others don't. I am very focused not just on access, but on completion, on at- tainment. Some universities do a great job of supporting students through mentoring programs and bridge programs. Others let them walk in the door, and they sort of sink or swim on their own. So we think we have to do something better. We have to do it together. We have to do it very thoughtfully. But having none of our money moving toward universities that are taking these responsibilities that you and I think are so signifi-cant, so profound, the status quo doesn't make sense to me. COMMITTED TO DEVELOPMENT OF COLLEGE RATINGS SYSTEM Senator M ORAN . In the absence of that $10 million being in- cluded in our appropriation bill, do you have the money and the au-thority to pursue this program? Secretary D UNCAN . We absolutely need to pursue this. We will pursue it. The money would be very, very beneficial. It would be very helpful. But we are moving forward on this, yes. Senator M ORAN . Thanks very much, Mr. Secretary. I don't have enough time to ask a second question. I will have an opportunity later. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Alexander. Senator A LEXANDER . Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, welcome. It is good to see you. Let me discuss something that I am sure we agree on, and some- thing I am afraid we disagree on, and ask you a question about it. STUDENT PERFORMANCE -BASED TEACHER EVALUATION We agree that we want higher standards for our 100,000 public schools. I am pretty sure we agree that teacher evaluation based on student performance is sort of the Holy Grail of elementary and secondary education. Where I am afraid we disagree is that I believe that is a State and local responsibility, and you believe it can be required from Washington, DC. 182 NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WAIVER AUTHORITY For example, you revoked a waiver the other day for the State of Washington because the legislature there wouldn't enact a teach-er evaluation system according to your standards. Now, I looked at the law, Federal law, and section 9527 of the Elementary and Sec-ondary Education Act says: An employee of the Federal Govern-ment can't mandate, direct, or control a school's curriculum, pro-gram of instruction. Section 1232 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act said: Any department or agency here cannot exercise any direction, supervision, or control over curriculum, program of instruction, personnel. Section 3403 of the Department of Edu-cation Organization Act prohibits any direction over curriculum, in-struction, personnel. In other words, it is clear to me that Congress says no national school board. Looking for the authority for you to make decisions like this, I go to the Secretary's waiver under No Child Left Behind, which is very simple. It says you may waive any requirement of the act that a State asks you to waive. But it seems to me, if it were ''Mother, May I,'' the old childhood game, you have turned it into where the child says, ''Mother, may I go outside and play,'' and you say, ''Yes, you may, but you need to sweep the floor, and make your bed, and cook the breakfast, and go to school, and do your homework, and be nice to your father,'' and do all these things. And the kid said, ''I didn't ask about that.'' And the mother said, ''Well, that is what you have to do.'' REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WAIVER To get a waiver for No Child Left Behind, for example, your re- quirements say you have to adopt standards. There are two versions of that that are approved, only two. You have to adopt am-bitious, achievable performance goals about whether schools are succeeding or failing. There are two versions of that, only two. You have to have prescriptive turnaround models if schools are low-per-forming and have significant achievement gaps. There are four types of that, only four. And you have to have a certain kind of teacher and principal evaluation. It has to meet each of seven Fed-eral criteria. And this didn't happen in Washington State. Now you know how much I care about teacher evaluation. Ten- nessee became the first State to do it when I was Governor. But I don't think you can do it from here or order it from here or define it from here. And in my opinion, what you are doing with this very well-inten- tioned overreach, I think, is creating a backlash among conserv-atives who don't like the Federal Government involved, and a back-lash among teachers unions who don't want any form of student achievement related to teacher evaluation. And you are under-mining, I am afraid, the very high standards and teacher evalua-tion systems that I think both of us want to do. In other words, I think the way to get to where both of us would like to go is not by ordering it from here, but by letting the Gov-ernors and the States have the responsibility to do it. 183 TEACHER EVALUATION AND FEDERALLY GRANTED WAIVERS So my question is: Would you please explain to me how using your waiver authority to place conditions on States about common standards, about performance targets, about teacher evaluation systems that are not otherwise required by Federal law\u2014and in the case of standards, in my opinion, is prohibited by the law\u2014how does that not amount to, in effect, a national school board? Secretary D UNCAN . This is a conversation you and I have had a number of times. Just to be very, very clear, to paraphrase a former Senator, I know what it is to be a superintendent. As you know, I used to be a superintendent, and I am not a national su-perintendent now. And what we have tried to do is very simple. Where States want to move away from the onerous provisions of No Child Left Behind, where they want to partner with us, and where we want to provide some flexibility, we just say some very simple things. You have to have high standards. And they can be State-developed. They can be common. We are open there. There is lots of flexibility there in terms of what folks have done. We just say you can't dummy down standards. Again, you have the right to do that. We are just not going to provide you additional flexibility, if you are dumbing things down. We think that the goal of teaching is not to teach. The goal of teaching is to actually have children learn and to have a piece of teacher evaluation be based upon student learning, we think, is just sort of basic common sense. I think it is very important that we use language very precisely, encouraging high standards. Again, common, or not common, our goal is high standards. We feel very good about that. NO FEDERAL ROLE OR INVOLVEMENT IN CURRICULUM We never have, never will, touch curriculum. Curriculum is not standards. Those things get conflated either through\u2014well, I won't get into why they get conflated. But standards are the bar we want people to reach, which is college- and career-ready once they grad-uate from high school. How you teach to those standards is curriculum. And it would be the height of arrogance for us to say anything about it. We never have, and we never will. That is always best left up to local com-munities. And so again, I would just use as a case study of where I think we have been a very important, effective partner, Exhibit A, quite candidly, Senator, is your State, the State of Tennessee. I came to that State 2 or 3 years ago. Tennessee was one of the lowest performing States in the Nation. I challenged the State to figure out, could it be the fastest improving State in the Nation, not the highest performing, but the fastest improving. I think if you asked your Governor, who I have a tremendous re- lationship with, if you asked your State superintendent, who I have a tremendous relationship with, have I and my Department sup-ported them in their efforts\u2014not told them what to do, not man-dated things, but supported them in their efforts\u2014I think we will let their words speak for themselves. 184 And we are thrilled\u2014thrilled\u2014that Tennessee is the fastest im- proving State in the Nation. And all the credit goes to the great work at the local level. But I would like to think a small bit of the help of support they got from us has been part of that story. So I will stop there. Senator A LEXANDER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a longer conversation, and my time is up. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator. Senator Landrieu. Senator L ANDRIEU . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And let me begin by thanking you for your extraordinary leadership all these years on this committee. And as an appropriator and an au-thorizer, you have had just an enormous impact for good for our country, for our children's health and education. And it has been an honor to work with you, and I look forward to our next few months together in these roles. CHARTER SCHOOL PROGRAM Mr. Secretary, you know that I have been, along with many Members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, a strong champion for charter schools, for public charter schools\u2014public, open access, free charter schools\u2014that are really, in essence, inde-pendent, entrepreneurial, inspirational, exciting places in this country, for the most part. Not every charter school is inspirational or working. But the idea of it, the model of it, is very entrepre-neurial. I know that you are familiar with the just unbelievable growth in grades and academic achievement happening in Orleans Parish, which is sort of ground zero in a positive way for the charter school movement that Senator Alexander has been so supportive of, and Representative Miller, Representative Cantor, and Representative Kline, and a growing number of Senators here of both parties. So it was perplexing to me, having been able to see so carefully and so closely the tremendous opportunity that kids of all races and backgrounds are achieving in public charter schools, to see in your budget flat funding for this initiative, the charter school pro-gram. It was disappointing to see the level of charter school fund-ing flat. Can the Department outline your expectations for successful im- plementation of the charter school program, given the level of fund-ing at $248 million for 2015? And the reason I say that is because I know that moving to char- ter schools is not the answer for every failing public school. I real-ize that there are other choices, good choices, that can be made. But the evidence is in and clear that charter schools that are op- erating with quality leadership, it is in\u2014the evidence is in; it is in-disputable. With quality leadership, with open enrollment, with choice, it is actually working. And I see it every day when I go home. So why did you all flat fund it? And do you not agree with the evidence that has been presented to you and your department? Secretary D UNCAN . I appreciate your tremendous leadership and courage on this issue and others. 185 I think the charter community has felt very well-supported by me and our administration. I think we have lots of bows and ar-rows, slings, to show for some of the challenges we have faced in support of that. These are, obviously, very tough budget times. We are thrilled to be able to maintain funding there. I just want to be very clear, for the record, that I am just a huge proponent of high-performing public schools, be they traditional schools or charter schools. And so many of the extraordinary public schools that I have seen in disadvantaged communities are char-ters, where they are changing the opportunity structure for kids and families\u2014\u2014 FUNDS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Senator L ANDRIEU . Let me ask you this, then, because you and I have had a long conversation about this, like you have with Sen-ator Alexander over the issues that he raised. You always say that, ''I am a strong supporter of high-performing public schools.'' So we have $248 million for public charters, which are a proven model, when they work correctly. We then gave you, over the last several years, billions of dollars for traditional public school improvement. Do you know how much money to date this administration has been given, to you by Congress, for that? What is it, $6 billion? Is that the number for\u2014\u2014 Secretary D UNCAN . Which fund? Which item are you talking about? Senator L ANDRIEU . School Improvement Grants. Secretary D UNCAN . Oh, okay. Senator L ANDRIEU . How much money have you had for School Improvement Grants? How much? Secretary D UNCAN . Yes, that is the right ballpark, yes. Senator L ANDRIEU . About $6 billion. Secretary D UNCAN . Yes. Senator L ANDRIEU . Okay, for School Improvement Grants. So my question is: You have given a very small amount of money for public high-performing charters. The evidence is in that they work. We have given 10 times that much money to School Improve-ment Grants for traditional public schools. So can you take 30 sec-onds, and then submit in writing to me, what evidence do you have that the $6 billion that we have spent for general improvements in public schools, not charters, what other models are working? And are they working as well as charters? Secretary D UNCAN . A couple things. Let me just walk through the math. That $6 billion is aggregated over a couple years. If you aggre- gate the charter money, it would be closer to $1 billion or so. Senator L ANDRIEU . Okay, so it is $1 billion versus $6 billion. Secretary D UNCAN . Roughly. Senator L ANDRIEU . That is good. 186 SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT GRANTS FUNDS Secretary D UNCAN . This funding is going to the bottom 5 percent of schools in the Nation, to turn them around. This is tough work. It is challenging. No one ever has funded this before. Part of the reason high school graduation rates are up across the Nation is we are challenging those dropout factories. CHARTER SCHOOLS AS MEANS FOR TURNING AROUND SCHOOLS One of the potential models that Senator Alexander talked about for those turnarounds is to convert to charters. Quite honestly, one of the challenges we have faced is that I would love more folks in the charter community to think about turning around traditional schools, and there has not been a lot of\u2014\u2014 Senator L ANDRIEU . That is exactly what we have done in New Orleans. And I know I am taking my time, but 20 more seconds. The charter community, which is $1 billion with 1 million kids on the waiting list, is turning around, in our State, the lowest per-forming schools, taking them from the lowest to the highest. It is a model that works. It has been proven, proven, proven, proven. Secretary D UNCAN . So charter\u2014\u2014 Senator L ANDRIEU . Let me just finish. It is a proven model. So I am going to be pressing this budget to spend our money where it works, and stop spending money where it doesn't. It is just as simple as that. So I am going to be looking for some very hard evidence on the $6 billion that you all have spent on general turnaround models, because I want you to prove to me that those other models work, because I know the charter model works. CHARTER SCHOOL ACCESS TO SCHOOL TURNAROUND FUNDS Secretary D UNCAN . Okay, just to be very, very clear, charters can access that $6 billion as a turnaround, and we don't have many charter providers who want to do this work. Senator L ANDRIEU . I don't agree with that, but we will look into it. Secretary D UNCAN . Okay. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Merkley. Senator M ERKLEY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. COMPETITIVE GRANT VERSUS FORMULA ALLOCATION PROGRAMS Mr. Secretary, one thing I wanted to draw to your attention that I am sure you have heard many times before; we have 200 school districts in Oregon, many of them very small. They consistently ask me to encourage the Department to focus on the formula funding distributions, simply because they don't have grant writers. They don't have extra administrators who can write grants. They are stressed as it is. This is something I can relate to. I ran small nonprofits, and I was a grant writer. And I was a grant writer be-tween midnight and 2 a.m. to try to get those grants out. And after you write five or six of them, and nothing comes back, you kind of give up. 187 So they feel like the emphasis on grant writing is highly disad- vantageous to small schools. And I have heard that in every part of my State. So I just wanted to emphasize that message back to you. Is that something you are familiar with? COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS AS PERCENTAGE OF EDUCATION FUNDS Secretary D UNCAN . Very aware of. And just to be clear, and it is sometimes a misconception here, approximately 89 percent of our budget is formula based. Only about 10 percent or 11 percent is competitive. So the majority of every dollar, $.89, is going out on a formula basis. Having said that, we feel very good about the few programs we have on the competitive side. We have seen, increasingly, rural dis-tricts come in. We have seen consortia of districts come in. And we can sort of walk through whether it is a Promise Neighborhoods initiative or the Investing in Innovation Fund, where we have got-ten some very nontraditional players, folks who think they can't compete or can't play are able to come into the game and do very, very well. So please challenge us to make sure we continue to level the playing field when we do that. But we think we have actually got-ten better at that over time. Senator M ERKLEY . Well, I will just note that the 2015 proposals take the discretionary grant funds from 10 percent of the budget to 16 percent of the budget, which is the opposite of the direction my school districts would like to see us go. So I would just share that back with you. HIGH COST OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION One of the things I am extremely concerned about is the cost of higher education. In this regard, certainly, I support more Pell grants. I support tuition freezes. I support low interest rates on student loans. But even with all that, in working-class communities, there is a growing conversation about whether or not there is really a path-way for children to succeed. And they are worried. And their par-ents are worried about having their kids trapped between high loan payments and low wages, and being squeezed between those. And demographically, we are actually seeing this impact in terms of people living in their parents' spare bedrooms, their basement, and marriage being postponed. It is not just an unfounded fear; it is a real thing. And it goes to the heart of an aspirational society where every child has a path to succeed. OREGON 'S PAY IT FORWARD PROGRAM There is a concept that has started in Oregon called Pay It For- ward, which is designed to address this. It basically says, instead of getting a loan, you get a Pay It Forward grant. And in exchange, you pledge to pay back 2 percent of your future income over 2 dec-ades, roughly, roughly speaking. 188 The details are more complicated to work it out, but I am pro- posing experimenting with this, because it solves that compression, because you can't be trapped between low wages and high loan payments, because if your wages are low, your payments are low. And if you are the next Bill Gates, then you have the blessing of putting $1 billion or $2 billion into the grant fund for the next gen-eration. It would create a different message that, indeed, there is an aspi- rational path for every child to succeed. Do you support experimenting with this type of different ap- proach? Are you willing to engage deeply in the conversation, be-cause our current system is not working? Secretary D UNCAN . First of all, Senator, I just want to say how much I appreciate your sensitivity on these issues. You understand them at a level of detail and nuance that most folks don't. You have lived this. You represent folks who are living this. And so having your thoughts, having your advice on this, is hugely helpful. That Pay It Forward model is very, very interesting to me. As you may know, it is based on the Australian and New Zealand models. I spent 4 years in Australia. My wife is Australian. She went to school there. So I am very, very familiar with it. I am happy to discuss it further. I am happy to look at whether you can experiment or do an exercise or do something interesting there in Oregon. But together, whether it is that or something else, I think we all have to find ways to do something radically better than what is happening today. So thinking outside the box, thinking differently, this idea came not from a bunch of academics, but from students in Oregon who are very, very thoughtful in doing the research and looking inter-nationally. So we would love to continue the conversation in a meaningful way. Senator M ERKLEY . Thank you. I will take you up on that offer to continue that conversation, because for untold numbers of high school students right now, they are getting the message from their community that they might as well give up, because they are not going to be able to afford to go forward. And that is something that should concern all of us. This is the American dream just slipping through our fingers for millions of working Americans. Secretary D UNCAN . Just quickly, we have tried to do as much as we can. There is a lot of work to do. We had, as you know, a $40 billion increase in Pell grants, without going back to the taxpayers for a nickel. It went from 6 million Pell recipients to almost 9 mil-lion, a 50-percent increase, many first-generation college-goers, probably many of the residents you represent. So we feel great about that, but we have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We are not where we need to be. Senator M ERKLEY . Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Moran. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Secretary, there is an irony here that at least I see as an irony, that I want to explore with you. The President announced the ConnectED initiative last June, and the goal was to get 99 percent of our schools across the country 189 to be connected. And, certainly, I am pleased by that. We work hard at bringing broadband services to rural America. It is a high priority for me. You have a part of that, and your budget request is for $200 mil- lion for a new Connect Educators part of that program. It is to train and bring our teachers up to a level of understanding and ap-preciation for what may come when connectivity actually occurs. But 84 percent, almost 85 percent, of the money that you are re- questing of that $200 million is based upon a competitive grant. So you are asking rural and underserved areas of the country to com-pete for the $200 million that is in your budget. The irony of that to me is this: That we have already determined that we have these rural schools that will struggle to connect. And then we are making them compete for the money to help them be prepared for the money that will come. ABILITY OF RURAL SCHOOLS TO COMPETE FOR GRANT FUNDS To me, this is the broader issue that I tried to raise in my open- ing statement, in which we have competitive grants\u2014and this is in part me being an advocate for rural America, an advocate for a State like ours. I will speak at graduation in 1 12weeks. There are 11 high school seniors graduating from the class. Those kind of circumstances can't lend themselves to being capable of competing for the grants that your Department so actively promotes. And it seems to me, the point I want to make and have you re- spond to, is here we have a program that is initially designed to help rural schools. But even rural schools have to compete for those dollars. And already the decision has been made that there is a dis-advantage. And my point being that those disadvantaged schools, whether it is this interconnectivity issue or it is Title I or it is IDEA, we just have school districts that are unlikely to be able to compete. They don't have the personnel. They don't have the grant writing exper-tise. It is hard to find somebody. Many of our school districts in Kansas will have a school super- intendent who is also the building principal. And yet, we are ask-ing those schools to figure out how they can compete for dollars that you want to use to promote excellence. I want to promote ex-cellence, but I want to make certain we don't leave behind those that we claim already are underserved or disadvantaged because they are rural. Secretary D UNCAN . Great questions. I actually think we have very good answers. Again, I would be happy to follow up with you later. So we have, frankly, thought all these things through. When we do these competitions, we are not going to the wealthy commu-nities. When we do Promise Neighborhoods, we are going to the most disadvantaged communities. So we are very intentionally targeting in these competitions those areas of the greatest need, not of the greatest grant writers, not of the greatest wealth. And again, if you look program by program, School Improvement Grants, Promise Neighborhoods, the Investing in Innovation Fund, 190 when we did the School Improvement Grants that Senator Landrieu talked about, there was a huge outcry that rurals couldn't compete, it wouldn't work in rural communities. Quite surprisingly, to us, rural communities actually got slightly more than their ''fair'' share; they got disproportionately more of the dollars than did urban and suburban areas and have, frankly, done very, very well. So you can look across what we have done. We have made some significant grants in places like Appalachia. We have made grants in poor rural communities in other parts of the Nation. We have done competitive priorities. We have done absolute pri- orities and set asides. And again, I would be happy to talk through the structure with you. But we think we have done, frankly, over time, a pretty good job of making sure those rural communities who don't have the fancy grant writers are being very well-served. MAXIMIZING IMPACT WITH LIMITED FUNDS The other important point to make is that, as you guys know, $200 million sounds like a lot. Spread across 15,000 school dis-tricts, that is like pennies. And trying to maximize the benefits with scarce tax dollars\u2014we are asking for $200 million. I could use $2 billion, $4 billion, pick a number. It is just not realistic in these financial times. I understand that. We are trying to make sure that we have maximum impact in the places that could use the money the most, again, not the wealthiest districts, not those with the best grant writers, but to have maximum impact in the places that could use it the most. The final thing I will say is that, as we do the Connected Edu- cators part, as the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) looks to increase access to high-speed broadband, we know rural communities have the greatest need. We know that is where the greatest cost is going to be. Just know that we are absolutely com-mitted to serving those communities. Senator M ORAN . I don't think that there is a set aside for rural districts in Connected Educators. It is a broad program for all schools across the country to compete. Secretary D UNCAN . Again, we are happy to work it through, but whether it is a set aside, whether it is a competitive advantage, we want to make sure that every competition we do is being used in very different communities because we are trying to create spots that can demonstrate best practices. So we can work through with you, technically, how we are going to set this up. But rest assured, we will make sure that rural com-munities get their fair share of those resources. Senator M ORAN . Thank you. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Moran. We have been joined by our neighbor to the east, Senator Kirk. Welcome. I yield to you, if you are prepared. Senator K IRK. I am. ALL YEAR SCHOOL STUDY ACT (S . 2029) Mr. Secretary, I have a present for you. I wanted to give you this chart, which shows countries that have all-year schools substan-tially outscoring the United States. It is for you and your office, so 191 you can always look at it and be reminded of S. 2029, which Sen- ator Booker and I have endorsed. [The chart and information on All Year School Study Act from Senator Kirk's office follow:] FROM THE OFFICE OF SENATOR MARK KIRK ALL YEAR SCHOOL STUDY ACT , S. 2029 Kirk-Booker bill to establish a pilot program for year-round schools to boost aca- demic achievement in low-income, low-performing districts 192 The Problem A long summer vacation within the school calendar is an outdated relic from the agricultural economy of 19th century. We no longer need kids to bring in the har-vest. Moreover, the long summer breaks of the traditional school calendar can be detrimental to academic achievement. \u2014Over the course of the summer, students lose on average one-month of math skills \u2014Low-income students lose as much as 3 months of learning in reading skills while their higher-income peers actually make gains in the same skills However, very few schools have adjusted their calendars. Year-Round Schools Are an Effective Solution \u2014In Illinois, year-round schools have been consistently successful at increasing academic achievement. At Alain Locke Elementary in Chicago, 25% and 23% more low-income students hit state benchmarks in reading and math than the state overall. It was also recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as 1 of 7 schools in the nation best at ''Closing the Achivement Gap.'' \u2014A 2012 study of year-round schools in Virginia found that certain student groups are more likely to improve faster. 74% and 65% of African American stu-dents at year-round schools improved faster than their traditional calendar peers in reading and math respectively. \u2014The United States overall has seen stagnant growth for student performance in recent years, while other OECD countries that employ year-round schools such as Singapore, Japan, and Austrailia routinely dominate on international math testing. \u2014According to 2013 PISA results, the U.S. average math score was 13 points below the OECD average, meanwhile Singapore, whose average scores ranked 2nd overall, outscored the OECD average by 79 points. We need to cultivate our future workforce to be prepared to master the skills of the 21st century information economy\u2014and follow the example of some of our toughest competitors by embracing innovative approaches to education. All Year School Study Act \u2014Authorizes a $4 million multi-year pilot program to establish year-round schools in the U.S. \u2014Target low-income, low-performing areas and focus on STEM education. Staff Contact: Jordan Hynes YEAR -ROUND SCHOOLING Senator K IRK. I just wanted to get you on the record: Do you en- dorse this legislation to encourage all-year school? Secretary D UNCAN . First of all, it is great to see you and to be able to work with you. And there are other areas where we need lots of studies. I am not sure if we need another study on summer reading loss. We have study after study after study, particularly in disadvantaged communities, where teachers work hard to get children to a certain point in June, and they come back in the fall, in September, and they are further behind than when they left. It is absolutely heart-breaking. So I will take it one more step. We don't need just longer years. We need longer days. We need longer weeks. We need to think about time in a very different way. And again, not for every single child. When Senator Landrieu, before you got here, Senator Kirk, talked about high-performing charter schools, many of those high- performing charter schools, they just have longer school days. They are working on Saturdays. They are working through the weekend. We talked a lot in my opening statement about opportunity gaps. We have to close those opportunity gaps with more time with great instruction, more time with great academic enrichment, more time 193 for debate and academic decathlon, and yearbook, and drama, and sports, and robotics. All those types of things\u2014summer months, after school, Saturdays\u2014give us a chance to give children what they need to be successful. Senator K IRK. As you remember, in Chicagoland, we increased the learning time for Chinese to make sure that people could get some sophistication in that language, which was a key thing for Chicago Public Schools to make sure we had kids who were pre-pared for the 22nd century economy. Secretary D UNCAN . So when I talk about more time and longer days and longer weeks, adults usually cheer and kids usually boo or throw tomatoes at me. So be prepared for a few tomatoes to be thrown your way as you talk about this. Senator K IRK. I think Cory and I can handle it. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Kirk, anything else? Senator K IRK. That is it. CHAIRMAN 'S CLOSING REMARKS Senator H ARKIN . We are going to close up here. I will just say that I tend to think that we do need longer school days. I don't know about a longer week. Longer school days and a longer school year, I would agree with Senator Kirk on that. Our days are very, very short. I do think we need to look at longer school years also. Mr. Secretary, do you have anything else that you want to add? Secretary D UNCAN . Again, thank you very much for your leader- ship. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you. Secretary D UNCAN . And I know you, as a leader here, have some very tough budget decisions to make. But you have always been collaborative. You have always been thoughtful. And no one is more passionate about the closing of opportunity gaps, so thank you for your leadership. ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS Senator H ARKIN . Well, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, and we will work with you on getting this appropriations bill through in the next few months anyway. The hearing record will remain open for 1 week for Senators to submit other statements and questions. [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but were submitted to the Department for response subsequent to the hear-ing:] QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR TOMHARKIN HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING Question. Mr. Secretary, I applaud the President and you for your continued com- mitment to advance early learning in the United States. I have been calling for this kind of investment for a number of years, and I think it's just what we need. We've been able to move the needle some on the issue. Last year's omnibus included an increase of $1 billion in Head Start. It included new resources and authority under Race to the Top for Preschool Development Grants. And, the administration's fiscal year 2015 budget request builds on these investments. 194 Some have suggested that we don't need another Federal program or more Fed- eral resources invested in high quality early learning programs. I disagree. I'd like to hear your response to that criticism of your budget proposal. Answer. It is important to understand that despite existing investments in pro- grams like Head Start, there is tremendous unmet need in this country for access to high-quality preschool. There is near-universal agreement on the importance of high-quality preschool education, and parents want what is best for their children, but there simply are not enough affordable, high-quality slots for children to attend these programs. Nationally, only 3 in 10 children are enrolled in high-quality pre-school programs. In almost every State, the unmet need for early learning is enor-mous. For example, in Pennsylvania, 6,700 children are waiting for openings in the State preschool program; in Colorado, districts report that over 8,000 eligible chil-dren cannot be served; and in Michigan, Governor Snyder reported last year that 29,000 needy preschool age children didn't have an opportunity to go to subsidized preschool. In addition, we need to recognize that what parents and children need is access to high-quality early learning opportunities from birth through age 5. So we're not talking about just creating more slots, but slots in high-quality preschool programs. Very few existing programs are meeting the demand for both access and quality, whether you're talking about cities, suburbs, or rural communities. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION INITIATIVE Question. Mr. Secretary, I am pleased that your budget proposes to continue in- vesting in high school reform, building on activities currently funded through the High School Graduation Initiative. Please tell me more about what we are learning through the high school graduation initiative and how this would inform high school reform activities proposed in the fiscal year 2015 budget request. Answer. High School Graduation Initiative grantees are implementing a variety of research-based and other promising strategies to keep at-risk students from drop-ping out and re-engage out-of-school youth. These include using data tools to iden-tify and serve at-risk students more effectively, such as early warning indicator sys-tems; offering personalized support services, including graduation coaching and mentoring, through proven approaches like Check and Connect and Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID); and implementing school climate interven-tions such as Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports. Although targeted strategies such as these hold promise, the President and I be- lieve that more fundamental reforms are needed if efforts to improve the graduation rates of our Nation's chronically underperforming high schools and to prepare stu-dents graduating from these schools truly for college and careers are to meet with lasting success. The proposed High School Redesign program, funded at $150 million in the President's budget, would call on local educational agencies and their part-ners to provide a radically overhauled and more engaging high school experience through instruction that is personalized to the needs and interests of individual stu-dents; relevant for the careers of the 21st century, including through improved use of technology; and complemented by an array of support services, including those currently supported with High School Graduation Initiative funds. Similarly, Col-lege Pathways and Accelerated Learning, which under the administration's reau-thorization proposal would consolidate the High School Graduation Initiative and other current-law programs and for which we request $75 million in fiscal year 2015, would support local efforts to improve and sustain student interest by intro-ducing more challenging curricula in high schools with low graduation rates, such as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, dual-enrollment programs, and early college high schools, while providing support services for stu-dents not on track to graduate. STUDENT OUTCOMES AND 21ST CENTURY WORKFORCE NEEDS Question. Also, how would the program address the misalignment between stu- dent outcomes and the needs of the 21st century workforce, particularly through partnerships among school districts, employers, and institutions of higher edu-cation? Answer. The High School Redesign program would incorporate a number of strat- egies to improve alignment between workforce needs and programs serving high school students. Under our proposal, eligible entities would have to include organi-zations that can help structure and facilitate career-related experiences for students as well as help schools prepare students to apply academic concepts to real-world challenges and entities. Such organizations might be nonprofits, community-based organizations, government agencies, or other business or industry-related organiza-195 tions. In addition, all grantees would be expected to provide students with career- related experiences or competencies, obtained through organized internships and mentorships, structured work-based learning, and other related experiences. We would also give special consideration to projects that plan to work with employers that help participants attain career-related credentials. In addition, our fiscal year 2015 budget request also provides $1.1 billion for a reauthorized Perkins Career and Technical Education (CTE) program that would in-crease alignment between CTE and labor market needs and strengthen collabora-tion among secondary and postsecondary CTE programs and business and industry. ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT WAIVERS AND STUDENT PROTECTIONS Question. Mr. Secretary, last month you responded to my February 19, 2014, let- ter related to ESEA flexibility granted to State Educational Agencies. As you know, I expressed great concern about how waiver implementation may erode protections for our most vulnerable students. I was hopeful that the response would provide more details about the Department's plans to address the concerns I identified in my letter. Specifically, my letter outlined four main concerns: (1) Waiver States identifying drastically lower numbers of schools for inter- ventions; (2) Waiver States not providing interventions in schools that are low-per- forming, but not identified as priority and focus schools; (3) The use of super subgroups in States' accountability systems; and (4) The lack of accountability for high school graduation rates in States' ac- countability systems. Could you please provide more details about the Department's plans for address- ing each of these concerns? Answer. I want to emphasize that I share your concern about improving edu- cational opportunities for our most vulnerable students, including low-income and minority students, students with disabilities, and English learners. This concern was a driving force behind our ESEA flexibility initiative, under which we are work-ing with States to ensure access to a high-quality education for all students, and I would be pleased to have my staff meet with yours to discuss how we are address-ing your concerns in ESEA flexibility, to date. As we continue to develop, in the coming months, our plans for the ESEA flexibility renewal process, we will continue to closely examine the issues you raise in your letter, and look forward to continuing to work with you on behalf of America's students. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR PATTY MURRAY GUIDANCE PROVIDED ON USE OF TITLE I FUNDS FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS Question. The number of homeless students in America's public schools has in- creased 72 percent since the great recession. Although homeless students are eligi-ble to be served under Title I, the Department of Education's guidance has actually made it challenging for school districts to effectively serve these vulnerable children. To address this, the fiscal year 2014 appropriations bill includes language specifi-cally stating that funds under Title I can be used to provide homeless students with transportation to school, and to support homeless liaisons, and the school district staff that identify homeless students and help to stabilize their education during this time of extreme hardship for the students and their families. Guidance issued by the Department of Education in a March 21, 2014, Dear Col- league letter directly contradicts the language of the fiscal year 2014 appropriations bill. Specifically, the Department's guidance poses the question: May a local edu-cational agency use funds it reserves under section 1113(c)(3)(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to pay for a homeless liaison or to provide transportation to the school of origin? The answer provided by the Department is: ''No,'' followed by additional com- mentary that undercuts the very clear congressional intent of our fiscal year 2014 bill language. Can you explain why the Department took this action, and what the Department will do to fix it so that the Department is in compliance with the law that was passed last year? Answer. Our intention was to make clear that, in addition to the new authority to pay for the liaison and school-of-origin transportation, the requirement to provide comparable Title I services remains. We are continuing to work with your staff on this issue. 196 AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE RESOURCES WITH ENHANCED ACCESSIBILITY FOR LEARNING PLAN Question. The American Printing House for the Blind (APH) is the world's largest nonprofit organization creating educational, workplace, and independent living prod-ucts and services for people who are blind and visually impaired. APH has worked in partnership with the Federal Government since 1879 to fulfill their mission. The Department of Education's fiscal year 2015 request for APH is $24.456 million, the same level the APH has received each year since fiscal year 2010. Digital technology is rapidly changing the ways in which educational materials are delivered to students. The APH has developed a ''Resources with Enhanced Ac-cessibility for Learning'' (REAL) Plan to streamline and speed up the delivery of dig- ital educational materials from publishers to students who are legally blind in acces-sible formats\u2014both hard copy and digital braille and large print. This work is im-portant for students who are blind and visually impaired to continue receiving the same educational content as their sighted peers. Secretary Duncan, given the high cost of developing technology, does the Depart- ment plan to increase funding for the American Printing House for the Blind's REAL Plan? Answer. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget request would provide a total of $24.5 million in discretionary funding to the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). The President recognizes the historical legacy of APH and its commitment to creating educational, workplace, and independent living products and services for people who are blind and visually impaired. ''Resources with Enhanced Accessibility for Learning (REAL) Plan'' is a new initiative for which APH has already proposed to use its endowment funds to cover costs associated with consultation and produc-tion for fiscal year 2015. ENSURING TIMELY ACCESS TO PRINTED TEXT FOR BLIND AND DISABLED Question. What additional investments can the Department make to ensure time- ly access to accessible content for students who are blind or have another disability affecting their ability to read printed text and graphics? Answer. Due to budgetary constraints, the President's fiscal year 2015 budget re- quest of $24.5 million would maintain level funding at the fiscal year 2014 level. The Department has met with APH to discuss the development of performance measures for APH's newest technologic innovations, with the intent to ensure timely access to accessible content for students who are blind or have another disability affecting their ability to read printed text and graphics. FUNDING FOR HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY PROGRAM AND COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE MIGRANT PROGRAM Question. The High School Equivalency Program (HEP) and the College Assist- ance Migrant Program (CAMP) are critical to promoting educational access, reten-tion, and completion for children of migrant farmworkers which are some of the most underserved, disadvantaged, and at-risk students in the country. Frequent moves contribute to very high dropout rates and the low enrollments in higher edu-cation. Yet, according to the Department's own estimates, HEP and CAMP programs are very successful: 89 percent of all CAMP participants successfully completed their first year at an institution of higher education and 74 percent of HEP students who completed their course of study earned a GED. CAMP's freshman cohorts have higher continuation rates than most college's general freshman population. Given the success of this program, please explain why the Administration for fis- cal year 2015 proposed $34.6 million for the HEP and CAMP programs which is the post-sequestration level, and did not propose the pre-sequestration level funding of $36.6 million for the HEP and CAMP programs in fiscal year 2015 which the Ad-ministration proposed in fiscal year 2014? Answer. We agree that the High School Equivalency Program and the College As- sistance Migrant Program programs provide important support for helping individ-uals from migrant populations to receive their GED credential and to complete their first year of postsecondary education. There are many good, effective programs in the Department, but in order to maintain fiscal discipline and adhere to the spend-ing levels set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, we had to make tough choices and set priorities for spending increases among programs, even increases that would only bring back program spending to pre-sequester levels. Please note that HEP and CAMP programs are not the only source of funding that can assist youths and adults from migrant farmworker and seasonal worker populations who are interested in obtaining their GED credential or completing 197 their first year of postsecondary education. The administration's fiscal year 2015 budget request also provided $898.3 million for Federal TRIO programs and $597.7 million for Adult Education State grants. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE CONNECTED INITIATIVE Question. I was very interested to see that your fiscal year 2015 budget request proposes $200 million for a new Connect Educators initiative that helps educators transition to using technology and data to personalize learning and improve instruc-tion and assessment. As a strong supporter of the Enhancing Education Through Technology program, which has not received funding since fiscal year 2010, as well as the ATTAIN Act\u2014the Accelerating Technology Transfer to Advance Innovation for the Nation Act of 2014, I was pleased to see a renewed focus from your Agency on education technology. Can you please provide more information about the types of professional develop- ment that you envision being provided through this program? Answer. The administration's ConnectED initiative will connect 99 percent of America's students to the digital age through next-generation broadband and high- speed wireless in their schools and libraries. The initiative invests in improving the skills of teachers, ensuring that every educator in America receives support and training in using education technology tools that can improve student learning. ConnectED calls for additional funding and support for schools to improve their network connectivity and provide device access to all students. Connect Educators is designed to help teachers and principals understand how to use technology to help with the implementation of new assessments as well as to leverage technology to support needed professional development and increase access to online resources, including sample lessons and e-books that are aligned with college- and career-ready standards. The increased connectivity called for through ConnectED opens up opportunities for teachers and principals to engage and collaborate with other educators across the country to improve practice and share approaches. Becoming a connected educa-tor can accelerate the adoption of best practices for all teachers and principals, but is crucial for teachers in schools where there may only be one teacher in a particular grade/subject in the school, who otherwise may have limited opportunities for col-laboration, and for principals so that they can connect with other principals across schools. Connect Educators calls for funding for teachers and principals to receive ''at the elbow'' support in both of these areas as well as to get connected to online communities and personalized professional development that meets the individual learning needs of educators, much like personalized/blending learning is used to im-prove instruction and support for students. CONNECT ED AND TEACHER EVALUATION SYSTEMS Question. How would this program support school districts as they implement new teacher evaluation systems? Answer. This program would support district efforts to align their professional de- velopment with new educator evaluation systems by offering teachers and principals access to personalized professional supports, in the form of Web-based professional development courses or online communities, that are designed to address needs identified in evaluations and help educators improve their practice and become more effective over time. CONNECT ED AND COMMON CORE ASSESSMENTS Question. How would this program support school districts as they implement new assessments linked to the Common Core State Standards? Answer. Providing schools with the connectivity and device access that they need is essential to helping them implement new assessments linked to college- and ca-reer-ready standards, whether they are in a State that has chosen to adopt the Common Core State standards or to use other college- and career-ready standards. There are a number of advantages of computer-based assessments, including more immediate feedback and the possibility for adaptive assessment (assessing students at the most appropriate level regardless of which grade they may be taking the as-sessment for). But these advantages require student access to devices and connectivity. ConnectED calls for additional funding and support for schools to im-prove their network connectivity and provide device access to all students. Connect Educators is designed to help teachers and principals understand how to use tech-nology to help with the implementation of new assessments as well as to leverage technology to improve access to needed professional development and other online 198 resources, including sample lessons and e-books that are aligned to college- and ca- reer-ready standards. ENSURING PRIVACY OF STUDENT DATA UNDER CONNECT ED Question. How would your agency ensure privacy of student data under this pro- gram; in particular, how would you ensure that student data would not be used for advertising and marketing purposes? Answer. As part of the requirement to receive eRate funding, schools must imple- ment filtering software to restrict access to potentially harmful sites (such as those that might be using student personal information in inappropriate ways). Con-nectED, administered by the FCC, will not require any new student data to be col-lected. However, as Internet access improves under the ConnectED Initiative, it is critical that school systems and educators understand the major laws and best prac-tices protecting student privacy while using online educational services. The Department shares your concerns about commercialization of student data, and our Privacy Technical Assistance Center released guidance in February 2014 about how schools and districts can protect student data in connection with con-tracting for online educational services. The guidance clarifies that FERPA would not permit a school or district to give FERPA-protected data to a third party solely for it to develop a product to market to a school or district and that the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) also provides parents with rights with regard to some marketing activities. This guidance can be found at the following Web link: http://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/Student%20Privacy%20and%20Online%20 Educational%20Services%20%28February%202014%29.pdf. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR MARYL. L ANDRIEU FUNDING FOR CHARTER SCHOOL PROGRAM Question. For years I have been very supportive of the Charter Schools Program (CSP), and thus was disappointed that the administration level-funded the Charter Schools Program in its fiscal year 2015 budget. As you know, the most recent inde-pendent research confirms that charter schools have made significant strides in clos-ing the achievement gap. In communities across the country, students are making significant learning gains in core academic subjects. In particular, I have continued to advocate for the Charter Management Organization (CMO) Replication and Ex-pansion Grant, and appreciate that the President's budget does request $75 million for it. However, the President's budget does not allocate any new funds for the SEA grants program. Can the Department outline its expectations for a successful imple-mentation of the Charter School Program given the level funding of $248 million for fiscal year 2015? Answer. The administration strongly supports efforts to expand the number of high-quality educational options available to our Nation's students, especially those living in poverty. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget would help accomplish this by directing scarce Federal resources to a new charter schools program, Supporting Effective Charter Schools, which under the administration's proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act would support, through subgrants from State educational agencies (SEAs) or charter school authorizers and through grants directly from the Department, the start-up or expansion of high-quality char- ter schools, prioritizing projects that serve concentrations of students from low-in-come families. If the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is not reauthorized prior to enact- ment of fiscal year 2015 appropriations, the Department will conduct a competition for new grants to SEAs under current law. At level funding, we anticipate allocating approximately $100 million for 10 to15 new SEA grants, in addition to the $46 mil-lion we will use for continuation awards to current SEA grantees. We expect to pur-sue rulemaking to ensure these grants support the start-up only of high-quality schools. As you note, the fiscal year 2015 budget includes a request to use, absent reau- thorization, up to $75 million for the high-quality charter school replication and ex-pansion grants currently authorized in appropriations language, which in fiscal year 2014 requires that not less than $45 million be used for these grants. This request recognizes the need to increase students' access to proven charter school models while providing the Department with flexibility to direct funds to the most deserv-ing projects across CSP competitions. 199 TITLE II FUNDING FOR SEED PROGRAM Question. In my State of Louisiana, the Supporting Effective Educator Develop- ment (SEED) Grant program has been used to train 604 teachers over the past 2 years, and will be used to train approximately 230 additional teachers for placement next year. Can you tell the committee whether and why or why not, you think a percentage of Title II funding should be designated specifically for the SEED grant program, which supports evidence-based teacher preparation programs, such as Teach for America and the National Writing Project, who have won these competi-tive awards in the past? Answer. We think the current set-aside under Title II, Part A of the ESEA that supports the SEED program is one of the most effective uses of Title II funds, large- ly because, as you stated, it supports evidence-based teacher preparation programs. As you know, we have long sought to increase the size of this set-aside in order to expand our ability to support more effective teacher and principal preparation pro-grams, help States raise standards for such programs, and recruit and retain school leadership teams with the skills and experience needed to turn around low-per-forming schools. We were pleased that this Committee supported a small increase in the set-aside in fiscal year 2014, and we are hoping you will give serious consid-eration to our request to raise the set-aside to 10 percent in fiscal year 2015. USE OF PERFORMANCE AND OUTCOME INFORMATION TO INFORM POLICY AND IMPROVEMENT Question. As our Nation continues to deal with shrinking budgets and growing de- mand for services, the Federal Government needs to find ways to invest scarce Fed-eral resources more efficiently and more effectively in evidence-based, results-driven solutions. I am pleased to see programs like Investing in Innovation (i3) prioritized in the President's 2015 budget as they are focused on ensuring evidence-based prac-tices are used to improve student outcomes. How is the Department using evidence, data and information about performance and outcomes to inform policy and drive continuous improvement in its programs and grantee interventions? Answer. Two key priorities in all of President Obama's budget proposals for edu- cation have been to use evidence and data to guide investment decisions and to structure both existing programs and new proposals to build the evidence base for what works in education. For example, many of our proposals to eliminate or con-solidate education programs were based on evaluation and performance data, con-tributing to the elimination of 49 Department of Education programs since Presi-dent Obama took office, for a total annual savings of more than $1.2 billion. New programs such as Investing in Innovation (i3) were specifically designed to build the evidence base for effective instruction and improvement. We have built in rigorous evaluation requirements for key competitive grant programs, such as Race to the Top, School Improvement Grants, and Promise Neighborhoods. Finally, we recently amended the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) to strengthen the use of evidence in Department competitive grant competitions and to improve the quality of data generated and reported by grantees. FUNDING FOR HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES Question. As we take stock of access and affordability to postsecondary edu- cational options, it is critical that we take into consideration that historically black universities like Dillard University, Southern University, Grambling State Univer-sity, and Xavier University in Louisiana are leading the way in the President's goal to graduate more students, boost the economy, and enhance global competitiveness. I applaud your ongoing efforts to ensure success for all students in their goals to pursue postsecondary options through programs like First in the World, TRIO, and Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Can you tell the committee how the Department plans to continue to support the needs of HBCUs throughout the Nation with level funding at $223.8 million? Answer. The President recognizes that HBCU's play a unique and vital role in providing higher education opportunities for African American students and stu-dents from low-income backgrounds. However, due to current constraints on budg-etary resources, the President's request for the Title III Strengthening HBCUs pro-gram, like the vast majority of Higher Education programs, is maintained at the fiscal year 2014 level. In addition to the request of $223.8 million in discretionary funding, HBCUs will also benefit from $85 million in mandatory funding and $57.9 million in discretionary funding for the Title III Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions. For over 150 years, these institutions have educated genera-200 tions of Americans and produced many of the Nation's leaders in business, govern- ment, academia, and the military. The fiscal year 2015 budget request will enable these institutions to continue serving a growing population of students and encour-age and prepare more of these students to pursue advanced study. The 2015 budget request includes $75 million for a new grant initiative designed to improve afford-ability, quality, and success in postsecondary education. The College Success Grants for Minority-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities would provide competitive awards to minority-serving institutions to support imple-mentation of sustainable strategies, processes and tools (including technology) to re-duce costs and improve outcomes for students. ACCESS TO POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION Question. What are some other ways that the Department intends on supporting low-to-moderate income students in pursuing their dream of attaining a postsec-ondary degree? Answer. In addition to fully funding the maximum Pell Grant Award to $5,830, continuing support for TRIO, GEAR UP, Title III and V programs, and making ad-ditional investments requested under First in the World and the new $75 million College Success Grants for MSIs, the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request in-cludes significant initiatives to help expand college access and completion for low- and moderate-income students, such as: \u2014Encouraging States to support, reform, and improve the performance of their public higher education systems through the State Higher Education Perform-ance Fund, which would generate an $8 billion new investment to make college more affordable and increase college access and success, especially for low-in-come students; \u2014Rewarding colleges that successfully enroll and graduate a significant number of low- and moderate-income students on time and encourage all institutions to improve their performance through the new College Opportunity and Gradua-tion bonus program; \u2014Reforming the campus-based programs to target those institutions with a dem- onstrated commitment to providing a high-quality education at a reasonable price that enroll and graduate higher numbers of Pell-eligible students and offer an affordable and quality education such that graduates can repay their edu-cational debt; \u2014Reinstating the Ability to Benefit provision for students enrolled in eligible ca- reer pathways programs, which will allow adults without a high school diploma to gain the knowledge and skills they need to secure a good job; and \u2014Helping borrowers manage their debt by extending Pay As You Earn to all stu- dent borrowers, ensuring the program is well targeted, and simplifying the bor-rower's experience while reducing program complexity. MEASURING THE SUCCESS OF PROGRAMS PROVIDING ACCESS TO POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION Question. How will the Department measure the success and impact of these pro- grams to ensure a wise investment of Federal dollars? Answer. While specific measures for proposed programs have not yet been deter- mined, the Department would make sure that the final measures are consistent with the overriding goal of the Federal student financial aid programs: To ensure that all Americans who wish to pursue a postsecondary education have access to high-quality postsecondary education by providing financial aid in an efficient, fi-nancially sound, and customer-responsive manner. RACE TO THE TOP \u2014EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY Question. It is clear that the Department is focused on equity and opportunity es- pecially in our lowest performing schools. In Louisiana, where 250,000 students are attending a school with a D or F letter grade rating, this issue rings true with me. Like the Charter School Program, it is evident that the Race to the Top\u2014Equity and Opportunity is focused on ensuring that students who were once faced with in-equities have the opportunity and option to reach their full potential. Can you talk about the impact that Race to the Top\u2014Equity and Opportunity will have on our education system, particularly in a State like Louisiana? Answer. Race to the Top\u2014Equity and Opportunity (RTT-O) will address key ele- ments that contribute to persistent opportunity and achievement gaps, including those in the lowest performing schools. By developing, enhancing, and integrating fiscal, human capital, and achievement data systems, grantees will be able to iden-tify LEAs, schools, and student groups with the greatest disparities in opportunity 201 and outcomes and will be better able to direct resources based on need. Strategies for supporting the highest need students include attracting, retaining, and sup-porting high-quality teachers and leaders in high-need schools, increasing access to rigorous coursework, and providing additional student supports designed to help mitigate the effects of concentrations of poverty, which will particularly benefit areas with large proportions of students and schools that are struggling or failing. Additionally, using integrated data, grantees will measure the success of these and other strategies for program improvement and will examine the use and alignment of existing Federal education resources to ensure they are being used effectively and are aligned with their comprehensive plans. OVERVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Question. Since 2009, the Federal Government has spent nearly $6 billion on school improvement dollars. Schools in Louisiana have had the opportunity to ben-efit from these grants, totaling over $95 million at over 90 schools. However, there seems to be a lack of adequate data informing Members of Congress and members of the community overall about strategies that work within School Improvement Grants (SIG) and therefore how we can best invest Federal dollars. Can you tell the subcommittee about the successes and challenges of SIG imple- mentation over the last 4 years? Answer. In February 2014 the Department published an analysis of State assess- ment results for schools receiving School Improvement Grants funding from the fis- cal year 2009 and 2010 competitions (see http://www2.ed.gov/programs/sif/ assessment-results-cohort-1-2-sig-schools.pdf). Comparing, where data permit, schools' average proficiency rates in the 2011- 2012 school year to their rates in the year prior to receiving SIG funds, the analysis notably found that: \u2014Proficiency rates in SIG schools have on average increased in both reading/lan- guage arts and mathematics; and \u2014Proficiency rates in 2009 cohort SIG schools continued to increase on average in the second year of implementation. In May 2014, the Department's Institute of Education Sciences released the first report on its intensive studies of a sample of 25 schools that began SIG implementa-tion in the 2010-2011 school year (see http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20144015/pdf/ 20144015.pdf). Among its findings, the report indicated that most schools with high-er organizational capacity (as determined by ratings on a set of capacity indicators) reported perceived improvements in many areas during the first year of implemen-tation, whereas schools with lower organizational capacity reported improvement in few or no areas. These and other findings suggest that the Department should continue to improve its support for local turnaround efforts, with a particular emphasis on schools strug-gling to implement interventions with fidelity and on key areas of need. For in-stance, many local educational agencies\u2014particularly those in rural areas\u2014have difficulty recruiting or developing school leaders with the specialized skills essential to carrying out successful school turnarounds. Accordingly, in March 2014, the De-partment initiated the Turnaround School Leaders Program, through which SIG na-tional activities funds are being used to make competitive grants to support the de-velopment or expansion of high-quality leadership pathways serving 5 or more SIG or SIG-eligible schools. We expect to make 10-15 awards under the program later this fiscal year, totaling approximately $19 million. We will continue to monitor im-plementation and identify topic areas that may benefit from additional resources in future years. SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL TURNAROUND PROJECTS Question. What turnaround strategies have you observed making the largest im- pact in schools across the country? Answer. The February 2014 analysis of State assessment data mentioned above showed that the average proficiency gains of schools implementing the turnaround or restart models generally exceeded those of schools implementing the relatively less rigorous transformation model. The May 2014 case study report found that schools with higher levels of strategic leadership or that had experienced a disrup-tion from past operations reported perceived improvement in more areas than schools without these characteristics, but did not identify relationships between per-ceived improvement and other examined school characteristics, including the SIG model implemented. With respect to specific improvement actions implemented in turnaround schools, the Department is currently developing a set of profiles of carefully selected SIG im-202 plementation sites that focus on topics such as data-based decisionmaking, school climate, and parent and community engagement. We expect that these profiles, which are scheduled for release in fall 2014, will serve as a helpful reference for stakeholders, including local educational agencies preparing school intervention plans under SIG. USING PERFORMANCE INFORMATION TO TURN AROUND LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS Question. How does the Department intend to capture accurate data that can bet- ter inform the decisions of policy makers and implementation so that we can better invest Federal dollars and more quickly turn around our lowest performing schools? Answer. The Department has developed and continues to implement a coordinated strategy for obtaining and analyzing a variety of SIG data to inform policymaking and local implementation. In addition to the strategy-specific information provided by the profiles, the detailed implementation reports from the case studies, and the annual analyses of State assessment and leading indicator results discussed above, the Department is also conducting a formal evaluation of the SIG program that will focus, among other things, on the impact of the receipt of SIG funds on student out-comes and the relationship between the four school intervention models (and related improvement strategies) and student outcomes and school performance. The first full evaluation report is scheduled for release in late 2014. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JACK REED INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO LITERACY GRANT APPLICATION Question. This year, the Department will be holding a new competition for the In- novative Approaches to Literacy grant. For the first competition, the Department did not publish the application until July\u2014a time when many school districts are not fully staffed to write grants. When will the Innovative Approaches to Literacy grant application become avail- able? Answer. The Department is in the process of developing the Innovative Ap- proaches to Literacy (IAL) grant application and plans to make it available in late June. DEPARTMENT OUTREACH FOR INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO LITERACY GRANT APPLICATIONS Question. What outreach does the Department have planned so that school dis- tricts and national nonprofit organizations have the time and information to submit quality proposals? Answer. The Department informed professional groups and associations when the Innovative Approaches to Literacy (IAL) Notice of Proposed Priorities, Requirement, And Definitions was published in the Federal Register on February 28, 2014 (Vol. 79. No. 40). In addition, professional groups, literacy professionals, and national not for profits involved with literacy were made aware of the proposed 2014 competition in the call for reviewers for the competition. We currently are working to publish the final Notice and application package as soon as possible to ensure that eligible entities have sufficient time to prepare high-quality applications. We also are planning to conduct three webinars that will be designed to cover all aspects of the grant application process for the IAL program. Each of these presen-tations will include an opportunity to ask specific questions regarding the competi-tion and its requirements. LEARNING FROM PREVIOUS INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO LITERACY GRANT COMPETITION Question. As the first round of grants finishes this year, can you share with us some preliminary information about what was successful and what could be im-proved for future competitions? Answer. The first round of Innovative Approaches to Literacy (IAL) grants was enthusiastically received by parents, school administrators, reading specialists, li-brary workers, content area teachers, and students. The Department gathered data from June through December of last year from the annual performance report, project specific goals, and the GPRA measures, but needs more time for an in-depth analysis of these data due to varying approaches taken across grantees and their projects. However, the initial review indicates that the IAL program has led to in-creased parent involvement, improved instructional practices, greater access to high quality literacy resources in both traditional and digital print, extended library 203 hours, increased technology-based instruction, and increased reading ability in both reading classes and content area classes. The greatest gains have been in programs that combine parent involvement, print distribution (either traditional books or dig-ital text), and good instructional practice. For future competitions, the Department will explore ways to improve the evalua- tion of the program and identify leading indicators of successful programs. ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE LIBRARY PROGRAMS Question. We know that student achievement is correlated with having access to effective school library programs as well as books in the home. This is an important piece of the equity agenda. What, specifically, does the Administration plan to do to ensure that disadvan- taged children have access to effective and well-equipped school libraries staffed by well-trained school librarians and books at home? Answer. The administration's reauthorization proposal for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act includes a new Effective Teaching and Learning: Literacy program that would make competitive grants to State educational agencies to sup-port comprehensive State and local efforts to develop and implement high-quality literacy programs. Such programs may include efforts to strengthen access to well- equipped school libraries as well as home-based literacy instruction, which could in-clude making books available to low-income families. COLLEGE ACCESS CHALLENGE GRANTS Question. Congress gave the Administration a great deal of flexibility in deter- mining what waivers under the College Access Challenge Grant would be equitable and what constitutes ''significant effort'' in redressing a violation of maintenance of effort. Instead of using its flexibility, the Department has developed a rigid ap-proach to reviewing and approving waiver requests, which resulted in more than half of the available funds being returned to the Treasury last year. According to an analysis by the American Association of State Colleges and Uni- versities, 28 States that were denied a waiver or did not receive funds last year had increased higher education appropriations in fiscal year 2013. Twenty-one of these States had increased funding in fiscal year 2012. How many States are in danger of losing their College Access Challenge Grant this year, and, how is the Department working with States to address this issue? Answer. Section 137 of the Higher Education Act (HEA) requires States to main- tain financial support for higher education at least at a level equal to the average amount provided over the 5 preceding fiscal years for public institutions of higher education (excluding capital expenses and research and development costs), and also for financial aid for students attending private institutions of higher education. If a State fails to meet these requirements, the Department must withhold any funds that would otherwise be available to that State under the College Access Challenge Grant (CACG) Program, authorized by section 781 of the HEA. The Department may waive the maintenance of effort requirements for a State if the Department de-termines that doing so would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable cir-cumstances. However, we execute this waiver authority carefully and reluctantly, given the importance we place on States maintaining fiscal support for higher edu-cation. Unfortunately, the number of requests the Department has received for waivers of the requirements of section 137 of the HEA has increased dramatically in the past 4 years. In Federal fiscal year 2013, 41 States failed to meet the maintenance of effort requirements in State fiscal year 2012; 33 of these States requested a waiv-er. Ultimately, the Department granted six of the 33 requests it received. Of the 27 States whose requests were denied, 17 had increases in their revenues over the preceding 5-year period and two additional States had sizeable surpluses. In such instances, the Department determined that these States did not meet the statutory standard of a ''precipitous and unforeseen decline i n... financial resources.'' USE OF MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT STANDARD Of the remaining waiver request denials, the Department applied the standard used across the Department's programs with maintenance of effort requirements, in-cluding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Under this stand-ard, States requesting a waiver that demonstrate a precipitous and unforeseen de-cline in resources must also demonstrate that higher education spending was not disproportionately targeted for reductions. The Department believes that this stand-ard plays a critical role in preventing harmful cuts to higher education spending at 204 the State level and ensuring that higher education is treated equitably as States are confronted with difficult budget decisions. When States fail to meet the maintenance of effort requirements and do not re- ceive a waiver of those requirements, section 137(d) of the HEA allows States that make a significant effort to correct their violations to receive their full College Ac-cess Challenge Grant funds. Of the 27 States whose waiver requests were denied last year, five ultimately received CACG funding by reinvesting in higher education. While we recognize that States must prioritize and sometimes make tough choices when making budget decisions, we continue to believe that granting waivers to States that do not treat higher education equitably is contrary to the intent of Con-gress in drafting section 137 of the HEA. We are still in the process of determining the number of States that have met the maintenance of effort requirements in State fiscal year 2013. As in prior years, the Department will continue to work with States to ensure that our decisions are based on complete information, including providing States with ample opportunities to provide additional information in support of their waiver requests. This outreach will include extensive contact with State program and budget officials via conference call and e-mail to clarify information submitted in conjunction with the waiver re-quest, updating the State on the Department's assessment of the data, and dis-cussing the State's options for meeting the maintenance of effort or waiver require-ments, or making a significant effort to correct their maintenance of effort violation. As we begin this year's review of maintenance of effort waiver requests, we will continue to work with States to gather information and release decisions as expedi-tiously as possible. POSTSECONDARY SUPPORT PROGRAMS Question. What alternatives has the Department considered to avoid having mil- lions of students miss out on the college outreach, student aid awareness, financial literacy, and other vital student supports provided under these grants? Answer. The Department annually invests over $1.1 billion in college preparation programs targeted at disadvantaged students through the Federal TRIO ($838 mil-lion in fiscal year 2014) and GEAR UP ($302 million in fiscal year 2014) programs. Collectively, these programs provide approximately 3,000 grants to States, institu-tions of higher education, local education agencies, and other nonprofit entities to undertake activities designed to assist disadvantaged students in enrolling and suc-ceeding in postsecondary education. TEACHER QUALITY PARTNERSHIP GRANTS APPLICATION Question. This year, there will be a new round of competition for the Teacher Quality Partnership grants. When will the grant application become available? Answer. Applications for funding under the Teacher Quality Partnership program became available on May 28, 2014. Applications will be due to the Department July 14, 2014. The Department also is currently planning two pre-application webinars for potential applicants\u2014Tuesday, June 10, 2014, at 10:00 a.m. and Thursday, June 12, 2014, at 2:00 p.m. TEACHER QUALITY PARTNERSHIP GRANTS APPLICATION PRIORITIES Question. Will the Department be including any new priorities for this round of competition, for example, a competitive priority for programs that address both teacher and principal preparation? Answer. The fiscal year 2014 Teacher Quality Partnership competition includes two absolute priorities from the statute, and two competitive preference priorities from the notice of final supplemental priorities and definitions for discretionary grant programs published in the Federal Register on December 15, 2010 (75 FR 78486) and corrected on May 12, 2011 (75 FR 27637). Under this competition, the Department will support projects training teachers and early childhood educators at (a) the pre-baccalaureate level, and (b) in teacher residency programs. These two project types are outlined in the statute. In addition, the Department will provide a competitive preference to applications promoting effective science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) teacher preparation and to applications for projects designed to support the implementation of internationally benchmarked, college- and career-ready academic standards, in-cluding the development of professional development aligned to those standards as well as strategies that translate those standards into classroom practice. The De-partment believes that these priorities will ensure a robust competition and effective targeting of Teacher Quality Partnership program funds in critical areas of teacher preparation. 205 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR MARK PRYOR DATA COLLECTION ON ONLINE LEARNING PROGRAMS Question. Distance learning plays an increasing role in postsecondary education. Millions of college students take at least one online course in a given year. The number of students utilizing online courses continues to increase rapidly each year. Online learning has the potential to expand access to higher education to students who might not otherwise have access to physical classes. Given the increased use of distance and online learning, what steps is the Department of Education taking to collect data on online learning and the effectiveness and how institutions could help improve and promote online learning and, if not, does the Department have any plans to begin collection of this information? Given the importance of distance learning in my State, I would like to work with you to focus efforts on collecting this data in an effort to improve delivery and outcomes of online and distance learn-ing. Answer. The Department plans to announce in late spring/early summer a new competition for the Center for Distance Education and Technological Advancements program. This competition, funded by Congress in fiscal year 2014 under the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, will award a grant to an institu-tion of higher education to develop a research agenda that would yield rigorous re-search increasing our knowledge in the area of online learning. The Department is still in the process of determining the design and focus of the competition. In addition, the Department's Institute of Education Sciences recently published a Request for Applications under the Education Research and Development Center program that includes as one of three topic areas a focus on Virtual Learning. The successful applicant will establish a Virtual Learning Laboratory to conduct a fo-cused program of research that will (1) use experimental methods to evaluate and improve the instructional practices, content, and/or learning tools offered by one or more widely used online instructional delivery platforms, with a particular focus on making improvements for low-income and low-performing students in K-12; and, (2) advance the field's understanding of how the large amounts of data generated with-in online instructional delivery platforms may be used to address important re-search questions and improve teaching and learning. In addition, the lab will provide leadership and outreach that will: (1) inform pol- icymakers, practitioners, and other nontechnical audiences about big data for edu-cation research and practice, (2) create a hub where researchers, developers and practitioners will come together\u2014both virtually and in person\u2014to discuss research goals and methods related to online learning, review emerging research findings, and support new partnerships and collaborations; and, (3) build the field's capacity to conduct well-designed studies of online learning and to use big data by offering workshops and other activities. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS AND COMPETITIVE ABILITY OF SMALL , RURAL STATES Question. The fiscal year 2015 Department of Education Budget contains a num- ber of important priorities that will continue to improve the education received by students throughout the country and in turn prepare them for college and the work-force. Focusing on educational equity is particularly important as we begin to antici-pate the changing needs of our future workforce. The education community in New Hampshire remains concerned about the De- partment's shift to competitive funding, and as a former teacher and governor, I ap-preciate the unique needs that arise in all schools and communities, not only those traditionally defined as most in need that often receive funding under competitive programs. States like New Hampshire do not necessarily have the resources, such as staff, to submit competitive applications for many of the programs that could make critical improvements in our State's educational system. Stakeholders in New Hampshire indicate that formula-driven grant programs pro- vide a more sustained impact that allows educators and administrators to perform their critical work. This continued investment is critical to ensuring that States and school districts can reasonably depend upon the funding source for continuity and can be relied on to institute desired changes. Your budget request for fiscal year 2015 proposes an increase of 62 percent for competitive grant programs over the amounts appropriated for such programs in fis-cal year 2014. Can you provide information regarding the number of competitive grant programs that you propose in your fiscal year 2015 budget request and the 206 specific steps that you are taking to ensure that small, rural States would be sup- ported should these programs be funded and implemented? Answer. Most competitive grant programs that would be funded under our 2015 budget request arise from authorizing statutes such as the Elementary and Sec-ondary Education Act. We do believe strongly in the use of competitive grants to promote innovation and maximize the impact for students of limited Federal edu-cation funding by funding the highest quality applicants, and this strategy has in-formed such key Administration education reform initiatives as Race to the Top, In-vesting in Innovation, and Promise Neighborhoods. We also believe that we have been increasingly successful in structuring our competitive grant programs\u2014 through such strategies as the use of absolute and competitive preference prior-ities\u2014to maximize the opportunities for success by rural applicants. For example, rural applicants have demonstrated considerable success in winning grants in the Race to the Top\u2014District competitions and the School Improvement Grant program. We intend to use similar strategies to ensure that we meet the needs of rural States and communities under new competitive grant proposals in our 2015 request, such as Race to the Top\u2014Equity and Opportunity, STEM Innovation, High School Rede-sign, and Connect Educators. We also are proposing hybrid programs where such an approach makes sense. Our Connect Educators proposal, for example, includes both formula grant funds aimed at increasing State capacity and competitive funds for LEAs prepared to use high-speed networks and related devices to improve in-struction for all students. Finally, approximately 89 percent of the discretionary funding for elementary and secondary education programs included in our 2015 budget request would continue to be allocated to States and school districts by for-mula. PARTICIPATION RATE OF STATES AND SEAS IN COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS Question. What data is the Department of Education currently using to determine whether all eligible States and districts apply for opportunities that they qualify for? Answer. The Department does not collect or use such data because no State or school district is required to apply for any discretionary or formula-based Federal education program. We have, however, provided targeted technical assistance to en-tities that are experiencing difficulty developing and submitting high-quality appli-cations for our competitive grant programs. COMPETITIVE GRANT AWARDS AND RECIPIENTS IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2014 Question. Can you please provide a comprehensive list of competitive grants awarded in fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014 and the States or districts that received them? Answer. The report included below, 2013 New Discretionary Grant Awards to States and LEAs, lists the new fiscal year 2013 discretionary grant awards to States and school districts that were identified in the Department of Education's financial data base. Fiscal year 2014 information was not included because few 2014 discre-tionary awards have been made at this time; most awards are made at the end of the fiscal year. Note that information on all Federal grant awards is available on www.usaspending.gov. Federal agencies provide regular updates to this system, so that current award information is available to the public.

State ... $173,484 State ... $65,000 GRANT PERIODS OF COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS Question. Can you indicate the periods of investment that are involved in competi- tive awards? Answer. Project periods for Department of Education competitive grant programs generally range from 3 to 5 years. There are exceptions, such as when an applicant does not request funding for the full proposed project period, and one recent grant competition made 2-year grants. ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF FORMULA VERSUS COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS Question. Furthermore, stakeholders are looking for further justification for how the Department of Education assesses the impact of the dependability and sustained impact of formula grant programs versus the unpredictability that can be associated with grants awarded competitively. Can you provide your justification for this shift? Answer. Formula grant programs typically are intended to provide ongoing sup- port to States and school districts in areas where they often struggle to produce positive educational outcomes, such as in serving students from low-income families, students with disabilities, and English Learners. Competitive grant programs, by contrast, generally are designed to provide extra resources for a limited period of time that allow a State or district to develop and demonstrate innovative ap-proaches to meeting educational challenges. Successful innovations then may be supported, following the end of the project period for a competitive grant program, through a combination of Federal, State, and local funding. We see a robust portfolio of competitive grant programs as a critical complement to our much larger invest-ment in formula grant programs, providing much-needed incentives and resources to support State and local innovation and build the evidence base for effective edu-cational practice. EFFECTIVE TEACHERS AND LEADERS STATE GRANTS Question. Your budget proposal includes a request for the Excellent Instructional Team initiative, and a component of this proposal is Effective Teachers and Leaders State grants. New Hampshire's higher education institutions that train educators are currently working with stakeholders in the State toward implementing a pro-gram that not only trains teachers for the workforce, but also follows them for at least 2 years post-graduation to provide them with additional support and prepara- tion to effectively manage a classroom as they begin their careers. This can help en-sure that teachers receive the preparation and support they need and help keep young educators in the profession. The Department's Effective Teachers and Leaders State Grant program provides a number of overarching goals that States can implement to improve the profession and ensure the highest quality educators are working with students. Would your formula grant distribution take into consideration the work currently being done by States to support quality teacher preparation efforts and ensure that such efforts would not be duplicative but could rather build off of the work that is already being done? Answer. Consistent with the current Title II, Part A statute, under the Effective Teachers and Leaders State Grants program, the Department would allocate funds 213 to States based on each State's relative share of the population, age 5 to 17, and on each State's share of children, age 5 to 17, from low-income families. States would be able to reserve State-level funds for activities such as those you describe, and would have flexibility to build on existing work to support and prepare teachers as they embark upon their new careers. INCORPORATING NONTRADITIONAL SCIENCE , TECHNOLOGY , ENGINEERING , AND MATH ACTIVITIES IN AFTER -SCHOOL PROGRAMS Question. As we continue to look at the jobs of the future in our country, it is clear that a strong comprehension of STEM subjects will be increasingly important. I believe we need to do more to expand understanding of STEM subjects through all facets of education, and I view out-of-school time as a critical period during which students can participate in nontraditional STEM activities like FIRST robot-ics in New Hampshire. How do you envision your Department incorporating more nontraditional STEM activities into federally supported afterschool initiatives as you work to provide our Nation's children with the skills they will need to succeed in the future? Answer. After school programs like 21st Century Community Learning Centers are an important example of how we are able to provide flexible Federal funding for initiatives that meet State and local needs and help States and communities lead the way in innovations that help prepare our children for college and careers in our globally competitive economy. In the STEM space, of course, we also believe that our STEM Innovation Networks proposal could provide significant support for the kind of out-of-school learning opportunities offered by participation in programs like the First Robotics Competition. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JERRY MORAN PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS Question. I recognize the important role that early childhood education plays in helping all students enter the classroom prepared to learn. That said, I am con-cerned the administration may direct funding for Preschool Development Grants to States that are willing to implement administration-driven approaches rather than allow for flexibility in funding on State and local identified needs for preschool edu-cation. Is the Department concerned that predetermined approaches would restrict flexibility for State and local entities to meet the unique conditions or needs of their communities? Answer. The Department is committed to funding high-quality preschool pro- grams that meet State and local needs. Although programs funded by Preschool De-velopment Grants would be required to meet nationally recognized program quality standards, grantees would have the flexibility to determine which local communities they wish to serve and how these programs should be delivered. For example, pre-school services could be delivered through a mixed-delivery system of providers in-cluding schools, licensed child care centers, Head Start, or other community-based organizations. In addition, only preschool programs funded through this program will need to meet the competition's criteria for high-quality preschool programs. Other preschool programs within the State will not be required to meet these cri-teria. PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS \u2014PROGRAMS REQUIREMENTS AND STUDENT OUTCOMES Question. The fiscal year 2015 budget request states that Preschool Development grantees will be required to meet minimum standards to receive funding, such as specific staff qualifications, training, and employee salaries that are comparable to K-12 teachers, among other requirements. There are local programs in States cur-rently that are making impressive strides in early child education, but may not be able to comply with all of these standards based on how they are customized to serve their unique communities. Again, while I support early childhood education, I am concerned that this approach will not provide necessary flexibility. How does this focus on specific requirements reconcile with a Department that continuously asserts that it is focused on outcomes in education? Answer. The Preschool Development Grant program would not require States to meet the criteria of a high-quality preschool program to be eligible for funds. All States will be eligible to apply. Rather, grantees will need to show how the pro-grams implemented with these funds will meet the competition's criteria for high- quality preschool programs. Preschool Development Grants are intended to support 214 the creation of high-quality model programs in select high-need communities. Given the scope and scale of these awards, the Department believes that grantees should be able to direct resources to the highest quality programs\u2014including those that meet high staff qualifications and other high-quality benchmarks\u2014in a few commu-nities. Research has shown that early childhood teachers' education and training have been linked to global measures of program quality, language and social inter-action between teachers and children, and improved student outcomes. PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS \u2014FUNDING SUBGRANTS Question. Will the Department commit to allowing funding to be subgranted to en- tities by States that will work toward meeting high-quality standards, but may not meet all of the minimum standards at this time? Answer. The Department is committed to funding high-quality preschool pro- grams. Early learning providers do not need to meet all of the standards when they apply for a Preschool Development grant. However, subgrantees must use grant funds to implement a program that meets the high-quality benchmarks outlined in the competition. For example, a subgrantee may not currently offer a full-day pro-gram or maintain a staff:child ratio of 1:10, but would need to commit to doing so upon receipt of program funding. SUSTAINING PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS Question. Given the high cost of implementing some of these standards, what as- surances will there be that these preschool programs will be sustainable after the grant period? Answer. The Department is very interested in funding high-quality projects that are sustainable after the grant period ends and will consider ways to further that goal. PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS \u2014ENCOURAGING STATE AND COMMUNITY COOPERATION Question. Flexibility at the State and local levels will be key to the success of the grant and the early childhood education systems in the States. Is there an expecta-tion that collaborative local councils will or can use existing high quality programs at the State and local levels to move toward a State early childhood system? And, how will the Department encourage opportunities for schools and community pro-grams to work together? Answer. The Department is very interested in encouraging collaboration, both be- tween States and local entities, and among local preschool providers and is planning to include such measures in the selection criteria for Preschool Development Grants. PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS \u2014FAMILY ENGAGEMENT Question. Please provide clarification as to the Department's expectations for fam- ily engagement implementation using Preschool Development Grants? Will States have the flexibility with funds to include evidence-based home visiting with pre-school classroom families to extend learning and facilitate parent engagement and partnership? Answer. The Department is committed to supporting family engagement efforts through the Preschool Development Grants program, and is considering including family engagement strategies throughout the priorities, requirements, definitions, and selection criteria sections of the Notice Inviting Applications. PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS \u2014STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES Question. Will Preschool Development Grants encourage States to use funding to maximize more inclusive opportunities so that children who have disabilities and the programs that serve them can participate fully in this funding opportunity? Answer. Yes; one of the elements of the Department's definition of high-quality preschool programs is the full inclusion of children with disabilities. PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS \u2014COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES Question. Please provide clarification as to the specific comprehensive services that will be required to be provided onsite by preschool programs to qualify for Pre-school Development Grant funding. Will a preschool program be eligible to receive funding should it commit to providing comprehensive services in the future under the grant if they are not currently provided? 215 Answer. Early learning providers delivering a high-quality preschool program would need to offer comprehensive services that meet children's needs across a range of domains of development, including: education, health, mental health, nutri-tion, and family engagement. Comprehensive services must be accessible or deliv-ered on site. While the Department believes that providing comprehensive services should be a part of a high-quality preschool program, States and subgrantees do not have to currently provide comprehensive services to be eligible to receive Preschool Develop- ment Grant funds. COLLEGE RATINGS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FUNDS Question. Please provide a detailed breakdown of funding that has been used to date to develop a college ratings system. This should include the source of funding for each activity, including funds relating to the information collection request on development of a college ratings system, funds relating to the actual development of the system, funds relating to travel and cost of conducting symposiums, among all other activities. Answer. The costs to date associated with the college ratings system, officially the Postsecondary Institutions Ratings System, or PIRS, are provided below, excluding full-time equivalent employee (FTE) costs. COLLEGE RATINGS SYSTEM COSTS TO DATE Activity Costs Funding Source Planning and Development Costs .......... N/A ......................................................... N/A Operations and Maintenance ................. Not Yet N/A Symposium Costs (includes travel) ....... Approximately $23,500 .......................... Student Aid Administration COLLEGE RATINGS SYSTEM IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET REQUEST Question. Could the Department please provide additional detail on the proposed use of $10 million in fiscal year 2015 to develop the college ratings system, as well as any planned use of funds beyond the $10 million? Answer. The college ratings system's development and refinement will require on- going costs beyond the initial costs associated with the first iteration that we are currently in the process of developing. That is why the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request includes $10 million to support further development and refinement of a new college ratings system, including Web site design and continuous improve-ment, and validation of the data and methodology. Specifically, we anticipate costs for a contractor to design, maintain, and update the Web site of the college ratings system; research and data costs associated with designing different methodologies and models, and for obtaining, validating, and analyzing data for the ratings sys-tem; as well as ''data-runs'' of rating methodologies and models. ALTERNATE FUNDING SOURCES FOR COLLEGE RATINGS SYSTEM Question. Please provide detailed information on the source, use, and amount of funding that will be utilized by the Department to develop the college ratings sys-tem if $10 million is not provided in fiscal year 2015 specifically for this purpose? Answer. If any amount less than the $10 million request is provided, the Depart- ment would need to utilize a combination of existing resources to make up for the shortfall. RACE TO THE TOP \u2014EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY Question. In a time of tight fiscal budgets, I question why the fiscal year 2015 budget request creates yet another new, competitive program under Race to the Top. Why fund the Race to the Top: Equity and Opportunity program when it provides duplicative services with ESEA, Title I grants that already reach all disadvantaged students? Answer. The Elementary and Secondary School Act (ESEA), Title I program pro- vides essential support for State and local efforts to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged students in high-poverty schools. We think that the modest $300 mil-lion investment we have proposed for Race to the Top\u2014Equity and Opportunity will generate innovative approaches and promising practices aimed at increasing edu-cational equity that could have a meaningful impact on improving the performance and outcomes of the $14 billion Title I program. 216 STUDENTS BENEFITING FROM RACE TO THE TOP AND ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL ACT , TITLE I SERVICES Question. Since Race to the Top was created, over $6 billion has been appro- priated for initiatives which have been aimed at ultimately reducing achievement and opportunity gaps for students. How many more students, especially in States like Kansas that have yet to benefit from Race to the Top funding, could have bene-fited from $6 billion in additional Title I services? Answer. Race to the Top is focused on helping States and school districts develop and implement systemic education reforms that can transform their ability to im-prove educational outcomes for all students. If an additional $6 billion had been al-located through Title I over the past 5 years, we estimate that Kansas might have been able to serve, on average, an additional 8,500 students annually. However, Kansas' share of that $6 billion\u2014an estimated $42 million\u2014would have been consid-erably less than the nearly $71 million that the State received in additional Title I funds provided in fiscal year 2009 through the American Recovery and Reinvest-ment Act (ARRA). ARRA provided $10 billion for ESEA, Title I, along with $4 bil-lion for Race to the Top State Grants, or the bulk of the $6 billion total referenced in your question. In other words, ARRA allowed us to invest in transformational re-form programs like Race to the Top while still keeping faith with traditional sources of Federal formula grant support relied upon by States and school districts. EQUITY AND COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS Question. How is equity achieved for all students when competitive programs, by their nature, result in only some students receiving services? Answer. The goal of the Race to the Top\u2014Equity and Opportunity proposal is to create incentives for States and school districts to make comprehensive changes in how they identify and close opportunity and achievement gaps. In other words, eq-uity in education is not just about equalizing expenditures or services, but also about using data to identify the needs of individual students and developing strate-gies to meet those needs. We think competitive grants are a more efficient and effec-tive way to target these limited resources on this goal than spreading the funds thinly through formula grants. A key purpose of our Race to the Top proposal for fiscal year 2015 is to generate a set of evidence-based practices and interventions that successfully address disparities in educational opportunity and improve out-comes, so that those practices and interventions can be scaled up with existing Fed-eral resources, such as our annual $14 billion investment in Title I, to provide equi-table educational opportunities to all students. COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS AND THE REDUCTION OF ACHIEVEMENT AND OPPORTUNITY GAPS Question. How will another $300 million for a new Race to the Top program that only reaches students in States and local school districts that successfully compete for funding, further the goal of reducing achievement and opportunity gaps for stu-dents? Answer. These funds would be awarded to States and school districts that submit high-quality applications demonstrating the greatest promise of using data to (1) identify the greatest disparities in opportunity and performance and (2) develop ef-fective strategies and practices for addressing those disparities. Our goal is to iden-tify a set of evidence-based practices and interventions that successfully address dis-parities in educational opportunity and improve outcomes. Then we would encour-age States and school districts to use existing Federal resources, such as ESEA, Title I funding, to scale up those proven practices and interventions to provide equi-table educational opportunities to all students. SPECIAL EDUCATION \u2014RESULTS DRIVEN ACCOUNTABILITY INCENTIVE GRANTS Question. Why did the Department choose to include $100 million for an Incentive grants competition under Special Education at the expense of increasing formula funding for Special Education Grants to States? Answer. While protecting funding for foundational programs like Special Edu- cation State Grants, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and ESEA, Title I State grants is incredibly important, we also need to invest in reform. The reform dollars we invest in competitive grants encourage States and districts to rethink their existing ways of doing things, including their use of for-mula funds, to produce better outcomes for students\u2014especially students that have historically been underserved, like students with disabilities. Our new $100 million Results Driven Accountability Incentive Grants (RDA) competition will improve spe-217 cial education services for children with disabilities while also building State and local capacity to continuously improve outcomes. Funds under the IDEA, Part B program are primarily used for program and serv- ices at the local level. The Department believes that these new competitive grants can be used together with formula funds to drive meaningful, targeted and systemic reforms to address gaps in performance that will have a significant and long-term impact on results for children with disabilities. RDA would support State efforts to identify and implement reforms that would improve results for children with dis-abilities, such as school readiness, academic performance, and graduation rates. CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING Question. Given the critical role that hands-on experiences play in helping stu- dents prepare for future careers, why does the fiscal year 2015 Department of Edu-cation Budget Request only provide level funding for Career and Technical Edu-cation (CTE)? Answer. We agree that the programs authorized under the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act provide important support for helping students prepare for future careers. The President's budget proposal for education represents hard choices for funding among multiple worthy programs in a difficult fiscal environ-ment. The fiscal year 2015 budget request respects the spending levels set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, with new discretionary funding dedicated to areas where we think it will have the greatest impact on improving educational outcomes. We also believe that a reauthorized Act that strengthens alignment between sec-ondary and postsecondary education and enhances accountability will enhance the quality of CTE programs available to students at the current funding level. IMPACT OF INNOVATION FUND SET -ASIDE ON CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION STATE FUNDING LEVELS AND STUDENTS Question. What would be the impact to individual States if Career and Technical Education Grants to States are reduced by a $100 million set-aside for a new inno-vation fund? And, how many less students will be served in States that are not suc-cessful in competing for this proposed use of funding? Answer. The Department's fiscal year 2015 budget request for Career and Tech- nical Education (CTE) State Grants presumes that the fiscal year 2015 appropria-tion would support a reauthorized Perkins program consistent with the Depart-ment's reauthorization proposal. We envision that a reauthorized Perkins program would incorporate revisions to the State allocation formula so that the formula drives funds to States based on current data. If Congress were to enact the set-aside absent reauthorization, we would be happy to work with Congress to explore ways to fairly distribute the impact on individual State allocations. The impact of the re-duction in the amount of funds distributed to States would vary due to the provi-sions of the State allocations formula, particularly the hold-harmless provision that ensures that no State's share of the appropriation is less than its share of the fiscal year 1998 appropriation. We are unable to estimate the impact on students served because States do not track the number of students served with Federal funds versus State and local CTE funding, and Perkins Career and Technical Education program funds constitute a small percentage of the total funding used for CTE pro-grams; the majority of the funding for CTE programs comes from State and local sources. Note that although directing funds to an innovation fund would reduce the amount of funds distributed to State and local entities, activities carried out through an innovation fund would help to strengthen CTE for all students by expanding the availability of CTE programs that work and encouraging States to establish policies that ensure that CTE programs are of high quality and lead to positive academic and career outcomes. IMPACT AID PAYMENTS FOR FEDERAL PROPERTY Question. Mr. Secretary, this subcommittee demonstrated its commitment to the Impact Aid program by restoring funding in fiscal year 2014 for all sections of the program to 99.8 percent of the fiscal year 2012 level. Given strong congressional support, why has the Department proposed to once again eliminate Payments for Federal Property? Answer. The policy of the Administration is to use available Impact Aid funds to help pay for the education of federally connected children, including children of members of the uniformed services, children of Federal employees who both live and work on Federal property, children of foreign military officers, children living on In-dian lands, and children residing in federally assisted low-rent housing projects. 218 Given the continued need for fiscal discipline, the Administration has proposed to maintain $1.2 billion in funding to four Impact Aid programs (Basic Support Pay-ments, Payments for Children with Disabilities, Construction and Facilities Mainte-nance) as part of its continued commitment to improving the educational outcomes of federally connected students supported by those Impact Aid programs. Unlike other Impact Aid programs, Payments for Federal Property are made to local educational agencies (LEAs) without regard to the presence of federally con-nected children and do not necessarily support educational services for such chil-dren. When the Payments for Federal Property authority was first established in 1950, its purpose was to provide assistance to LEAs in which the Federal Govern-ment had imposed a substantial and continuing burden by acquiring a considerable portion of real property in the LEA. The law applied only to property acquired since 1938 because, in general, LEAs had been able to adjust to acquisitions that occurred before that time. Over 64 percent of districts that currently receive Payments for Federal Property first applied before 1970. We believe that the majority of LEAs re-ceiving assistance under this program have now had sufficient time to adjust to the removal of the property from their tax rolls. In addition, many LEAs receiving funds under this authority consist of two or more LEAs that consolidated, at least one of which originally met the eligibility cri-terion of a loss of 10 percent of the aggregate assessed value of real property re-moved from the tax rolls. The current statute allows such LEAs to retain eligibility even though they are no longer demonstrably burdened. STUDENT IMPACT OF ELIMINATION OF PAYMENTS FOR FEDERAL PROPERTY Question. What impact would the elimination have on the educational opportuni- ties of students in districts that currently benefit from such payments? Answer. It is not possible to estimate the direct impact on educational opportuni- ties of students in districts that currently receive Payments for Federal Property as each district's budget situation would need to be considered individually. Please also note that these funds do not necessarily support educational services to federally connected children and are calculated without regard to such children. COST TO IMPACT AID PROGRAM OF REDUCED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FUNDING OF DOMESTIC DEFENSE SCHOOLS Question. Has the Education Department (ED) discussed with the Defense De- partment the impact on public schools should the Defense Department reduce its commitment to the Domestic Defense schools? As I am concerned about the strain that would be put on the Impact Aid program to offset the increased cost to school districts of educating additional students, does the Department have similar con-cerns and what would be the estimated cost to the Impact Aid program? Answer. There have been no discussions between the Department of Defense and ED regarding the impact of the Department of Defense's potential reduction in com-mitment to Domestic Defense schools. The Department of Defense was conducting an independent needs study regarding Department of Defense schools in 2012, how-ever, we were not informed of its results. ENTREPRENEURSHIP Question. As we think about the current fiscal environment, one way we can help reduce the Federal deficit is to grow the economy. To do this, I have advocated for the need to strengthen our support of entrepreneurs given that new businesses ac-count for the creation of an average of 3 million jobs each year. Support for entre-preneurship begins with developing our next generation of American talent and independent thinkers. What specific activities and programs at the Department of Education focus on helping students attain the skills necessary to become entre- preneurs and compete in a global economy? Answer. Nearly all of our programs are aimed at helping students attain the college- and career-ready skills they need to be successful in our 21st century glob-ally competitive economy, including traditional employment in business and indus-try as well as more entrepreneurial activities. In particular, our emphasis on new college- and career-ready standards and aligned assessments reflects the growing need for all students to master the higher-order thinking and reasoning skills that are essential for the creative work involved in entrepreneurship. And two key pro-posals in our 2015 request\u2014STEM Innovation Networks and High School Rede-sign\u2014would provide significant new support for locally determined activities con-sistent with your interest in entrepreneurship. For example, the $150 million re-quest for High School Redesign would support the redesign of high schools in inno-vative ways that better prepare students for college and career success so that all 219 students graduate from high school with college credit and career-related experi- ences or competencies, obtained through project or problem-based learning, real- world challenges, and organized internships and mentorships. And a $110 million request for STEM Innovation Networks would encourage partnerships of LEAs, higher education, nonprofit organizations, and business to increase opportunities for students to engage in hands-on STEM learning activities that will give them the skills to help America compete and innovate in our technology-driven world. EDUCATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Question. I am pleased that the University of Kansas (KU) has been a leader in special education research. Currently KU is receiving funding from the Office of Special Education programs to develop a national center to assist schools in edu-cating general and special education students together and improving school-wide academic outcomes. Given the tight fiscal budget, what resources can the Depart-ment direct towards research and development in teaching, use of technology and student learning, including learning of special education and high-risk students, to make certain that American schools are at the forefront of educational progress? Answer. The Department's Institute of Education Sciences (IES) supports re- search and development through the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). Since 2002, NCER has invested over $1.5 billion to fund a wide variety of studies focused on strategies to improve student outcomes. These include research grants on effec- tive teaching, education technology, and cognition and student learning, among other topics. Since its initial grant competitions in 2006, NCSER has invested about $530 million to build a comprehensive program of special education research de-signed to expand the knowledge and understanding of children with disabilities from birth through the transition from high school. Active grants include those ad-dressing the development and testing of interventions and assessments, as well as innovative uses of technology, to help children with or at risk of disabilities and their families, teachers and other professionals who provide support or services. Major NCSER investments in the last few years have included, for example, Na-tional Research and Development Centers on improving mathematics instruction for students with mathematics difficulties; developing and testing a comprehensive school-based intervention for secondary students with autism; and strategies for ac-celerating the academic achievement in reading and math of students with learning disabilities. While budget constraints prevented NCSER from holding grant competi-tions in fiscal year 2014, new proposals for research funding will be accepted for fis-cal year 2015. Fewer awards are anticipated based on available funding. Finally, IES runs a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program that offers funding to for-profit small business for the research and development of commercially viable education technology products to support students and teachers. For example, one awardee developed iPrompt, which allows teachers to customize and present dif-ferent visual supports for students with autism using various mobile devices. HIGHER EDUCATION SERVICES FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS Question. While I support the goals of increasing college access and attainment for disadvantaged students, why did the Administration choose to create the new $75 million College Success Grants for Minority-Serving Institutions program when the proven TRIO programs already exist to provide support services to disadvan-taged students to assist with college completion? Answer. TRIO projects provide essential services to help students from disadvan- taged backgrounds to enter and succeed in undergraduate and graduate education. The Administration's request maintains funding for these essential programs. How-ever, we also believe that new approaches are needed to increase college attainment, particularly among under-resourced Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) that face unique challenges, serve a large share of low-income students, and are in need of additional support. The College Success Grants for MSIs initiative would provide funding for high- quality proposals by individual MSIs or consortia to implement evidence-based strategies that are designed to increase the numbers of students, particularly Pell Grant recipients, completing postsecondary education. While certain aspects of the College Success Grants for MSIs program may be similar to the Federal TRIO pro-grams, successful applicants would use funding to undertake a much broader set of activities than are permitted under TRIO, including the following: \u2014Partnering with school districts and schools to provide college recruitment, awareness, and preparation activities, to enable students to enter and complete postsecondary education. 220 \u2014Establishing high quality dual-enrollment programs. \u2014Implementing evidence-based course redesigns of high enrollment courses to im- prove student outcomes and reduce costs. \u2014Reforming institutional need-based aid policies to enhance educational opportu- nities for low-income students and provide incentives for on-time completion. \u2014Providing comprehensive student support services, both academic and non-aca- demic. \u2014Reducing the need for, and improving the success of, remedial education. MANDATORY FUNDING \u2014TEACHER AND PRINCIPAL EFFECTIVENESS Question. I am aware that the Department has requested $5 billion in mandatory funding for Recognizing Education Success, Professional Excellence, and Collabo-rative Teacher (RESPECT) grants which would be used to address teacher recruit-ment, overhaul tenure and evaluation systems, and link salaries to performance. Recognizing that mandatory funding is not likely to be provided this fiscal year, could you elaborate on whether the Department intends to use any discretionary funding under Title II or other funding streams to begin undertaking these activi-ties? Answer. Under the Effective Teachers and Leaders State Grants program, States would have a limited amount of State-level funds with which to provide support for effective teacher career ladders, reform certification and licensure requirements, in-crease professional development opportunities, and reform teacher and school leader compensation systems. The Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) pro-gram, part of a set-aside under the State Grants program, would allow the Depart-ment to make additional grants to national nonprofit organizations to support teach-er and school leader enhancement projects. Also, under the State Grants program, the Department would make competitive awards to States and school districts for the purpose of raising standards for teacher and principal preparation. In addition, the proposed Teacher and Leader Innovation Fund would support State and school district efforts to develop and implement innovative approaches to improving human capital management systems through a competitive grant process. USE OF TITLE II NATIONAL ACTIVITIES FUNDS Question. Mr. Secretary, could you provide the subcommittee with a specific breakdown on use of funds to date for any Title II funding for national activities in fiscal year 2014? Answer. Commitments for Title II National Activities in fiscal year 2014 are: \u2014Impact Evaluation of Teacher and Leader Performance Evaluation Systems (5- year study, ending in 2016). \u2014Study of Teacher Quality Distribution and Measures of Teacher Quality (mathe- matics) (5-year study, ending in 2015). \u2014Study of Teacher Prep Experiences and Early Teacher Effectiveness (6-year study, ending in 2016). \u2014Impact Evaluation of Math Professional Development for Elementary School Teachers (3.5 year study, ending in 2016). \u2014Analytic and Technical Support to the Improving Teacher Quality State Grants Program (Support for data collection, monitoring, and an annual meeting of State coordinators). \u2014Support for Connected Educators Month. \u2014Impact Evaluation of Data-Driven Instruction: Professional Development for Teachers (4-year study, ending in 2017). \u2014Impact Evaluation of Support for Principals (5-year study, ending in 2018). CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER ROLE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS Question. Describe the role of your Department's Chief Information Officer in the oversight of information technology (IT) purchases. How is this person involved in the decision to make an IT purchase, determine its scope, oversee its contract, and oversee the product's continued operation and maintenance? Answer. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) has the primary responsibility to en- sure that Information Technology (IT) is acquired and information resources are managed in a manner consistent with statutory, regulatory, strategic departmental requirements, and priorities. The CIO oversees the Lifecycle Management process (LCM) that is used to manage systems from concept through retirement. This proc-ess includes funding, acquisition, design, implementation, operation, and retirement of IT systems. The CIO manages the LCM process using the Department's IT gov-ernance process, which measures the value and priority of IT investments and their alignment to departmental strategic objectives. The CIO also ensures that projects 221 are managed in accordance with Federal and departmental IT policies and industry best practices for IT project management throughout their lifecycle. FUNDING OF DEMONSTRATION , MODERNIZATION , AND ENHANCEMENT OF IT SYSTEMS Question. How much of the Department's fiscal year 2015 budget request would be for Demonstration, Modernization, and Enhancement of IT systems as opposed to supporting existing and ongoing programs and infrastructure? And, how has this changed in the last 5 years? Answer. Over the past 5 years, the Department has placed a high priority on en- suring its IT programs are able to fund Development, Modernization, and Enhance-ment (DME) activities. The table below shows the Department's DME funding over the past 5 fiscal years. Data is derived from the OMB Exhibit 53, which is a report of all Federal agency IT investments, and Exhibits 300A and 300B, which report on budgetary and management information necessary for sound planning, manage-ment, and governance of IT investments.

DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS \u2014CLOUDFIRST AND SHAREFIRST INITIATIVES Question. Describe the progress being made in the Department to transition to new, cutting-edge technologies and applications such as cloud, mobility, social net-working, and so on. What progress has been made in the CloudFirst and ShareFirst initiatives? Answer. The Department is in the process of implementing its Access Anywhere transformation initiative. This initiative will allow the Department's users to benefit from access to Department IT systems, applications and shared IT services from anywhere, at any time, and from any device. ED employs multiple virtual private network (VPN) technologies to enable remote access to email, files, intranets, and applications from a variety of tablet, phone, and PC platforms. Since calendar year 2012, ED has offered Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) access upon the employee's acceptance of the terms of service for BYOD access. During fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2017, the Office of the Chief Informa- tion Officer (OCIO) plans to provide the following cloud computing services: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) .\u2014The Department will provide fundamental computing resources such as processing, storage and networks so that Department users can deploy and run software, operating systems and applications. IaaS will increase utilization of existing investments, reduce infrastructure investments, and decrease IT expenses. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) .\u2014The Department will provide an integrated plat- form-based computing solution on the cloud consisting of specific operating systems, applications software and development tools; that will be available via the Web. PaaS will improve the management and procurement of IT systems development ca-pabilities. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) .\u2014The Department will migrate some of its desktop software applications and data to the cloud infrastructure. The software is accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface, such as a Web browser. SaaS will improve the management, cost, and accessibility of software applications. Additional migration of technology services to the cloud will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. The table below outlines some of the shared services the Department currently utilizes: 222 SELECTED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SHARED SERVICES Service Service model Deployment model Shared Service Provider (SSP) Hiring Services ...................................................................

DEPARTMENTAL CENTRAL PROCESSING SYSTEM AND FAFSA -ON-THE-WEB Question. One of the major IT investments for the Department of Education is the Central Processing System, which is responsible for FAFSA-On-The-Web. This project has an appropriated cost of $59.14 million and is scheduled to be completed by 2015, but has faced significant challenges, resulting in both cost variance and schedule variance. Recent developments have improved the status of the project; however, the Federal IT Dashboard indicates the project is moderate-to-high risk, and the most recent information submitted to the Dashboard was for December 2013. Please provide an update about the progress of this project. Answer. The Front End Business Integration (FEBI) contract was restructured under an initiative called FEBI Modernization during fiscal year 2012 to better align the way FSA manages the FAFSA-on-the Web releases and other contracted 223 products and services that support the Central Processing System (CPS). Prior to modernization, the CPS was invoiced as a separate component of the contract, but with the contract changes, CPS was included as part of a tiered pricing structure where FSA is invoiced based on the volume of FAFSAs processed. These structural changes to the contract affected the way schedule and cost should be tracked in the OMB Exhibit 300 even though the project remained on schedule and at the planned cost. Around this same time, FSA underwent an organizational realignment where the management of the FEBI contract, funding, and OMB Exhibit 300 were shifted to another business unit which caused a disruption in timely reporting. In fiscal year 2013, there was also a strategic change to the FAFSA on the Web release schedule to allow for the deployment of multiple releases throughout the year. Under this multi-release schedule, there were further changes to the way the sched-ule and cost should be tracked in the OMB Exhibit 300 even though schedule and cost remained on target. Since fiscal year 2012, development work has been completed on schedule and at the contracted price with no overruns despite the reporting discrepancies in the OMB Exhibit 300. Schedule and cost are tracked monthly through the invoicing process as new development work occurs on CPS and its related products and serv-ices. A billing schedule with dates for delivery, associated deliverables, and the con-tracted cost is issued as part of the contract modification and when invoices are re-ceived, the date of completion, contracted cost and associated deliverables are verified before payment is made. To date, the completion dates and contracted cost of development work have been on schedule. FAFSA -ON-THE-WEB MANAGEMENT Question. Additionally, the Federal IT Dashboard indicates the project manager does not have the required certification. What has the Department done to address this? Answer. As per Department of Education policy, major IT investment project managers have 1 year to complete certification requirements and the CPS project manager was granted a waiver. The required FAC-PP/M certification approved waiver is effective until November 2014. While the current project manager had the necessary experience, she needed to complete some additional training. Her waiver application contained a training plan, which has been executed over the period of her waiver. As soon as all necessary training is complete, she will submit her FAC-PP/M application for certification. QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR THAD COCHRAN TITLE II FUNDING AND THE SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE EDUCATOR DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROGRAM Question. In Mississippi, the Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) grant program has been used to train 384 teachers over the past 2 years, and will be used to train approximately 175 additional teachers for placement next year. Needless to say, the positive impact that these teachers have had on Mississippi children has been remarkable. Can you speak to the importance of the investment Congress has made by requesting the Department to designate a percentage of Title II funding for this program? Answer. We believe the SEED program is an excellent example of the kind of in- novative and effective work that Congress can support through a set-aside of funds under Title II, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). We hope to increase this set-aside from the current level of 2 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 10 percent in fiscal year 2015, to expand our ability to support similarly effective teacher and principal preparation programs, help States raise standards for such programs, and recruit and retain school leadership teams with the skills and experi-ence needed to turn around low-performing schools. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD C. S HELBY SCIENCE , TECHNOLOGY , ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS Question. If American students are going to compete in a global economy, they must succeed in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. While I am a leading proponent of STEM instruction, it is difficult to understand why the Administration would prioritize the consolidation of STEM programs across 224 the Federal Government, but then create new, competitive STEM programs within the Department of Education. Why did the Department choose to direct scarce Federal resources toward the cre- ation of new, competitive STEM programs, rather than increase investments in the proven Math and Science Partnerships program which support services for students in all States? Answer. The Administration's STEM Innovation proposal is a key part of the Gov- ernmentwide strategy for delivering STEM education that is more cohesive and co-ordinated and, thus, more likely to improve STEM outcomes for more students. The Mathematics and Science Partnerships program in current law\u2014as it primarily sup-ports teacher professional development projects that may be implemented in isola-tion from other STEM education efforts\u2014is not designed to support the comprehen-sive reforms our Nation needs to improve our supply of STEM talent. PRIORITIZING AND FUNDING STEM INITIATIVES WITHIN COMPETITIONS OF EXISTING FEDERAL PROGRAMS Question. Can the Department elaborate on efforts to prioritize STEM initiatives within competitions across existing Federal programs within the Department? And, how will the Department continue these efforts with fiscal year 2015 funding? Answer. The Department continues to carefully identify opportunities to target limited program funds on the Administration's core education reform areas, includ-ing STEM education. In fiscal year 2013, we included an absolute priority for STEM-focused projects in competitions for new grants under Investing in Innovation (grants under the competitions totaled $135.7 million) and gave competitive priority to STEM-focused projects under Magnet Schools Assistance ($89.8 million) and Sup-porting Effective Educator Development ($29.8 million). In fiscal year 2014, we are maintaining an absolute priority for STEM under Investing in Innovation's Scale- Up grants and including a STEM invitational priority in new competitions under Special Programs for Migrant Students, Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions, and Arts in Education. We expect to maintain a STEM focus in Investing in Innovation in fiscal year 2015 and may prioritize STEM reforms in making new grants under other programs as funding permits. VETERANS ' EDUCATION Question. As our Nation's veterans return from overseas, many will take advan- tage of the education benefits they earned while serving our country by pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree. How does the fiscal year 2015 budget request for the Department of Education ensure that adequate resources are dedicated to assisting veterans on college and university campuses with successful degree com-pletion? Answer. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget would enable the Department to continue to support approximately 50 Veterans Upward Bound projects nationwide. Veterans Upward Bound projects assist veterans in preparing for postsecondary education by providing comprehensive student support services, including tutoring; mentoring; cultural enrichment activities; work-study programs; assistance in course selection, preparing for college entrance exams, and in completing college ap-plications; and information on available financial aid and assistance in completing the FAFSA. POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION VETERANS ' RESOURCE CENTERS Question. In the past, the Department of Education provided funding for a Cen- ters of Excellence for Veteran Student Success program that specifically assisted veterans. This program supported the establishment and development of university- based programs to support military veteran student success. Given our Federal re-sponsibility to the veterans that have served this country, wouldn't the Department agree that these resource centers play a critical role in helping veterans achieve postsecondary education success? Answer. In fiscal year 2010, Congress provided $6 million to support the Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success program, authorized under Title VIII of the Higher Education Act (HEA). With this funding, the Department made 3-year awards to 15 institutions of higher education to support the development of Centers to coordinate services to address the academic, financial, physical, and social needs of veteran students. It is absolutely essential that we make certain that veterans can access crucial services to enable them to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. In 2015, the Administration proposes to allocate $14 million to support 50 Veterans Upward 225 Bound projects designed to provide veterans with the support they need to maximize the educational opportunities that are available to them. RACE TO THE TOP \u2014EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY Question. This Administration has touted the Race to the Top program as critical to the development and testing of model education reform strategies, as well as the implementation of these reforms throughout the country. However, to what extent has this over $6 billion investment led to reform strategies being replicated in States that have yet to receive any Race to the Top funding? Please provide specific, meaningful, impactful, and sustained examples as to how students in States that have yet to receive funding have benefited from Race to the Top. Answer. Race to the Top has changed the debate around education across the Na- tion and reinforced next-generation reforms launched by States. One reason that more than 40 States have been approved for Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) flexibility is that the competition for Race to the Top helped initiate key reforms that positioned the majority of States to move beyond No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and commit to far-reaching changes around standards and assessments, new differentiated accountability systems emphasizing turning around the lowest- performing schools and closing achievement gaps, and developing and implementing educator evaluation systems that take into account student growth data. Race to the Top has contributed to the fact that, since 2009, 46 States and the District of Co-lumbia (DC) have developed statewide reform plans and 42 States and DC have adopted high college- and career-ready standards. Race to the Top States have led the way in many of these important reform efforts and other States can learn from their experiences. For example, Race to the Top States collaboratively created a Student Learning Objectives (SLO) Toolkit. The SLO Toolkit helps States and Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) implement meas-ures of student growth in tested and non-tested grades and subjects. It provides re-sources related to making SLO policy, providing SLO tools, selecting or creating as-sessments and setting targets, communicating with teachers and principals, training district staff and school administrators, and ensuring continuous improvement. The Toolkit is available at https://rtt.grads360.org/services/PDCService.svc/ GetPDCDocumentFile?fileId=4504. Additionally, there are numerous publications and case studies that the Depart- ment has compiled and made available to all States. These resources include lessons learned and other materials from Race to the Top States that are applicable to all States and LEAs and are available at http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/implementa-tion-support-unit/tech-assist/index.html. PELL GRANTS Question. While I have reservations about the direction that this Administration is headed in with respect to the proposed college ratings system, I think we all agree that graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients are a serious concern. It is important that we work together to not only increase graduation rates for Pell Grant recipi-ents, but to also address the sustainability of the program before it experiences dis-cretionary shortfalls in future years. Yet, proposing a $7 billion mandatory funding proposal for a College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus program is unrealistic and does not represent a good faith effort towards working together to achieve these goals. Mr. Secretary, what can the Department of Education do at this moment to help increase the graduation rate of Pell Grant recipients without linking it to a controversial college ratings system or drastically increasing mandatory or discre-tionary funding and thereby exacerbating the pending shortfall in the Pell Grant program? Answer. Let me start by clarifying that the 2015 cost of the proposed College Op- portunity and Graduation Bonus program would only be $647 million; $7 billion would be the cost of the program over the (10-year) budget window. I strongly believe that rewarding colleges for results through this program would advance our shared goal of increasing graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients and promoting on-time completion. The College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus pro-gram would reward colleges that successfully enroll and graduate a significant num-ber of low- and moderate-income students on time, and encourage all institutions to improve their performance, but also incentivize eligible institutions to continue improving their performance and graduate even more low-income students by pro-viding a larger bonus amount for additional Pell graduates. Grants would be used for making key investments and adopting best practices that will further increase college access and success for low-income students, such as by awarding additional need-based financial aid, enhancing academic and student support services, improv-226 ing student learning and other outcomes while reducing costs, using technology to scale and enhance improvements, establishing or expanding accelerated learning op-portunities, as well as other innovations, interventions, and reforms. In addition to this program, the fiscal year 2015 President's budget proposes to make two reforms to the Pell Grant program. First, it will strengthen academic progress requirements in the Pell Grant program in order to encourage students to complete their studies on time. Second, it would reinstate the Ability to Benefit pro-vision for students enrolled in eligible career pathways programs, which would allow adults without a high school diploma to gain the knowledge and skills they need to secure a good job. Finally, the 2015 President's budget proposes to reform Federal allocation in the campus-based programs to target those institutions that enroll and graduate higher numbers of Pell-eligible students, and offer an affordable and quality education such that graduates can repay their educational debt. If adopted, these reforms would have a significant impact on increasing the graduation rate of Pell Grant recipients. REGULATIONS AFFECTING MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT OF FEDERAL STUDENT AID Question. I understand that a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee was established by the Department to consider how Federal Title IV student loan credit balances are distributed. While I support the need for transparency, I am also concerned about the overregulation of higher education institutions and already heavily regu-lated banks. Is it the Department's intent to cover all accounts held by a student who receives a Federal student aid disbursement? If so, why does the Department presume juris-diction over privately held accounts that may be unrelated to Title IV funds? Answer. The Department's primary goal in formulating draft regulations and con- ducting negotiated rulemaking governing payment of Title IV credit balances has been to ensure that students have access to their credit balances, and to protect stu-dents from the concerning banking practices identified by the Government Account-ability Office (GAO) (see the related report at http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14- 91), the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) (see the related report at http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oig/auditreports/fy2014/x09n0003.pdf), and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (see the related report at this site http:// www.uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/thecampusdebitcardtrip lmay2012 l uspef.pdf), among others. The Department is trying to ensure that students have easy, free, and convenient access to their full Title IV credit balances so they can afford academically related expenses and complete their academic programs in a timely manner. REGULATED BANKS AND NON -BANK CAMPUS FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS Question. How will the Department take into account the difference between regu- lated banks and non-bank campus financial service providers when considering reg-ulations? Answer. Over the course of the negotiated rulemaking process, negotiators dis- cussed a number of possible approaches to ensure sufficient student protections within the context of Title IV credit balance disbursements without expanding the regulations beyond the Higher Education Act's purview. The committee made sig-nificant progress on this front and the Department will carefully consider all pro-posals in drafting a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). From the point of view of the Department, practices that erode credit balances pose the same risk to stu-dent, Department, and taxpayer interests regardless of whether they are engaged in by banks or non-bank campus financial service providers. REGULATORY COST -BENEFIT ANALYSIS Question. The proposed rule may have measurable costs to all parties should it be promulgated. Will the Department commit to undertaking and making public a cost-benefit analysis of the impact of additional regulations on students, higher edu-cation institutions, and financial institutions prior to their implementation? Answer. As required under Executive Orders 12866 and 13563, the Department will include a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) in the Notice of Proposed Rule-making (NPRM). The Executive Orders require that the Department propose or adopt regulations only upon a reasoned determination that their benefits justify their costs, tailor the regulations to impose the least burden possible, and select those approaches that maximize net benefits. The public is free to comment on this RIA and provide the Department feedback on the impact of the proposed regula-tions. 227 DISBURSEMENT OF FEDERAL STUDENT AID \u2014DEBIT AND PREPAID CARDS Question. A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report acknowledged that the benefits of college debit and prepaid cards can include convenience for stu-dents and cost savings and efficiencies for schools. Did the Department take into account the impact on efficiencies in the disbursement of Federal student aid when proposing changes to the management and disbursement of Title IV Higher Edu-cation Act funds? If so, please explain in detail. Answer. The Department recognizes that, as noted in the GAO and Office of In- spector General (OIG) reports, the debit and prepaid cards offered to students pro-vide certain benefits to students and institutions, especially compared with the sole use of credit balance disbursements via paper checks. During the negotiated rule-making process, we repeatedly solicited feedback from representatives of students, institutions, third-party servicers, and the banking sector, and made significant progress in amending our regulatory proposals to meet the goals of these various constituencies. However, we were also troubled by the primary findings of the GAO and OIG reports, which noted a fee structure that often deprives students of a sig-nificant portion of their Federal student aid funds, a lack of convenience access to those funds, and a lack of neutrality both in the presentation and delivery of credit balances. In its regulatory proposals presented at the negotiations, therefore, the Department sought to maintain the advantages to students of choice of financial ac-counts while ensuring that easy, free, and convenient student access to Title IV credit balances remained the primary goal. TRANSPARENCY AND CONSUMER CHOICE IN PROVISION OF FEDERAL STUDENT AID Question. Additionally, the GAO report included a recommendation that schools and college debit and prepaid card providers present students with objective and neutral information on their options for receiving Federal student aid payments. Recognizing that transparency is important to consumer choice, regulated banks often already provide transparent disclosures related to their accounts and card usage. Will the Department commit to working with financial institutions and schools to improve existing transparency disclosures prior to issuing final regula-tions, especially given that this issue may be addressed without the need for new and burdensome regulations? Answer. One of the unique aspects of the negotiated rulemaking process is that it affords both the Department and representatives of affected constituencies the op-portunity to discuss regulatory proposals and work toward a draft regulatory pro-posal that is better for students and takes into account the important perspectives of those who provide services to students. One of the committee's areas of agreement was the importance of neutral presentation of information relating to financial ac-counts, so students could make an informed and individualized choice that is best for them. As the NPRM is drafted, the Department will continue to consider the feedback received at the negotiating table and the numerous supporting documents submitted by the nonFederal negotiators. Once an NPRM is published, the Depart-ment will carefully consider all comments that are submitted regarding the NPRM as part of the rulemaking process. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR LAMAR ALEXANDER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT REGULATION Question. The proposed Gainful Employment (GE) regulation represents an un- precedented expansion of administrative and regulatory functions at the Depart-ment of Education. Given the complexity of the regulation and reporting require-ments for the nearly 8,000 affected programs, I am interested in understanding the costs associated with this new scope of work for the Department. Please provide exactly how much the Department has spent to date on promul- gating this rule, beginning with the first rulemaking process in 2010 and including an itemization of how much taxpayers spent defending the regulation before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Answer. In fiscal years 2011-2012, prior to work stoppage in August 2012, Fed- eral Student Aid obligated a total of $5,783,561. The table included below excludes full-time equivalent (FTE) costs. 228 DISTRIBUTION OF FSA GE OBLIGATIONS IN FISCAL YEARS 2011-2012 Fiscal year Totals 2011 2012 Data Collection, Calculations and Distribution ..................................................... $3,083,298 $1,019,463 $4,102 ,762 Social Security Agency Challenge Solution 5,783 ,561 In addition to the amount spent above by Federal Student Aid for a system, the Department estimates that it spent over $100,000 on the first negotiated rule-making process that began in 2010, and approximately $125,000 on the second ne-gotiated rulemaking process for non-FTE related expenses including facilitation, logistical support and travel for some of the negotiators. ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT REGULATION Question. Additionally, please provide a comprehensive estimate of the annual fi- nancial costs and the number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) that will be needed to administer the regulations if the rule is implemented as proposed, including a breakdown of the costs associated with each step in the process such as interactions with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and data computations related to wages, earnings and programmatic default rates. Answer. The proposed Gainful Employment (GE) regulations are estimated to pro- vide budgetary savings between $666 million and $973 million over 10 years (http:// www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-03-25/pdf/2014-06000.pdf). In addition to producing these savings, additional benefits include: Improving quality of programs, reducing student debt, assisting prospective and current students and their families to make more informed decisions, and eliminating poor performing programs. The Depart-ment of Education and the Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) anticipate needing additional staff, as well as non-pay budgetary resources, in order to successfully im-plement the proposed regulations. Specifically, Federal Student Aid (FSA) anticipates the need for approximately 28 FSA full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). This total includes FTEs for the GE Op-erations Team (16) to manage the challenge process and approvals and the chal-lenge systems solution and labor pool; FSA systems teams National Student Loan Data Systems (NSLDS-4); and FSA's Program Compliance Regions (8). Separately, FSA expects to spend approximately $46 million in non-pay on imple- menting GE regulations in fiscal years 2013-2016. This includes the following ex-penses: \u2014GE Data Collection and Calculations of Debt Measures and Disclosures-$10 mil- lion.\u2014We estimate the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and other current systems will need approximately $10 million for FSA system updates to collect GE data from schools, receive and store additional data from the So-cial Security Administration (SSA), calculate three debt measures and eight dis-closure metrics, distribute the data to schools, make recalculations based on challenges, and distribute data to other FSA systems. \u2014Social Security Administration (SSA) Interactions-Less Than $100,000 .\u2014Based on an interagency agreement with SSA, FSA will receive aggregate earnings in-formation from SSA on an annual basis. This data will be used in the calcula-tions of any Debt to Earnings ratios and Median Earnings disclosure informa-tion. The estimate for the interagency agreement is less than $100,000 over 4 years. \u2014Challenge Solution With Labor Pool-$35 million .\u2014FSA is currently looking at solution alternatives for the management of student level data challenges that will be received from institutions for individual programs that have evidence that data elements within the calculations are inaccurate. To manage a high level of challenges, FSA is looking at solution alternatives that will include a system with workflow capabilities, interfaces with FSA and other partner data systems, analytical capabilities for basic checks in challenge data, and con-tracted staffing to resolve challenges within the timeframe indicated in the reg-ulation. To resolve the challenges, we estimate needing 50 contractors, making it the primary cost driver for challenge management. While this is a current estimate, the variability of challenge volume (i.e., how many challenges FSA ac-tually receives) may increase or decrease the overall total cost. 229 \u2014Contractor Support for Program Management of GE Implementation-Less Than $1 million .\u2014This includes contractor support for the program management of implementing the gainful employment requirements. The contractor(s) would manage the schedule, documentation, and other aspects of program manage-ment for implementation. ESTIMATED GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT REGULATION IMPLEMENTATION COSTS Fiscal year Totals 2013 2014 2015 2016 Data Collection, Calculations and Distribution .. .................... $3,000,000 $4,500,000 45,818,153 GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS Question. I generally believe that all regulations should be implemented prospec- tively. In the case of the Department of Education's Gainful Employment regulation, it is my understanding that although the Department is providing a transition pe-riod for the regulation's implementation, the proposed transition period still uses student loan debt levels from previous years that institutions may not be able to influence. What steps is the Department taking to ensure that the accountability metrics, such as the student debt levels in the debt-to-earnings ratio, are con-structed to provide institutions with ample opportunity to revise policies and proce-dures to improve program performance? Answer. Several provisions in the proposed rule would give institutions time and opportunity to improve programs that do not meet the standards. First, all pro-grams are given multiple years to pass the accountability metrics before they would become ineligible for Title IV, HEA program funds. Second, for marginal programs, the Department proposes to create a ''zone'' status where programs are given more time to improve before they would lose access to Federal student aid. And, finally, the proposed rule includes a transition period for the first 4 years after implementa-tion of the regulations during which, in calculating a program's debt-to-earnings rates, we will take into account any immediate cost, and in turn student debt, re-ductions that institutions make. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT \u2014CALCULATION OF DEBT -TO-EARNINGS RATIOS Question. The Department of Education is taking an unprecedented step by using personal student data to calculate program eligibility for Title IV, including calcu-lating a debt-to-earnings ratio using individualized direct wage data from the Social Security Administration (SSA). Please provide an overview of the steps involved in the matching of personal stu- dent loan debt levels to the Social Security Administration's wage database to cal-culate the debt-to-earnings ratios. Answer. For each program, the Department will develop a list of students in the applicable cohort period based on information submitted by the institution. The list is subject to a corrections process. Once the list is final, the Department will submit it to SSA. The Department will obtain from SSA the aggregate mean and median earnings for the program\u2014and not individualized earnings data\u2014for those students on the list whom SSA has matched to its earnings data. If SSA is unable to match certain students on the list, the Department will exclude from the calculation of the median loan debt the same number of students with the highest loan debts as the number of students whose earnings SSA did not match. The information used to cal-culate the median loan debt is from the Department's National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and is not submitted to SSA. The debt-to-earnings rates are then calculated based on the program-level median debt and mean or median earnings\u2014 and not calculated on an individual level. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT \u2014PRIVACY PROTECTIONS Question. Additionally, please describe the steps that the Department is taking to ensure that personal information is not compromised during the calculation of the debt-to-earnings metrics during the data transfers between the Department and the Social Security Administration (SSA). 230 Answer. The SSA and the Department will comply with the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. 3541-3549; re-lated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars and memoranda, such as Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources (November 28, 2000), and Memorandum M-06-16, Protection of Sensitive Agency Information (June 23, 2006); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) directives; and the Federal Acquisition Regulations. These laws, directives, and regulations in-clude requirements for safeguarding Federal information systems and personally identifiable information (PII) used in Federal agency business processes, as well as related reporting requirements. The file transmitted through a secure batch process from the Department to the SSA will contain items of PII necessary to complete the match with SSA records. The return file from SSA will not contain any PII. The data files exchanged remain the property of the providing agency. SSA will retain the electronic files received from the Department only for the time required for any processing related to the information exchange under the agreement and will electronically dispose of the data. SSA will destroy the data received from the Department after completing the information exchange activity. The Department and SSA will each follow their own procedures for reporting loss of data or breach of PII notifications. The Department and SSA will use administra-tive, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the data provided or created in this process is under the immediate supervision and control of authorized personnel in a manner that will protect the confidentiality of the data. Electronic files will be encrypted using the FIPS 140-2 standard. The Department and SSA will store the data provided or created in an area that is physically and technologically secure from access by unauthorized persons during duty hours as well as non-duty hours or when not in use (e.g., door locks, card keys, biometric identifiers, etc.). Only au-thorized personnel will transport the data provided or created. INSTITUTIONAL ACCESS TO DEBT -TO-EARNINGS METRICS Question. It is my understanding that the proposed Gainful Employment (GE) regulation offers very little visibility to institutions on the performance of their pro-grams prior to the Department of Education's release of the metrics for account-ability purposes. In particular, institutions will have no visibility into the direct earnings information from the Social Security Administration that will be used to generate the debt-to-earnings metrics. What alternative measures of earnings, in-cluding those outside of the transition period, such as the use of Bureau of Labor Statistics salary information, will be available to institutions to help them under-stand where they stand on the metrics and provide institutions with some ability to improve program performance? Answer. To help institutions understand how their programs might fare under the debt-to-earnings metric, the Department has published two sets of informational re-sults that include program-level earnings: The first in connection with the previous rulemaking, and the second with the release of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in March 2014. These data sets are an estimated 1-year snapshot of potential re-sults under the proposed rule for informational purposes only and are not intended to predict long-term outcomes for programs. In addition, institutions will be able to approximate a program's program cohort default rate by breaking its institutional cohort default rate down by program level. Once the regulations are implemented, for programs without an earnings history, an institution will have available, through the required disclosures for GE pro-grams, earnings and other performance information of comparable programs that can be used as a benchmark for estimating the performance of a program. Institu-tions would also have the ability to appeal their debt-to-earnings rates results by submitting alternate measures of earnings from two sources, data obtained from a State earnings database or data collected through a survey of students who com-pleted the program. CONGRESSIONAL PROVISIONS FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT GRANTS PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY Question. Since 2009, this Administration has spent more than $6 billion through the School Improvement Grants (SIG) program to help States turn around low-per-forming schools. States receiving these grants must agree to implement one of four federally defined turnaround models. The latest results released by the Department of Education confirm that schools receiving grants have made little progress in im-proving student achievement. 231 Recently, Congress granted greater program flexibility to the School Improvement Grants by allowing States to develop and present for approval, their own models for turning around low-performing schools. What steps has the Department of Edu-cation taken to implement this provision in a manner consistent with congressional intent? And, will you confirm that States, which have received waivers through the Administration's ESEA Flexibility program, will be able to take advantage of this provision? Answer. The Department is currently developing a notice of proposed require- ments that would implement the new SIG program provisions in the fiscal year 2014 appropriations act, make other changes that reflect lessons learned from 4 years of implementation under the current requirements, and help ensure consist-ency across the Department's programs. We anticipate publishing the proposed re-quirements in August 2014 and finalizing the requirements no later than the end of the calendar year. The requirements would apply to the subgrant competitions that States conduct in spring 2015 using fiscal year 2014 funds. A local educational agency applying for fiscal year 2014 funds in a State imple- menting ESEA flexibility would not be prevented from taking advantage of the pro- vision allowing implementation of an alternative school improvement strategy estab-lished by the State and approved by the Department. INNOVATION IN EVALUATION OF TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS Question. You recently announced your intention to issue new Federal regulations governing the evaluation of teacher preparation programs. Ensuring that teachers are well-prepared to lead their classrooms has traditionally been left to the States, and many States are currently developing new policies in this area. For example, Tennessee and Louisiana are using data from teacher evaluation systems to improve their teacher preparation programs. But given that we don't have proven models of effective policy in this area, I am concerned that the Department's plans to impose a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate that States use data from teacher evaluation sys-tems to assess their teacher preparation programs will discourage State innovation. What efforts will the Department make to ensure that States have the flexibility to develop innovative ways to assess the performance of their teacher preparation programs? Answer. This summer we will release a proposal to support the pipeline of future teachers by strengthening teacher preparation programs; importantly, we will seek additional input on this plan through a public comment process. This proposal will encourage all States to develop their own meaningful systems to identify high- and low-performing teacher preparation programs across all kinds of programs, not just those based in colleges and universities, while also asking States to move away from current input-focused reporting requirements, streamline the current data require-ments, incorporate more meaningful outcomes, and improve the availability of rel-evant information on teacher preparation. These changes will help to improve sys-tems-level accountability for supporting the high-quality instruction all students de-serve. Moreover, strengthened preparation and support will help to make teaching an increasingly desirable and rewarding career. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR MARK KIRK SUPPORT FOR YEAR -ROUND SCHOOL PROGRAMS \u2014I3 AND PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS Question. As you noted during the hearing, extended day education and year- round schools are a proven way to improve student achievement. Given this, is the Department of Education providing funding for any year-round school models through any of its programs aimed at innovation in education, such as your Invest-ing in Innovation (i3), or Promise Neighborhoods programs? If not, why not? Answer. For the 2014 competition for i3 Development grants, the Department in- cluded a priority for improving low-performing schools by either (1) changing ele-ments of the school's organizational design to improve instruction by differentiating staff roles and extending and enhancing instructional time; or (2) changing elements of the school's organizational design to improve instruction by differentiating staff roles and extending and enhancing instructional time. This year's pre-application competition for Development grants closed on April 14, 2014, and of the 94 applications submitted under the priority for improving low-per-forming schools, 14 applications addressed the subpart for extending and enhancing instructional time. At this time, the review process is still in progress. Although the Department had not included a priority that explicitly focuses on extended day edu-cation and year-round schools on any of the i3 competitions to date, in 2011 Boston 232 Public Schools received an i3 Development grant to focus on extended learning time under a priority for improving low-performing schools. Under the Promise Neighborhoods program, there are currently two grantees that provide support for year-round schools. The program has not included a specific pri-ority or requirement for year-round schools, but they are an accepted model. YEAR -ROUND SCHOOL PROGRAMS RESEARCH Question. Is more research needed to show how these year-round programs are effective? Answer. My understanding is that research on the academic benefits of year- round schools has been inconclusive. As with other approaches to restructuring the school day, week, or year, the success of year-round schools may depend on both the particular State and local context and the details of implementation. For example, if a year-round schedule is adopted primarily to address overcrowding and other fa-cility constraints, and is not accompanied by an effort to rethink the delivery of in-struction to take advantage of the new schedule, it may not produce improved aca- demic outcomes. OTHER PROGRAM SUPPORT FOR YEAR -ROUND SCHOOLING Question. With what other existing grant programs could the Department fund year-round schools? I am particularly interested in a school model of shorter breaks spread out throughout the year. I have seen this model improve student achieve-ment in Chicago charter schools. Answer. Most Federal elementary and secondary education program funds may be used to support year-round schools, as eligibility for these programs is not depend-ent on the structure of the school year. However, we do not have any programs that specifically support State efforts to restructure the school year, such as by imple-menting year-round schools. YEAR -ROUND SCHOOLS AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES Question. Does the Department track or collect information regarding year-round schools in any way, including which areas of the country have such schools and what are the student achievement outcomes? Answer. The Department does not track separately information on year-round schools. FOREIGN LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS AND INVESTING IN INNOVATION FUNDING Question. Does the Investing in Innovation (i3) Fund support any foreign lan- guage immersion programs for grades K-6? And, if not, why? Answer. The i3 program does not include a priority or subpart that specifically reference foreign language immersion, and there is not currently a grantee in the portfolio whose project has this focus. However, the i3 program does include an ab-solute priority focused on English learners (and has included a competitive pref-erence priority in previous i3 competitions). Currently 46 of the 117 grants include a focus (either explicitly under an absolute or competitive preference priority, or im-plicitly through the project's work) on English learners. The Department's process for developing priorities for the i3 competition is com- plex and considers, among others, policy needs, urgent needs, the quality of the evi-dence base on particular topics, and the availability of models. To date, foreign lan-guage immersion programs have not emerged as a pressing area to be addressed through the i3 program during our consideration of topics for past competitions. USES OF I3 PROGRAM FUNDING Question. What is the i3 program spending its money on? Answer. The Department has awarded approximately $1.07 billion to 117 projects since 2010. Five of those 117 projects have been Scale-Up grants, for a total of $219.9 million; 35 have been Validation grants, for a total of $575.6 million; and 77 have been Development grants, for a total of $277.4 million. The table below shows the main topic areas for which the Department has pro- vided funding, mostly through absolute priorities. The information in this table does contain duplication because grantees sometimes address more than one of these topic areas. The table shows aggregated information for all the cohorts that have received funding to date. The first cohort was funded in fiscal year 2010, and no grants have ended yet. The first set of grants to expire will do so later in 2014. 233 TOPIC AREAS FUNDED BY THE INVESTING IN INNOVATION FUND Topic Area Number of grants Total funding Teacher and Principal Effectiveness ...................................................... 23 $314,483,707 Turning Around Low-Performing Schools ................................................ 22 264,027,914 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) ................ 26 220,158,904 Standards and Assessments .................................................................. 21 180,805,322 Use of Data ............................................................................................. 9 66,422,464 Parent and Family Engagement ............................................................. 8 22,216,648 Serving Rural Communities .................................................................... 24 249,503,263 English ..................................................................................... 351,635,234 ...................................................................... 98,176,186 Technology ............................................................................................... 3 17,991,838 SUCCESSFUL AND EFFECTIVE I3 PROGRAM MODELS Question. The i3 program, or the Investing in Innovation Fund, is now 4 years old; what are the successes and effective models that the Department has seen as a result of this program? Answer. The first cohort of i3 grantees was funded in September 2010. These projects are 4 to 5 years in length, and complete findings about their implementa-tion and effect will not be available until 2015 at the earliest, when the first cohort concludes its project activities. While most i3 grantees will be sharing findings in a formal evaluation report at the end of their grant projects (and the i3 program will have a report of the national evaluation of i3 in spring 2016), some grantees are releasing interim reports with interim findings. Grantees with interim reports that show positive findings include Reading Recovery (The Ohio State University), Success for All Foundation, and AppleTree Institute. In the 2013 grant competition, we found that one of the projects funded under the Validation competition used evi-dence produced under a 2010 Development grant to meet the moderate evidence re-quirement and receive the Validation grant. We are very excited about seeing the progression of i3 grantees across the evidence pipeline. In addition, the Department has made modifications to grant competitions based on lessons learned from previous competitions. Specifically, we give careful consider-ation to priorities we use each year to identify gaps in the portfolio where a competi-tion would help us find projects with potential for success and effective models. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JOHN BOOZMAN INVESTMENT IN CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION Question. I am very proud of the career and technical education (CTE) classes of- fered across the State of Arkansas. I constantly hear about the programs and their strong collaborations with employers and businesses in their communities, full class-es and many students who are honor students and both career- and college-ready. In striving to provide the best possible education for our students and prospects for their future, why aren't there further investments in CTE, in many cases a proven successful program, in the fiscal year 2015 President's budget request? Answer. We agree that the programs authorized under the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act provide important support for helping students prepare for future careers. The President's budget proposal for education represents hard choices for funding among multiple worthy programs in a difficult fiscal environ-ment. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget request respects the spending levels set in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, with new discretionary funding dedicated to areas where we think it will have the greatest impact on improving educational outcomes. We also believe that a reauthorized Act that strengthens alignment be-tween secondary and postsecondary education and enhances accountability will en-hance the quality of CTE programs available to students at the current funding level. ENSURING WIDESPREAD BENEFITS FROM COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS Question. In testimony you have delivered to both the House and Senate Appro- priations Committees, it is clear there is a focus and investment in competitive funding and grants, and a desire for innovation with these new competitive grants. Since the President has not requested any increases in ESEA, Title I and IDEA for-mula funding which are so crucial to a majority of districts across the country, espe-234 cially in a rural State like Arkansas which has a more difficult time finding re- sources to compete for these grants, I'm concerned about the focus of your budget. How are you planning on disseminating innovative ideas and best practices from all of these new grants to ensure that schools who aren't beneficiaries of these grants will benefit in some way from these investments? Answer. The Reform Support Network (RSN), which was created to support the Race to the Top grantees as they implement reforms in education policy and prac-tice, also shares promising practices and lessons learned with other States attempt-ing to implement similarly bold education reform initiatives. Similarly, the School Turnaround Learning Community supported by the School Improvement Grants program shares turnaround resources with all schools, districts, and States. COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS AND EQUITY AND OPPORTUNITY GAPS Question. Do you have any concerns that further competitive funding will create more opportunity gaps and less equity? Answer. We believe targeted, competitively awarded investments can produce in- novative models of effective instruction and improvement that can shrink oppor-tunity gaps and increase educational opportunity for all students, and serve as mod-els on how to use existing funds to improve equity. SUPPORT FOR SUCCESSFUL CHARTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS Question. In many cases, public charter schools operate at best with around 80 percent of funding that traditional public schools have, and these high-performing charters are doing exceptional work even within these financial constraints, like one rural public charter in my State, the KIPP Delta Collegiate which was recently ranked by US News and World Report as the 2nd Best High School in Arkansas. What investments or policies in this budget or actions is the Department taking to help successful charters spread their impact? Answer. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget supports efforts to expand the number of high-quality educational options available to our Nation's students in sev-eral ways. Most notably, the budget includes $248 million for a new charter schools program, Supporting Effective Charter Schools, which under the Administration's proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act would support grants to State educational agencies (SEAs), charter school authorizers, charter management organizations, local educational agencies (LEAs), and other nonprofit organizations for the start-up or expansion of high-quality charter schools. Funds could also be used for grants to SEAs, LEAs, and financial institutions to improve access by high-quality charter schools to facilities and facilities financing. Successful charter schools also would benefit from other key proposals in the budget. For instance, charter high schools are well-positioned to access the $150 mil-lion requested for the proposed High School Redesign program, which would support innovative approaches for improving the high school experience and increasing the number of students prepared for college and careers without the need for remedi-ation. The effective practices of high-performing charter schools could also be fur-ther developed, validated, and scaled up with resources from Investing in Innova-tion, for which the Administration has requested $165 million for fiscal year 2015. TRIO FUNDING Question. Given that the Administration has focused so heavily on expanding the numbers of low- and moderate-income, first generation students entering into col-lege and on their successful graduation, is there a reason why TRIO funding in the fiscal year 2015 budget is maintained at fiscal year 2014 levels? Answer. The President has articulated a bold vision for the United States to once again lead the world in college attainment by 2020. We regard the Federal TRIO programs as a key component of the President's strategy to realize this ambitious goal. In fiscal year 2014, Congress restored most of the sequester reduction to the Federal TRIO programs, providing $838.3 million, a level the Administration has proposed to maintain in the fiscal year 2015 President's Budget Request. At this level, the Department expects to support approximately 2,790 TRIO projects serving nearly 800,000 students nationwide. However, the Administration believes that such a bold objective also requires new Federal approaches to stimulate States and institutions of higher education to pur-sue innovative college access and completion strategies. To that end, the President's 2015 budget request includes the following: \u2014Encouraging States to support, reform, and improve the performance of their public higher education systems through the State Higher Education Perform-ance Fund, which would generate an $8 billion new investment to make college 235 more affordable and increase college access and success, especially for low-in- come students; \u2014Rewarding colleges that successfully enroll and graduate a significant number of low- and moderate-income students on time and encourage all institutions to improve their performance through the new College Opportunity and Gradua-tion Bonus program; \u2014Reforming the campus-based programs to target those institutions with a dem- onstrated commitment to providing a high-quality education at a reasonable price, that enroll and graduate higher numbers of Pell-eligible students, and that offer an affordable and quality education such that graduates can repay their educational debt; \u2014Reinstating the Ability to Benefit provision for students enrolled in eligible ca- reer pathways programs, which will allow adults without a high school diploma to gain the knowledge and skills they need to secure a good job; and \u2014Helping borrowers manage their debt by extending Pay As You Earn to all stu- dent borrowers, ensuring the program is well-targeted, and simplifying bor-rowers' experience while reducing program complexity. SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Senator Kirk. Thank you, Senator Moran. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Secretary D UNCAN . Thank you. Senator H ARKIN . The meeting will stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., Wednesday, April 30, the sub- committee was recessed, to reconvene subject to the call of the Chair.] (237) DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 WEDNESDAY, MAY 7, 2014 U.S. S ENATE , SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS , Washington, DC. The subcommittee met at 10:02 a.m., in room SD-138, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Tom Harkin (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Harkin, Durbin, Reed, Mikulski, Shaheen, Moran, Shelby, Alexander, and Johanns. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY LOVE, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, CEN- TERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOM HARKIN Senator H ARKIN . The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies will please come to order. Each year this subcommittee questions the Secretaries of agen- cies under our jurisdiction. But because Secretary Sebelius has re-signed and the nominee to serve as the next HHS Secretary, Mat-hews Burwell, has not yet been confirmed, we are sort of in an odd situation, so we decided on a different approach for HHS this year. We have before us today leaders from each of the HHS operating divisions that have the large proposals in the President's budget, new programs as well as programs with proposals for significant increases and/or cuts. So this is a great opportunity for this subcommittee to get an- swers from the leaders most responsible for implementing our bills, so I look forward to this. Each of your agencies administers at least one program that holds special interest for me, and I am sure for others on this committee. Overall, the budget request for HHS is $1.5 billion less than last year. The budget request is consistent with the overall funding lev-els in the Bipartisan Budget Act. That agreement partially restored cuts from sequestration and prevented further cuts to nondefense discretionary programs in 2014 and 2015. However, as this budget request shows, this committee knows all too well that cuts to nondefense discretionary spending over the last several years have forced some very difficult decisions. 238 The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), I have been deeply committed to expanding access to high-quality early learn-ing programs for most of my career. I am pleased with the budget's proposed $270 million increase for Head Start and the $57 million increase for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. This bill honors significant investments this committee made in those pro-grams just last year. I am particularly interested in hearing more today about the ACF work in implementing the $500 million provided last year to expand Early Head Start, including the establishment of new Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships. At the same time, I am deeply concerned about proposed cuts to the Community Services Block Grant program and LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program). For CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), Dr. Frieden and I have had conversations about the importance of pub-lic health. The challenge of public health is that when it is working well, no one should notice it. We in the U.S. notice it least because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a world-class public health institute. In fact, that is why I was pleased to allocate funding in 2014 to create a program to help other countries create their own CDCs to organize their health systems around public health and data. So I look forward, Dr. Frieden, to hearing about progress on that effort. Dr. Wakefield, it is nice to have you back on Capitol Hill, where you are no stranger here. You spent most of your career here with both Senator Burdick and Senator Conrad, both of whom were great leaders in rural health and rural healthcare. Your career has demonstrated your commitment to delivering high-quality care to those who need it most, and I can think of no greater calling and no greater mission than HRSA's (Health Resources and Services Administration), which is to increase access to comprehensive pri-mary care services for medically underserved communities. So that is why I am deeply troubled by the repeated budget pro- posals to cut or delay health center openings and to reduce the number of pediatricians and nurses that we train. I will also have a question about integrative medicine and how we are doing with that. Last but not least, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv- ices (CMS). Although Ms. Tavenner is unable to attend today\u2014her mother passed away just last evening\u2014I want to congratulate CMS, its leaders and staff, on the latest enrollment estimates, in-cluding 8 million people who signed up for coverage in the State and Federal exchanges, close to 5 million in Medicaid and the Chil-dren's Health Insurance Program. So despite a rocky start with that Web site, the Affordable Care Act remains the most significant human services legislation in decades. It is giving millions of men, women, and children affordable insurance options for the first time. So I look forward to hearing from you, Mr. Love, about the steps CMS is taking to ensure that the people who signed up for cov-erage have access to and receive quality care. I am particularly interested in hearing about two things: CMS's continued efforts to reduce healthcare fraud and abuse. As we 239 know from our data, for every $1 we spend in that area, we are getting $8 returned to the Treasury in savings. So that work is critical to ensuring that Medicare is available for millions of Ameri-cans for generations to come. PREPARED STATEMENT The other is, again, the provision of prevention and wellness pro- grams under CMS and how that is being implemented in the Af-fordable Care Act. So I hope that the format of this hearing will give us renewed appreciation for the breadth of human needs that HHS serves every year. So I look forward to all of your testimony. Before Senator Moran starts his statement, Chairwoman Mikul- ski submitted a statement to be inserted for the record. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRWOMAN BARBARA A. M IKULSKI Today we are here to discuss the fiscal year 2015 budget request for the Depart- ment of Health and Human Services. I would like to thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran who worked so hard to enact the 2014 Omnibus. By negoti-ating with their House counterparts, we were able to ensure HHS would no longer have to operate under a continuing resolution or sequestration. This hearing is part of the Senate Appropriation Committee's mission to hold more than 60 hearings in a span of 6 weeks and to complete all of our appropria-tions work by October 1. We will begin the process of marking up our bills on May 22, and hope to consider this subcommittee's bill sometime in June. It saddens me to acknowledge that this will be the last LHHS appropriations bill authored by Senator Harkin. However, it should also inspire us to get the LHHS bill to the Senate floor for the first time in 7 years. It would be a fitting way to pay tribute to Senator Harkin, who has either chaired or served as the ranking member of this subcommittee for the past two decades. I look forward to hearing from our panel of witnesses, which represent HHS' Ad- ministration for Children & Families (ACF); Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention (CDC); Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Health Re-sources and Services Administration (HRSA). I hope all of you touch on how the Health and Human Services' budget will help to create jobs and support innovation, while protecting the public's health and pro-viding kids with quality healthcare, child care and a jump start on education. Mr. Greenberg, I will want to discuss two areas of ACF's budget request with you: Child Care Development Block Grants (CCDBG) and Unaccompanied Alien Chil-dren. Senator Burr and I worked together on a bipartisan reauthorization of the CCDBG program that followed regular order and had an open amendment process on the Senate floor. We were able to make important reforms that improved the quality of care children receive. I was thrilled to see our bill pass with over-whelming bipartisan support and a vote of 96-2. I appreciate that your fiscal year 2015 request increases funding levels for CCDBG, but additional funding will still be needed to ensure that the reforms in our bill are implemented effectively. Kids must be taken off waiting lists and pro-vided with the child care they deserve. While your requests for CCDBG give reason for optimism, I am very disappointed with the budget you have requested to tackle the issue of Unaccompanied Alien Children. You have asked for level funding even though you had to transfer millions of dollars to this program in fiscal year 2014 in order to fulfill your needs. I am worried because these are some of our most vulnerable children. They have left their countries and travelled thousands of miles to enter the United States, often fleeing violence to avoid becoming victims of abuse or organized crime. Their journey here is often riddled with danger\u2014these kids put their life, health and safety in jeopardy. Along the way, they risk being subjected to trafficking and the violence they were attempting to escape. These brave children deserve our con-sideration. On April 22, I convened a bipartisan, bicameral staff level meeting with various Federal agencies that are responsible for these unaccompanied alien children. We 240 learned that the number of unaccompanied children entering the United States is rising. In fiscal year 2012 there were 14,000. In fiscal year 2013 there were 25,000 and that number is projected to balloon to 60,000 for fiscal year 2014. This issue is not going away\u2014we expect tens of thousands more to enter the country in fiscal year 2015\u2014and we need to keep these children in mind when appropriating our re-sources. What I need from you is a better estimate of the budget you will need to provide these kids with proper services so you don't have to transfer funds in the future. Dr. Frieden, as America's chief public health officer, I look forward to hearing your plans for new and existing initiatives. How do you plan to continue the creation of blue zones, which were supported by $80 million in Community Prevention Grants? I hope you will delve into how you plan to use the $45 million in funding to im- prove global health security. What will your approach be in helping other countries build and strengthen their own Centers for Disease Control as well as improve early detection and response to epidemics? You have also requested $30 million to combat antibiotic resistance by quickly identifying deadly microbes and use common sense practices to protect patients from infection. I encourage you to work with Dr. Peter Pronovost of Johns Hopkins, his checklist has proven very effective in reducing central line infections. Lastly Dr. Frieden, I am keen to hear more about the $16 million budgeted to address prescription painkiller abuse. Administrator Wakefield, I look forward to hearing about your work to strengthen the healthcare work force and increase the number of primary care doctors, nurses, pediatricians and dental providers in underserved communities. I am also interested in hearing how communities, families and patients are bene- fiting from the additional funding dedicated to health reform and community health centers. Finally, Mr. Love, I have particular interest in CMS because it employs over 4,200 in my home State of Maryland. CMS does important work to process Medicare claims, increase access to health insurance, prevent fraud and abuse, help States expand their Medicaid programs, support new healthcare delivery innovations and implement healthcare reform. I want to hear how this budget will enable you to fulfill those crucial responsibil- ities. I also want to know what specific plans you have to increase health insurance enrollment; improve the functionality and operation of the Federal health insurance exchange; and help States expand their own Medicaid programs. I understand that there are some proposals in this budget that will not be univer- sally supported across the aisle\u2014that's the nature of any bill or budget. We all have things we like and things we don't like, but we must try to refrain from making any one issue a ''deal breaker.'' It is my hope, however, that we can work together to come to an agreement. I think we all recognize that sequesters and continuing resolutions are not an effec-tive way to run a Federal agency like the Department of Health and Human Serv-ices. Our Nation is better off when we work together and govern together. Senator H ARKIN . I will now turn to our ranking member, Senator Moran, for his opening statement. STATEMENT OF SENATOR JERRY MORAN Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Before I give my remarks, let me express my condolences to Marilyn Tavenner and her family. We have a good, solid working relationship with Marilyn, and I really do express my sincere con-cern and care for her loved ones. We are sorry for the loss of her mother. I am, Mr. Chairman, disappointed that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is not here today. In my view, she declined, refused to testify, to talk about and defend the budget request. I know there were numerous press accounts last week about this issue, and what I know about it is that our staff invited all Cabinet Secretaries under the purview of this committee with the option of 241 certain dates. We asked those Cabinet Secretaries to accept one of those dates, and we do it in whoever accepts first gets that date. And Secretary Sebelius accepted the opportunity to testify at a hearing to be held on April 2, and then at her request, we moved her opportunity to testify to May 7, to accommodate her schedule. The Department of Health and Human Services budget requests nearly $70 billion for fiscal year 2015, and I would expect the head of any Department, regardless of its budget size, regardless of its budget request, to appear before the Senate Appropriations Com-mittee to discuss and defend, for our consideration, their thoughts on that budget. More closely, the total discretionary and mandatory budget com- bined of Health and Human Services for fiscal year 2015 is $1.02 trillion. That is more than the amount of the discretionary budget cap for the entire Federal Government. And so we get the view of how big Health and Human Services is. And I, certainly, appreciate the individuals who are here to tes- tify today. I know that you have expertise and experience. But none of you can testify to the overall strategy or manage- ment of the Department. Not one person on the panel before us can explain the give-and-take that goes into determining how funding is allocated throughout the entire budget. Not one witness here with us today can answer the questions regarding the priorities of the Department as a whole. And not one of the panelists can speak to why specific decisions were made. All of these questions would be answered by a Secretary. And in that role, I believe she should be here. And I am disappointed that she declined to appear before our panel today. I have worked hard to be a valuable and hardworking member of the Appropriations Committee. I have praised Barbara Mikulski and her leadership of our Appropriations Committee. There has been a great desire to get us back to regular order. Her leadership, along with Senator Shelby, has been very much appreciated by me and I assume by all members of the Appropriations Committee. And I wanted to make certain that the circumstance we find our- selves into today doesn't become a norm for the Appropriations Committee. In my view, regular order would require that a Cabinet Secretary be here to discuss and defend his or her budget. And I want the committee's work to be responsible and received well and to be respected. And I think we lose something if we eas-ily forgo the opportunity to have a conversation with a Cabinet Sec-retary. My colleagues tell me, who have been here longer than I have, that no one can remember a Cabinet Secretary declining to appear before their appropriations subcommittee. Whether or not that fact is exactly true or not, I am not certain. But at least for those who have told me, there is no recollection of that not being the case. And I want to make clear from my perspective, and I hope this is not a Republican/Democrat perspective, is the Appropriations Committee is deserving of the respect of a Cabinet Secretary to be here in front of us to have the conversations necessary for us to make decisions, to elucidate the facts surrounding the appropria-tions request, and to make sure that we do our jobs as appropri-ators as best as we can to our abilities. 242 So, Mr. Chairman, I used my opportunity in my opening state- ment to, certainly, express my respect for the folks who are in front of us, but to indicate my disappointment at the absence of the Sec-retary. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator H ARKIN . Thanks, Senator Moran. Again, I just want to make it clear, in statements referred to last week, and since I made the statements, I want to respond in kind. I want to make it very clear that as the chair of this subcommittee, I never formally asked or invited the Secretary to appear. Staff started working this stuff out, trying to figure out dates and all that kind of stuff, when it is mutually agreeable. In between time, Secretary Sebelius submitted her resignation. And then the President nominated Ms. Burwell to be the head of HHS. Budget hearings, these kinds of budget hearings, look for-ward. They look at what is coming. That is what the budget is about, next year. Secretary Sebelius is not going to be here next year. But Ms. Burwell hasn't taken over yet. And so we were sort of in a kind of limbo. I will admit that this is my idea, to have the heads of the agen- cies under HHS that have the lion's share of the funding to come here. I said earlier to the group, I said a lot of times if I were asked to appear and testify on something under my jurisdiction, I would have all my staff in back of me, backing me up, because they are the repository of the knowledge. They are the ones who carry out this. Secretaries, Senators, we have sort of a broader vision of things. And so I thought it would be interesting, and perhaps even hope- fully maybe a precedent to have the people here who actually do the work, and who carry out the bulk of the spending of the money that we appropriate. And so there is nothing sinister or anything other than that. If we were having an oversight hearing over the past, yes, you would have someone like that here who was responsible for implementing things in the past. But that is not why we are here. We are talking about the budget for the future and what that is going to be about. And that is why I set this up in this way. Each of you here, your statements will be made a part of the record in their entirety. We will start left to right. We will start with Mr. Love, if you can sum up in 5 minutes, also Mr. Greenberg, Dr. Frieden, Dr. Wakefield. And then we will start our rounds of questioning. So, Mr. Love, please start, and if you can just sum it up in 5 minutes. SUMMARY STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY LOVE Mr. L OVE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to discuss the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' discretionary budget request included in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget. 243 I am appearing today on behalf of Administrator Tavenner, who the chairman and ranking member graciously acknowledged her loss last night. I will do the best I can as her understudy. My name is Tim Love, and I was appointed CMS's chief oper- ating officer in January of this year. As a career public servant, I have spent nearly 3 decades in public service, including the United States Navy, a Peace Corps volunteer, and over 22 years in CMS. I would like to begin by saying that our agency is committed to strengthening and modernizing the Nation's healthcare system to provide access to high-quality care and improved care at lower costs for beneficiaries and consumers enrolled in our programs. I would like to thank the subcommittee for the support you have provided CMS that allows us to carry out this important work. Our fiscal year 2015 budget request allows CMS to build on the successes we have achieved in helping more Americans obtain healthcare coverage while improving the quality and value of the care provided. CMS has led efforts to expand affordable health insurance cov- erage to Americans through the health insurance marketplace. We are pleased to report that at the end of the first enrollment period, 8 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance. An additional 4.8 million Americans have enrolled in a State Med-icaid program during this period. In addition to the marketplace, CMS continues to serve 54 mil- lion Americans through Medicare, 65 million through Medicaid, and nearly 6 million through the Children's Health Insurance Pro-gram, also known as CHIP. Our fiscal year 2015 program management budget request en- ables reforms in healthcare delivery, while continuing to support the ongoing Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs, as well as the marketplace. The CMS budget supports fraud prevention and the reduction of improper payments, which are top priorities for the administration. The program integrity investments in the budget are projected to yield $13.5 billion in savings for Medicare and Medicaid over the next 10 years. Our budget includes a package of Medicare legislative proposals that will save $407 billion over 10 years, while more closely align-ing payments with actual costs of care, strengthening provider pay-ment incentives to promote high-quality care, and by creating in-centives for beneficiaries to seek high-value services. PREPARED STATEMENT Together, these measures will extend the hospital insurance trust fund solvency by 5 years. Our budget reflects the administration's commitment to fiscal re- sponsibility while providing CMS with the resources it needs to support demographic trends in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, and continued administration and oversight of the marketplace. We look forward to continuing our work with this subcommittee, and I would like to thank you for your time this morning. [The statement follows:] 244 PREPARED STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY LOVE Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to discuss the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-ices discretionary budget request included in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget. Our request will allow us to build on the successes we have achieved in helping more Americans access healthcare coverage and improving the quality and value of care provided across our delivery system. In fiscal year 2014, CMS led efforts to expand affordable health insurance cov- erage to Americans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. We are pleased to report that 8 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance through the Marketplace and more than 4.8 million more Americans enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Additionally outside experts estimate that millions more enrolled directly with insurers for new high-quality cov-erage. In 2015, we will continue our work to expand quality, affordable coverage to millions of Americans. In addition to the Marketplace, CMS continues to serve 54 million Americans through Medicare, 65 million through Medicaid, and nearly 6 million through CHIP. Fixing America's healthcare system doesn't stop with guaranteeing that everyone has coverage. To address the rising costs of healthcare, we must improve the way that healthcare is delivered, including the coordination and safety of care. We are working closely with providers, hospitals, and others to improve our healthcare de-livery system for all patients. Already, we have made significant progress. For the second consecutive year, overall health costs grew more slowly than the economy as a whole. We have also seen low spending growth per enrollee in 2012 for Medicare (0.7 percent), Medicaid (1.3 percent), and private health insurance premiums (2.7 percent). We began tying Medicare payments for hospitals to their readmission rates, and saw the 30-day, all-cause readmission rate decline in both 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Medicare Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) began participating in the Shared Savings Program that encourages providers to invest in redesigning care for higher quality and more efficient service delivery, without restricting patients' freedom to go to the Medicare provider of their choice. The program is off to a strong start with 338 Medicare ACOs participating in the Shared Savings Program. We are encour-aged by the interim results and we look forward to final performance year one re-sults later this year. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT The budget for CMS Program Management enables reforms in healthcare delivery while continuing to support the ongoing Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs in CMS, as well as the recently implemented Health Insurance Marketplace. The request also accommodates substantial increases in CMS' workload because of de-mographic trends and program changes driving higher Medicare and Medicaid en-rollment and implements responsibilities assigned in the Affordable Care Act and other legislation related to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. The fiscal year 2015 dis-cretionary budget request for CMS Program Management is $4.2 billion, an increase of $108 million above fiscal year 2014. This request will allow CMS to continue to effectively administer Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Pro-gram (CHIP), as well as new health insurance reforms contained in the Affordable Care Act. With Medicare enrollment projected to grow to 55 million beneficiaries in fiscal year 2015, CMS will require additional resources to effectively oversee the pro-grams. For example, the budget requests an additional $49 million in Survey and Certification funds to conduct mandated Federal inspections of key facilities\u2014such as nursing homes\u2014serving beneficiaries. This increase is needed to complete sur-veys at frequencies consistent with statutory and policy requirements, given contin-ued growth in the number of participating facilities, increased survey responsibility, and inflation. The budget improves survey frequencies for dialysis facilities, non-accredited hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and other providers. Additionally, this budget requests funding to survey community mental health centers for the first time. PRIVATE INSURANCE AND THE MARKETPLACES The Affordable Care Act provides vital new protections for consumers receiving or shopping for private health insurance. New reforms ensured that essential care will become a standard part of most private health insurance plans, and that con-sumers can continue to rely upon their insurance when they become ill. Consumers 245 are able to purchase more efficient coverage due to rate review and medical loss ratio protections. By providing one-stop shopping, the Marketplace has helped indi-viduals better understand their insurance options and assisted them in shopping for, selecting, and enrolling in high-quality private health insurance plans. The budget includes $629 million for CMS activities and administrative expenses to support Marketplace operations in fiscal year 2015. For the federally facilitated Marketplace (FFM), CMS performs eligibility and appeals work, certification and oversight of qualified health plans, payment and financial management functions, and operates the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). As a part of this work, CMS operates a number of IT systems to support the Marketplaces, such as the system that operates FFM functions including eligibility, and plan management. The data services hub provides eligibility verification services to all Marketplaces through interfaces with trusted data sources in other Federal departments. Other IT costs include hosting services and data management systems. Additionally, CMS oversees operations of State-based Marketplaces and provides technical assistance as needed. To help individuals better understand their coverage options, CMS provides Marketplace consumer assistance through a call center and website for the FFM, as well as in-person support through Navigator grants. PROGRAM INTEGRITY The fiscal year 2015 budget supports fraud prevention and the reduction of im- proper payments, which are top priorities of the administration. For fiscal year 2015, the budget invests a total of $428 million in new Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC) and Medicaid program integrity funds. Together the program integrity investments in the budget will yield $13.5 billion in gross sav-ings for Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years. The budget also proposes legislative changes to give HHS important new tools to enhance program integrity oversight; cut fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and generate an additional $1 billion in program savings over 10 years. The HCFAC investment supports efforts to reduce the Medicare fee-for-service im- proper payment rate and initiatives of the joint HHS-DOJ Health Care Fraud Pre- vention and Enforcement Action Team task force, including Strike Force teams in cities where intelligence and data analysis indicate high levels of fraud, and the Health Care Fraud Prevention Partnership between the Federal Government, pri-vate insurers, and other stakeholders. CMS will also make further investments in innovative prevention initiatives, such as the Fraud Prevention System that ana-lyzes all Medicare FFS claims using sophisticated algorithms to identify suspicious behavior. In fiscal year 2015 and beyond, CMS will continuously refine these tech-nologies to better combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. Finally, these funds will support more rigorous data analysis and an increased focus on civil fraud, such as off-label marketing and pharmaceutical fraud. IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID The budget includes a package of Medicare legislative proposals that will save $407.2 billion over 10 years by more closely aligning payments with costs of care, strengthening provider payment incentives to promote high-quality efficient care and making structural changes that will reduce Federal subsidies to high-income beneficiaries and create incentives for beneficiaries to seek high-value services. To-gether, these measures will extend the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund solvency by approximately 5 years. The budget seeks to preserve stability in the Medicaid pro-gram and CHIP during the first full year of the Affordable Care Act expansion of coverage while also including $7.3 billion in Medicaid savings and $345 million in CHIP investments over 10 years to make Medicaid and CHIP more flexible, efficient and accountable. CONCLUSION The President's fiscal year 2015 budget request reflects the administration's com- mitment to fiscal responsibility, while also providing CMS with the resources it needs to support beneficiary growth in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, continue ad-ministration of the FFM, and conduct effective oversight of State-based Market-places. Thank you for your interest in CMS' efforts to strengthen and modernize the Nation's healthcare system to provide access to high-quality care and improved health at lower costs, and I look forward to continuing to work with the sub-committee on these important issues. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Mr. Love. 246 Mr. Greenberg, for the Administration for Children and Families. STATEMENT OF MARK H. GREENBERG, ESQ., ACTING ASSISTANT SEC- RETARY, ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Mr. G REENBERG . Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to discuss the 2015 budget proposals for the Administration for Children and Families. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking you for your years of leadership and your support of ACF programs over this time. In particular, your leadership in education for the Nation's youngest children has been critical for Head Start and to advancing the Na-tion's early education agenda. We wish you the very best for your retirement. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much. I am looking forward to it. Mr. G REENBERG . ACF's budget supports programs serving our most vulnerable children and families, including victims of domes-tic violence, of human trafficking, youth and foster care, runaway and homeless youth, and others. In my opening statement this morning, I will focus on our early childhood initiatives, but I would be happy to discuss other aspects of our budget in response to your questions. Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early education. In 2015, the Presi-dent has renewed his call for investments to create a continuum of high-quality early learning services for children from birth through age 5. The initiative would expand voluntary evidence-based home visiting programs, expand access to high-quality care for infants and toddlers through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, and help States provide high-quality preschool for 4-year-olds in low- and moderate-income families through a partnership with the Department of Education. We appreciate this committee's strong support for the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships in 2014. Our budget requests $650 million to support and expand those partnerships. The fund-ing will assist communities in increasing access to programs that meet Early Head Start standards of quality for infants and tod-dlers. Through the partnerships, Early Head Start programs and child care providers will work together to provide high-quality, full-day services, offering comprehensive support to meet the needs of work-ing families and to prepare children for preschool. We are seeking an increase of $270 million for the Head Start program in order to maintain current service levels. That would bring the total funding for the program to $8.9 billion. The 2015 request for the child care and development fund in- volves both mandatory and discretionary funds, a total of $6.1 bil-lion between mandatory and discretionary. It would support sub-sidies for 1.4 million children and important initiatives to raise the quality of child care. 247 PREPARED STATEMENT In discretionary funding, we are seeking an additional $57 mil- lion. We are also proposing that of the discretionary funding, that $200 million be targeted to help States develop higher health and safety standards, to improve monitoring, to increase provider qual-ity through evidence-based professional development, and to im-prove access to information for parents choosing a child care pro-vider. In concluding, ACF's budget strives to promote the economic and social well-being of children, individuals, families, and commu-nities. It addresses critical needs in a period of limited Federal re- sources. And I would be happy to answer any questions. Thank you. [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARK H. G REENBERG Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for supporting the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) in fis-cal year 2014 and for inviting me to discuss ACF's proposed budget for fiscal year 2015. In addition to an overview of ACF's budget, I would like to share with you three areas in which we are working to address important needs: (1) early childhood development, (2) unaccompanied alien children, and (3) reducing the over-prescrip-tion of psychotropic drugs for children in foster care. FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET The fiscal year 2015 budget request for ACF is $51.3 billion. ACF's budget sup- ports expanding access to high-quality early education to prepare our youngest chil-dren for success in life. Funds are also included for programs that serve our most vulnerable children and families, including victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, and runaway and homeless youth. In addition, the budget supports im-portant improvements in Head Start, Child Care, and Child Support. The budget includes mandatory funding for a new demonstration, in partnership with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to address the over-prescription of psychotropic drugs for children in foster care. The budget also proposes to create subsidized job opportunities for low-income parents by redirecting $602 million in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funding to a Pathways to Jobs initiative. The fiscal year 2015 discretionary request for ACF is $17 billion, a decrease of $637 million below fiscal year 2014, reflecting a fiscal climate that forces difficult choices among worthy programs. The budget advances high-quality care for infants and toddlers as part of the President's plan to help prepare America's children for success in life by expanding access to early education. Additional investments are also included to continue a groundbreaking study of children at risk of abuse or ne-glect and of children in the child welfare system, and to study the prevalence of youth homelessness and the characteristics of homeless youth in order to better ad-vance efforts to end youth homelessness. EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT As the President stated in his State of the Union Address, research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early edu-cation. These programs can help level the playing field for children from lower in-come families by improving school readiness through increased vocabulary and so-cial and emotional development. In fiscal year 2015, the President renews his call for a series of investments that will create a continuum of high-quality early learn-ing services for children beginning at birth through age 5. This initiative would ex-pand current Federal investments in voluntary, evidence-based home visiting pro-grams, expand access to high-quality care for infants and toddlers through HHS' Early Head Start\u2014Child Care Partnerships, and help States provide high-quality preschool for 4 year olds in low and moderate income families through a partnership with the Department of Education. We appreciate the strong support provided by this committee for Early Head Start\u2014Child Care Partnerships in fiscal year 2014. The budget requests $650 mil-248 lion, an increase of $150 million above fiscal year 2014, to support and expand the Partnerships. This funding will assist communities in increasing access to early learning programs that meet Early Head Start standards of quality for infants and toddlers. The funds will be competitively awarded to new and existing Early Head Start programs. Applicants may propose to partner with child care providers that serve lower income children, especially those receiving Federal child care subsidies, or to expand existing services. Through these partnerships, Early Head Start pro-grams and child care providers will work together to provide high-quality full-day services that offer comprehensive supports to meet the needs of working families, and prepare children for preschool, in a variety of settings. An increase of $270 million is sought for the Head Start program in order to maintain current service levels. This will bring total funding for the program to $8.9 billion. In addition to the EHS-CC Partnerships, this funding level includes over $8.2 billion to provide services for an estimated 929,000 slots for Head Start and Early Head Start children and their families. The budget continues to include $25 million in transitional funding for the Designation Renewal System to minimize dis-ruption of services to Head Start children and families during the transition period to new Head Start providers from low-performing Head Start programs. The fiscal year 2015 request for the Child Care and Development Fund is $6.1 billion, which includes $3.7 billion for the Child Care Entitlement and $2.4 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The total funding level represents an increase of $807 million over fiscal year 2014 in combined discretionary and mandatory funds, and will support subsidies for 1.4 million children\u2014approximately 74,000 more children than would otherwise be served. Of the $2.4 billion available in discretionary funds for child care, $200 million is targeted to help States raise quality by developing higher health and safety standards, improving monitoring, in-creasing provider quality through evidence-based professional development, and im-proving access to information for parents choosing a child care provider. UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN Unaccompanied alien children (UAC) apprehended trying to enter the United States unaccompanied by a parent or guardian are among the most vulnerable pop-ulations ACF serves. By law, ACF must accept UAC into its care and custody upon referral from the Department of Homeland Security or other Federal agencies. These children reside in State-licensed shelter facilities until ACF can place them with sponsors, usually parents or other relatives. The annual number of arriving UAC has increased from 6,560 in fiscal year 2011 to an estimated 60,000 in fiscal year 2014. Reasons for this increase are complex, but a key factor is the high level of violence in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, the countries of origin for most UAC. In the last 3 years, ACF has streamlined its placement process, reducing the aver- age amount of time unaccompanied alien children spend in shelters. ACF has cut the average length of stay for all UAC from 75 days between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2011 to 35 days in fiscal year 2014. ACF has also been able to decrease the per bed costs by 5 percent. Despite these efforts, total UAC costs have increased significantly due to the rising number of UAC. As directed by Congress, ACF is working with the Departments of Homeland Se- curity, State, and Justice\u2014in an effort to better understand the reasons for the in-crease in the number of UAC arrivals and develop strategies for managing rising UAC costs. We appreciate the committee's willingness to provide UAC funding based on updated arrival estimates in fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014. This action has enabled ACF to serve all incoming UAC without reducing services for ref-ugees. We are continuing to monitor the flow of UAC in 2014 and will keep the com-mittee updated on what impact this will have for the amount of funding needed in 2015. ADDRESSING THE OVER -PRESCRIPTION OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE May is National Foster Care Month, which provides us an opportunity to reflect on the efforts we've made on behalf of the vulnerable children we have taken into our care. Children in foster care receive a disproportionate level of prescriptions of psychotropic medication compared to other children receiving Medicaid. A 2011 Gov-ernment Accountability Office report using Medicaid claims from five States found that 20 percent to 39 percent of children in foster care received a prescription for psychotropic medication in 2008, compared with 5 percent to 10 percent of children not in foster care. 249 For fiscal year 2015, ACF's budget includes a request for $250 million over 5 years in mandatory funding to support State efforts to reduce over-prescription of psychotropic medications and improve outcomes for young people in foster care by scaling up evidence-based psychosocial interventions, in concert with a Medicaid demonstration. This initiative will encourage the use of evidence-based screening, assessment, and treatment of trauma and mental health disorders among children and youth in foster care in order to reduce the over-prescription of psychotropic medications. This new investment and continued collaboration will improve the so-cial and emotional outcomes for some of America's most vulnerable children. CONCLUSION In conclusion, ACF's budget strives to promote the economic and social well-being of children individuals, families, and communities. This budget addresses critical needs in a period of limited Federal resources. Again, thank you for the opportunity to discuss ACF's proposed budget with you. I would be happy to answer any ques-tions you may have. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Mr. Greenberg. And thank you for your kind words. I appreciate it. And thank you for your long work in this whole area. Dr. Frieden, welcome back. STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. FRIEDEN, M.D., M.P.H., DIRECTOR CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION Dr. F RIEDEN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the subcommittee. We appreciate this opportunity to share with you our plans for the coming year. And we thank you for your support in 2014, and I will be able to discuss how some of that support is already being brought to bear to protect Americans better. CDC works 24/7 to protect Americans from threats, whether they come from this country or anywhere in the world, whether they are infectious or noncommunicable, whether they are intentional man-made or naturally occurring. Last week, the U.S. had its first case of MERS coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which has been highly lethal in several countries of the Middle East and has been exported to countries in Europe. This is the first case we had in the U.S. It was in a traveler who went from Saudi Arabia to London to Chicago and took a bus to Indiana, where he has been hospitalized. And this really emphasizes that we are all connected by the air we breathe, by the water we drink, by the food we eat. And dis-eases anywhere are just a plane ride away. One of the things we do at CDC is to respond to emergencies. And a few years ago, the U.S. Ambassador to Africa said to me that CDC is the 911 for the world, and I thought, that is wonderful, but really, what we want to do is make sure that countries all over the world have their own public health 911, so that they can find, stop, and prevent health threats at the source. That will protect us better. That will protect them better. And that is what our Global Health Security Initiative is for the 2015 budget proposal. This will allow us to do better at finding and stopping things like Ebola. We currently have a team in West Africa. The first time West Africa has had an Ebola virus outbreak. It has been large, highly lethal. 250 And outbreaks like this destabilize countries. They kill people. They also undermine economic development. And they affect us in the United States. In fact, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak 10 years ago cost the world more than $30 billion in just 3 months. So we have plenty of good reasons to invest in global health secu-rity, and the 2015 request is for a $45 million expansion of what we have done in 2013 and 2014 to better protect countries and bet-ter protect ourselves by having a safer world. The second major initiative that we are proposing for 2015 is ad- dressing a second growing threat to Americans, and that is anti-microbial resistance, drug-resistant bacteria. We are seeing now at least 23,000 deaths, at least 2 million ill- nesses, about $20 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. from drug- resistance. We are losing really our last lines of defense. These are miracle drugs. I am trained as an infectious disease physician. I practiced before there was treatment for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and then I saw the wonders of HIV treatment, and how that trans-formed the world. I worked in tuberculosis control for many years and I, unfortunately, took care of patients for whom there were no drugs to treat. We are potentially facing a challenge that we will have no drugs to treat common infections, if we don't address antimicrobial resist-ance more effectively and urgently. And we are confident that we can make real progress. Our 2015 request is for $30 million, a 5-year program that we are confident will be able to cut two of the most deadly threats in terms of microbial threats to the U.S., what is called CRE, or carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, and C. difficile. Each of these is a very big problem. We think we can cut them in half in 5 years with this support, as well as reducing other problems. Just for one of those conditions, that would save $2 billion over 5 years. The third major new initiative we are proposing is on prescrip- tion opiate abuse, and this is a huge problem. It is one of the very few problems that is getting worse in terms of health in this coun-try. We have had a fourfold increase in the number of people dying from prescription opiate abuse, and that is related to a large in-crease in prescriptions of these drugs, which are very important for drugs for patients with pain palliation, such as those with terminal cancer, but are being overused to a very great extent. We are confident that with this resource, what we will do is sup- port States to do a better job helping patients and helping doctors use these dangerous medications as effectively as possible, and drive down overdoses and overdose deaths. PREPARED STATEMENT So I want to thank you again for your support in 2014. We are already using the support you gave us through the Advanced Mo-lecular Detection Initiative to do rapid sequencing of the MERS coronavirus case that is already in the U.S. so we can better under-stand that case. So thank you for that. Public health really is the best buy, and I very much look forward to answering your ques-tions. 251 [The statement follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THOMAS FRIEDEN , M.D., M.P.H. Good morning, Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and other distin- guished members of the subcommittee. It is a pleasure to appear before you as Di-rector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Nation's leading health protection agency and an operating division of the Department of Health and Human Services, to discuss CDC's fiscal year 2015 budget request. Today I would like to focus on how CDC works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to protect Americans from health threats, and how we propose to make even more progress in fiscal year 2015. We thank this committee for supporting CDC through your 2014 appropria- tions. CDC works 24/7 to keep America safe from health, safety, and security threats, both foreign and domestic. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights dis-ease and supports communities and people to do the same. For fiscal year 2015, CDC has requested additional funding to accelerate the fight against three growing threats\u2014the risk of infectious disease threats from around the world, growing re-sistance to antibiotics, and the increasing epidemic of prescription drug overdose. WORKING TO PROVIDE HEALTH SECURITY 24 /7 CDC helps save lives 24/7 by preventing, detecting, and controlling the growing risks of infectious disease outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, drug-resistant bacteria, and natural and manmade hazards and disasters. We provide emergency response support, technical expertise, and critical rapid development of prevention technologies, including vaccines and other medical countermeasures. CDC provides boots on the ground presence in the United States and throughout the world, supported by our state-of-the-art laboratories, which are critical to our Nation's safety and health. With this committee's support, CDC is now building our advanced molecular detection capacity, unlocking microbial genomes to track and stop outbreaks more effectively, and finding new ways to prevent these outbreaks in the first place. CDC's response to diseases such as influenza, salmonella, hantavirus, HIV, and Ebola are highly visible ways CDC protects the public from health threats, but it is often what the public does not see every day that keeps Americans safe from ever- present health threats. CDC plays a pivotal role in our country's ability to respond to and mitigate potentially catastrophic events\u2014such as pandemics, natural disas-ters, and acts of bioterrorism\u2014by ensuring that local, State and global public health systems are prepared for public health emergencies and by working to keep health threats from entering our country. CDC plays another critically important role protecting Americans from the lead- ing causes of death and disability. CDC applies life-saving solutions that work to drive down the incidence of costly diseases and improve the lives of Americans. CDC leads prevention and health promotion efforts to improve health and reduce chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, which account for 75 percent of the $2.7 trillion in healthcare costs spent in the United States each year. Together with State and local partners, CDC deploys proven interventions to build healthier communities. For example, CDC worked with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and private-sector partners to launch the Million Hearts \u00ae initiative, which will prevent one million heart attacks and strokes by 2017 through proven strategies such as improving blood pressure control and promoting smoking cessation. Our efforts to control chronic diseases are expanding in 2014, thanks to the support of this committee. KEEPING AMERICA AND THE WORLD SAFE THROUGH GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY Diseases and disasters know no borders; we are all connected by the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. CDC deploys scientists and dis-ease detectives globally 24/7, because outbreaks that start in remote corners of the world can travel here as quickly as a plane can fly. Detection and response time is critical. Diseases infecting people around the world in the past 10 years\u2014such as MERS Coronavirus, SARS and H1N1 and H7N9 influenza\u2014cost lives and caused enormous economic disruption. These and other diseases have far-reaching health, economic, political, and trade implications. Less than a week ago we confirmed our first MERS case in the United States, and CDC has a team on the ground helping to prevent the spread of that deadly virus. 252 Our fiscal year 2015 budget requests $45 million to support expanded global health security activities. Over the next 5 years, CDC and U.S. Government part-ners, including the Departments of State and Defense, will work with up to 30 coun-tries to protect at least 4 billion people through global health security efforts. As an important step toward this larger goal, CDC's funding request will allow us to partner with up to 10 countries in fiscal year 2015 to advance global health security, building on successful demonstration projects in Uganda and Vietnam, as well as others currently underway. CDC will help countries find threats faster, stop them closer to the source, and prevent them wherever possible. FIGHTING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE Antibiotic resistance\u2014when bacteria do not respond to the drugs designed to kill them\u2014threatens to return us to the time when simple infections were often fatal. Today, antibiotic resistance causes more than 23,000 deaths, more than 2 million illnesses, and up to $20 billion in healthcare costs in the United States each year. Tomorrow could be even worse: A simple cut of the finger could lead to a life-threat-ening infection; routine surgical procedures, such as hip and knee replacements, would be far riskier; and common complications of life-saving treatments such as chemotherapy and organ transplants could prove fatal. Now is the time to address this threat. CDC's 2015 budget request includes $30 million to detect and protect against antibiotic resistance. With strategic investment over the next 5 years, CDC can turn the tide on the most dangerous of these infec-tions, including reducing infections with CRE\u2014the nightmare bacteria\u2014by 50 per-cent and reducing C. difficile infections by 50 percent. Reduction in C. difficile alone will save 20,000 lives, prevent 150,000 hospitalizations, and cut more than $2 billion in healthcare costs. Achieving these goals requires investments in laboratory capac-ity to detect resistance across the Nation, implementing best practices for infection control in healthcare settings, and improving antibiotic prescribing practices. REVERSING THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC We are witnessing a new epidemic rapidly unfold in America: deaths from pre- scription painkiller overdoses. Prescription painkiller overdose deaths increased four-fold between 1999 and 2010, killing more people than all illicit drugs com-bined\u2014including cocaine and heroin. The prescription drug overdose epidemic is driven in large part by fundamental changes in the way healthcare providers pre-scribe opioid pain relievers. We can prevent abuse of prescription drugs while at the same time making sure patients receive safe, effective, and appropriate pain treat-ment. CDC's fiscal year 2015 budget requests $16 million to work with States and the healthcare system to begin to reverse this epidemic. As the Nation's health protection agency, CDC has led the way in identifying the connection between inappropriate opioid prescribing and resulting overdose deaths. CDC's proposed investment would target States with the highest burdens of pre-scription drug overdose to implement proven strategies to reverse the trend, includ-ing assisting insurers and clinicians in improving coordination of care for high-risk patients; supporting development and effective use of universal, real-time, and ac-tively managed prescription drug monitoring programs\u2014State-run prescription tracking databases; and evaluating State programs and policies to build the evi-dence base for overdose prevention. Public Health Challenges in a 24/7 World In the next few years, CDC and our Nation must face both new and ongoing chal- lenges to protect our health security in a time of fiscal constraint. We must accu-rately detect and quickly respond to numerous and unpredictable disease threats, whether natural or man-made. We must also ensure that CDC is able to protect Americans from the leading causes of death and disability that weaken our eco-nomic productivity and global standing. Thank you for your continued support of CDC's important work to serve this Nation, and I am happy to answer your ques-tions. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Dr. Frieden. Dr. Wakefield. STATEMENT OF HON. MARY K. WAKEFIELD, PH.D., R.N., ADMINIS- TRATOR, HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Dr. W AKEFIELD . Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Before I begin, I too want to acknowledge your upcoming retirement and personally 253 thank you for the support you have given to the programs that are operated through the Health Resources and Services Administra-tion across the years. Clearly, you place a high priority on the com-munities and the populations that are served by these programs. So thank you for that. I should also provide a little bit of a shout-out to your staff. Over the years, too, they have just been terrific, both in advancing your goals and the goals of this committee. With that, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Moran, and mem- bers of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Health Resources and Services Administra-tion. HRSA is the primary Federal agency charged with improving ac- cess to healthcare services for people who are medically under-served because of their economic circumstances or because of geo-graphic isolation or serious chronic diseases, among other factors. To address these issues, HRSA's programs work through partner- ships. We engage in partnerships with States, community-based or-ganizations, academic institutions, healthcare providers, and others to strengthen the Nation's primary care infrastructure, to bolster the healthcare workforce, and to achieve health equity. I want to take just a few minutes to provide the committee with an overview of HRSA's priorities for fiscal year 2015. In terms of strengthening the primary care infrastructure, our community health centers program support community-based orga-nizations that provide comprehensive primary care services in medically underserved communities. Health centers provide a really wide range of services, medical services, dental, behavioral services. And frequently, those services are located in one setting. I think it is important to note, too, that when it comes to health centers and that infrastructure, nearly half of all of them are lo-cated in rural communities. The HRSA budget includes $4.6 billion for the health centers program. This funding will enable us to serve about 31 million pa-tients, and that is an increase from about 21 million patients that were reported in our most recent data. That care is provided through 9,500 service delivery sites, and those sites stretch across the Nation. They are in every State, in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Pacific basin. In fiscal year 2015, $100 million is allocated to fund 150 new health center sites that will serve an additional about 900,000 pa-tients. HRSA also has a priority focus on supporting a highly skilled healthcare work force through health professions training, through curriculum development, and through scholarships and loan repay-ment programs. In order to increase the availability of high-quality care, HRSA health workforce programs provide targeted support for health pro-fessions, and for parts of the country where shortages of health professionals exist. 254 To this end, the HRSA budget includes a new workforce proposal to increase the supply of needed healthcare providers that are well distributed across the country. One of our most important primary care workforce programs is the National Health Service Corps. The corps works to build healthy communities by supporting qualified health providers dedi-cated to working in rural and urban areas of the country where shortages of healthcare providers persist. Employed by local primary healthcare sites including rural health clinics and community health centers, National Health Serv-ice Corps technicians work every day to promote health and to treat illness and injury. In this case, too, nearly half of all our cur-rent corps providers work in rural communities. To meet the needs of both rural and urban underserved popu- lations, the President's budget includes the largest increase in funding in the history of the National Health Service Corps, and it is projected to support an annual field strength of more than 15,000 providers from fiscal year 2015 through 2020. These are providers who will meet primary healthcare needs of more than 16 million patients. HRSA's health workforce funding will also support a new com- petitive grant program, the Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education Program. This new program will fund teaching hos-pitals, children's hospitals, and community based consortium of teaching hospitals and other healthcare entities in order to expand residency training with a focus on ambulatory, primary, and pre-ventive care. Also integral to ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to critical health services is the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. We now know that people living with HIV who are on drug treat-ment and are virally suppressed are much less likely to transmit the infection to others. By helping people to stay in care and adhere to their antiretroviral treatments, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program plays a critical role in preventing the spread of HIV. Armed with this knowledge, the Ryan White program supports the national HIV/AIDS strategy of reducing transmission by serv-ing patients across the care continuum. HRSA also administers a number of other critically important healthcare programs that collectively touch the lives of millions of people across the country, including poison control centers, national programs for countermeasures and vaccine injury compensation, and Federal organ and blood stem cell transplantation. PREPARED STATEMENT Across the agency, we take seriously the stewardship of our pro- grams and our responsibility for the funds that are awarded to grantees and communities. And over the last few years, we have developed a number of strategies to ensure the integrity of the pro-grams that we operate. Thank you again for providing me with the opportunity to share our work with you today, and I too will be pleased to answer ques-tions. [The statement follows:] 255 PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARYK. W AKEFIELD , PH.D., RN Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) budget request for fiscal year 2015. HRSA is the primary Federal agency charged with improving access to healthcare services for people who are medically underserved because of their economic circumstances, geographic iso-lation, or serious chronic disease. Our fiscal year 2015 budget addresses these issues by providing critical investments in programs that bolster our primary care infra-structure, strengthen the healthcare workforce, and improve health equity. BOLSTER PRIMARY CARE INFRASTRUCTURE To bolster the Nation's primary care infrastructure, the budget includes $4.6 bil- lion for the Health Center program, which supports community-based, patient-di-rected organizations that provide comprehensive primary care services in medically underserved communities. Health centers provide a wide range of medical, dental, and behavioral services, often making all of these services available at one location. It is important to note that nearly half of all health centers serve rural populations. The fiscal year 2015 investment will allow health centers serve approximately 31 million patients, at nearly 9,500 service delivery sites and provide care in every State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin. The budget also allocates $100 million to fund 150 new health center sites that will serve an additional 900,000 patients. STRENGTHEN HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE HRSA is also charged with strengthening the healthcare workforce by supporting the education and distribution of a highly skilled primary care workforce through training, curriculum development, and scholarship and loan repayment programs. To this end, the budget provides $1.8 billion for health workforce programs and makes new and strategic investments to strengthen our supply of healthcare pro-viders that are well-distributed throughout the country. One of our most important primary care workforce programs is the National Health Service Corps. Employed by local rural health clinics, community health cen-ters, and other primary care sites, Corps clinicians work every day to promote health and treat illness and injury in rural and urban areas of the country where access to care is limited and where shortages of healthcare professionals persist. Nearly half of all current Corps providers work in rural communities. The Presi-dent's budget includes $810 million for the Corps in fiscal year 2015, which rep-resents the largest level of funding in the history of the Corps. This level of funding is projected to support an annual field strength of more than 15,000 providers over fiscal years 2015-2020 and serve the primary healthcare needs of more than 16 mil-lion patients annually. HRSA will also invest in our Nation's health workforce through the new Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education (GME) program, which will expand resi-dency training in primary care and other high-need specialties with the goal of en-couraging innovation in training models and greater accountability for GME funds. This program will support 13,000 residents over 10 years through competitive grants to teaching hospitals, children's hospitals, and community-based consortia of teaching hospitals and/or other healthcare entities. The budget also invests $144 million to develop the Nation's nursing workforce through programs that, among other strategies, support the enhancement of ad-vanced nursing education and practice, increased nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and an expanded nursing pipeline. The budget also provides for two new workforce initiatives, including $10 million to support a new Clinical Training in Interprofessional Practice program to increase the capacity of community-based primary healthcare teams to deliver quality care. In addition, $4 million is provided to fund new Rural Physician Training grants to help rural-focused training programs recruit and graduate students likely to prac-tice medicine in rural communities. ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY HRSA considers our work with special populations and eliminating health dispari- ties a top priority. The budget includes $2.3 billion for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to improve and expand access to care for persons living with HIV/AIDS. As a payor of last resort, the Ryan White Program funds services not covered by health insurance but which are nonetheless critical to ensuring that individuals liv-ing with HIV are linked into care and started on anti-retroviral drug regimens. Due 256 to the Affordable Care Act, many Ryan White clients will continue to gain access to health insurance or see improvements in their current health insurance coverage in fiscal year 2015. In response to these changes, as well as the evolving nature of the epidemic, the Federal Government will continue to coordinate closely with State and local governments and Ryan White Program grantees to ensure that vulnerable populations living with HIV have regular access to quality HIV care and life-extend-ing medications. The budget also proposes better serve the needs for women, infants, children and youth by consolidating funds from Part D of the Ryan White program to Part C. The consolidated program will emphasize care across all vulnerable populations and will allow resources to be better targeted to points along the HIV care continuum and to populations most in need throughout the country. One of our largest programmatic areas focused on special populations is our ma- ternal and child health programs. The HRSA budget includes funding through fiscal year 2024 to extend and expand the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, through which States are implementing evidence-based home vis-iting programs that enable nurses, social workers, and other professionals to work with at-risk families and to connect them to assistance that supports the child's health, development, and ability to learn. These programs are strictly voluntary and have been shown to improve maternal and child health and developmental out-comes, improve parenting skills and school readiness. In addition to the investments in health centers and the National Health Service Corps that will improve access to healthcare in rural areas, the budget provides $125 million for targeted programs to assist Americans living in rural communities through the HHS Office of Rural Health Policy, which is housed within HRSA. The Office serves as the Department's primary voice on rural health issues and funds a number of State and community-based grant and technical assistance programs to help meet the healthcare needs of rural communities. HRSA also makes investments in a number of other critically important healthcare programs that collectively touch the lives of millions of people across the country. These include the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which provides discounts on outpatient prescription drugs to program that serve a high number of low-income patients, and efforts to support Federal organ and transplantation oversight, as well as efforts to promote awareness of organ transplantation issues and increase organ donation rates. CONCLUSION In fiscal year 2015, HRSA will continue its efforts to strengthen the safety net by expanding and enhancing primary care services, primary care health profes-sionals, services for low-income individuals and people with serious health condi-tions, such as HIV/AIDS or in those in need of an organ transplant. We will con-tinue to leverage our work on important health services for mothers and children, and targeted health professions training. HRSA will also continue to work in part-nership with other Federal entities, State and local governments, private organiza-tions, and Members of Congress to strengthen access to care with the aim of improv-ing the health of millions of Americans. Thank you again for providing me the op-portunity to discuss HRSA's fiscal year 2015 budget with you today. I am pleased to respond to your questions. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Dr. Wakefield. We will now start a series of 5-minute questions, and I will start off. EARLY HEAD START -CHILD CARE PARTNERSHIPS Mr. Greenberg, I want to start with you, the Administration for Children and Families. The budget request includes $150 million to expand Early Head Start, including the new Early Head Start and child care partnerships. This subcommittee had provided $500 million for the same purpose last year. I understand the grant com-petition for these fiscal year 2014 funds will be announced in the next couple weeks. There is a lot of excitement and interest in com-munities across the country, because of this. So could you talk, just very briefly, about ACF's vision for these new Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, because, as I un-257 derstand it, what we were trying to do, obviously, in promoting more Early Head Start, we recognize that there are a lot of dif-ferent providers of child care out there. They are doing good jobs, too, but we want them to be coordinated with Early Head Start, not one-size-fits-all, but how can we start coordinating it, so these kids are ready to go to kindergarten, basically, and first grade? Is that the idea? Mr. G REENBERG . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, it is. I should say, we are very excited about the Early Head Start- Child Care Partnerships, and we have been struck over the last number of months, as we have talked and worked with Head Start programs and child care programs, and those interested in early childhood across the country, how much excitement there is. Mr. Chairman, as you indicate, the basic concept is that there are very high standards that apply in the context of Early Head Start, but only a very small number of eligible infants and toddlers are able to participate in the Early Head Start program. A much larger number are in child care settings across the country, and the child care settings vary considerably in their quality. The vision for the partnerships is that Early Head Start pro- viders will actively work with child care providers in their commu- nities. In doing so, that will ensure that Early Head Start services can be provided to children in child care settings, and at the same time, there is a potential to use this as a way of raising the overall quality of child care that can benefit a much larger group of chil-dren. So we are excited about it. There is tremendous enthusiasm in the field. We are expecting a strong and vigorous competition. And we are seeking additional funding, because we know that in this first round of competition, we will only be able to respond to what is likely to be a fraction of the interest that is out there in moving this direction. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Mr. Greenberg. GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY Dr. Frieden, we included $7.5 million in last year's omnibus for CDC to establish national public health institutes in developing countries. A lot of this came about because of a trip I took with you to Africa one time. And what we saw was a lot of fragmentation in these countries, different departments doing different things and taking a long time to determine what was causing an outbreak, or where it was located, how it was being transmitted. So the idea was to help set up CDC-like structures in other coun- tries. As you know, CDC sort of sets the standard for the world. I noticed China has even called its own public health institute the China CDC. That speaks volumes. So we put that $7.5 million in there. It was, hopefully, to start this, to make your agency's job easier when there are disease out-breaks. So now the budget for next year zeroed out this initiative. So tell me what that is all about. And how does your budget re- quest for $45 million for global health security fit in with this ini-tiative? Dr. F RIEDEN . Thank you very much, Senator Harkin. Thank you for your leadership on this and so many other issues. I think your 258 understanding and commitment to public health have been extraor- dinarily helpful in getting us the progress that we have made. And as we have seen when we go around the world, the leading question I am asked is how can we have our own CDC? With these resources, we have put out a call and asked countries what they would like to do. We have more than 30 countries interested in doing more in this area. We anticipate giving five countries cooperative agreements to expand an existing public health institute and make it more of an effective program, and three countries to begin that planning proc-ess so they can have something in the future. The budget always has hard choices, and we wish things could be in this that aren't. However, I do think there is a synergy be-tween the Global Health Security Initiative and national public health institutes. Global health security is about helping other countries best find, stop, and prevent disease outbreaks within their borders. In order to do that, they need a laboratory network. They need trained epidemiologists. They need emergency operations centers. They need a way of operating. And to do that, they have to have effective national public health institutions. So I think there is a great deal of synergy between these pro- grams. Resources are not what we would all wish they would be for the kind of programs that we would like to run, but I do think the national public health institutes program is a very important one. Senator H ARKIN . My time has run out. I want to follow up on that, maybe in the next round, because, one, it seems to me it is facilities, bricks and mortar, laboratories. It seems like the other one is setting up systems. And I don't know how that is working out with both of these. Senator Moran. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. In def- erence to my colleague from Nebraska who has an Ag Committee hearing, I will yield my time to Senator Johanns. Senator J OHANNS . I thank the ranking member. Sometimes we are called to be in two places at once, and I appreciate it, because that is an important hearing also. Let me just start out and say, thank you for being here. We, cer- tainly, appreciate it. I would like to offer a comment, though, about the absence of Secretary Sebelius. I have been in the chair of a Cabinet Secretary before. I am astonished, absolutely blown away, that she is not here today. I am a fairly new member to the Appropriations Committee, and I can't think of more important work than what we do. We guard the taxpayer's dollar. We not only look forward in these hearings to what is coming in the next year. We look back at how those dollars were spent in the past year. So I am very troubled by the fact that she is not here. It is part of the job of being a Cabinet Secretary. I had the honor of being a Cabinet Secretary. And at one point in that career, the chairman of this committee was also my chairman of my committee of jurisdiction. 259 There never would have been a day where, if I was asked to ap- pear before a committee he was chairing, that I would not have at-tended. That simply would not have happened. Most importantly, what we do here is we try to assure Nebras- kans and people across this country that tax dollars are spent wise-ly. I can tell you, having been in your chair many times, I am not sure I would describe it as a pleasant experience, but it was impor-tant that I defended the priorities in the budget that I proposed to Congress. And as long as I was Secretary, there was no one else that could replace my presence. So by not being here, Secretary Sebelius and, I feel, the White House, too, because they could direct that she be here\u2014is sending the message that somehow they are not accountable, not account-able to me, not accountable to my colleagues, but most importantly, not accountable to the American taxpayer. Leadership is not about convenience and being available when it works into someone's schedule. It is about accepting responsibility for the job you have taken on. The fact of the matter is that this budget was compiled under the Secretary's watch. No one else's. She was in charge. Not only that, she is still running this agency. Unfortunately, her absence speaks volumes about lack of trans- parency. The Secretary's time at HHS has, certainly, not been a picture of success. Last month, a nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report revealed that the administration has failed to meet more than half\u2014more than half\u2014of the 83 statutory deadlines re-quired under Obamacare. She is the Secretary. I should have the right to ask about that. And the Department of HHS was respon-sible for virtually all of those missed deadlines. This administration has unilaterally delayed or changed parts of the healthcare law more than 20 different times. Again, virtually all of these delays are under the jurisdiction of HHS. So we have a slew of missed deadlines, changes to the law that, quite honestly, we haven't approved in Congress. But if anything, that would underscore the importance of her being here, to justify that, to tell me why she thinks she has the ability to do that. Last year during the appropriations process, I actually offered an amendment that required HHS to be more transparent in spending on Obamacare. I was very pleased that the language was included in the final appropriations package. It required the Department to submit in this year's budget re- quest an outline of the sources of funding used to implement the healthcare law's exchanges, and specifically how the Department used that money. But she is not here to answer for that. Unbeliev-able. I don't believe the HHS budget came close to following those re- quirements, and I have the requirements right here. Why should I not be entitled to ask her about that? So I want to reiterate my disappointment. I think it was impor- tant that I use my time to express this. I hope somehow the mes-260 sage gets back to the White House that we are serious about over- sight. We are serious about transparency. And we are serious when we ask Cabinet members to attend our hearings. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Johanns. And while we might have some disagreements on certain things, we both agree on one thing: It is time to retire. Senator J OHANNS . And we are. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Mikulski. Senator M IKULSKI . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing. I wanted to come for several reasons. One, of course, is our re- sponsibility to do due diligence on these budgets. But also to thank the men and woman at this table and the people who work at the agencies that they are the executive leadership of. I want to thank them for their service. In each and every way and every day, our country is better and safer, and our children's lives are brighter, because of your leader-ship, your executive ability, your trying to guide us during great times of budgetary turmoil and uncertainty. And then facing se-quester, facing furloughs, facing uncertainty, and facing a rather skimpy cost-of-living increase. So I want to thank you. I want to thank people at each and every one of these agencies for the job that you do. And I know the other day, they gave the so-called Sammies awards for thanking people for their service, but we can't do the job we want to without that. Each and every one of you, we could have had a separate hearing on the work that you do, from the CDC, to CMS, to Children, and HRSA, et cetera. But today, because of a sense of urgency to really hold our hear- ings, do our due diligence, and be able to avoid a lame duck, we are working on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to restore regular order. I want to thank Senator Shelby, for all of his cooperation, and then my chairs and my ranking, to be able to accomplish this. Our goal is to be able to move our committees in an expeditious way, and then to be able to complete our work by October 1. It is a bodacious, audacious effort, because it has not been done since 1996. Since 1996, the Congress of the United States has not com-pleted this. So we are going to give it a go, and we are going to give it a try. ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ' FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET REQUEST I am going to focus my time, though, with you, Mr. Greenberg. Ordinarily, I go with health and talk to CMS, talk to CDC, and talk to HRSA. But I am going to focus on you today for two rea-sons: One, early childhood; and then the other, the unaccompanied children. I want to thank Senators Alexander, Shelby, Harkin, and Burr. We led a bipartisan effort here on children. First of all, in last year's appropriation, we put money into Head Start, and we did it by working together. And you felt that plus- 261 up. So we say Congress did. This is the Congress that did it. This is the Congress that did it. And then working on a bipartisan basis, we passed the Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG) that had not been reau-thorized in, again, over 20 years, by working together. So let me get to my question. Is this budgetary request\u2014first of all, let's go to the CCDBG grant\u2014enough resources to implement the new authorizing legislation that was passed on a bipartisan basis, particularly on the quality initiatives? Mr. G REENBERG . Thank you, Senator Mikulski, for your com- ments. I first just want to recognize how much we appreciate the bipartisan support in the appropriations process and the\u2014\u2014 Senator M IKULSKI . We appreciate the thanks, but I have 5 min- utes. Mr. G REENBERG . Okay, so for the requirements of the bill that would strengthen health and safety, and strengthen consumer edu-cation, and strengthen a number of other aspects of State perform-ance, States, if their funding is limited, States will need to make judgments within their block grant funds around prioritizing. Senator M IKULSKI . I am getting lost here. Do you have the money or don't you? I mean, is this enough or not? Mr. G REENBERG . The budget request that the administration made was one that was recognizing the importance of additional funding for child care, both for access and for quality. It is also a budget request that is necessarily constrained by the figures that we are operating within. Senator M IKULSKI . Can we go to the Head Start program? You say the additional $270 million will maintain current service levels. Now, we love the President's new initiative. But what we feel right now is we have to keep going on that which we have, where we don't have new programs, new regs, new compliance standards, but keep that which we are doing. Now is this Spartan, skimpy, or do you think adequate? Because there is a code word here: To maintain current service levels. I am concerned about this, that it is not really enough. And, again, there is strong bipartisan support for Head Start here. And I might say, on the other side of the dome, too. Mr. G REENBERG . Sure. And in the Head Start request, we did structure it in order to maintain current services, certainly, to go further than that would have required additional funding. And we were constrained in what we could request in discretionary fund-ing. Senator M IKULSKI . So what I hear you saying is that what we are doing here is good, but it is going to be barely enough to meet that which we already have on the books. I am not trying to put you on the spot. Mr. G REENBERG . Sure. Senator M IKULSKI . So let me then go to unaccompanied children. I am really frustrated about this. Colleagues, I would really ask you, knowing your concern, both as Senators and fathers, and so on, we have children pouring over the border from Central America. These are unaccompanied chil-dren. We have, like, boat people, but they are border children. 262 They are pouring over the border. The numbers are escalating. When they come over, HHS picks up these children. We don't want to warehouse them. We try to put them in foster care. They are being sent by their families to escape the violence in Central America. There was a little girl from Ecuador who, when she was moved to a shelter, hung herself in the shower. And she had been on the road all by herself, and she was 11 years old, and she had been on the road for 2 months. Now Sebelius called me when I was doing the omnibus, asked for more money because they didn't have it. They underestimated the numbers. So we put in more money. Barbara Mikulski, a social worker, working with Richard Shelby, who was not going to leave children warehoused in Quonset huts, and, I must say Hal Rogers and Nita Lowey, we put the money in. Now, I have been saying to the Administration, ''Tell me what you need, and don't stick us with the bill at the end.'' And I feel that you are not telling me what you need. I really don't feel that HHS is telling me what you need. So you have gone from\u2014and I say this to my colleagues, please go to page 5 of the testimony\u2014in 2011, it was 6,500 kids. In fiscal 2014, it was 60,000. We have gone from 6,500 to 60,000, and every-body is saying you can't give me the numbers because you can't make the estimates. Well, what do you think? Really, I have taken this up to Sebelius. I have taken it up to Burwell. I am taking it to John Kerry. Senator Harkin has done the same. I know I have the support from\u2014we just need to know. We have to look out for these children while we work on root cause. I have been down to root cause before. While we were work-ing on root cause, we still have thousands of unaccompanied chil-dren whose parents paid coyotes and someone to bring them over the border to safety. Mr. G REENBERG . So, as you indicated, Senator, the numbers have gone up very dramatically over the period since 2011. And the numbers continue to grow. The children are principally children from Guatemala and Hon- duras and El Salvador. The best indications are that there are a mix of reasons, that the violence that is occurring in these coun-tries appears to be a significant contributing factor. Additional fac-tors are economic conditions, and in some cases, family reunifica-tion. So there are a set of reasons. But the numbers do continue to grow. For HHS, our responsibility is\u2014\u2014 Senator M IKULSKI . Mr. Greenberg, I so respect you. You have such a long history of fighting poverty. But if HHS does not receive enough funding for this program where we have adequate\u2014not adequate\u2014we need real projections. The Department of Homeland Security could end up holding these children in cells intended for adults unless we come to grips with what are we going to do and how we are going to bridge this while we are looking at the root cause. 263 So I don't want to take the time of my colleagues. Members have been waiting patiently. Senator Harkin did this. I am going to stop. But this is a humanitarian crisis, and we have to go to the edge of our chairs to at least get the estimate for fiscal year 2015. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just felt the committee needed to be aware of this because this is not only a funding problem, it is a hu-manitarian crisis. But our failure to appropriate could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. Mr. G REENBERG . Senator Mikulski. Senator M IKULSKI . I need numbers. Thank you very much. My time is up. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Moran. Senator M IKULSKI . Thank you. And thank you, colleagues. I real- ly think this is a new hot potato here. Senator H ARKIN . A huge issue. And it is a funding issue that con- fronts not only HHS, but also Homeland Security, too. Senator M IKULSKI . And the Department of State. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I apparently established a precedent. I am going to soon yield to the ranking member, the Senator from Alabama. But, Madam Chair, while you and your colleagues, counterparts in the House, and Senator Shelby, work on trying to figure out the gap of $4 billion in the Federal Housing Authority that creates huge problems for all of the appropriations process, this, in my view, is the issue in this subcommittee that is very similar\u2014a $1.1 billion gap, we believe, that somehow needs to be addressed, based upon the tremendous humanitarian need. And while all of us are sympathetic broadly to humanitarian needs, particularly when it comes to children, it is exacerbated. So it is a high priority. But my point would be: We have a similar problem to what we have in Federal housing here in this budget as a result of this issue. Let me yield the balance of my time to the Senator from Ala- bama, the ranking member. Senator S HELBY . Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Harkin. First of all, I want to just restate what I have said many times\u2014 I appreciate what all of you do and what you are trying to do. We are short of money, but not short of ideas, not short of people that would be great scientific investigators, and so forth. We have to make tough decisions. I hope we make some wise ones. But I support what you do, individually and collectively. But now I want to direct my remarks not to you, but to Secretary Sebelius. On April 2, 2009, then-Governor Sebelius testified before the Senate Finance committee at her confirmation hearing to serve as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. At that hearing, the chairman of the Finance Committee asked her the following direct question, and I quote, ''Do you agree, without reservation, to respond to any reasonable summons to appear and testify before any duly constituted committee of Congress, if you are confirmed?'' 264 Governor Sebelius, at that time she was still Governor, answered unequivocally, and I quote again, ''I do. And I look forward to it.'' Well, the then-nominee gave us her word that she would appear when asked to do so. Apparently, she has changed her mind. This subcommittee and, of course, the whole committee, has two former Secretaries, Senator Alexander who was Secretary of Edu-cation, and Governor\u2014I call him Governor\u2014Senator Johanns. I thought his statement earlier was right on point. What has not changed is this subcommittee's responsibility to en- sure that taxpayer dollars appropriated to HHS are spent wisely. That is why we wanted Secretary Sebelius up here. And in light of the failures of Obamacare, a lot of us believe, it is entirely reasonable to expect the Secretary to explain how she spent money previously allocated to her Department before we con-sider her request for $60.8 billion more. Nevertheless, Secretary Sebelius has reneged on her promise to the Senate and refused a reasonable summons to appear and tes-tify here today. Why? Because, according to the Obama administra-tion, she doesn't want to. That is not sufficient. We deserve better than that. We deserve more respect on this committee. Thank you. Senator H ARKIN . Senator Reed. Senator R EED. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your testimony. LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Mr. Greenberg, we understand\u2014it has been highlighted by my colleagues\u2014the fiscal pressures the Department is under. One area which I have worked on consistently, on a bipartisan basis with Senator Collins, is LIHEAP. And once again, the budget is very disappointing, honestly. We will do our best to try to restore funding. This is critical, not just to our region of the country, but it is particularly critical in the Northeast, because we are paying energy prices that are some-times three and four times the national average. And so, less dol-lars with higher prices means more and more families are literally cold in the winter. And I think in the summertime, other parts of the country have a similar problem with cooling. My question is: I don't know what you can do at this point, but I want to stress my disappointment. And can you give us an idea of why we couldn't get more money into the LIHEAP budget from the administration? Mr. G REENBERG . Senator Reed, thank you. The LIHEAP decision was an extremely difficult one. It does simply reflect the need to make decisions and make priority judgments among competing pri-orities with limited discretionary funding. For LIHEAP, we are very mindful of the tremendous importance of the program. We are very mindful that it only reaches a fraction of the eligible households, that for those who it does reach, that the benefits that are provided are limited in relation to their heating and cooling costs. We are mindful of all those limitations. And this was simply a judgment about priorities with limited discretionary funds. 265 We have proposed, as part of the budget, to also move forward on energy burden reduction grants, recognizing that a part of an overall strategy has to be helping families develop ways of lowering their energy costs. But, fundamentally, this is about constrained resources. Senator R EED. Well, I think, as you can anticipate, we will try our best to rebalance. HEALTHY HOMES AND LEAD POISONING PREVENTION Dr. Frieden, let me move on quickly. CDC, the Healthy Homes and Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, is another extremely im-portant program. Lead poisoning is a completely avoidable child- hood disease that can cause irreparable damage to children. We have made progress. We were able to restore some funding last year to CDC. Can you tell us what your plans are to use these resources and also to make them stretch further, go further, and help more chil-dren? Dr. F RIEDEN . Thank you, Senator Reed. Thank you for your sup- port for this and other public health issues. Lead poisoning prevention is critically important, as you say. And CDC has a unique role in both surveillance, so we know what is happening, and targeting interventions. We know that even slight elevations in lead levels can result in a lifelong reduction in both intellectual potential and in earnings capacity, so it has major economic implications. What we will do with the funding restored by Congress is to sup- port roughly 30 city or State health departments to do a better job at surveillance and targeting prevention to better protect children and continue to drive down lead poisoning rates. Senator R EED. Thank you very much. In this context, I have to thank Senator Mikulski and our former colleague, Kit Bond. When they were leading the Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee here, they targeted remediation, so that we could literally get the lead out of houses. And without Barbara's leadership, thousands and thousands of children\u2014and Senator Bond's\u2014would have been not only adversely affected\u2014\u2014 Senator M IKULSKI . And Jack Kemp. Senator R EED. And Secretary Kemp, too. So this was a bipartisan effort. We like to see it that way. HOME VISITING AND LEAD EXPOSURE Final question: If I may, Dr. Wakefield, and that is, you have a home visiting program. This relates to the lead exposure. You have a home visiting program, and it is an opportunity to check on many hazards, including lead exposures, and to coordinate with CDC. Can you tell us what you intend to do to coordinate between these home visits and the Healthy Homes and Lead Poisoning Pro-gram, so we are getting more bang for the buck? That is what we want to do around here. Dr. W AKEFIELD . Sure. So the home visiting program is being de- ployed in all 50 States, and it has as a basis, evidence-based pro-grams that are deploying nurses, social workers, other health care 266 providers, to families that choose to participate in the program vol- untarily. But they are families that tend to be at risk, of course, and living in at-risk communities. So through the home visiting program now, we have over the course of about the last year or so, infused in six of those evidence- based programs information about lead poisoning prevention and healthy housing. So I know that is a priority for you and for other Members of the Senate, and we have tried to embed that in the program in a num-ber\u2014not all yet, Senator\u2014but in a number of the home visiting programs. Senator R EED. And are you working with CDC? Dr. W AKEFIELD . We do very closely. And I have personally had conversations with CDC on this topic. Senator R EED. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Reed. Senator Moran. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you. I thought it was fi- nally my time to talk, but Senator Alexander has asked that I yield to him, and I am happy to yield. Senator A LEXANDER . I am glad we have such a yielding ranking member. I thank you for your courtesy, Senator Moran. Mr. Love, I hope you will express to Marilyn Tavenner our sym- pathy for the loss of her mother, and respect for the way she does her job. And we look forward to seeing her soon. Dr. Frieden, I wanted to especially thank you for the terrific job the CDC did in the meningitis outbreak. You worked fast and quickly. And by doing that, and the help that you gave the Ten-nessee Department of Public Health, and Vanderbilt and others who worked on that, you saved a lot of lives in that. And to all of you, I think we all appreciate and respect the work that you do and look forward to more informational hearings. But this is not an appropriate hearing. I think my colleagues know I spend as much time as anybody on the Republican side try-ing to make this Government work in the way it is supposed to work. I especially appreciate what Chairman Mikulski said about the regular order, and I like the fact that she and Senator Shelby and Senator Harkin and others and Senator Moran, are trying to have us do our job with appropriations, and to do it together in the way we are expected. So I am supporting that effort, and intend to do everything I can to help her do that. But this is not right for the Secretary of the Department to not appear to defend the President's budget. I was a Secretary. I am pretty sure I answered the same ques- tion when I was asked, would I show up, when I was asked by the committee. And I believe I did, whenever I was asked, at least for this specific occasion. And I notice that the chairman mentioned a couple times that he is retiring this year. But if he is, I haven't noticed it. If anybody from Iowa were to ask me if Tom Harkin was slowing down in this 267 year of his retirement, I would say, as far as I can tell, he is speed- ing up. I mean, we have a hearing every other day, it seems like. And he is busily doing his job, and I am glad he is. I enjoy working with him. We have gotten more done than any other committee in the Congress, authorizing committee. I notice that the Senator from Nebraska is also retiring, and he not only came to this hearing, he is on his way to another hearing. So where is the Secretary of Health and Human Services? She is still on the job. And if the Secretary of Defense were still on the job and waiting for the next Secretary, and we were invaded, or Ukraine happened, would the Secretary of Defense not show up? That is not appropriate. And it is more, I am afraid, than just the Secretary playing hooky. I mean, this is getting to be a persistent problem with this administration regarding, Article 1 of the Constitution and the Congress, the representatives of the people as an inconvenience. I think Presidents ought to begin their terms by taking the Cabi- net down to Mount Vernon and reminding themselves that while the chief executive is extremely important, the Founders didn't want a king. And George Washington, who could have stayed for-ever, as long as he lived, as President, imprinted his humility and respect for the people on the Constitution that he helped to write. And every President since then, almost, has tried to stretch that envelope. But this administration has gone further than any I can remem- ber, with its recess appointments and its czars and its waiver au-thority for school boards and raising money privately to do what Congress did not authorize to do and turning the Senate into a place where the majority can do whatever it wants, whenever it wants to get a result that the administration wants. That is not the way our constitutional framework was set up. I hope I would say the same thing if we had a Republican Presi- dent whose Secretary didn't show up to testify before a Republican committee. We have Article 1 for a reason. We represent the people of this country for a reason. We are here, ready to do our jobs. And I am extremely disappointed that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who helped write this budget over the last 6 months, is not here to do her job. What if the next Secretary said she couldn't come testify because she didn't have anything to do with writing the budget? It is the job of the Secretary to be here, to show respect, not for each of us, but for the people we are elect-ed to represent under Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Alexander. Senator Shaheen. Senator S HAHEEN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Mr. Greenberg, before I get into the meat of my questions, I do want to just echo what Senator Reed had to say about the LIHEAP program. 268 As you know, in the Northeast, we had a very cold winter, and we have a lot of people in New Hampshire who did not get the as-sistance that they really needed through the LIHEAP. So while I appreciate we have very challenging resource issues, I, certainly, will be arguing on this committee that we should increase the amount of funding for LIHEAP. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT Mr. Love, I am really pleased that despite all of the challenges with the rollout of healthcare.gov that this past week we heard that over 40,000 people in New Hampshire had selected a health insurance plan through the exchange. That is a significantly great-er number than the 19,000 that CMS had targeted, so we were pleased about that. I am also pleased that there was recently a bipartisan com- promise in our New Hampshire Legislature that allowed the Gov-ernor and the Legislature to agree to an expansion of Medicaid in the State. That will require a waiver, as you know, and I understand that there are discussions already underway between the State of New Hampshire and CMS, so I would urge those discussions to go for-ward as expeditiously as possible. And I appreciate all the work that you are doing to try to make that happen. We have 50,000 residents in New Hampshire who will benefit from an expansion in Medicaid. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the steps that CMS is taking to continue to improve the implementation of the healthcare law, specifically with respect to the healthcare.gov Web site. What steps are you taking to ensure that problems don't exist moving forward? And can you talk about the importance of what I believe is the importance of having a permanent CEO to head up the effort around the technology and the Web site? Mr. L OVE. Thank you, Senator. Regarding the rollout of healthcare.gov, as you and other mem- bers of the committee have mentioned, we have a number of 8 mil-lion that no one I think would have predicted in the early fall. And there has been an extremely diligent effort, both on the part of the agency as well as our colleagues elsewhere in Government, and the private sector, quite frankly, to help us get up to speed on that. We have made tremendous progress. What we are very much focused on in the next 6 months\u2014the end of open enrollment, the first season\u2014is really building on that infrastructure, particularly as it regards the consumer experience and interacting with the Web site. That is of primary importance to us. There are other aspects of the Web site that the consumer may not see but are also quite important. We are focused on the finan-cial management piece of it and various oversight functions. And we are working just as hard during the down period as we were during the open enrollment. And we hope to see a dividend. We hope you will see a dividend to that in the next open enrollment in the fall. Regarding your question on a chief executive officer for our Cen- ter for Insurance\u2014CCIIO (Center for Consumer Information and 269 Insurance Oversight) is our shorthand\u2014but basically, the compo- nent that is central within CMS that has lead responsibility for that. I know that there are different management leadership mod-els under consideration. Right now, we do have an acting director, Dr. Mandy Cohen, who is doing a great job stepping up since her predecessor left a short while ago. And we are looking at different management models to bring the type of leadership effort I think you are considering. I know the Administrator is consulting both with the Depart- ment and the White House now on what the most rigorous leader-ship model for the CCIIO front office will be. I am sure you will be hearing more about that. Senator S HAHEEN . Thank you. I would urge you to make sure that there is a permanent person in charge of that effort in the fu-ture. PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE Dr. Frieden, I am sure you are aware that in northern New Eng- land, we have had an epidemic of heroin use. In New Hampshire, we had more deaths last year from drug overdoses than from car accidents, so it is something that we are very concerned about. I have done several panels with law enforcement, with treatment providers, to talk about what might be done to address this epi-demic. And one of the things I heard recently from a former DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent who had worked in this field for about two decades was that we should be doing more to ensure that there are some protocols around how doctors decide on prescriptions, since that, in too many cases, has been the avenue through which people got into drug use. And I wonder if you could talk about what CDC is doing or can do to educate providers for appropriate prescription drug practices. Dr. F RIEDEN . Thank you very much. This is, indeed, a huge problem. We have seen a fourfold increase in deaths from prescription opiates, currently, more deaths than from heroin and cocaine combined. And we have also seen devastating impacts on communities, where there are some communities where it is so rampant that it is difficult to recruit new businesses in because people can't pass drug tests. We see this as an opiate problem. As you point out, many, per- haps even most, people who currently use heroin started off with prescription opiates. We have tracked these trends, both overall and by State. And the numbers are, frankly, shocking. This is, to a significant extent, a doctor-caused, or iatrogenic, epi- demic. And we do believe it can be reversed by things like good guidelines. In fact, enough prescription opiates are given each year to give every adult in the country 75 opiate pills a year. It is just way too much. It is 18 billion pills a year. And we find in some States, as many as one in three people get a prescription each year. So what we have focused on for the 2015 request is to be able to support States with several specific things. One is strengthening prescription drug monitoring programs. These are very important, but there isn't one in the country that 270 is yet real-time, universal, and actively managed. So we want to get to that key area of tracking prescriptions, and intervening with both patients and providers for services as needed, or law enforce-ment if appropriate. The second key area is supporting States on a variety of meas- ures that they can do with insurers, Medicaid, and others. And the third is specifically the issue of guidelines. Washington State and some communities have guidelines, but they aren't well- followed. They aren't well-established. And by establishing guide-lines, then insurers, Medicaid programs, others can ensure that pain relief, which is very important\u2014for example, for patients with terminal cancer pain\u2014continues, but without the great risk that these drugs provide. Senator S HAHEEN . Well, thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, if I can just have one follow-up question. I know I am over my time. So how much of the requested $15.6 million for prescription drug overdose programs is going to be targeted to help providers become smarter prescription providers? Dr. F RIEDEN . The overwhelming majority of that would go to States. And within the States, each State would decide where they would move the money, where they would invest it. But the three key components are improving prescription drug monitoring programs, tracking the system in real-time, and strengthening prescriber practices and provider behavior. Senator S HAHEEN . Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Shaheen. Senator Moran, please take the time you desire. Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. First of all, Dr. Frieden, you have invited me to visit the CDC, and I want to express my gratitude and also express my sincere in-terest in accepting the invitation. We will work toward accom-plishing that. I look forward to that visit. The chairwoman of our full committee, the Senator from Mary- land, talked about the Unaccompanied Alien Children program. This is an example of a question that I would ask the Secretary if she were here. If she were here, I would ask this question: The Unaccompanied Alien Children program is underfunded by more than half, $1.1 billion. It is my understanding that the administra-tion will not submit a budget amendment to address that shortfall. I guess I would ask the Secretary if that is true. And I would say, Madam Secretary, if we have to live within our budget allocations, what HHS programs would you recommend that we would use to make up for that $1.1 billion? And again, there is no one here who can help us directly answer that question. Further, on ACA risk corridors, I would ask the Secretary that section 1342 of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to establish and administer those corridors. Does the Secretary have the authority to make payments from the risk corridor fund? And if not, how would the administration pay for that funding gap? Again, perhaps someone here could answer their belief as to whether the authority exists, but I don't think there is anybody 271 here who could tell us how the administration would then pay for that gap. We have had a lot of conversation, mostly in the House, about the evaluation tap. It was originally implemented throughout the Department's budget to use for evaluations of those program activi-ties within the Department. Perhaps, unfortunately, it is now used\u2014I guess not ''perhaps.'' Unfortunately, it is now used to sup-plant budget authority. And I would ask how does the Department of Health and Human Services justify taking funding from the National Institutes of Health to fund programs that should receive independent budget authority. There has been a request for an increase in that evaluation tap from 2.5 percent to 3 percent, and, Madam Secretary, how was it determined that increase in the tap was necessary in fiscal year 2015? What deliberations took place within HHS, and within the White House, to decide which agencies are sources and which are receivers of evaluation tap transfers? And specifically, why does the Department use what I would say is a budget gimmick to highlight an increase in NIH funding of $200 million even though NIH is left with only a $58 million increase above 2014, after accounting for the tap increase? And finally, an example of what I would ask the Secretary is re- garding the nonrecurring expenses funds. I am trying to become more knowledgeable about information technology. We have a hear-ing later today in the Appropriations Subcommittee on FSGG. The nonrecurring expenses fund dollars went to fund the Afford- able Care Act-related information technologies, but the fund can be used to cover any one-time capital I.T. acquisition. And I would be interested in knowing what analysis the Department does before moving unobligated funds into the nonrecurring expenses fund, and the details of that process for the subcommittee. How does HHS decide what I.T. projects merit nonrecurring ex- pense fund dollars? Does HHS solicit formal or informal requests from agencies for nonrecurring expense fund-related projects? What programs would have received funding over the past 2 years had funding not been siphoned off to fund implementation of the health insurance exchange? And then finally, an issue that is in my view so important. In last year's budget request, there was the $80 million increase for Alzheimer's disease research. Congress, in our omnibus bill, we were successful in finding $100 million for an increase for Alz-heimer's disease research. And why did the Department not include that increase for Alz- heimer's disease research in its 2015 budget proposal? And perhaps most importantly, will NIH be able to reach the goal for finding a cure for Alzheimer's by 2025, the stated goal, without an increase in its research funding? Mr. Chairman, I thank you for conducting this hearing. I am sorry that I don't think these folks can answer my question. We will continue the efforts to try to find those answers. I was interested in Senator Mikulski's conversation with Sec- retary Sebelius. And perhaps we will have that opportunity, either 272 in a hearing sometime or with the new Secretary, to explore these issues further. Thank you. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you, Senator Moran. I just have a couple follow-ups I want to do. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS Dr. Wakefield, I want to talk just a little bit about community health centers. As you know, we are going to face a funding cliff here if we don't extend the mandatory part of this budget. So talk to me a little bit about how you envision this moving ahead to make sure that we have the necessary funds, so that we don't have that budget cliff. I think it is 2016. Dr. W AKEFIELD . Sure. Thank you, Senator. The community health centers program is extremely important to ensure that individuals across the country have access to pri-mary healthcare services and preventive healthcare as well. And the importance of that program has really been increasing since about 2009 when that infrastructure was seeing about 17 mil-lion patients. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, as of about 2012, we are seeing about 21 million patients. And in 2015, we ex-pect we could be seeing as many as 31 million patients in that in-frastructure. So your point about sustainability and stability, to ensure that individuals and communities across the country have access to pri-mary healthcare services, is an important one. And we, of course, are concerned about long-term funding as well. So in fiscal year 2015, we have $3.6 billion. That is the last year of funding through the Affordable Care Act for community health centers, in fiscal year 2015. Our ask is $1 billion in discretionary for fiscal year 2015, to pro- vide a total of $4.6 billion to fund community health center pro-grams. Of that money, Senator, about $1 billion would be applied for nonrecurring costs. That is, to invest in construction and renova-tion. And frankly, from the field, from health centers across the country, because of this increased demand in numbers of people who are seeking healthcare services, a lot of them now with insur-ance coverage, this will allow those community health centers to build out and to reconfigure the centers in order to be able to ac-commodate that increased number of patients that are being seen. So about $1 billion, as I said, in 2015 will be used for non- recurring construction funds. Going forward, then, to replace the Affordable Care Act funds for fiscal year 2016, 2017, and 2018, we are proposing in the budget mandatory funding of $2.7 billion per year. In addition, we would assume that there would be appropriations made available by the Congress, but that is the proposal to ensure stability and access to healthcare services in the subsequent years. Senator H ARKIN . Will that $2.7 billion be enough to alleviate the funding\u2014\u2014 Dr. W AKEFIELD . So, Senator, if we were to assume that in addi- tion to that $2.7 billion, there would be appropriations that would 273 also be made available in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, to sup- port the program. Senator H ARKIN . How much? Dr. W AKEFIELD . That provides baselines to support operations, and so on. Senator H ARKIN . What would that be, about how much a year, which you anticipate that would be in terms of discretionary budg-et? Dr. W AKEFIELD . Well, I couldn't speak\u2014\u2014 Senator H ARKIN . We would have to come up with that. I am not going to be here, but he is going to be here. Dr. W AKEFIELD . So, Senator Moran\u2014\u2014 So, Senator, we are looking closely at the out-years additional needs. What we can count on is that need for $2.7 billion. So we are tracking, for example, the number of individuals that are re-ceiving care in health centers that are now coming through the doors with insurance coverage, so that provides some additional revenue. Senator H ARKIN . So you get some funds coming in through the Affordable Care Act? Dr. W AKEFIELD . To replace Affordable Care Act, we will have our mandatory funding of $2.7 million per year. In addition\u2014\u2014 Senator H ARKIN . Are you anticipating money that will come in because people now have insurance coverage? Dr. W AKEFIELD . Yes. So people will be coming in with insurance coverage. So we have that phenomenon. People coming through the door with insurance coverage, either Medicaid insurance coverage where it has been expanded, or private insurance coverage. But we also know that that is going to be uneven, Senator Har- kin, because there will be some States where Medicaid has not been expanded and individuals have become aware of community health centers as a place where they can access services. No one is turned away. A sliding fee scale is used for people under 200 per-cent of poverty. So we have a little bit of both of those dynamics. And we will have to look very closely at that for years 2016 and on. Senator H ARKIN . Do you anticipate any fall off of attendance\u2014 maybe that is the wrong word\u2014people seeking medical care from community health centers because they now do have insurance cov-erage and they might be going to their primary care doctor some-place else? Dr. W AKEFIELD . We don't. We don't expect a decline in demand for services through community health centers based on a couple things. First of all, we can look to the State of Massachusetts that has enacted healthcare reform a number of years ago. And even though their rate of uninsured decreased markedly, their demand for healthcare services through their community health centers in-creased markedly. So these are health centers that are located in underserved communities. They are trusted sources of care. They have been embedded in those communities for now, in many cases, a number of years. And frankly, they provide very high-quality and comprehensive care. 274 If you go to a health center, you can access oral healthcare serv- ices generally onsite. You can access behavior of mental health services, generally onsite, in addition to traditional medical serv-ices. So these are comprehensive healthcare delivery settings that have a strong tie to the communities that they serve. So the answer is no. Sorry. Senator H ARKIN . Thanks. HEALTHCARE FRAUD AND ABUSE Mr. Love, let me just quickly go to you. I mentioned the healthcare fraud and abuse program. The latest study showed that for every $1 spent, we got $8.10 recovered. This is the highest 3- year average return on investment in the 17-year history of this program. Now the Budget Control Act included cap adjustments that en- couraged Congress to increase this funding by $898 million over the past 3 years, an amount that would have saved taxpayers more than $6.2 billion. But the President's budget did not request utilizing this funding. Can you give the subcommittee an idea of what has been lost over the last 2 years by not taking advantage of the additional funding encouraged in the Budget Control Act? Mr. L OVE. Senator, Mr. Chairman, thanks for the question area. I cannot answer that specific question, but I can tell you what the budget is projected going forward, and that, as you said in your earlier remarks, there was an 8-to-1 return on investment, which is an excellent investment, indeed. And we remain very supportive of the fraud, abuse, and program integrity program. What the President's fiscal year 2015 budget does do is request $428 million for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Fund, HCFAC, which would provide both a dividend for Medicaid and Medicare. And the projected dividend on that over 10 years is $13.5 billion. So I think you will see it is, certainly, projected to be consistent with the 8-to-1 return on investment that you mentioned earlier. Senator H ARKIN . So your budget request increases HCFAC fund- ing by $428 million? Is that, which you are saying? Mr. L OVE. Yes, sir. Senator H ARKIN . That is lifting the cap? Mr. L OVE. I believe that is discretionary. Senator H ARKIN . Yes, lifting the cap on the mandatory side gives you that $428 million. And with that, you anticipate how much of a return? Mr. L OVE. $13.5 billion return over 10 years. Senator H ARKIN . Okay. I got that. GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY INITIATIVES Dr. Frieden, one last thing for you, following up a little bit on what I started earlier, and that is setting up CDCs in other coun-tries. You had a global health initiative, but then the request zeroes out the money we put in last year, which was $7.5 million. 275 Again, tell me, how was the $7.5 million utilized? And why wouldn't we want to continue that effort rather than just putting it all in the global health initiative? Dr. F RIEDEN . We certainly do want to continue the effort of strengthening national public health institutes around the world. The current fiscal year, what we are doing is working with around eight countries to either strengthen or start the process of creating a national public health institute. Some of those, it has multiple institutions, binding them together. Some of them, it is new. We anticipate working in multiple regions in the world. We have countries very interested in this area. And it is the kind of project that we would hope to be able to continue going forward. The global health security proposal would also enable us to strengthen national public health institutes, but not as directly as the funding in the fiscal year 2014 budget. So I can't really say more than that, but thank you for that support. I will comment that, Senator, if I might, after several decades, three decades of support for public health, we really appreciate your support for public health, not only in this country but around the world. You, of course, changed our name from the Centers for Disease Control to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and we embrace that mission, and we thank you for your support. Senator H ARKIN . I appreciate that. I will follow-up with you fur- ther on the continuation of your effort to help other countries set up their own CDCs, and basically, to make sure that they start having coordinated effort. Again, what I picked up in some of my travels, there were just so many fragmented parts. And they just don't have a CDC-like structure to pull it all together. They do need labs. They need equipment. They need all that. I understand that, too. But they need to change their structures. So I am going to have my staff further inquire about that. And I am a little disappointed that was not in the budget. I will get some more information on that as we move ahead in our decisions on what we want to do on that. ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE Two other just quick questions: One, tell us again about the looming crisis that I keep reading about in terms of antibiotic re-sistance, what is happening in our country. At least here, we are losing the ability to fight off certain bugs because of antibiotic re-sistance. So what is happening? Where are we in this? Dr. F RIEDEN . What we are seeing, Senator, is a steady increase in the proportion of different bacteria, in particular, that are resist-ant to antibiotics. And earlier, a few months ago, we released the first-ever report on our national status in terms of antimicrobial resistance. We found that there are more than 2 million resistant infections per year, more than 20,000 deaths per year in the U.S. from resistant infections. Another estimate is more than $20 billion in expenses. We highlighted\u2014\u2014 276 Senator H ARKIN . Do you have something in your budget request that zeroes in on this? Dr. F RIEDEN . Yes, we have a specific initiative to expand our ef- forts to reverse antimicrobial resistance. It is a $30 million request each year over 5 years. And with that investment, we think we can cut some of the deadliest resistant infections in half. We are con-fident we can deliver that value. Again, one of them, in particular, that I am very concerned about, something called CRE. It is a deadly bacteria. It is spread-ing in hospitals. It started out in one State, and then it was in 10, and now it is in virtually every State. It can be lethal to half of the hospitalized patients who get it. And I called it a ''nightmare bacteria'' because it can spread not only from patient to patient, but between different species of bac- teria. So whole classes of bacteria that can cause routine infections, like urinary tract infections, could become resistant to virtually all or even all of our available antibiotics. And we need to respond quickly. So we would do that by working intensively with hospitals by setting up regional centers of excel-lence and by moving forward as rapidly as possible, to improve both the detection of persistence and control of outbreaks, control measures where there are outbreaks. We have been able to see big reductions where we have been able to control this using a state-wide or communitywide approach, and prevention measures, which could be as simple as hand-washing or vaccination, or as complex as more complex interactions that would reduce the number of re-sistant infections. We recommended that every single hospital in this country have an antibiotic stewardship program so that they can make sure that the antibiotics used in the hospitals, where we are seeing some of the most resistant infections, can be prescribed appropriately. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FUNDING Mr. Love, please take back to CMS for me this: That this is my last year here, but I am going to be really vigilant in making sure that CMS follows the law and follows what this committee pre-scribes in terms of how the Affordable Care Act money is used. And let me cut to the quick on this: That there won't be any more shifting of money from prevention and wellness programs into base programs that CMS already has. Okay? It is just not going to happen. So just please take that back. Let everybody know. Mr. L OVE. I certainly will, Senator. Thank you. ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS Senator H ARKIN . I appreciate that. Thank you. Listen, thank you all very, very much. This has been a good hearing. Again, please take back to Ms. Tavenner the sympathies of all of us on the committee. She has been a great administrator, and this is a tough time for her, and please take that back to her, our deepest sympathies. 277 To all of you, thank you again for all of your public service. You have been great public servants, carrying out your responsibilities well. And we will leave the record open for 1 week for other Senators. [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but were submitted to the Department for response subsequent to the hear-ing:] QUESTIONS SUBMITTED TO TIMOTHY LOVE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR TOMHARKIN HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL PROGRAM Question. The latest HHS report released in March found that for every $1 spent on fraud and abuse in fiscal year 2013, $8.10 was recovered. This is the highest 3- year average return on investment (ROI) in the 17-year history of Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC). The budget Control Act included cap adjustments to encourage Congress to increase this funding by $898 million over the past 3 years. I am disappointed that the President's budget did not request utilizing this funding. Please describe the savings that have been lost over the last 3 years, and the fraud and abuse that has gone undetected, by not taking advantage of the additional funding encouraged in the Budget Control Act? Answer. The fiscal year 2015 budget supports fraud prevention and reduction of improper payments, which are top priorities of the administration. Despite enact-ment of multiyear discretionary cap adjustments in the Budget Control Act (BCA), annual appropriations bills have not provided the full amount of program integrity funding authorized in that law. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) actuaries conservatively project that for every new $1 spent by HHS to combat healthcare fraud, about $1.50 is saved or avoided. Applying this rate of return to the $932 million in HCFAC funding that was not provided between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2014 results in an estimated $1.4 billion in lost savings. In addition, HCFAC funding has also been subject to the cumulative effects of rescissions and sequestration, further affecting CMS' ability to detect fraud and abuse. Historically, for every $1 spent on healthcare-related fraud and abuse investigations through HCFAC and other programs in the last 3 years, the Government recovered $8.10. This is the highest 3-year average return on investment in the 17-year history of the HCFAC Program. Therefore, the President's budget proposes to build on recent progress on efforts to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse by increasing support for the HCFAC program through both mandatory and discretionary funding streams. The budget includes $697 million in new HCFAC program funding in fiscal year 2015: $294 million in base discretionary funding, $25 million in new discretionary funding, and $378 million in proposed new mandatory funding. Starting in fiscal year 2016, the budget requests all additional HCFAC funds as mandatory, instead of through the discretionary cap adjustment included in the Budget Control Act (BCA). All proposed HCFAC program investments, including gradual growth over time, are consistent with BCA levels. Providing additional resources for HCFAC as a dedicated, dependable source of mandatory funding will allow the Departments of HHS and DOJ to conduct nec-essary program integrity activities and make sure that only accurate payments are made to legitimate providers for appropriate services to eligible beneficiaries. Pro-viding additional mandatory funding for HCFAC will also eliminate delays in an-nual appropriations that make it difficult for HHS and DOJ to execute budget plans and achieve targeted results each year. The more stable mandatory program integ-rity funding will produce new deficit savings of $2 billion over 10 years. PROVIDER NON -DISCRIMINATION (SECTION 2706) Question. Section 2706 of the Affordable Care Act, the provider ''non-discrimina- tion'' provision is intended to prohibit health insurance plans from discriminating against entire classes of licensed and certified healthcare professionals solely on the basis of the provider's licensure or certification. Despite the clear intent of this pro-vision, I believe that the HHS, Treasury and Labor erred when it released the 2013 FAQ document that subverted the congressional intent of the section. The fiscal year 2014 Omnibus directed HHS to work with Labor and Treasury to correct the FAQ to reflect the law and congressional intent within 30 days of enactment of the bill. Recently HHS chose to issue a Federal Register notice requesting additional 278 public comment as to the appropriate interpretation of this provision. When does HHS plan to correct the FAQ to reflect what congressional intent is of the provision? Answer. The comment period for that Federal Register Request for Information is open until June 10, 2014. After the comment period closes, I would expect that HHS, together with the Departments of Labor and Treasury would evaluate the comments and use the public input to evaluate future rulemaking on that topic. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR MARYL. L ANDRIEU Question. CMS recently implemented a final rule that changed payments for speech generating devices (SGDs) so that Medicare beneficiaries no longer have the option to purchase them, but instead must rent them. Constituents with diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral palsy have expressed concern that Medicare will not pay the rental fees for the devices if they are admitted to hospice, a hospital or nursing home. These devices are highly customized and cannot be provided off-the-shelf. My understanding is that SGDs are overwhelmingly pur-chased, upwards of 99 percent of the time according to recent claims data. Why did you move SGDs into a rental category when the agency indicated that devices that are purchased 75 percent of the time should continue to have a purchase option? And how do you plan to address concerns about beneficiaries losing access? Answer. We recognize that patients may use long-term durable medical equip- ment (DME) such as SGDs because of chronic conditions or permanent disabilities. However, the statutory DME benefit is for equipment used in the home. When the beneficiary is admitted to a hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF), or hospice, it is the responsibility of the institution to furnish this device and any other DME that a beneficiary needs. CMS is committed to carefully monitoring beneficiary access using real-time claims data to ensure that beneficiaries are receiving medically nec-essary items and services. Question. As your agency prepares for open enrollment this fall, what improve- ments are you making to help certified health insurance agents and brokers seamlessly enroll and assist consumers into the health insurance marketplaces? Health Insurance brokers are making sure consumers understand the nuances of their plans, and they are the only group of certified individuals who handle both enrollment and service to policyholders year-round. Specifically, do you plan to es-tablish a toll-free helpline for agents and brokers, enable their National Producer Number (NPNs) to be added at any point during the enrollment process, and list certified agents and brokers on the local help section of Healthcare.gov? Answer. Agents and brokers will continue to play a vital role in enrolling individ- uals and businesses in coverage, as they do today. Agents and brokers act as trusted counselors, providing service at the time of plan selection and enrollment and cus-tomer service throughout the year. CMS provides training for agents and brokers to help them better assist consumers at purchasing coverage through the federally facilitated Marketplaces. In the first year, over 52,000 agents and brokers completed training from CMS. Agents and brokers continuing their participation in the individual market feder- ally facilitated Marketplace (FFM) for the 2015 plan year and future plan years will complete an annual registration renewal process that includes re-completion of re-quired training and re-execution of the applicable FFM Agent Broker Agreements. To continue participation in the FF-SHOPs for the 2015 plan year and future plan years, agents and brokers will execute the FF-SHOP Agent Broker Agreement an-nually, create an FFM user account, complete identity proofing, and are encouraged to re-complete testing and training. Agents and brokers who will be participating in the individual market FFM and/or the FF-SHOP for the first time for the 2015 plan year must register, create an FFM user account, complete market-specific training, and execute the applicable FFM Agent Broker Agreements. In general, the agent or broker's NPN, name, and FFM user ID should be re- corded as part of the consumer's application. This will identify the agent or broker on the enrollment transaction (called an ''834'') so the FFM can appropriately track enrollment and the issuer can compensate the agent or broker based upon the en-rollment (as may be appropriate). However, should an issuer identify a particular enrollment that should have had an agent/broker associated with it, the issuer should add the agent or broker to the enrollment internally even if the agent or broker was not reflected on the 834, in case there is any follow-up required as a result of the enrollment. If an agent or broker has a legitimate reason to believe he or she should be cred- ited for an FFM enrollment, but has not been credited for it, the agent or broker should contact the respective QHP issuer directly to discuss the specific situation. 279 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD J. D URBIN MEANINGFUL USE STAGE 2 Question. On May 6, 2014, CMS reported to the Health Information Technology Policy Committee that only 4 hospitals and 50 eligible professionals had successfully reached Stage 2 of the Medicare and Medicaid electronic health record (EHR) incen-tive program commonly referred to as Meaningful Use. We are now 7 months into the program year for hospitals and 4 months into the program year for physicians and other eligible professionals. Further complicating providers' efforts are the lack of certified EHRs in the inpatient hospital setting. As of mid-April, only 29 complete EHRs have been certified to 2014 program requirements. CMS has also said the 370 complete EHRs that were certified for the earlier edition of certified technology may not be used in 2014, even if providers are still at Stage 1 of the Meaningful Use program. These performance statistics for Stage 2 are alarming. What steps are you taking to ensure that providers are able to safely and effectively transition to Stage 2 of the program? In addition, while I understand that there is a hardship exceptions process, this process currently provides relief only from the significant financial penalties for not attesting in a timely way. Could the exemption be broadened to include lost incen-tive dollars once providers attest to Meaningful Use, even if they attest up to one full year late? Answer. HHS has been listening to providers, healthcare associations, EHR ven- dors, and its partners in the healthcare industry. In December 2013, HHS an-nounced that it would engage in rulemaking to extend Stage 2 of Meaningful Use for 1 year and allow Stage 3 to begin in 2017. In addition, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) issued a 2015 Edition EHR Certification Criteria Proposed Rule as part of its new regulatory approach to pro-vide more frequent updates to the certification criteria. By extending Stage 2 until 2017, HHS would have an additional year of Stage 2 implementation data to help inform any program changes. An extension also al-lows CMS and ONC to better align quality performance measures across Federal programs and to consider effective Stage 3 approaches to advance interoperability and clinical decision support capabilities that will help drive improved health out-comes. In response to stakeholder concerns that providers were having difficulties meet- ing the requirements of Stage 2, CMS and ONC announced in February 2013 that additional flexibility would be provided for payment adjustments and hardship ex-ceptions. For example, eligible professionals (EPs) may request a hardship exception because the EP is unable to control the availability of Certified EHR Technology at one such practice location or a combination of practice locations. MEDICAID INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASES Question. Given American Chiropractic Associations (ACAs) emphasis on patient- centered care and health outcomes, has CMS investigated the efficacy and long-term cost-effectiveness of residential substance abuse treatment services for Medicaid eli-gible recipients? Answer. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has identified ex- isting and, in cooperation with our Federal partners, is developing new resources for States seeking to enhance their efforts to address the service need of individuals with mental and substance use disorders. These resources seek to support States in their efforts to improve benefit design, comply with the Mental Health Parity and Equity Act, develop community integration strategies and coordinate behavioral healthcare with primary care and other services. More information can be found in a Center for Medicaid & CHIP Services Information Bulletin issued on December 3, 2012 (http://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/downloads/CIB-12-03- 12.pdf). Included as part of the Informational Bulletin is information related to the variety of current and new coverage options that States may use to cover behavioral health services. PACKAGING RULE Question. In its 2014 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Rule, CMS modified its packaging policy. Under Medicare's previous packaging policy, a drug or biologic that is used 100 percent of the time, or costs less than $90, may be pack-aged in a payment to hospitals to cover healthcare items and services in a proce-dure. The revised policy allows packaged payments in cases in which the drug or biologic is used less than 100 percent of the time or when its cost exceeds $90. The 280 decision on which treatment to use is at the clinical discretion of the physician and is incorporated into the single payment the hospital receives from Medicare. How will CMS ensure the accuracy of its cost data in the absence of a require- ment that hospitals report what drug or biologic is used within the package pay-ment? Is CMS planning to conduct audits or implement a mechanism to ensure hos-pitals accurately reporting data? Also, is CMS concerned about the effect this rule will have on bladder cancer screening and treatment? Answer. In general, multiple drugs may or may not be used for a given service and the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) payment for that service reflects the average of all potential ancillary items and services used to fur-nish the primary procedure. The OPPS has never had a requirement that a drug is used 100 percent of the time with the primary procedure into which the drug pay-ment is packaged. In the calendar year 2014 OPPS/ambulatory surgery center (ASC) final rule, for the vast majority of drugs and biologicals, we continued our tradi-tional methodology for packaging drugs and biologicals with a per unit cost under a $1 threshold of $90, which is adjusted each year to reflect changes in nominal prices. We also finalized packaging all drugs for the following categories of products: (1) Drugs, biologicals, and radiopharmaceuticals that function as supplies when used in a diagnostic test or procedure; and (2) drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure. Adopting these packaging policies followed our longstanding policy of packaging radiopharmaceuticals and contrast agents into the associated imaging test. In order to help ensure the accuracy of cost data, CMS expects hospitals to cor- rectly report the items and services provided to patients according to correct coding principles. CMS provides coding guidance every year in our annual OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period and in several sections of our online CMS Manuals. For example, CMS specifically provides the following coding guidance in the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, chapter 4, section 10.4 A: ''[I]t is extremely important that hospitals report all HCPCS codes consistent with their descriptors; CPT and/ or CMS instructions and correct coding principles, and all charges for all services they furnish, whether payment for the services is made separately paid or is pack-aged.'' We are monitoring the effects of our 2014 packaging policies. However, because these policies became effective January 1, 2014, not enough time has elapsed with these policies in effect for us to meaningfully evaluate their effect. We are confident that Medicare beneficiaries have access to adequate bladder cancer diagnosis and treatment services and we will continue to examine these services as we do all other services through our annual rulemaking process. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN Question. CMS has used public reporting of hospitals' performance on certain measures including 30 day outcomes, surgical complications, and healthcare associ-ated infections to inform the public about a hospital's performance on these and other important metrics. Public reporting encourages hospitals to improve their per-formance and quality because they know that they are being compared by their po-tential patients. Do you think that public reporting of hospitals' prescription drug dispensement can help encourage more thoughtful and appropriate prescribing behavior? Answer. Under the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) program, hospitals report a variety of quality measures, most of which are publicly displayed on Hos-pital Compare. These measures encompass a wide variety of topics, including mor-tality measures, readmissions measures, healthcare-associated infection measures, survey measures of patients' experience of care, and measures of timely and effec-tive care. It is possible that a hospital prescription drug dispensement measure could help encourage appropriate prescribing behavior, but the details of any such measure would need to be carefully evaluated as part of the measure consideration process that CMS has adopted. CMS considers additions to measures for the Hospital IQR program every year and conducts its measurement activities in a transparent man-ner, which involves the solicitation of input from multiple stakeholders. The proc-esses that have been established to solicit such input throughout the measure devel-opment, selection, and implementation cycle include posting calls on the CMS Web site for nominations for technical expert panels; posting proposed or candidate meas-ures on the CMS Web site for public comment; holding CMS Open Door forums, publicly posting measures being considered by December 1 each year as part of the 281 pre-rulemaking process; engaging the National Quality Forum through their Meas- ures Application Partnership to make recommendations on measures; soliciting com-ments through rulemaking on proposed measures; and soliciting suggestions through rulemaking on potential future measures. Question. Do you think that providers are prescribing more and engaging in more testing because they feel a pressure to satisfy their patients? Answer. Many different factors can contribute to overprescribing of medications. CMS has proposed improvements to the Medicare Part D program to address con-cerns about overprescribing and other abusive practices. These improvements in-clude giving CMS the authority to revoke a physician or eligible professional's Medi-care enrollment if CMS determines that he or she has a pattern or practice of pre-scribing that is abusive, represents a threat to the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries, or otherwise fails to meet Medicare requirements. CMS will also be able to revoke a physician or eligible professional's Medicare enrollment if his or her Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Certificate of Registration is suspended or revoked, or if the applicable licensing or administrative body for any State in which he or she practices suspends or revokes his or her ability to prescribe drugs. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JERRY MORAN RATE STABILIZATION PROGRAMS Question. Does the Secretary have the authority to make payments from the Risk Corridor fund? If not, how will the administration pay for a possible funding gap? Answer. Risk corridor payments can be made pursuant to section 1342 of the Af- fordable Care Act and longstanding CMS user fee authority provided in appropria-tions acts. Question. If the Secretary does have the authority to make payments from the Risk Corridor fund, how will any surpluses in receipts from the program be used? Specifically, could a surplus be used for Program Management activities? Answer. We intend to implement the risk corridors program in a budget neutral manner over the 3 years of the program. HHS issued guidance in April clarifying its plan to hold any excess risk corridor collections from 1 year to the next to be available to make risk corridor payments in subsequent years as set out in law and regulations. Question. What will happen if the incoming receipts for Risk Corridor, Risk Ad- justment, and Reinsurance programs are less than the Department's projected esti-mates? Answer. If reinsurance collections are not sufficient to fund the reinsurance pay- ment pool, all payments will be reduced pro-rata to fall within collections received. The proposed rule entitled, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Exchange and Insurance Market Standards for 2015 and Beyond (79 FR 15808 March 21, 2014) proposed that\u2014in the event that collections are less than projected esti-mates\u2014CMS would prioritize reinsurance contributions collected to the reinsurance payment pool to assure that the pool is sufficient to provide the premium stabiliza-tion benefits intended by the statute. Under the risk adjustment methodology, risk adjustment charges will be equal to risk adjustment payments and the program will net to zero. We anticipate that risk corridors collections will be sufficient to pay for all risk corridors payments over the life of the 3-year program. However, in the unlikely event of a shortfall for the 2015 program year, we recognize that the Affordable Care Act requires us to make full payments to issuers. In that event, we would use other sources of funding for the risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of appropriations. We will provide additional specificity in future guidance or rule-making as necessary. Question. When will CMS start making payments under the Risk Corridor, Risk Adjustment, and Reinsurance programs? Answer. We anticipate payments for these programs will first be made in the summer of 2015 for the 2014 plan year. EXCHANGE ENROLLMENT Question. How many previously uninsured Americans have enrolled in the Ex- changes? Answer. In addition to the more than 8 million people who have selected plans through the Marketplace during the initial open enrollment period, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently estimated that 5 million people will have purchased coverage outside of the Marketplace in Affordable Care Act-compliant plans. More-282 over, recent national surveys indicate that the number of Americans with health in- surance coverage is growing, and the number of 18 to 64 year olds who are unin-sured is declining. For example, Gallup has found an almost 5 percentage point de-crease in the uninsured rate for adults (18 and over) from the third quarter of 2014 to April 2014 (18 percent versus 13 percent, respectively). Similarly, the Urban In-stitute estimates a 2.7 percentage point decrease in the uninsured rate for adults (18 to 64) between September 2013 and 2014 (corresponding to a 5.4 million decline in the number of uninsured adults). Meanwhile, the RAND Corporation estimates a 4.7 percentage point decrease in the uninsured rate (corresponding to a net de-crease of 9.3 million uninsured adults, ages of 18 to 64) between September 2013 and March 2014. Question. Since only 28 percent of the new enrollees represent the young, healthy population, how will the Marketplace avoid the so called ''death spiral'' or significant spikes in premiums in 2015? Answer. Consistent with expectations, through the end of 2014 open enrollment, the proportion of young adults (ages 18 to 34) who have selected a Marketplace plan through the State Based Marketplaces (SBMs) and Federally-Facilitated Market-places (FFMs) has remained strong. We expect that the robust sign-up numbers we are observing in the Marketplace's first year\u20148 million at the close of 2014 open enrollment\u2014will encourage insurers to compete on price for consumers during next year's open enrollment period. In addition, provisions of the Affordable Care Act, in-cluding rate review and the medical loss ratio rule, will help protect consumers against unfair rate hikes. Question. What is the percentage of enrollees that have actually paid their pre- miums to date? Answer. CMS and the Department have a longstanding focus on transparency and accuracy. When CMS has accurate and reliable data regarding premium payments, we will see that this information is available. However, we do know that some issuers have made public statements indicating that 80 percent to 90 percent of the people who have selected a Marketplace plan have made premium payments. It is also important to note that issuers have the flexibility to determine when premium payments are due. EXCHANGE COST Question. How did the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) come up with the $1.8 billion estimate necessary to operate the Marketplace for fiscal year 2015? Answer. As with all of our budget requests, the fiscal year 2015 Marketplace re- quest represents an assessment of needs based on the costs of existing contracts, as well as new functions that will be implemented in fiscal year 2015. Question. What happens if the Department does not receive the projected $1.2 bil- lion in Marketplace user fees? Answer. Millions of Americans have already gained quality, affordable insurance coverage through the Marketplace, and funding continued operations is one of my highest priorities. In line with the 2015 President's budget, we expect to collect $1.2 billion in user fees from issuers participating in the Federal Marketplace in fiscal year 2015. The Department's fiscal year 2015 request is critical to carry out the De-partment's responsibilities to fund Marketplace operations. Question. In fiscal year 2014, the Department estimated $450 million in Market- place user fees. Did CMS meet that estimate? Answer. User fees for the federally facilitated Marketplace were first collected in January 2014 to align with the first month of Marketplace coverage. We are still working on updating user fee projections for fiscal year 2014, which will be based on recent enrollment and premium data gathered from the initial enrollment period. STATE -BASED EXCHANGE REPLACEMENT COSTS Question. Does the Department plan to provide funds to purchase replacement IT systems for the failed State-based Exchanges like Oregon? And if so, where will this funding come from? Answer. CMS is working with States on addressing the implementation chal- lenges with their State-based Marketplace. CMS will be implementing contingency plans to smoothly and effectively assume the Marketplace functions for any States that are unable to demonstrate readiness to continued operation of their Market- place. Question. Will the Department plan to recoup some of these funds from contrac- tors who failed to deliver a working system? 283 Answer. We need to determine what went wrong and why (and in States where things are going right understand that too). In those States where Federal Govern-ment and taxpayer funds were misused, we need to use all available avenues to get those funds back for the taxpayer. Finally, we need to make sure that ensure that those who should be receiving access to quality, affordable healthcare through those States receive that access. CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS Question. When will the Committee receive the list of Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) affected by the 10-mile rule that was requested in the fiscal year 2014 Om-nibus? Answer. CMS is in the process of obtaining a new software package that will allow us to produce the list as requested by the committee. We will work to provide the list to your staff as quickly as possible. Question. How will the proposals regarding CAHs in the fiscal year 2015 budget request affect access to healthcare for Americans living in rural communities? Answer. The proposals in the President's budget are aimed at preserving bene- ficiary access while promoting payment efficiency. These proposals narrowly tar-geted and designed to improve efficiency while preserving access to care. CMS does not expect either proposal would have any significant adverse impact on rural access to care. Question. How many hospitals will be at risk of losing their designation based on these CAH proposals? Answer. Currently, when making a determination of a Critical Access Hospital's (CAH) satisfying the statutory location requirements concerning proximity to an-other CAH or a hospital, CMS starts by using online driving directions programs (such as Google maps) to calculate the number of driving miles to other CAHs or hospitals. CMS also considers any evidence to the contrary that the CAH chooses to submit before making its determination. Any list would preliminary estimate only based on the initial policy proposal. A final determination of the effect on the status of any particular CAH would be determined on a case-by-case basis and would de-pend on the legislative language and implementing regulations. RECOVERY AUDIT CONTRACTORS Question. What is the current status of the new Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) contracts? Please provide details on the new incremental changes that RAC auditors will have to follow under the terms of the new contracts. Answer. CMS is currently in the procurement process for the next round of Recov- ery Audit Program contracts and plans to award these contracts this year. In Feb-ruary 2014, CMS announced a number of changes to the Recovery Audit Program that will take effect with the new contract awards as a result of stakeholder feed-back. CMS believes that improvements to the RAC program will result in a more effective and efficient program, including improved accuracy, less provider burden, and more program transparency. Question. When will the Department's Working Group on the RAC program pro- pose its recommendations? Answer. The Department has formed an intra-agency workgroup with representa- tives from CMS, Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA), and the Depart-mental Appeals Board (DAB) tasked with developing recommendations to improve the Medicare appeals process and address the significant backlog of appealed claims. We are working diligently to identify short- and long-term solutions to ad-dress the backlog. Question. What is the plan to address the current multiyear backlog at the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals? Answer. The Department has formed an intra-agency workgroup with representa- tives from CMS, OMHA, and the DAB tasked with developing recommendations to improve the Medicare appeals process and address the significant backlog of ap-pealed claims. We are working diligently to identify short- and long-term solutions to address the backlog. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS Question. This is the last year of mandatory funding for Community Health Cen- ters. How has the Department planned for the so-called funding cliff for Community Health Centers? How will the Department prioritize its current budget in the event that no additional mandatory dollars are provided? Answer. As you know, the Affordable Care Act appropriated $11 billion over 5 years in mandatory funding for community health centers, with $1.5 billion avail-284 able to support major construction and renovation at health centers, and the re- maining $9.5 billion available to support ongoing health center operations, establish new health center sites in medically underserved areas, and expand primary care health services at existing health center sites. While the Department has submitted proposals in the past to mitigate the impact of the declining mandatory funding, Congress included language in the fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014 appropria-tions bills directing HHS to obligate all funding available for each respective fiscal year. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget includes a proposal to extend mandatory funding for health centers at $2.7 billion annually over fiscal years 2016-2018, in addition to a discretionary investment. This funding level is projected to support continued operations for over 1,300 health centers with nearly 9,500 primary care sites. The President has not yet submitted a discretionary budget for fiscal year 2016, the year the mandatory Health Center funds will expire. If funding for the Health Center Program is significantly lower in fiscal year 2016 compared to the previous year a complex procedure of grant level reductions, and possibly terminations, could occur. This could result in numerous health center sites closing, and a reduction in patients served by health centers. Question. Why did the fiscal year 2015 budget proposal not attempt to offset the funding cliff with discretionary funding? Answer. The budget includes a proposal to continue mandatory funding for health centers in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018 at $2.7 billion per year, for a total in-vestment of $8.1 billion. The President has not yet submitted a discretionary budget for fiscal year 2016, the year the mandatory Health Center funds will expire. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD C. S HELBY HEATHCARE .GOV BACKEND SYSTEMS Question. What is the status of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) appeals system? Has the backlog been resolved? Where are the funds coming from to pay for the computer based infrastructure used to review these claims? Answer. Consumers applying for health coverage in the Marketplace receive an eligibility determination that informs them whether or not they are qualified to pur-chase coverage through the Marketplace or receive financial assistance. Consumers who disagree with the determination may request an appeal. CMS first attempts to resolve the appeal directly with the consumer through in- formal resolution, which involves contacting the consumer as expeditiously as pos-sible to work through the consumer's concerns. This approach has worked particu-larly well for consumers who filed appeals early in the open enrollment period, be-fore system errors were corrected. Many of these consumers have since been able to successfully enroll in a qualified health plan and have withdrawn their appeals. CMS prioritizes medically urgent appeals, and as a result, is working to resolve those appeals as quickly as possible. CMS is now holding hearings for those cases that are not otherwise resolved through an informal process. Question. Provide an update on how much of the healthcare.gov backend remains incomplete including the automatic payment system. What are the current problems with completing this task and the timeline for resolving the issues? Answer. As CMS has said, the automated payment and reporting system between issuers and CMS is not complete or fully tested. CMS has an interim process for paying issuers that are owed Marketplace financial assistance in the form of Ad-vanced Premium Tax Credits (APTC) or Center for Scientific Review (CSR) pay-ments. Under this interim process, issuers who are owed payments submit initial, aggregate information on a monthly basis in order to receive Marketplace financial assistance payments. This data includes preliminary total effectuated enrollments, enrollees receiving Marketplace financial assistance, and the estimated amount owed to the issuer, all of which are subject to change and unconfirmed by CMS. On a monthly basis, CMS compares the effectuated enrollment counts submitted by the issuers to the enrollment counts generated from the FFM for individual market issuers. These data and payments will be further reconciled once the automated payment and reporting system is in place. The automatic payment system is a pri-ority for CMS. NAVIGATORS Question. How many Navigators have been hired? 285 Answer. HHS does not directly hire Navigators. The Affordable Care Act requires that each Marketplace, including the federally facilitated and State Partnership Marketplaces, establish a program under which it awards grants to Navigators. In August 2013, CMS, as operator of the federally facilitated and State Partnership Marketplaces, awarded Navigator grants to 105 grantees to provide Navigator serv-ices to consumers in those Marketplaces in 2013-2014. The CMS Navigator grant-ees represent a broad and diverse segment of stakeholders. Each Navigator grantee is responsible for determining staffing levels that would be appropriate for meeting the terms and conditions of their grants. Over the course of Open Enrollment, more than 28,000 in-person assisters, including Navigators, were trained, and they reached more than 2.4 million consumers through events, outreach activities, and storefront locations. Question. With the ACA enrollment period closed, have these people been laid off (i.e. are they temporary employees)? If not, what will the Navigators be doing until the next enrollment period? Answer. Staffing levels and deployment are determined by CMS Navigator grant- ees in a manner that best enables the grantee to fulfill the terms and conditions of the Navigator grant. Question. How much funding from fiscal year 2014 will be allocated to the Naviga- tors' program? Answer. The Funding Opportunity Announcement for Navigators in the federally facilitated and State Partnership Marketplaces for 2014-2015 has not yet been re-leased. Question. How much funding do you expect to allocate to the Navigators' program in fiscal year 2015? Answer. Funding decisions related to the Navigator program in the federally fa- cilitated and State Partnership Marketplaces for fiscal year 2015 have not yet been made. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JOHN BOOZMAN Question. According to title XVIII of the Social Security Act, in order for a hospital to continue to participate in the Medicare program, it must meet all of the statutory provisions of section 1861(e) of this Act. This section defines a hospital as an institu-tion that ' '...i s primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatient s... diagnostic services and therapeutic services.'' With no statutory or regulatory definition of ''primarily engaged'' in reference to inpatients treated at hospitals, what criteria and/or specific recognized quantitative method(s) is CMS using to determine whether a hospital meets the statutory provi-sions of 1861(e) of the Social Security Act? Answer. CMS has not yet identified any quantitative method, such as percentage of services or ratio of inpatient-to-outpatient services, which could solely be used to determine whether a facility is primarily engaged in furnishing services to inpa-tients. CMS has heard from stakeholders that a fixed standard might exclude cer-tain rural hospitals. Therefore, CMS continues to interpret the phrase ''primarily engaged'' on a case-by-case basis to consider the facts and circumstances of each fa-cility. Question. In Arkansas, safety net hospitals have been subject to overly aggressive contractors denying an overwhelming number of claims based on minor technical-ities or the contractor's own inaccuracies. Are you aware of this issue? If so, what is being done to address and/or correct these situations? Answer. CMS uses the Recovery Auditors to perform medical review to identify and correct Medicare improper payments primarily on a post payment basis. CMS uses the vulnerabilities identified by the Recovery Auditors to implement actions that will prevent future improper payments nationwide. Since full implementation in fiscal year 2010 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Recovery Audi-tors have returned over $7.4 billion to the Medicare Trust Fund. To ensure the accuracy of the Recovery Auditor's claim determinations, CMS uses an independent validation contractor to review a monthly random sample of claims on which the Recovery Auditors has made an improper payment determination. The Recovery Audit Validation Contractor (RVC) establishes an annual accuracy score for each Recovery Auditor. The RVC employs policy experts and clinicians, and pre-sents CMS with an independent decision regarding each sample. The accuracy score represents how often the Recovery Auditors were accurately determining overpay-ments or underpayments based on the validation contractor's review. In fiscal year 2012, all Recovery Auditors had a cumulative accuracy score of 92 percent or higher. 286 CMS is currently in the procurement process for the next round of Recovery Audit Program contracts and plans to award these contracts this year. In February 2014, CMS announced a number of changes to the Recovery Audit Program that will take effect with the new contract awards as a result of stakeholder feedback. CMS be-lieves that improvements to the RAC program will result in a more effective and efficient program, including improved accuracy, less provider burden, and more pro-gram transparency. Question. What does CMS do when an overly aggressive contractor review threat- ens the financial solvency of a longstanding Medicare provider? Specifically, do you assist in the navigation of the appeals process, and do you encourage attempts to be creative to achieve an alternative resolution? Answer. Providers who disagree with a Recovery Auditor improper payment deter- mination may utilize the multilevel administrative appeals process. Recovery Audit appeals follow the same appeal process as other Medicare claim determinations. However, CMS is sensitive to the concerns of the provider and supplier commu- nities and continues to work with these communities to reduce the burden of the review process. The CMS has imposed additional documentation request limits on the number of medical records a Recovery Auditor may request in a 45-day time-frame. The limits establish continuity and help providers prepare for potential au-dits, as well as encourage the Recovery Auditors to select only those claims with the highest risk of improper payment. The limits and the acceptance of electronic health records help to minimize the time necessary to respond to Recovery Auditor requests and offers another alternative for providers to safely and quickly transport the documentation. The CMS understands that additional staffing is often required to address Recovery Auditor correspondence and it is constantly working to ensure providers can respond to requests without affecting beneficiary care. Each Recovery Auditor has a customer service center with representatives avail- able to address provider concerns. They are required to have a quality assurance program to ensure that all customers receive professional and knowledgeable assist-ance with timely follow-up when necessary. Personnel are required to return tele-phone calls within 1 day, respond to electronic inquiries within 2 days, and respond to written requests within 30 days. The Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) are also available to address any Recovery Audit Program questions dealing with claims adjustment, recoupment, and appeals. If a provider is experiencing fi-nancial hardship, the MAC may be able to approve an extended repayment plan for the provider. CMS works across the agency to minimize provider burden. These efforts include ensuring that claims reviewed by one entity are not reviewed by another contractor again, unless there is a concern of potential fraud. CMS also works to ensure that multiple review entities such as Recovery Auditors, Medicare Administrative Con-tractors, and Zone Program Integrity Contractors are not reviewing the same pro- viders and the same topics at the same time. CMS is exploring additional options to help providers navigate through the audit process. Initiatives include enhancing CMS Web sites with consolidated contractor information, standardizing documenta-tion request letters, and standardizing medical review timeframes. The CMS under-stands that some providers utilize additional staffing to help manage the require-ments of the Recovery Audit Program and is constantly working to streamline pro-gram operations as much as possible. Question. Are you aware that Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) contractors are denying claims based on minor documentation technicalities, which is explicitly pro-hibited by the RAC Statement of Work? If so, how are you striving to correct this problem? Answer. CMS regularly evaluates the Recovery Auditors' performance and adher- ence to the requirements in their Statement of Work. Staff members go on location to observe medical reviewers, IT systems, and customer service areas. When onsite visits are not possible, CMS conducts desk audits on claims to confirm that all as-pects of the review process were completed correctly and accounted for in the Data Warehouse. Regular meetings with claims processing contractors, provider groups, and other stakeholders are also monitored for additional contractor oversight. If there are any findings in these evaluations, CMS notifies the Recovery Auditor and requires a corrective action plan. The results of these regular evaluations are con-solidated annually in the Contractor Performance Assessment Rating System (CPARS) for an overall performance rating for the year. These results are available to all Federal agencies. CMS believes that regular contractor oversight is essential to the success of the Recovery Audit Program. In addition, CMS uses the Recovery Audit Validation Contractor mentioned in the response to the first question to en-sure Recovery Auditors are identifying accurate improper payments based on Medi-care policy. 287 Question. Does CMS expect its contractors to agree to meet in-person with pro- viders who have been the subject of an aggressive review of claims and a significant number of inappropriate denials? Answer. After notification of an improper payment, providers may request a dis- cussion with the Recovery Auditors regarding their claim determinations. The dis-cussion period offers providers the opportunity to discuss concerns about the deter-mination with the Recovery Auditor Medical Director and submit additional docu-mentation relevant to the determination to substantiate their claims. It also allows the Recovery Auditors to review the additional information without the provider having to file an appeal. If the Recovery Auditor reverses its claim determination, it will stop the claim from being adjusted, or work with the MAC to reverse the ad-justment if it has already occurred. Each Recovery Auditor has a customer service center with representatives avail- able to address provider concerns. They are required to have a quality assurance program to ensure that all customers receive professional and knowledgeable assist-ance with timely follow-up when necessary. Personnel are required to return tele-phone calls within 1 day, respond to electronic inquiries within 2 days, and respond to written requests within 30 days. The MACs are also available to address any Re-covery Audit Program questions dealing with claims adjustment, recoupment, and appeals. CMS is exploring additional options to help providers navigate through the audit process. Initiatives include enhancing CMS Web sites with consolidated contractor information, standardizing documentation request letters, and standardizing med-ical review timeframes. The CMS understands that some providers utilize additional staffing to help manage the requirements of the Recovery Audit Program and is con-stantly working to streamline program operations as much as possible. Question. In the recently released fiscal year 2012 Recovery Auditor Report, CMS reports data as of the first level of appeal. What does CMS do to assess the accuracy of data cited by contractors? Answer. The fiscal year 2012 Recovery Auditor Report, in Appendix L includes in- formation on the number of appeals at the first 4 levels of appeals, including the (1) Medicare Administrative Contractor, (2) Qualified Independent Contractors, (3) Administrative Law Judge (within the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, an agency independent of CMS), and (4) the Departmental Appeals Board. The data re-ported in the Report to Congress is gathered by CMS with assistance from the Of-fice of Medicare Hearings and Appeals and the Departmental Appeals Board. All collections and appeals data cited in the Report to Congress is CMS data and not contingent on Recovery Auditor data. To ensure the accuracy of the Recovery Auditor's claim determinations, CMS uses an independent validation contractor to review a monthly random sample of claims on which the Recovery Auditors has made an improper payment determination. The Recovery Audit Validation Contractor (RVC) establishes an annual accuracy score for each Recovery Auditor. The RVC employs policy experts and clinicians, and pre-sents CMS with an independent decision regarding the sample. The accuracy score represents how often the Recovery Auditors were accurately determining overpay-ments or underpayments based on the validation contractor's review. In fiscal year 2012, all Recovery Auditors had a cumulative accuracy score of 92 percent or higher. Question. CMS announced in February that it will require RACs to adjust the Ad- ditional Documentation Requests (ADRs) to levels in line with the provider's denial rate, allowing providers with low denial rates to have lower ADR limits and pro-viders with high denial rates to have higher limits. Although it is yet to be deter-mined whether this change will alleviate provider burden as there is disagreement over the accuracy of RAC denial rates, I would urge the Agency to continue to pur-sue changes that ensure the RAC program targets improper payments while taking into consideration the overall burden on providers. Does the Agency have further plans to require such flexibility and reasonableness in the RAC program? Answer. CMS is currently in the procurement process for the next round of Recov- ery Audit Program contracts and plans to award these contracts this year. In Feb-ruary 2014, CMS announced a number of changes to the Recovery Audit Program that will take effect with the new contract awards as a result of stakeholder feed-back. CMS believes that improvements to the RAC program will result in a more effective and efficient program, including improved accuracy, less provider burden, and more program transparency. 288 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED TO MARK H. G REENBERG QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD J. D URBIN HEAD START Question. In fiscal year 2014, Congress restored the 5.27 percent reduction Head Start grantees received in fiscal year 2013 due to sequestration with the expectation that grantees would use the funds to restore services to pre-sequestration levels. In some cases, especially in rural Illinois, restoration of services to exactly match pre- sequestration enrollment slots or other service levels may be impossible or no longer the best use of funds due to reduction in population or other changing needs of the community. How is the Department working with local grantees to provide flexi-bility to ensure the much needed restored resources are being used to best serve the local community? Answer. The Office of Head Start (OHS) communicated to grantees the expecta- tion that they use the 5.27 percent Congress appropriated to restore the number of funded enrollment slots, the number of days or weeks in the program year, or the other cuts programs made to absorb the reduction. We asked grantees to work with their Regional Office if there are circumstances that make full restoration of serv-ices or slots challenging. As the Senator noted, there are situations where it is no longer possible or the best use of funds to restore exactly what was cut. For exam-ple, some grantees no longer have access to the facility where they provided center- based care prior to sequestration or the needs of the community have changed, such as declining population or expanded pre-school services through other providers. In these cases, Regional Offices are working with grantees to explore other service en-hancements to meet the needs of the community. If the grantee can only restore a portion of the slots that were cut, for example, Regional Offices engage in discus-sions on extending the hours or days of service as an alternative. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JERRY MORAN HEAD START Question. How will the Administration on Children and Families ensure that Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership funding reaches rural States like Kansas? Answer. We anticipate a robust nationwide competition, including rural States and communities. Funding is available within each State based on the number of young children in poverty and HHS hopes to fund high-quality applications from all 50 States. UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN PROGRAM Question. The budget request did not provide an increase for the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program, knowing that the number of children coming into the country illegally would increase this year. Therefore, what HHS programs do you suggest we reduce to address this shortfall? Answer. The fiscal year 2015 budget requested $868 million for the UAC program, consistent with the level provided in the fiscal year 2014 enacted bill, given the high degree of uncertainty around the program's future needs. However, the budget also proposed over $2.2 billion in discretionary program terminations and reductions at the Department. We appreciate the additional funding provided in the fiscal year 2015 bill reported out by the subcommittee as well as the enhanced authority to draw on other resources in the Department as needed. Question. After appropriating a $510 million increase in the fiscal year 2014 Om- nibus for the UAC program, the subcommittee requested that HHS coordinate with the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Justice in an effort to develop strategies for managing the rising cost of HHS' program. What proposals have been developed to reduce funding increases for this program in the future? Answer. HHS has been coordinating with State, DHS, DOJ, and OMB on strate- gies to stem the flow of UAC, reduce the length of stay, and otherwise reduce costs. HHS efforts, in coordination with other Departments, have already reduced length of stay (from 75 days to 35 days) and costs, producing a 56 percent reduction in per capita shelter costs from 2011 to 2014. The Departments have also identified several strategies that are currently under consideration for feasibility of implementation. These strategies include: \u2014Modified approach to children with non-parent relatives\u2014to not treat some chil- dren that are apprehended at the border with a non-parent relative as a UAC, 289 and to develop alternate procedures for children apprehended throughout the interior of the U.S., if residing with a relative at the time of apprehension. \u2014Modified approach to youth with serious criminal offenses, for whom release to a parent or sponsor is not appropriate. \u2014Speeding up voluntary departure. \u2014Developing improved transportation services\u2014DHS and HHS are exploring whether an integrated transportation system could reduce costs while maintain-ing sufficient protections for children. \u2014Developing a shared services model. \u2014DHS and HHS are exploring a plan for a co-located site, which may yield sav- ings. EVALUATION TAP Question. How was it determined that an increase in the Evaluation Tap was nec- essary for fiscal year 2015? Answer. The Public Health Service (PHS) Evaluation Set-Aside is authorized by section 241 of the PHS Act, which has been amended in appropriations bills, to fund activities across HHS like AHRQ and CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. These funds are used to support critical public health and evaluation activities across HHS. Congress sets both the tap percentage and the usage of funds for the purposes specified in law. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget proposes an in-crease of the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside from 2.5 percent to 3 percent, consistent with the approach taken in the fiscal year 2014 President's budget, and trans-parently reports how this funding would be used, both in program level totals and in appropriations language. Question. Please explain what deliberations take place within HHS and with the White House when deciding which agencies are to be the sources and receivers of Evaluation Tap transfers. Answer. The PHS Act Set-Aside is authorized by section 241 of the PHS Act, which has been amended in appropriations bills and allows HHS to assess a per-centage of PHS Act authorized program funding to support activities across the De-partment. Historically, activities are excluded from the set-aside because they are not PHS Act authorized, they support program management, or they have been con-sciously excluded by Congress (e.g., the SAMHSA block grants). The Department ex-amines sources and receivers during the annual budget process and Congress sets both the tap percentage and the usage of funds for the purposes specified in law. Question. Why does the Department use a budget gimmick to highlight an in- crease of $200 million for NIH, even though NIH is left with only a $58 million in-crease above fiscal year 2014 after accounting for the tap increase? Answer. The Public Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside plays a critical role sup- porting key public health programs and Congress sets both the tap percentage and the usage of funds for the purposes specified in law. As with most of the Depart-ment's other public health agencies, NIH contributes its mathematical share of re-sources to the PHS Evaluation Fund. QUESTION SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD C. S HELBY CHILDREN 'S HOSPITAL GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION & NEW WORKFORCE INITIATIVE Question. The new Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (GME) pro- gram sets-aside $100 million for children's hospitals. Children's hospitals were fund-ed at $265 million in fiscal year 2014. Why is the Children's GME program targeted for such a significant reduction? Currently, the Children's GME is distributed by a formula-based payment. Within the new $530 million workforce initiative, only $100 million will be distributed to children's hospitals using the current formula. Children's hospitals along with all teaching hospitals will be eligible to compete for the remaining $430 million. How will children's hospitals continue to train physicians when they will only receive a small percentage of their prior formula-based payments and are not successful in the new competition? The National Health Service Corps and Targeted Support for GME programs are described with a focus on increasing the number of physicians in rural and other underserved areas. How will HHS accomplish this objective? Answer. The Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Program will be integrated into the new, competitive community-based Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education Program which will expand residency slots, with a focus on ambulatory and preventive care in order to advance the goal of higher 290 value healthcare that reduces long-term costs. To support the transition of CHGME into the new program, the budget includes $100 million of mandatory funding per year for 2 years to support the Children's Hospital GME Program to be allocated using the existing formula. In addition, these hospitals will be able to apply for the competitive funding to support pediatric residency training through the new Tar-geted Support for Graduate Medical Education Program. The Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education Program will continue to support graduate medical education in children's hospitals. The program includes a $100 million set-aside for 2 years to be distributed to children's hospitals using the current CHGME formula and they can compete for additional funding. While HRSA can't estimate the number of FTEs supported in Children's Hospitals in the TSGME program until a FOA is released and awards are made, HRSA supports efforts to train providers who treat children outside of the hospital setting, as well as current service delivery to children. \u2014NHSC, through both scholarship and loan repayment programs, supported 540 pediatricians, pediatric nurse practitioners, pediatric dentists, and child psychi-atrists to serve in HPSAs (as of September 2013). \u2014Currently, there are nearly 100 students, residents, and health providers spe- cializing in the health of children and preparing to go into practice and are re-ceiving support from these programs. \u2014HRSA also funds the PC Residency Expansion program, which currently sup- ports 14 pediatric residencies to increase the number of resident positions for 5 years, from 2010-2015, adding well over 100 new pediatricians to the work-force. \u2014And also relevant to access to care for children, in 2012, health centers treated more than 6.6 million patients under the age of 18; in fact, nearly 32 percent of all health center patients are children. The Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education Program will focus specifi- cally on key priorities for workforce development and transforming the healthcare delivery system. For example, the program will focus on increasing training opportu-nities in community-based settings, including in rural and underserved areas. Appli-cants will need to demonstrate that they provide diverse training experiences that will help ensure that we are training future physicians in the settings where we know patients get the bulk of their care, as well as being trained in the models of healthcare delivery that are most effective. This will help ensure that HRSA funds residencies that are likely to produce primary care practitioners who would work in rural and underserved areas, where the need is the greatest. In fiscal year 2015, HRSA expects to fund over 10,000 new National Health Serv- ices Corps loan repayment awards in order to build and sustain a field strength of 15,000 primary care providers across the country, serving the primary care needs of more than 16 million patients in high-need rural, urban, and frontier areas across the United States. In fiscal year 2013, 100 percent of all new National Health Serv-ices Corps loan repayment awards were made to those serving in health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) of highest need (scores of 14 or higher) and nearly half of National Health Services Corps clinicians are serving at rural sites. A 2012 retention assessment survey found that 55 percent of National Health Service Corps clinicians continue to practice in underserved areas 10 years after completing their service commitment. Another recent study completed in fiscal year 2013 showed 85 percent of those who had fulfilled their service commitment re-mained in service to the underserved in the short-term. Short-term is defined as up to 2 years after their service completion. HRSA continues to provide support to clinicians who practice in underserved areas. For example, HRSA has several social media outreach efforts to keep clini-cians apprised of program updates and events, as well as networks to provide addi-tional local resources for clinicians serving in underserved communities. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED TO THOMAS R. F RIEDEN , M.D., M.P.H QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR TOMHARKIN PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERDOSE Question. Our country is facing a major public health problem regarding the in- creasing use, and abuse, of prescription painkillers. In the past two decades, pre-scriptions for opioid painkillers in the U.S. nearly tripled to over 200 million per year. Just last month, a study reported that one in five women on Medicaid used prescription opioids during pregnancy. How will the funding you requested in the 291 President's budget address the prescribing patterns of doctors regarding opioid pain- killers? Answer. Prescription opioid overdoses quadrupled in the United States between 1999 and 2010. During this same time period, the amount of prescription opioids prescribed in the United States also quadrupled. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified two factors that account for a large percentage of pre-scription opioid overdoses: (1) patients receiving opioids from multiple prescribers and/or pharmacies and (2) increased number of prescriptions for high daily doses of opioids. As the Nation's public health agency, CDC focuses on prevention, and pre-vention of this epidemic includes addressing the prescribing practices that fuel pre-scription drug abuse, addiction, and overdose. The President's budget request reflects CDC's focus on prescribing. The initiative will deliver the resources and expertise to funded States to address prescribing prac-tices that are driving this epidemic. The $15.6 million proposed would expand the existing Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program (Core VIPP) funds to support State health department injury programs to (1) strengthen their ability to track and monitor prescribing and overdose trends, (2) build out effective insurance strategies to identify and stop inappropriate prescribing, and (3) enhance prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to equip doctors and pharmacists with the informa-tion they need to protect their patients. Sixteen of the currently funded 20 States currently use this funding to address problem prescribing in important and innovative ways. For example, States are im-proving or evaluating Medicaid patient review and restriction programs, protecting patients at the highest risk for overdose, integrating PDMP with electronic health record systems, or using PDMP data to identify doctors who may be prescribing in-appropriately. LINKAGES WITH CLINICAL CARE Question. In the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus, Congress provided CDC with funding to make big new investments in heart disease, diabetes, and community chronic dis-ease prevention this year. Given all the changes in the healthcare system, please describe how these resources will help link public health and clinical care to prevent and control chronic disease and promote health in our communities. Answer. CDC provides scientific leadership and technical expertise to State, local, tribes/tribal organizations, and U.S. territories to assist them in building capacity to develop and implement chronic disease prevention and health promotion pro-grams that have measureable impact. CDC is focused on implementing cross-cutting strategies to address school health, nutrition and physical activity risk factors, obe-sity, diabetes, heart disease and stroke: (1) conducting epidemiology and surveil-lance, (2) implementing environmental approaches, (3) expanding health system interventions, and (4) enhancing community-clinical linkages. With fiscal year 2014 funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, CDC will implement Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) DP14-1422, PPHF 2014: State and Local Public Health Actions to Prevent Obesity, Diabetes, and Heart Disease and Stroke. CDC is supporting implementation of population-wide approaches to prevent obesity, diabetes, and heart disease and stroke and reduce health disparities. In addition, these new investments target priority population subgroups with uncontrolled high blood pressure and those at high risk for type 2 diabetes that experience racial/ethnic or socioeconomic disparities, including inad-equate access to care, poor quality of care, or low income. This competitive FOA to States and large cities has two components, both of which are designed to address heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Through these efforts, CDC builds on and ex-pands the work funded in ''FOA 13-1305-State Public Health Actions to Prevent and Control Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity, and Associated Risk Factors and Pro-mote School Health''. To specifically address linkages with clinical care, CDC is implementing key inter- ventions such as: \u2014Implementing systems to facilitate identification of patients with undiagnosed hypertension and people with pre-diabetes. \u2014Increasing partnerships to facilitate bi-directional referral between community resources and health systems, including evidence-based lifestyle change pro-grams. \u2014Improving the delivery and use of clinical services by increasing implementation of quality improvement processes in health systems (e.g., fully utilizing elec-tronic health records). 292 \u2014Working to increase the use of team based care in health systems (e.g., increas- ing the use of self-measured blood pressure monitoring in conjunction with clin-ical support). \u2014Increasing the use of community health workers (e.g., patient navigators) in the community to promote linkages between health systems and community re-sources for adults with high blood pressure and adults with pre-diabetes or at high risk for type 2 diabetes and to support self-management of chronic diseases and related risk factors. Such interventions have been shown to result in measurable impacts on heart dis- ease, stroke, and other chronic conditions. The interventions build on the lessons learned implementing coordinated models intended to maximize CDC's investment in the work of State and local departments of health. Using additional non-PPHF funds, CDC will work with awardees to operationalize community health needs as-sessments (CHNAs) as a critical tool in improving health and a tangible opportunity to link communities and health systems, including nonprofit hospitals. Throughout the course of this funding and beyond, CDC will continue to monitor and evaluate longer term outcomes associated with better connections between the public health and the health sector that result from these investments. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD J. D URBIN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Question. Many Americans think of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a reactive agency that works to contain and manage viral epidemics and other public health threats\u2014and it does\u2014but the agency also conducts important proactive research work. What areas of biomedical research are being conducted by CDC? Has past re- search led to any significant health safeguards? How would CDC invest a steady increase in funding to expand and supplement this research? The fiscal year 2015 budget request cuts CDC funding by more than $200 million. What research func-tions will CDC have to suspend as a result of this decrease? Answer. CDC has many unique roles that span the research continuum, as well as a primary role in applying the knowledge gained through research in addressing health threats and making Americans healthier. CDC research provides people the information they need to make healthier choices; provides clinicians with vaccines to protect children against deadly diseases; and gives health systems the tools they need to control healthcare-associated infections. CDC's unique applied research role is in solving real-world problems, and in taking what we learn and know based on research and putting it to work in clinics and communities around the world. As the Nation's public health protection agency, CDC funds and engages in a wide range of research, from laboratory investigations to epidemiologic analyses to pre-vention effectiveness research to clinical trials. A few examples of research con-ducted by CDC include the following: \u2014Through new fiscal year 2014 funding, CDC is increasing its investment in Ad- vanced Molecular Detection technology to use molecular sequencing tools and better develop bioinformatics capacity. These technologies can more rapidly de-liver a greater level of detailed information on infectious pathogens, thereby more quickly identifying and responding to outbreaks, better understanding and controlling antibiotic resistance, and better developing targeted prevention measures. \u2014CDC is the source of much of our knowledge about the population's health, from rigorous surveys and scientific studies. For example, CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) takes measures of nutritional biochemistries, nutrients, toxic chemicals, and other direct biomedical measures to assess the Nation's health. From this and other data from CDC surveys, sci-entists at CDC and elsewhere analyze the relationship between health risk fac-tors and health outcomes. \u2014CDC's laboratories serve as key elements of our Nation's defense against out- breaks, but also generate new knowledge that advances the biomedical sciences. As an example, tobacco laboratories measure addictive and toxic substances in tobacco products and smoke, as well as in the urine and blood of persons who use tobacco or are exposed to secondhand smoke. Similarly, the deadly 1918 in-fluenza virus was safely reconstructed in secure CDC laboratories, using genetic fragments, allowing scientists to better understand influenza genetics and be more prepared to detect new, deadly flu strains. 293 \u2014CDC tracks antibiotic resistance, having last year released the first-ever na- tional report on the burden and threats posed by antibiotic-resistant infections. CDC not only tracks these threats, but also assesses and categorizes their haz-ard level, provides recommendations on preventing the spread of resistance, and addresses gaps in our current knowledge of antibiotic resistance. \u2014CDC has developed a portable and effective light trap to kill mosquitoes and other insect vectors of disease. This trap is being used throughout the world. \u2014Nutrition and chronic disease laboratories develop new or improved methods for measuring nutritional and dietary bioactive compounds to conduct the most comprehensive assessment of the Nation's nutritional status, improve labora-tory measurements to detect micronutrient deficiencies in the United States and developing countries, and operate reference laboratories that ensure the accu-racy of clinical measurements for cardiovascular and other selected chronic dis-eases. Question. Has past research led to any significant health safeguards? Answer. CDC's biomedical and other research has consistently supported the pro- tection and improvement of the public's health. New scientific discoveries lead to the development and refinement of clinical guidelines, health policies, and community programs. CDC identifies new pathogens, and develops new diagnostic tests for their identification by laboratories across the country and the world. Moreover, CDC continually tracks the health of the Nation and the emergence of new health threats, providing recommendations for action and guiding funding decisions else-where. \u2014CDC has contributed significantly to the roughly 63 percent decrease in new do- mestic tuberculosis (TB) cases between 1992 and 2012. Since its inception in 1997, CDC's Tuberculosis Trials Consortium has brought together a number of U.S. research institutions and clinical trials sites around the world to develop new TB treatment and prevention strategies. In 2009, CDC's TB laboratory de-veloped and implemented the Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance Service, a national clinical referral service providing rapid confirmation of multidrug-re-sistant and extensively drug resistant TB. CDC also develops TB prevention and treatment guidelines, such as the recent release of guidelines for the use and safety monitoring of Bedaquiline Fumarate, the newest drug for the treat-ment of multidrug-resistant TB. \u2014CDC's influenza laboratories work to develop vaccines and track changes in the circulation of influenza viruses. These laboratories test influenza viruses from around the world to detect antigenic change, which provides information for pandemic preparedness and vaccine composition decisions. Additionally, they produce seed strains for influenza vaccine development, test the immunogenicity (ability to provide an immune response) of influenza vaccines among humans, and test transmissibility of newly emergent influenza viruses in animal models. \u2014CDC health data collection drives health funding allocations. For instance, CDC provides HIV surveillance data to the HRSA Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. Since fiscal year 2007, HRSA has used total counts of living cases of HIV and living cases of AIDS in the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Program Parts A and B allocation formulae. By providing these data to HRSA, CDC and HRSA are collaborating to ensure that the HIV care and treatment funds are ration-ally distributed according to the Ryan White program legislation. \u2014Chemical threat agents and toxins laboratories support the public health re- sponse to emergencies with around-the-clock laboratory capability to identify human exposure to 150 chemical threat agents within 36 hours. This laboratory system provides support to and proficiency testing for State, local, and terri-torial public health laboratories to maximize national capacity for response to chemical incidents, and develop unique laboratory methods for measuring toxins for diagnosing botulism, anthrax, and ricin poisoning rapidly and accurately. Question. How would CDC invest a steady increase in funding to expand and sup- plement this research? Answer. CDC research is directed to solving real-world problems. Sustained in- creased funding for research would allow to CDC to steadily expand investments in current priorities areas, while also allowing for funding to address emerging health threats. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget includes funding increases for key areas of research, such as: \u2014Antibiotic Resistance .\u2014CDC is proposing to establish a robust national network to deal with this rapidly growing threat to our Nation and the world. Additional funding will enable better detection of the deadliest antibiotic resistance threats and protect patients and communities, saving lives and healthcare costs. 294 \u2014Global Health Security .\u2014All our health security threats are amplified by the globalization of travel and the food supply. MERS is a recent example. CDC will work in partnership with other countries, U.S. Government partners, and global organizations to accelerate progress toward a world safe and secure from infec-tious disease threats. An important element of this proposal is to establish a global laboratory network capable of detecting all public health emergencies of international concern. \u2014Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Public Health Informatics .\u2014The budget re- quest expands CDC's capacity to monitor key health indicators, purchase 12 months of electronic birth records enhanced data, phase in electronic death and birth records, and increase funding for public health systems research. Question. The fiscal year 2015 budget request cuts CDC funding by more than $200 million. What research functions will CDC have to suspend as a result of this decrease? Answer. The President's budget request proposes strategic new investments and identifies targeted reductions that will allow CDC to advance its core public health mission in the most cost-effective manner. In a limited resource environment, the request includes elimination of CDC funding for Occupational Safety and Health Education Research Centers, as well as for the Agricultural, Forestry, and Fishing Sector of the National Occupational Research Agenda. CDC reductions focused pri-marily on eliminating duplicative, less effective, and lower priority programs in order to fund priorities and address urgent public health threats, such as global health security and antimicrobial resistance. TOBACCO AND E -CIGARETTES Question. Smoking causes nearly one in every five deaths in the United States and costs the country $193 billion each year in healthcare expenses and lost produc-tivity. An estimated 43.8 million American adults smoke cigarettes, and about 3,800 young people under the age of 18 smoke their first cigarette every day. Congress created the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a dedicated funding stream for cru-cial investments in prevention for a healthier America, to begin addressing these and other public health challenges. The Fund provides an opportunity to reverse decades of increasing healthcare costs attributable to growing rates of obesity, chronic disease, and other preventable illness. Please summarize investments made through the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to promote tobacco prevention and control. What measurable economic and health benefits have resulted from those investments? A portion of the fund went toward the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tips from Former Smokers campaign. Please summarize the status of this initiative and health and economic benefits of this campaign. If Prevention and Public Health Funds dollars are reallocated toward nonpublic health prevention initiatives, how would that reallocation of funds impact tobacco control and prevention efforts and the returns on those investments? The use and sale of e-cigarettes in the United States has grown significantly over the past decade. According to a recent CDC report, the number of calls to poison centers involving e-cigarette liquids rose from one per month in September 2010 to 215 per month in February 2014. More than half of the calls to poison centers due to e-cigarettes involved young children under age 5, and about 42 percent of the poi-son calls involved people age 20 and older. Please summarize CDC's current and planned research on the public health ef- fects of e-cigarettes? Answer. PPHF-funded tobacco prevention initiatives such as Tips from Former Smokers and quitline support are having substantial impact. Without these invest-ments we would expect to see substantially fewer Americans who have quit smok-ing. Tips From Former Smokers .\u2014The Tips from Former Smokers Campaign is cur- rently in its third year, and will return to the airwaves with new ads in summer 2014. CDC estimates that so far, Tips has led millions of Americans to make a quit attempt, and hundreds of thousands to quit permanently. Because of the strong evi-dence of effectiveness of the Tips campaign, the 2014 Surgeon General's Report rec-ommended ''the following action should be implemented: Counteracting industry marketing by sustaining high impact national media campaigns like the CDC's Tips from Former Smokers campaign and FDA's youth prevention campaigns at a high frequency level and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more.'' On average, annual funding levels have sustained the Tips campaign between 3 and 4 months of each year, and represent less than 3 days of tobacco industry spending on promotion and marketing. Nevertheless, at current levels the funds are 295 having a substantial impact. At a cost of less than $200 per life year saved, Tips is also a highly cost-effective strategy. In contrast, most clinical and preventive interventions cost thousands of dollars per year of life saved. Quitline Support .\u2014PPHF funds also allowed CDC to dramatically expand the reach of State tobacco cessation quitlines through the Tips from Former Smokers national tobacco education campaign. PPHF funds supported both the campaign and State quitline capacity to handle the increased calls generated by the campaign. During the 2012 and 2013 Tips campaigns, which aired for a combined total of 28 weeks, there were a total of 718,042 calls to 1-800-QUIT-NOW, a portal which routes callers to their State quitlines. This represents 359,055 additional calls be-yond baseline levels. Community Investments .\u2014In addition, PPHF-funded community investments ad- dressing tobacco use (as well as nutrition and physical activity) have had substan-tial impact and reach. For example: \u2014As a result of the CDC's chronic disease community investments funded through recovery act funds, an estimated 27.4 million Americans now have in-creased protections from deadly secondhand smoke exposure in workplaces, res-taurants, bars, schools, multi-unit housing complexes, campuses, and recreation areas. \u2014As of December 2013, the chronic disease community investments funded through Prevention and Public Health Funds are estimated to have provided 15.6 million new people with access to smoke-free or tobacco-free interventions. Question .\u2014The use and sale of e-cigarettes in the United States has grown signifi- cantly over the past decade. According to a recent CDC report, the number of calls to poison centers involving e-cigarette liquids rose from one per month in September 2010 to 215 per month in February 2014. More than half of the calls to poison cen-ters due to e-cigarettes involved young children under age 5, and about 42 percent of the poison calls involved people age 20 and older. Please summarize CDC's current and planned research on the public health ef- fects of e-cigarettes? Answer. Through surveillance analysis and updates, original research, and coordi- nation with HHS agencies, CDC is conducting cutting-edge research to capture the public health effects of e-cigarettes. Surveillance Analyses and Updates .\u2014CDC's Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) is in the process of analyzing available e-cigarette data and updating key surveil-lance systems to incorporate questions about e-cigarette use, including CDC's Na-tional Adult Tobacco Survey, National Youth Tobacco Survey, and the Global Adult and Youth Tobacco Surveys. \u2014Additionally, CDC is working with partners, other Federal agencies, and States to incorporate e-cigarette questions into existing surveillance systems, including the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFS), Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), FDA's Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH), SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and State Youth (YTS) and Adult (ATS) Tobacco Surveys. \u2014Finally, CDC is leveraging opportunities to collect data on e-cigarettes from rapid response sources, such as HealthStyles and YouthStyles surveys. Research .\u2014CDC is developing a series of research projects to address significant knowledge gaps related to e-cigarettes. \u2014A request for proposal (RFP) has been announced to support a contract for re- search to measure the effects of secondhand exposure to e-cigarette aerosol. The CDC study aims to simulate and examine real-life exposure to secondhand aer-osol from e-cigarettes by conducting an observational pilot research study look-ing primarily at biomarkers of exposure to nicotine in research participants ex-posed to secondhand e-cigarette aerosol. CDC anticipates making the award this summer. \u2014CDC's Tobacco Laboratory is collaborating with the FDA on studies that ad- dress three main categories of e-cigarettes: cigarette look-alikes, pencil size e- cigarettes (these use nicotine liquid) and tank e-cigarettes (large, often with voltage adjustment and use nicotine liquid). These studies will measure: (1) harmful and potentially harmful constituents of e-cigarette aerosol and nicotine liquid, (2) addictive compounds in e-cigarette aerosol and liquid, and (3) bio-markers of these harmful and addictive constituents in blood and urine of users and people exposed to e-cigarette aerosol. CDC is also working on standardized smoking machine measurement protocols so measurements of constituents in e- cigarette aerosol can be reliably compared between different laboratories. 296 \u2014CDC, in coordination with FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, is conducting a more in-depth analysis to build upon the MMWR published on e-cigarette expo-sures called to poison centers. The additional analyses will compare the health effects and demographics of reported e-cigarette exposures to other nicotine-de-livery methods such as nicotine patches, lozenges, and gums. \u2014Formative research is being conducted with adult smokers and former smokers 18-54 years old to understand reasons for use of noncombustible tobacco prod- ucts (e.g., e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, snus) in combination with combustible tobacco products (e.g. cigarettes, little cigars). \u2014In partnership with FDA, CDC is performing in-depth research with pregnant women and women planning a pregnancy to assess their understanding of risks associated with using electronic cigarettes and other nicotine-containing prod-ucts during pregnancy. \u2014Among youth and adults, CDC is also examining the impact of exposure to e- cigarette advertising on intention to use e-cigarettes or other tobacco products. \u2014Through a survey administered by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, CDC is examining screening practices, knowledge and attitudes of obstetricians toward the use of electronic cigarettes and other nicotine con-taining tobacco products during pregnancy. Coordination .\u2014CDC's Office on Smoking and Health works closely with HHS agencies to coordinate research priorities, including, for example: \u2014CDC and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), with the North American Quitline Consortium, are assessing current quitline experiences regarding e- cigarettes to inform future messaging and tracking. \u2014CDC and FDA co-authored recent updates on youth use of e-cigarettes (Sep- tember 2013) and e-cigarette related calls to poison centers (April 2014). \u2014CDC and FDA are working together to analyze data from the National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) and the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) on the impact of e-cigarette use on cessation and on youth and young adult intentions to smoke conventional cigarettes. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN Question. The National Asthma Control Program helps millions of Americans con- trol their disease. In the United States today nearly 26 million people have asthma, including 7 million children. This is concerning to me since New Hampshire's asth-ma prevalence rates are higher than the national average. The CDC has requested level funding of $27.4 million for the National Asthma Control Program, which appears to only fund preventive work in 20 States. How-ever, it is my understanding that this program was always envisioned to be nation-wide. Is CDC committed to ensuring that every State has a comprehensive approach to asthma control? How much funding would it take to get a quality program in every State? Answer. CDC's National Asthma Control program is committed to advancing knowledge on asthma interventions with the strongest evidence of effectiveness. Comprehensive asthma care entails providing a seamless alignment of the full array of services across the public health and healthcare sectors so that people with asth-ma receive all, not just some, of the services they need. Providing comprehensive care at a population level requires a stepwise approach. The first step is to ensure the availability of and access to guidelines-based medical management and pharmacotherapy for all people with asthma. Then, for the segment of people whose asthma remains poorly controlled, additional next steps provide or link them with progressively more individualized services (e.g., intensive self-management edu-cation, environmental trigger reduction services, and other environmental manage-ment strategies). CDC reduced the number of awards in order to increase the average award to States ($331,000 in fiscal year 2013 to $650,000 in fiscal year 2014). Additionally, CDC restructured the awards using a population-based model to ensure that fund-ing was allocated based on need. Funding comprehensive care to a subset of States based on need is CDC's current approach. Question. I am deeply troubled that 1 in 10 kids have asthma nationwide and it is a growing contributor to health disparities. What can we do to reverse this star-tling trend? Answer. CDC recognizes that asthma prevalence is increasing nationwide and is a significant contributor to health disparities. Today, African-Americans are 2-3 times more likely to die from asthma than any other racial or ethnic group. CDC has a strong network of funded State asthma programs and partners and an estab-297 lished surveillance role in public health. States use the information we collect to tar- get vulnerable populations and implement comprehensive, evidence-based asthma interventions. Asthma carries with it a significant economic burden. In 2007, asthma cost about $56 billion in medical cost, lost school and work days, and early deaths. Medicaid spends over $10 billion per year treating asthma. While we don't know what causes asthma, we do know that attacks are sometimes triggered by allergens, exercise, oc-cupational hazards, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and airway infections. CDC's National Asthma Control program works with States to reduce the burden of asthma across the country. While the overall number of people with asthma has risen, trends show that more people with asthma are living with their disease under control. For example, we have seen the hospitalization rate decline by 14 percent in States receiving CDC asthma funds (2000-2007). Other progress in addressing asthma: \u20141.7 million fewer people had asthma attacks in 2009 \u2014Over 1,000 fewer people died in 2010 \u2014Children missed 4.2 million fewer school days because of asthma in 2008 CDC's asthma grantees have also reduced healthcare costs. In Connecticut, the ''Putting on AIRS Program,'' a home based program focusing on self-management and elimination of asthma triggers, reported significant progress: \u201485 percent decline in emergency department visits \u201467 percent decline in asthma-related physician visits \u201462 percent decline in missed days of school and work \u2014Net savings of $26,720 per patient after 6 months In Michigan, the asthma program worked with the Asthma Network of West Michigan and Priority Health, the largest payer in western Michigan, to reduce healthcare costs and improve asthma outcomes: \u201444.4 percent decline in emergency department visits among private members \u201424.4 percent decline in emergency department visits among Medicaid members \u2014For every $1 invested in home visits, environmental assessments and trigger re- duction, it has recouped $2.10 in reduced costs due to uncontrolled asthma. These are just a few examples of how CDC is working to reverse trends. Question. I believe the National Diabetes Prevention Program holds great promise to reduce the burden of diabetes and I am anxious to see the program implemented in even more communities in New Hampshire and across the country. I was pleased to see that the President's budget includes a request for $10 for the program. \u2014Given the incredible promise of the National Diabetes Prevention Program to reduce the number of individuals with prediabetes that develop type 2 diabetes, can you share with us the agency's plan for expanding the number of program sites and individuals participating in fiscal year 2015? \u2014Currently there are 79 million people with prediabetes. Does the agency have an estimate of the resources needed for the National Diabetes Prevention Pro-gram to confront the human and economic impact of the disease beyond 2015? Answer. New estimates from CDC indicate more than 86 million adults in the U.S. have prediabetes, an increase from the previous estimate of 79 million in 2010. With an fiscal year 2015 appropriation request of $10 million (level with the 2014 appropriation), CDC's National Diabetes Prevention Program grantees will expand locations, target populations, settings, number of sites, number of participants, and number of lifestyle coaches, class offerings, and insurance reimbursement. Selected grantee activities include: \u2014The Black Women's Health Imperative will expand its program sites to New Or- leans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where they have identified specific prediabetes health disparities. \u2014Y of the U.S.A. (Y) plans to increase the number of sites offering the lifestyle change program from 11 to 46. \u2014The National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD) has secured coverage of the lifestyle interventions for the Thomas Jefferson Health System medical school, medical center, and Accountable Care Organization clients. In fiscal year 2015, CDC plans to increase the number of organizations applying for CDC recognition through promotion of the Diabetes Prevention Recognition Pro-gram (DPRP). To date, 508 organizations have applied for recognition, serving ap-proximately 10,200 participants. CDC is revising its DPRP standards to incorporate recognition of virtual lifestyle change programs. Initiating this type of program vir-tually will significantly increase the availability of lifestyle interventions in commu-nities where no physical programs exist or for those who would prefer to engage at home. CDC is partnering with a national medical organization to educate their constitu- ency and increase referral and uptake of the intervention for their patients with 298 prediabetes. Furthermore, CDC will continue educating employers and public/pri- vate payers across the U.S. about the benefits and cost-savings of offering the evi-dence-based lifestyle change program as a covered health benefit for employees and for reimbursing organizations who deliver the intervention. Additionally, with fiscal year 2014 funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, CDC will implement Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) DP14-1422, PPHF 2014: State and Local Public Health Actions to Prevent Obesity, Diabetes, and Heart Disease and Stroke. These new investments target priority population subgroups with uncontrolled high blood pressure and those at high risk for type 2 diabetes that experience disparities, including racial/ethnic or socioeconomic dispari-ties, inadequate access to care, poor quality of care, or low income. This funding will support environmental and system approaches to promote health, support and rein-force healthful behaviors, and build support for lifestyle improvements. Diabetes pri-mary prevention strategies include: \u2014Working with a network of partners and local organizations to build support for evidence-based lifestyle change (e.g., National Diabetes Prevention Program); \u2014Implementing evidence-based engagement strategies (e.g. tailored communica- tions) to build support for lifestyle change; and \u2014Increasing coverage for evidence-based lifestyle change programs by working with employers and other network partners. Question. Currently there are 79 million people with prediabetes. Does the agency have an estimate of the resources needed for the National Diabetes Prevention Pro-gram to confront the human and economic impact of the disease beyond 2015? Answer. CDC is currently in the early stages of formulating an fiscal year 2016 budget request and, therefore, does not have an estimate at this time for funding needs in fiscal year 2016 or beyond. Question. Studies show that gestational diabetes is a growing problem and affects up to 18 percent of all pregnancies in the United States. The same studies show that gestational diabetes puts women and their children at a higher risk of devel-oping type 2 diabetes later in life and is associated with more health problems for both mother and child during pregnancy and childbirth. Can you talk about steps the CDC is taking to understand, monitor and help pro- viders understand and test for gestational diabetes? Answer. CDC agrees that gestational diabetes is a prevalent and growing public health problem, and considerable work has been conducted to demonstrate that the obesity epidemic has contributed to the problem of gestational diabetes. However, we do not believe that testing for gestational diabetes is an issue; virtually all women who obtain prenatal care are tested. Work funded by other HHS agencies (NIH's NICHD) has demonstrated that treating even mild gestational diabetes has benefits for mothers and their offspring. CDC is mainly concerned with the impact of gestational diabetes on the future health of women who had a pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes. These women and their children are at substantial risk of developing Type 2 diabetes as they move through their life course. Short-term fol-low-up of these women may not be adequate; as a result, CDC has: \u2014Partnered with national organizations including the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD) and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) to facilitate information exchange among members and to provide new information about gestational diabetes. Their reach includes over 500 State and local health departments, healthcare organizations, commu-nity health centers, WIC programs, nonprofit agencies, and private providers. \u2014Worked with clinical partners to emphasize the need for postpartum testing of women who had a pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes \u2014Funded a pilot study (Balance after Baby) to determine how best to structure an intervention for recently pregnant women who had a pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes so that they might optimize their weight, physical activity and nutritional status and prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes. We are considering expansion of this pilot study. \u2014Recommended that all women with a Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) af- fected pregnancies be screened for diabetes at their postpartum visit (about 6- 8 weeks after delivery); currently postpartum screening rates are very low. As a result, CDC funded a clinical study (Comparison of Glucose Tolerance Testing Immediately Postpartum and at 6 Weeks in Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) to determine if women with GDM could be accurately screened for dia-betes during their delivery hospitalization instead of waiting 6-8 weeks for their postpartum visit. If screening at the delivery hospitalization is comparable to the 6-8 week screen, it increases the ability to identify women who are at risk for diabetes and adverse health outcomes. 299 QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JERRY MORAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERDOSE Question. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) budget re- quests $15.6 million for a new Prescription Drug Overdose initiative. Instead of fo-cusing funds specifically to address this problem, the budget requests an increase to the Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program, which is a much broader in-jury prevention program. Why did CDC not design a program to specifically address this problem in the States where the burden is highest? Answer. CORE VIPP is an existing system that has shown evidence of success in preventing injuries and protecting residents in the States in which the program has been implemented. Of the 20 currently funded States, 16 have already identified PDO as a priority and have been working on this topic with existing resources. Ad-ditionally, 10 of the highest PDO burden States are already funded through Core VIPP. The Core VIPP mechanism allows CDC to target specific activities to address this critical public health epidemic while also supporting State health departments' overall ability to collect data, use those data to act, and collaborate across sectors to address the highest burden injury and violence prevention issues. Through the expansion of Core VIPP, CDC can direct resources to the States who need it most (i.e., those with the highest burden) and those who to demonstrate their readiness to advance multiple, complementary approaches\u2014insurance innovations, prevention programs, and enhanced State-focused analysis. CDC strives to capitalize on exist- ing mechanisms to better coordinate State efforts and reduce administrative burden on States. The request of $15.6 million in the fiscal year 2015 President's budget will sup- port PDO work (via Core VIPP) at the State level, in two ways: \u2014Provide base injury prevention funding to a number of States that are not cur- rently part of the Core VIPP program, with an emphasis on States with the highest burden of PDO. The goal is to build a State's basic ability for injury prevention in order to have a foundation for PDO-specific activities. Each of these States will be required to include PDO as one of their injury prevention priorities. \u2014The majority of the funding will be used for a set of Core VIPP States to expand and intensify their PDO prevention activities. This funding will be competed among existing and new Core VIPP States, with an emphasis on States with the highest burden of PDO and those States most prepared to conduct PDO pre-vention activities. ALZHEIMER 'S DISEASE RESEARCH Question. Last year, the budget requested an $80 million increase for Alzheimer's disease research. Congress provided $100 million in the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus. Why did the Department not include an increase for Alzheimer's disease research in the fiscal year 2015 budget proposal? Answer. Unlike the one-time funds provided for Alzheimer's research by the NIH Director in fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013, the additional $100 million appro-priated dollars are added to the base, and upcoming budgets for Alzheimer's re-search will be estimated from this increased base. The estimated total NIH-wide support for Alzheimer's disease in fiscal year 2014 and again in fiscal year 2015 is $566 million. This amount is an estimate that could potentially increase, or decrease depending on peer review results. Most of the efforts for implementation of the Na-tional Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are led by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA has awarded several major new grants supporting translational and clinical research aimed at the disease; they are among the first projects to be developed with direc-tion from the 2012 AD Research Summit, and focus on identifying, characterizing, and validating novel therapeutic targets and identifying possible ways to stop dis-ease progression. This brain disease is being aggressively targeted on multiple fronts. For example, NIH recently launched the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP), an unprece-dented partnership with the Food and Drug Administration, a number of bio-pharmaceutical companies, and several nonprofit organizations that will use cut-ting-edge scientific approaches to sift through a long list of potential therapeutic tar-gets and biomarkers, and choose those most promising for further development. This public-private partnership will initially focus on three disease areas, including Alz-heimer's disease. This truly innovative and collaborative approach should speed up the development of new treatments and cures for multiple conditions and diseases. Another way NIH-funded scientists are accelerating the development and applica-300 tion of innovative technologies toward major advances in Alzheimer's disease is with the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Ini-tiative. NIH is a major player in this pioneering, multi-agency venture that will en-able the creation of new tools to examine the activity of billions of nerve cells, net-works, and pathways in real time. By measuring activity at the scale of circuits and networks in living organisms, researchers can begin to decode sensory experience and, potentially, even memory, emotion, and thought. The BRAIN Initiative will provide a foundational platform that has the potential to spawn remarkable oppor-tunities in basic and applied research for several brain disorders. Question. Will NIH reach the goal of finding a cure for Alzheimer's by 2025 with- out an increase in its research funding? Answer. While it is still impossible to predict with certainty when an effective treatment or preventive intervention will be available, the infusion of new Federal funds to Alzheimer's research in the past several years has already energized the field, accelerated the pace of discovery, and facilitated the support of research projects that may not otherwise have been funded. In particular, the field is benefiting from the inclusion of an additional $100 mil- lion in the NIH's fiscal year 2014 budget appropriation which will be applied to high-priority research on Alzheimer's disease. The National Institute on Aging (NIA), an NIH Institute and lead Federal agency for research on Alzheimer's dis-ease, will manage the bulk of the projects awarded with these funds. Unlike the one-time funds provided for Alzheimer's research by the NIH Director in fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013, these additional appropriated dollars are added to the NIA's base, and upcoming NIA budgets will be estimated from this increased base. NIA is strategically distributing these funds among single-year and multiyear projects to maintain a stream of new competing dollars to support high-quality, peer-reviewed research on aging and Alzheimer's disease in future years. This recent increase in funding comes at an opportune time, and we have more reason than ever to be optimistic about the possibility of an effective treatment or preventive intervention for Alzheimer's. Recent breakthroughs in biomedical imag-ing are enabling us to identify and track the earliest pathological stages of the dis-ease process in the living human brain, long before clinical symptoms appear. These discoveries, in addition to discovery of other early biomarkers of the Alzheimer's dis-ease process, have opened a ''window of opportunity'' for us to target and potentially reverse the disease's underlying pathology before cognitive, behavioral, and emo-tional symptoms appear. NIH has begun to launch its first such clinical trials in presymptomatic individ- uals. For example, in one study, researchers are investigating whether an antibody treatment, crenezumab, which is designed to bind to, and possibly clear away, ab-normal amounts of amyloid protein in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, can prevent decline in cognitive function among members of a unique and large family population in Colombia sharing a genetic mutation known to produce early-onset disease. We anticipate initial results from this groundbreaking study by 2017. An-other study, the A4 Trial, will test an amyloid-clearing drug in the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease, in symptom-free older volunteers who have had positron emis-sion tomography brain images that show abnormal levels of amyloid accumulation. Positive results from these or similar studies would provide important ''proof of con-cept'' that targeting preclinical disease is an effective strategy, and would represent a major step forward in our efforts against Alzheimer's disease. NIH also supports more than 35 Alzheimer's disease clinical trials, including a number of studies of interventions to slow disease progression among individuals who are already showing symptoms. Over 40 compounds are currently under study to stimulate and advance research on the discovery and development of new preven-tive and therapeutic interventions for AD, mild cognitive impairment, and age-re-lated cognitive decline. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD C. S HELBY STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE Question. The budget proposes, for a second year, to reduce funding for the Stra- tegic National Stockpile. This reduction could result in fewer people receiving treat-ment during an influenza pandemic and fewer people receiving post-exposure treat-ment following exposure to anthrax. The proposed reduction is more than an effi-ciency cut; it affects our capability to respond in the event of a terrorist attack. If this cut is sustained, how does HHS expect the Federal Government to adequately respond should there be a bioterrorist attack or disease epidemic? 301 Answer. Through collaboration on the Public Health Emergency Medical Counter- measures Enterprise (PHEMCE) governance process, CDC and other HHS agencies coordinate priorities and activities for future fiscal years to utilize all available re-sources to safeguard the health of U.S. populations. CDC will prioritize replacement of expiring items that rank the highest on formulary priorities, based on an annual review of the SNS and result in efficiencies form improved procurement. DUPLICATION Question. In the Government Accountability's Office's annual report on duplica- tion, it highlighted that it takes 10 different offices at the Department of Health and Human Services to run programs addressing AIDS in minority communities, that autism research is spread over 11 different agencies, and that there are 45 early learning and child care programs funded by the Federal Government. How is your Department addressing this issue? Answer. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) mission is to pro- vide the building blocks that Americans need to live healthy, successful lives. HHS programs span from infant home visiting to the largest healthcare provider for sen-iors. In addition to the breadth of HHS' mission, several of the programs identified in the report have unique aspects to them, which warrant tailored approaches. Specifically for AIDS in minority communities, HHS does not support consoli- dating the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) into core HIV/AIDS funding at this time. MAI is distinct from other HIV/AIDS programs and funding as it focuses specifically on the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment, and outreach and education in the United States. HHS continues to de-liberate strategies to more efficiently administer MAI and reduce duplicative re-quirements for grantees, while ensuring that the Department is being responsive to the needs of racial and ethnic minority communities and populations disproportion-ately impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. For autism research, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report cites that ''84 percent of the autism research projects funded by Federal agencies were potentially duplicative.'' HHS believes that this statement is misleading or could be easily misconstrued. It is important to recognize the difference between appro-priately addressing complex problems using multiple strategies and funding redun-dant or duplicative projects. We do not believe that research is necessarily duplica-tive if two agencies fund the same broad objectives in a strategic plan. Although GAO's report acknowledges that duplication is necessary in science for the sake of replication or corroborating results, it does not appreciate the full extent of the ne-cessity of replication and the extensive policies in place at HHS and other Federal agencies to prevent redundant projects. HHS recognizes that scientific endeavors and the path of research discovery are not linear undertakings and often require verification and validation efforts. HHS is concerned about the GAO report's implication that it is wasteful when more than one funding agency addresses an objective or aim of the Strategic Plan for Autism Research. It must be recognized that the goals and objectives of the Stra-tegic Plan represent complex scientific questions that require a multidisciplinary ap-proach, with multiple scientific strategies. For example, to develop effective inter-ventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that will address the full range of symptoms and degrees of disability found in the ASD population, research studies on multiple intervention types, such as behavioral, pharmacological, educational, and occupational, may need to be undertaken simultaneously to facilitate rapid progress that benefits individual with varying needs. Based on the urgent need to address rapidly the health and services issues that are the most pressing in the community, it is not only appropriate, it is critical that multiple agencies address the complex questions related to understanding the neurobiology of ASD and identi-fying efficacious strategies for use across the lifespan. HHS is supportive of and committed to the call for greater coordination among Federal research funding agencies and actively engages in efforts to minimize risk of research duplication in all activities. HHS agrees that there should be continued vigilance and coordination to avoid unnecessary duplication across research projects. HHS has robust procedures in place for avoiding duplication before grant and con-tract awards are made and to keep the funding decisionmaking process fair and eq-uitable. In addition, the internal NIH Autism Coordinating Committee (NIH ACC) and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) provide opportunities for monitoring and collaboration within NIH and across Federal agencies. These policies and coordinating bodies have served HHS well in terms of identifying and preventing unwarranted duplication prior to making funding decisions. We will con-302 tinue to monitor the internal NIH ACC procedures, as well as participation on the IACC, to make full use of these opportunities. As part of the HHS Strategic Plan, HHS commits to collaboration across State, local, tribal, urban Indian, nongovernmental, and private sector partners to support early childhood initiatives. The most recent GAO report released in April 2014 (2014 Annual Report: Additional Opportunities to Reduce Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication and Achieve Other Financial Benefits) did not include Early Learning in the 11 areas that were suggested to take action to address evidence of fragmenta-tion, overlap, or duplication. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM Question. Last month the CDC published the latest prevalence study on the rates of autism. The report focused on children born in the year 2002, and found a 30 percent increase in the rates of autism in just 2 years\u2014finding that 1 in 68 children born in 2002 is likely on the autism spectrum. The previous study had included the State of South Carolina and found an overall rate of 1 in 90 children born in 2000 on the autism spectrum with 1 in 55 boys. This latest report does not include South Carolina data. Why not? Can I presume that the rates of autism in South Carolina have also increased 30 percent? Answer. South Carolina was not able to provide suitable data in time to be in- cluded in the CDC's 2014 report on autism. CDC is working with the South Caro-lina Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) site to finalize their 2010 data; it would not be appropriate to speculate or compare SC to the ADDM 2010 published findings. Question. There is great concern among the autism community that the CDC con- tinues to take 4 years to publish the data on 8 year olds. The agency should be able to obtain and publish data more quickly. What are you doing to improve your turn around time on the data evaluation? Answer. CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Net- work method for tracking autism has advantages and disadvantages. CDC's ADDM Network collects and analyzes in-depth data to understand what is happening in communities across the United States, rather than simply counting the number of children with autism. The ADDM Network does not rely on parents' or providers' reporting of autism diagnoses; the network collects detailed information on symp-toms that are consistent with a diagnosis of autism, as documented in tens of thou-sands of children's health and education records. This method allows us to: \u2014identify children with diagnosed and undiagnosed autism, \u2014cover a very large and diverse population base, \u2014track changes over time, \u2014examine whether certain groups of children are more likely to be diagnosed with autism than others with similar symptoms, \u2014analyze the age when children are being identified, and \u2014demonstrate what progress is being made to identify children earlier. CDC's ADDM Network is continuously working to maximize our tracking system's efficiency. First, we recently rolled out a new Web-based data collection system that is helping us collect, manage and review data more efficiently. Second, many of the community sources from which we collect data have moved to electronic records. This switch might also help us collect and review data more quickly. Lastly, we are piloting new electronic data mining techniques that hold potential for streamlining record review in the future. Question. Last month the CDC published the latest prevalence study on the rates of autism. The report focused children born in the year 2002 and found a 30 percent increase in the rates of autism in just 2 years\u2014finding that 1 in 68 children born in 2002 is likely on the autism spectrum. There is concern in the autism community that you are not requiring each of the State grantees to obtain education data, so that you are making apples to apples' comparison from State to State. Two of the States included in this year's published study do not have the education data, which your report States decreases the preva-lence rate. If the two States are removed, then the rate of autism goes from 1 in 68 to 1 in 58. Can you insure that going forward all grantees obtain educational data so we are getting the most accurate picture? Answer. CDC currently cannot ensure that all grantees will have access to edu- cational data going forward. Decisions about whether CDC's Autism and Develop-mental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network sites have access to educational data are made at the local level and are subject to change. CDC has and will con-tinue to encourage ADDM Network surveillance sites to work closely with their local 303 communities to obtain access to as many sources of information on children with autism as possible. CDC is assessing ways to maximize information sources in the new ADDM Funding Opportunity Announcement in 2014. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR MARK KIRK Question. NIH and NCI provide all kinds of grants to researchers to provide sup- port for investigator-initiated projects. These grants are integral to researcher's abil-ity to pursue academic careers. I have heard from several constituents that many young, promising MD/Ph.D. investigators are leaving their training programs to go into private practice- abandoning their scientific scholarship because there isn't funding to support their labs. This is a general problem, but I'm particularly con-cerned about the field of radiation oncology. I understand that when the NCI did a review of its grants, it determined that about 5 percent of NCI's budget was going to fund radiation oncology grants/projects. I'm not sure what the right number would be, but 5 percent seems awful small given that radiation oncologists treat roughly two-thirds of all cancer patients. Does 5 percent seem small to you? And are you willing to review your internal processes to make sure that there aren't any problems in the way radiation oncology proposals are reviewed that is leading to such a low funding rate? Answer. NCI's primary goals are to support and conduct a broad spectrum of can- cer research. The research NCI oversees uses a wide variety of approaches and funding mechanisms, with several goals: improving our understanding of the causes and biological mechanisms of a large variety of cancers; preventing cancers; detect-ing and diagnosing all types of cancers; and treating cancers, as well as the symp-toms and sequelae of cancers, more effectively. NCI's research projects and pro-grams include studies of the basic aspects of cancer biology at the molecular and cellular levels: investigations of how cancer cells and processes affect, and are af-fected by, the cellular environment in which they exist, and applications of these discoveries toward successful detection, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and con-trol of cancers of all types. All research efforts supported by NCI are subjected to rigorous review for quality and purpose by expert peer reviewers, program staff, and advisory groups. Decisions about individual research projects selected for funding are made for a limited period of time, based on a series of rigorous evaluations performed by scientific peers, NCI divisional program staff, and NCI Scientific Program Leaders, and then subjected to final approval by the National Cancer Advisory Board and the NCI Director. An emphasis on scientific merit is maintained throughout the review process. All of these efforts are monitored annually through written progress reports and subjected to competitive peer review or terminated on a regular basis, generally between 2 to 5 years. Similar processes are used to oversee the representation of various types and costs of research in our portfolio. Radiation therapy plays a critical role in NCI's portfolio of cancer clinical trials. It is incorporated as a standard part of the treatment plans for patients with stage III squamous and adenocarcinomas of the lung, limited stage small cell lung cancer, as well as esophageal, breast, brain, and rectal cancers. Investigational questions related to new radiation therapy techniques as well as how to best combine radi-ation therapy with systemic therapies and surgery comprise a major part of the portfolio of studies carried out by the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). The majority of the trials conducted by one of the adult clinical trials groups, NRG Oncology, focus on studies to improve the use of radiation therapy. In addition to NRG, the Alliance, the Children's Oncology Group, the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, and the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group also have active studies that incorporate radiation therapy. This portfolio of trials is monitored by an NCI oversight committee, the Clinical Trials and Translational Research Advi-sory Committee. The overall quality control for radiation therapy clinical studies supported by the NCI is also directly supported by a grant to fund a core quality control group responsible for overseeing these activities across the NCTN. NCI cur-rently supports 50 national trials that incorporate radiation therapy as a component of the investigational program under examination. In addition to the substantive re-sources provided for radiation therapy-related clinical trials, NCI supports basic re-search into radiation therapy and radiobiology. In fiscal year 2013, funding for this basic research was approximately $56 million. This, of course, is complemented by $107 million per year in funding for studies of critical DNA repair mechanisms that are of major interest and relevance to understanding the mechanism(s) of action of radiation therapy. 304 Question. Stroke is the leading cause of disability for adults in the United States and the 4th leading cause of death. Recent studies show that 1 of 6 veterans return-ing from war zones and 1 of 4 stroke survivors have symptoms of PTSD. Knowing these statistics what cross-coordinating efforts, if any, are happening within NIH, DOD and the VA? Answer. The high rate of PTSD among military servicemembers and veterans is of major concern to NIH. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is work-ing with the Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and academic clinicians and researchers to focus on the mental health needs of military service personnel, as well as veterans and their families. A cross-agency priority goal (CAPG) of the DOD, VA, and HHS to improve mental health outcomes for Service Members, Veterans, and their families will help speed the progress of research efforts related to PTSD, suicide prevention, and common co-occurring con-ditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury (TBI) and substance abuse). The CAPG will be supported through specific cross-agency priority actions that will be accomplished over the next 3 years. Another example of collaborative efforts across agencies to address military mental health issues is the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resil-ience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) project, a partnership between NIMH and the Department of the Army to provide the Army with actionable data to help them drive down the suicide rate, and to address associated problems, such as PTSD, among soldiers. In addition, as a result of a 2012 Executive Order, DOD, VA, HHS (including NIH), and the Department of Education developed a National Research Action Plan, which provides a comprehensive approach to accelerating research on traumatic brain injury and PTSD. While PTSD most commonly develops after exposure to a terrifying event or or- deal, it also occurs in individuals who have suffered an acute life-threatening ill-ness, e.g., stroke survivors. An NIH-supported study estimated that 1 in 4 survivors of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) develop significant PTSD symptoms. More than one-third of stroke survivors suffer post-stroke depression. Post-stroke depression can interfere with daily functioning, inhibit quality of life, and if not treated and managed appropriately, can slow rehabilitation and lead to further dis-ability. NIH-funded research is addressing ways to treat post-stroke depression, in-cluding psychosocial/behavioral interventions, in addition to novel rehabilitation pro-tocols that improve motor function as well as reduce depression in stroke survivors. NIH-funded studies are also investigating ways to identify patients who will benefit most from these therapies, and more generally, trying to understand the mecha-nisms by which behavioral factors contribute to outcome and recovery from stroke. The new National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) StrokeNet, composed of 25 acute and rehabilitation stroke centers, is dedicated to testing new means of improving quality of life in stroke survivors which must in-clude attention to post-stroke depression and PTSD. NIH will continue to look for ways to collaborate with other agencies as appro- priate to help uncover connections between conditions such as PTSD, stroke, and depression. Question. Viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer\u2014one of the most le- thal, expensive and fastest growing cancers in America. More than 5.3 million peo-ple in the U.S. are living with hepatitis B (HBV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) and as many as 75 percent of them are undiagnosed. With the lack of an adequate, com-prehensive surveillance system, these estimates are only the tip of the iceberg. Viral hepatitis kills 15,000 people each year and is the leading non-AIDS cause of death in people living with HIV. These epidemics are particularly alarming given the ris-ing rates of new infections and high rates of chronic infection among disproportion-ately impacted racial and ethnic populations. Additionally, recent alarming epi-demiologic reports indicate a rise in HCV infection among young people throughout the country. Further, the baby boomer population (those born 1945-1965) currently accounts for two out of every three cases of chronic HCV. As these Americans con-tinue to age, they are likely to develop complications from HCV and require costly medical interventions that can be avoided if they are tested earlier and provided with treatment options. Can you highlight the problems facing our country with viral hepatitis and the urgent need to address these two diseases and what could happen if we do not act? Answer. Viral hepatitis is an urgent public health problem in the United States. Hepatitis B (HBV) .\u2014There have been dramatic decreases in the number of new acute infections among children, resulting from universal infant immunization rec-ommendations, and today most new infections are among adults. However, an esti-mated 1.2 million persons in the United States have chronic hepatitis B infection, and 25 percent will die of HBV-associated complications in the absence of medical 305 interventions. Preventing perinatal infections by screening pregnant women and vaccinating infants upon birth also remains a priority. Hepatitis C (HCV) .\u2014Recent data indicate that no more than 50 percent of HCV- infected persons in the United States have been tested for HCV. Of those tested, 32-38 percent are referred for care, 7-11 percent are treated, and 5-6 percent achieve virologic cure. These low proportions reflect gaps in health-care delivery at every stage of the HCV continuum of care. Consequently HCV-related disease, healthcare costs, and mortality are increasing. Implementation of CDC and USPSTF recommendations for birth-year based HCV testing linked to HCV care and treat-ment can avert an estimated 121,000 deaths (Smith BD et al. Recommendations for the Identification of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection Among Persons Born Dur-ing 1945-1965. MMWR. 61(RR04);1-18. See Table 3 with Source: Rein DB et al. The Cost-Effectiveness of Birth-Cohort Screening for Hepatitis C Antibody in U.S. Pri-mary Care Settings. Ann Intern Med. 2012;156(4):263-270. Modified and reprinted in MMWR with permission from Annals of Internal Medicine.). CDC is working to improve the continuum of hepatitis C testing, care, and treatment; and will leverage the use of newly FDA-licensed safe and curative therapies for new prevention oppor-tunities. CDC plays a key role in implementing the HHS Action Plan for the Prevention, Care and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis. The plan sets out ambitious goals and a path forward to confront viral hepatitis. Its goals are to increase the proportion of those who are aware of their Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infections; reduce new Hep-atitis C infections; and, eliminate mother to child transmission of Hepatitis B. Question. Given the release of U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grade ''B'' recommendation for HCV screening for baby boomers and individuals at risk, do you feel you have the resources to implement that recommendation and educate Medicare beneficiaries and healthcare providers about hepatitis C and its disproportionate impact on baby boomers? Answer. Currently, only a small proportion of the baby boomer cohort is eligible for Medicare. The cohort will steadily age into Medicare eligibility over the next 15 years. Recent evidence from CDC demonstration projects indicates that a substantial number of people who are either currently Medicare-eligible or will become eligible over the upcoming decade can receive recommended HCV testing in nonprimary care settings. Therefore, Medicare beneficiaries receiving screening and in the near future can significantly increase the proportion of people who are aware of their in-fection. However, while screening those who are or will soon be Medicare beneficiaries is vitally important, it is also important to screen the rest of the birth cohort now, so that all who are infected can be screened for alcohol use, and receive care and treat-ment (including hepatitis A and B vaccination, as medically appropriate). Implementation of new CDC and USPSTF recommendations for HCV testing can save over 120,000 lives. In fiscal year 2012, CDC received Prevention and Public Health Funds to support demonstration sites for hepatitis B and hepatitis C testing to identify persons with undiagnosed infection, and for linkages to care when appropriate. Nine sites were selected to do hepatitis B testing, and 24 sites to do hepatitis C testing. Evaluation of these sites is ongoing, but preliminary data indicate that over 45,000 tests were completed in the first year of the initiative, yielding important lessons learned that can be implemented elsewhere. CDC was able to provide continuation funding to al-most all of the sites in fiscal year 2013, and substantial gains in the total number of completed tests are expected in the second year. In 2014, CDC will support the development and evaluation of new viral hepatitis prevention programs in three jurisdictions. These viral hepatitis prevention pro-grams aim to establish the platform needed to reduce new infections, improve sys-tems of care, and combat hepatitis-related health disparities; activities will include but not be limited to education on hepatitis C. Question. Viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer\u2014one of the most le- thal, expensive and fastest growing cancers in America. More than 5.3 million peo-ple in the U.S. are living with hepatitis B (HBV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) and as many as 75 percent of them are undiagnosed. With the lack of an adequate, com-prehensive surveillance system, these estimates are only the tip of the iceberg. Viral hepatitis kills 15,000 people each year. These epidemics are particularly alarming given the rising rates of new infections and high rates of chronic infection among disproportionately impacted racial and ethnic populations. Additionally, recent alarming epidemiologic reports indicate a rise in HCV infection among young people throughout the country. Some jurisdictions have noted that the number of people ages 15 to 29 being diagnosed with HCV infection now exceeds the number of people 306 diagnosed in all other age groups combined. Further, the baby boomer population (those born 1945-1965) currently accounts for two out of every three cases of chronic HCV. As these Americans continue to age, they are likely to develop complications from HCV and require costly medical interventions that can be avoided if they are tested earlier and provided with treatment options. It is estimated that this epi-demic will increase costs by billions of dollars\u2014from $30 billion in 2009 to over $85 billion in 2024\u2014to private insurers and public systems of health such as Medicare and Medicaid, and account for additional billions lost due to decreased productivity from the millions of workers suffering from chronic HBV and HCV. Over the last 2 years, CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) have begun to align their recommendations for hepatitis screening, recommending one-time test-ing of baby boomers and screening vulnerable groups for HCV. In April, the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services (HHS) renewed the Action Plan for the Preven-tion, Care and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis which provides clear and attainable goals to increase the number of individuals diagnosed with viral hepatitis and re-duce transmission of the viruses. The Action Plan identifies discrete activities for HHS and other Federal agencies to break the silence of this epidemic. Will the agen-cy continue to focus cross agency attention on addressing the viral hepatitis epi-demic and implementing the Action Plan? Answer. On April 3, 2014, HHS released the 3-year update of the Action Plan for the Prevention, Care and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, which provides a framework around which both Federal and non-Federal stakeholders from many sectors can en-gage to strengthen the Nation's response to viral hepatitis and work to improve viral hepatitis prevention, screening, and treatment through 2016. This update is the culmination of efforts across the Department of Health and Human Services as well as at the Departments of Justice, Housing and Urban De-velopment, and Veterans Affairs who have worked to develop this framework for fo-cused activity by both Federal and non-Federal stakeholders. Federal colleagues have identified more than 150 important actions their agencies and offices will un-dertake between 2014 and 2016 across six priority areas. \u2014Educating Providers and Communities to Reduce Viral Hepatitis-related Health Disparities (Confront viral hepatitis by breaking the silence). \u2014Improving Testing, Care, and Treatment to Prevent Liver Disease and Cancer (Take full advantage of existing tools). \u2014Strengthening Surveillance to Detect Viral Hepatitis Transmission and Disease (Collect accurate and timely information to get the job done). \u2014Eliminating Transmission of Vaccine-Preventable Viral Hepatitis (Take full ad- vantage of vaccines that can prevent hepatitis A and B). \u2014Reducing Viral Hepatitis Associated with Drug Use (Stop the spread of viral hepatitis associated with drug use). \u2014Protecting Patients and Workers From Health Care-Associated Viral Hepatitis (Quality healthcare is safe healthcare). In shaping these actions, HHS sought substantial input from non-Federal part- ners and stakeholders through public webinars and a formal Request for Informa-tion (RFI) published in the Federal Register. In fact, a notable feature of the up-dated plan is a more explicit recognition that achieving the goals of this national plan will require the time, talent, and energy of a broad mix of partners from across all sectors of society, both governmental and nongovernmental. As such, the updated plan includes a listing of potential opportunities for non-Federal stakeholders to pro-mote successful implementation. Finally, to maximize cross-agency and cross-departmental effort in support of the updated Viral Hepatitis Action Plan, the Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy, in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, actively coordinates a Viral Hepatitis Implementation Group (VHIG) composed of senior leaders from HHS, VA, DOJ/BOP, HUD and ONDCP. The VHIG meets on a regular basis to share progress, discuss challenges and highlight new opportunities. Question. There are a number of cancers, and stomach cancer is a prominent ex- ample, where there is both dismal survival rates and also a shortage of ongoing re-search. The vast majority of stomach cancer is diagnosed at metastatic stages, for which there are, at present, no cures. Stomach cancer treatments have made little progress in the past decade and are quite limited. The investment that the NCI is making in a number of cancers through The Cancer Genome Atlas has the potential to catalyze research in stomach and other cancers. But for cancers, like stomach cancer, with less-developed research infrastructures, how can we be confident that research to pursue the findings of the TCGA will occur? Answer. While NCI has made significant progress in preventing, detecting, and treating many cancers, gastric cancer is one of several types that are not well un-derstood and remain difficult to treat. For such areas, NCI has a variety of tools 307 at its disposal to stimulate research in specific areas. Meetings of NCI and extra- mural experts to conduct ''horizon scanning'' for scientific opportunities on a variety of cancers occur as part of NCI's standard practices. In fact, NCI invited a group of international experts in gastric and esophageal cancer to participate in a work-shop in May 2011. In addition to discussing the basic biology, epidemiology and clin-ical research, they also focused on different patterns of gastric cancer observed in other countries. One result of the workshop was the initiation of a pilot project for obtaining pre-treatment gastric tumor specimens. (NCI has also recently convened workshops for hepatic, lung, and pancreatic cancers.) Initiatives, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), that provide new insights into a wide range of cancer types can greatly accelerate progress in many common and rare cancer types, such as gastric cancer, and generate prime research opportu-nities. The genomic sequence data from TCGA's gastric cancer samples are already freely available to qualified researchers for further study. (NCI has developed websites that allow researchers to search for genetic alterations in any cancer stud-ied by TCGA and will continue to support these cancer genomics portals to promote the widest possible utilization of these data.) The first 295 gastric cancer samples have been evaluated, and a report is expected to be published early this summer. The report shows that the current classification of gastric cancer subtypes by ap-pearance under the microscope is imprecise and can be refined by analysis of tumor genomes. Some of the genetic abnormalities are characteristic of particular gastric cancer subtypes and might be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Additionally, several of the mutations found in gastric cancer are also present in other cancers studied by TCGA and other projects. NCI vigorously supports research into thera-peutic strategies to target the abnormal molecular pathways that are caused by mutations that occur in one or many tumor types. The work that is expected to follow up findings from TCGA does not require spe- cific research methods or equipment for each type of cancer, but it does require cer-tain specific resources: tumor samples, appropriate experimental models for each disease, and investigators motivated by new opportunities to work on that disease. Suitable laboratory models are important for testing candidate drugs or immunotherapies for their ability to block abnormal molecular pathways and pre-vent tumor growth. Human cancer cell lines are the mainstay of this kind of re-search, but the currently available cell lines do not model all of the diverse subtypes of cancer, including gastric cancers, and do not possess all of the recurrent mutations that drive the malignant process. NCI is addressing this infrastructural deficiency by using biopsies of various kinds of human cancers to create a large number of new cancer models with newly available methods (e.g., so-called ''organoid'' cultures and ''conditionally reprogrammed'' cells). When successful, NCI will distribute these new cancer models broadly to cancer researchers to help de-velop diagnostic and treatment strategies tailored to specific subtypes of cancer and to specific molecular abnormalities. To that end, NCI is soliciting applications to support pilot projects at NCI-designated cancer centers for the development and characterization of cell lines derived from human cancer specimens. These models could also help clarify cellular mechanisms that drive tumor progression and gen-erate hypotheses about ways to interrupt those processes. Letters of intent have been received from several potential applicants, and at least one plans to develop models for gastric cancer. Question. How can the NCI assist stomach cancer researchers and researchers of other cancers with deficiencies in foundational knowledge in developing successful RO1 grant applications that can have an impact for patients battling stomach can-cer? Answer. NCI can and does foster opportunities to study gastric (stomach) cancer in several ways: \u2014by providing new information of the type illustrated by The Cancer Genome Atlas and discussed in response to the previous question (this kind of new infor- mation suggests new ideas and opportunities for research, often addressed to diseases that were previously difficult to study); \u2014by offering an array of funding opportunities (including team awards), and not only RO1 grants; \u2014by supporting the training of talented individuals who might develop an inter- est in gastric cancer through individual fellowships, institutional training awards, and career development awards; and \u2014by highlighting NCI's concerns about the slow progress against this disease through the organization of workshops and public discussion of public health needs and research opportunities. 308 In addition, NCI program managers are available to provide guidance to inves- tigators who seek help in finding the most appropriate funding mechanisms to sup-port proposed work on gastric cancer and other types of cancers. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED TO MARYK. W AKEFIELD QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR TOMHARKIN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS Question. The Health Centers program received mandatory funding under the ACA, a critical investment that the National Association of Community Health Cen-ters (CHCs) estimates created over 550 new health clinics and expanded capacity at thousands of existing sites. This investment needs to be extended, or the manda-tory funding will expire in fiscal year 2016 and health centers will face a massive funding cliff. I have expressed support for fixing this issue by continuing mandatory funding, an approach supported in the President's budget. If funding was not ex-tended, please provide the administration estimate on how that would impact the CHC program in fiscal year 2016. Please include how much base funding for exist-ing health centers will be reduced, the number of clinics that will close, and the loss in patient capacity. Answer. The budget includes a proposal to continue mandatory funding for health centers in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018 at $2.7 billion per year, for a total in-vestment of $8.1 billion. This investment is part of a total budget that includes more than $400 billion in specified health savings over 10 years. The President has not yet submitted a discretionary budget for fiscal year 2016, the year the mandatory Health Center funds will expire. If funding for the Health Center Program is signifi-cantly lowered in fiscal year 2016 compared to the previous year a complex proce-dure of grant level reductions, and possibly terminations, could occur. This could re-sult in numerous health center sites closing, and a reduction in patients served by health centers. RYAN WHITE HIV /AIDS PROGRAM Question. The President's budget proposes to consolidate Part D of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program into Part C of the program. Part D provides family-cen-tered primary medical care for women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS. These services include case management for HIV-infected pregnant women and HIV-infected children and youth. Has Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) conducted an assess- ment of Part C programs to determine whether Part C programs are prepared and have the infrastructure to provide primary and specialty care to these populations? How many Part C grantees have pediatric providers and are currently equipped to provide primary and specialty medical care and support services to infants, children and youth? Answer. In 2014, 67 percent of Part D programs funded by the Ryan White HIV/ AIDS Program are dually funded by the Part C program. The consolidated program will continue to provide increased access to allowable services under Part C that meet the needs of the Part D community. All applicants to the fiscal year 2015 Part C Funding Opportunity Announcement will be required to demonstrate how they will provide care and treatment for the most vulnerable populations, including women, infants, children and youth. The assessment of an applicant's capacity to provide the services proposed in their grant applicant is a key area of focus for the objective grant review committee. The consolidation will expand the focus on women, infants, children, and youth across all of the funded grantees and will in-crease points of access for the population. In addition, the consolidation will result in increased efficiencies, reduced duplication of effort and reporting/administrative burden among currently co-funded grantees, and allow more funding to be available for direct patient care services. Question. What are HRSA's plans to ensure a seamless transition of services, in- cluding case management services, and to ensure that women, infants, children and youth are not lost to care, including plans to provide technical assistance to current and future grantees? Answer. Since 67 percent of Part D grantees are currently also Part C grantees, HRSA expects that transition will be manageable. Continuing to reduce mother-to- child transmission of HIV remains a priority. The President's budget will result in more Part C programs providing women, infants, children and youth-focused serv-ices, which will result in increased access to proven medical care for these popu-309 lations across the country. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides extensive technical assistance opportunities to both current and future Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees through our Technical Assistance Resources, Guidance, Education & Training (TARGET) Center, AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs), our national cooperative agreements, and during pre-application technical assistance calls when the new Funding Opportunity Announcement is released. In addition, one-on-one technical assistance from the HRSA staff will be available to assist grantees receiving new funding under Part C to ensure that the Program's most vul-nerable populations, which include women, infants, children and youth, are not lost to care and treatment. Question. What impact will the proposed consolidation have on Part C grantees needing to seek a waiver from the 75/25 core medical services requirement in order to provide case management services to Part D populations? Answer. HRSA takes seriously the responsibility to ensure that all of the needs of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are met. Under the President's budget, all Part D programs that meet the Part C Program eligibility for grant funding are encour-aged to apply for Part C funding. Eligible Part C grantees, and grantees awarded Part C funding through the fiscal year 2015 Funding Opportunity Announcement, would need to meet the legislative requirements in Part C regarding use of funds. This will result in more Part C programs providing women, infants, children, youth focused services, which means increased access to proven medical care for these pop-ulations across the country. HRSA will ensure that Part C grantees meet the needs of these populations through grant monitoring and technical assistance. THE 340 B DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM Question. The President's budget requests $17 million for the Office of Pharmacy Affairs (OPA) to improve program integrity and administration of the 340B Federal drug discount program. Congress provided $10 million in the fiscal year 2014 Omni-bus, an increase of $6 million over fiscal year 2013, for program integrity consistent with existing requirements and recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. Please provide an fiscal year 2014 implementation plan for the program integrity effort and describe what has been accomplished to date with the increase in funding. How is HRSA prioritizing its program oversight activities? Answer. The $6 million of additional funding provided in the Omnibus Appropria- tions Act for fiscal year 2014 have enabled HRSA to develop a robust strategy to more effectively oversee the covered entities and manufacturers that participate in our program. Please find a detailed outline of our areas of investment that follows. Manufacturer Compliance \u2014We are devoting resources to implement provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to prevent overcharges to 340B covered entities. \u2014The resources will upgrade our current internal-facing pricing database, pro- viding a secure access mechanism for covered entities and the capacity for HRSA's Office of Pharmacy Affairs to conduct ceiling price verification. \u2014The contract will be awarded this summer and upgrades will be complete in 2015. \u2014Work has begun to finalize rulemaking on Civil Monetary Penalties for manu- facturers and Administrative Dispute Resolution. Covered Entity and Manufacturer Compliance \u2014We are investing in a new compliance management system that will create a sophisticated tracking system for all covered entities and manufacturers partici-pating in the 340B program. \u2014We have designed a system overview for proposal, and the contract for building the system will be awarded this summer. Full implementation is expected in fiscal year 2015. Covered Entity Compliance \u2014Five additional auditors, and one audit coordinator, will be hired in order to in- crease the number of program audits conducted. The resulting increase in au-dits will be seen in fiscal year 2015 when hiring is complete and new staff have been trained. Overall Program Integrity \u2014We are have hired 2 staff and plan to hire 6 additional staff in the Office of Pharmacy Affairs to manage and analyze information from expanded program integrity efforts. This includes Program Integrity Specialists, Data Analysts, 310 and an individual devoted to technical assistance and education. Staff will re- view audits and other compliance related activities, develop policy, manage and analyze data, and continue work on implementing 340B ACA provisions. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD J. D URBIN MENTAL HEALTH Question. According to USDA, 50 million people live in rural America. This rural population is disproportionately affected by mental health disorders with higher lev-els of depression, along with domestic violence, and child abuse than their urban peers. Unfortunately many families in rural American find themselves cut off from men- tal health services, because of geographic and cultural barriers. As of January 2013, there are 3,800 Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas nationwide, as defined by HRSA. More than 85 percent of MHPSAs are in rural areas. As a result of the scarcity of mental health professionals, primary care providers in rural communities typically have a larger role in mental healthcare than their urban peers. Studies have shown that stigma is a significant concern for many in rural Amer- ica. People suffering from a mental disorder are less likely to seek treatment if they fear being recognized. In light of this stark data, what steps is the agency taking to increase the mental health workforce in rural settings? What steps is HRSA taking to better integrate mental health and primary healthcare in rural hospitals and FQHCs? What steps does HRSA propose for further addressing the scarcity of mental providers in rural settings? Answer. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) is one of the Administration's most effective tools for getting healthcare providers to the areas where they are needed most, with half of all NHSC clinicians serving in community health centers. In fiscal year 2013, nearly one in three clinicians (2,854 as of September 2013) in the NHSC was a behavioral and mental health professional, which includes psychia-trists, health service psychologists, clinical social workers, licensed professional counselors, marriage and family therapists, psychiatric physician assistants, and psychiatric nurse specialists. All NHSC behavioral and mental health practitioners serve in high-need, underserved areas that have a mental Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designation. The fiscal year 2015 President's budget also includes a $3.96 billion increase in funding for the National Health Service Corps over 6 years, the largest increase in the program's history. This increase will build and sustain an annual field strength of 15,000 and create incentives for providers to practice in the areas of the country that need them most. Since 2010, based on historical data, over 27 percent of the total field strength has been behavioral and mental health practitioners. In addition, HRSA is implementing programs that help train additional behav- ioral health providers. The Mental and Behavioral Health Education and Training (MBHET) Program supports accredited graduate schools and programs of social work and accredited doctoral psychology schools, programs and pre-degree intern-ship organizations to increase the number of behavioral health providers serving the medically underserved populations, including rural areas. It is estimated that over 2,900 individuals will be trained as a result of these activities. In fiscal year 2014, HRSA partnered with SAMHSA to expand the behavioral health workforce as part of the President's plan to prevent gun violence. The initia-tive will include $35 million to expand training for roughly 3,500 behavioral health professionals and paraprofessionals, including master's level social workers, psy-chologists and marriage and family therapists, as well as various behavioral health paraprofessionals. The program will include an emphasis on training to address the needs of children, adolescents, and transition-age youth (ages 16-25) and their fami-lies. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget includes a request to continue to fund this effort. HRSA's Graduate Psychology Education Program supports clinical training pro- grams for doctoral-level psychology students to address the behavioral health needs of vulnerable and underserved populations. In Academic Year 2012-2013, the most recent data available over a third of the individuals supported in this program are from rural or disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition, more than half of individuals who received a financial award and completed their training reported that they were currently employed or pursuing further training in a Medically Underserved Community. 311 Further, in January, the Vice President announced a $50 million Funding Oppor- tunity Announcement to expand access to behavioral health services at approxi-mately 200 existing health centers nationwide. Health centers will be able to use these new funds, made available through the Affordable Care Act, for efforts such as hiring new mental health and substance use disorder professionals, adding men-tal health and substance use disorder services, and employing team-based models of care. All current health center grantees, nearly half of which serve rural areas, were eligible to apply for this funding. ORAL HEALTH Question. According to HRSA, 108 million Americans currently lack access to den- tal coverage. In fact, a large number of people with dental insurance coverage lack access to dental care. The U.S. has 141,800 working dentists and 174,100 dental hy-gienists. However, according to HRSA data, there are 4,230 dental health profes-sional shortage areas nationwide with 49 million people living in them. More than 16 million children in the United States go without seeing a dentist each year. Particularly vulnerable are children living in rural areas. Although the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides comprehensive oral health coverage, dental care is the greatest unmet health need among children. More con-cerning, many dentists refuse to treat Medicaid beneficiaries, citing low reimburse-ment rates and administrative burdens. In 2009, HRSA embarked on an Oral Health Initiative, which included a series of Institute of Medicine reports. Based on this work, what has the agency done to implement the recommendations from the Initiative to close the coverage gap? States with the highest Medicaid reimbursement rates still have children enrolled in Medicaid who aren't able to access adequate oral healthcare. What is the agency's position on expanding the number of mid-level professionals to provide care in un-derserved areas? Answer. HRSA has used the IOM reports to advance its work to expand access to oral healthcare. In 2012, HRSA/MCHB launched the Perinatal & Infant Oral Health National Initiative in tandem with the release of the MCHB-funded docu-ment: Oral Health Care During Pregnancy: A National Consensus Statement. This effort responds to three of the IOM committee's Organizing Principles for an HHS Oral Health Initiative: reduce oral health disparities (#4), explore new models f o r... delivery of care (#5), and promote collaboration among private and public stakeholders (#8). Concrete examples of success will include: increased utilization of preventive dental care by pregnant women, establishment of a dental home for in-fants by age one, reduced prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC), and reduced dental expenditures. In 2013, HRSA initiated the first phase of this initiative, fund-ing the Perinatal and Infant Oral Health Quality Improvement Pilot grant program. The outcome will put into practice and continuously assess a statewide approach that responds to the comprehensive oral health needs of pregnant women and in-fants most at risk. In 2014, HRSA will award funding to establish the Perinatal and Infant Oral Health Quality Improvement National Learning Network. This learning network will coordinate the development and testing of an evidence-informed stra-tegic framework that can inform statewide healthcare systems transformation. Knowledge gained will comprise the National Strategic Framework for Improving Perinatal and Infant Oral Health through Systems Change. HRSA also entered into a cooperative agreement with the National Network for Oral Health Access to provide specialized training and technical assistance to HRSA awardees around increasing access to primary oral healthcare services for under-served and vulnerable populations. In February 2014, HRSA issued a report on the Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice (http://www.hrsa.gov/ publichealth/clinical/oralhealth/primarycare/integrationoforalhealth.pdf) as part of an initiative that strives to improve access for early detection and preventive inter-ventions by expanding oral health clinical competency of primary care clinicians, leading to improved oral health. Furthermore, HRSA is supporting a pilot project to demonstrate implementation of a core set of clinical competencies for primary care clinicians in three Community Health Centers. The IOM reports have also in-formed work on an HHS Oral Health Strategic Framework by the HHS Oral Health Coordinating Committee. HRSA is also deploying its programs to increase access to oral health services. In the National Health Service Corps, the numbers of oral health providers (dentists and registered dental hygienists), have nearly tripled since 2008, increasing from approximately 480 to 1,300 in 2013. As of the end of fiscal year 2013, 164 dentists, committed to work in underserved areas, are currently in the training pipeline, being supported by the NHSC Scholarship Program. 312 HRSA's oral health workforce training programs providing financial support to over 390 students, residents and fellows participating in degree, residency or fellow-ship programs in dentistry, public health and/or dental hygiene. In Academic Year 2012-2013, these programs trained over 2,600 oral health students and 517 primary care dental residents. The State Oral Health Workforce Improvement Program provides grants to States to implement innovative programs to address their dental workforce needs in a manner that is appropriate to the States' individual needs. As part of this program States have used HRSA funds for dentist recruitment and retention efforts, ex-panded training in community settings, increased preventive services such as dental sealant and fluoride programs, and expansion of clinical services in underserved areas. HRSA has provided funding to support curriculum development for dental thera- pists and development of community prevention programs using expanded practice dental hygienists. HRSA grantees have undertaken activities related to the use of alternative oral health providers with the goal of expanding the number of oral health providers and increasing access to oral health services. POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION Question. Maternal depression is often unrecognized and untreated because preg- nant and postpartum women are not universally screened for depression. Estimates of depression during pregnancy range between 14 and 23 percent. Rates of postpartum depression in the first year range from 5 to 25 percent. What is the assessment of HHS on the adequacy of current research into the causes of postpartum depression? Does HHS have a position on the value of uni-versal screening as a meaningful goal and will the agency work with the Congress to encourage it? What is HHS doing to increase access to mental health services for low-income mothers? Answer. HHS supports numerous efforts to address the problem of depression among pregnant and postpartum women in the areas of research, prevention, screening, and care. In the U.S., we know that approximately 12 percent of recent mothers (2009) who had a birth in the past 2-9 months reported postpartum depres-sion. We also know that postpartum depression disproportionately affects mothers with less education and with lower incomes, as well as American Indian/Alaska Na-tive mothers. Research has shown that risk factors or possible causes of postpartum depression include previous depressive episodes, stressful life events, and low social support. HHS, through the National Institutes of Health, is conducting research examining the epidemiologic characteristics of severe postpartum depression, the effects of the high levels of stress hormones experienced by pregnant women living in poverty, the effects of postpartum depression on infants, and effective treatments for this type of depression. Regarding universal screening for postpartum depression, the Department, has re- viewed healthcare research and found the following: \u2014perinatal depression is one of the most common complications of the perinatal period; \u2014validated screening tools exist that demonstrate high levels of both sensitivity and specificity (at least for major depression); and \u2014screening and intervention demonstrate better outcomes for women experi- encing perinatal depression. However, the agency does not recommend universal screening at this time due to an insufficient evidence base for how and when to screen and intervene, especially as it relates to non-White women. Further study in these areas is needed. HHS is also supporting a number of programs to increase access to mental health services for low-income and disadvantaged mothers, especially in the area of screen-ing and care for pregnant and postpartum women. HRSA supports the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which provides voluntary, evi-dence based home visiting services for low income pregnant and postpartum women and their families in all 50 States, DC and territories. All home visitors assess ma-ternal depression with valid depression screening tools, and they provide referrals to community mental health services as available and as needed. The program has established a new collaborative this year that focuses on optimizing the manage-ment of maternal depression. HRSA also supports the Healthy Start program, which focuses on reducing infant mortality and improving perinatal outcomes in areas of high need throughout the country. All Healthy Start grantees screen their clients for perinatal depression before, during, and after pregnancy. Screening is repeated 313 throughout the pregnancy, with screening frequency dependent upon the woman. If the woman is found to need services related to depression, she is referred for appro-priate care. Healthy Start has also developed perinatal screening booklets and mate-rials for materials in English and Spanish, which have been widely disseminated. Finally, SAMHSA supports Project LAUNCH (Linking Actions for Unmet Needs in Children's Health) which seeks to promote the wellness of young children from birth to 8 years by addressing the physical, social, emotional, cognitive, and behav- ioral aspects of their development. One area in which Project LAUNCH focuses is on the strengths and challenges within the family system, including parental de-pression. SAMHSA is also preparing to launch a toolkit on maternal depression for family service providers that includes basic information about maternal depression, tips, resources and strategies for talking with women about depression, screening for depression and referral to mental health services. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN Question. HRSA invests a great deal of resources on doctors in training and also for continuing medical education. What can HRSA do to help educate providers about appropriate narcotic prescription drug dispensement and how to avoid excess prescribing? Answer. HRSA supported training is not specifically focused on training in pre- scribing narcotic medications for pain management; however, this topic is addressed as part of training curricula for many health disciplines. Through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program, HRSA will seek to increase education about appropriate narcotic prescription drug dispensement to NHSC providers through various available media, including webinars, newsletters and social media. Question. As you know, the United States has the lowest ratio of primary care providers in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. American medical students often choose specialist training over primary care train-ing. How can we incentivize medical students to choose primary care specialties? Answer. The administration recognizes that primary care is the foundation of the healthcare delivery system today, and it will play an even greater role in the future. HRSA funds several programs that aim to encourage physicians to select a pri- mary care specialty. Through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) programs, students and clinicians receive scholarship or loan repayment awards in return for a commitment to provide primary health services in underserved areas (HPSAs) for at least 2 years. In fiscal year 2013, 100 percent of all new NHSC loan repayment awards were made to those serving in HPSAs of highest need (scores of 14 or high-er) and nearly half of NHSC clinicians are serving at rural sites. In fiscal year 2015, HRSA expects to fund over 10,000 new NHSC loan repayment awards in order to build and sustain a field strength of 15,000 primary care providers across the coun-try, serving the primary care needs of more than 16 million patients in high-need rural, urban, and frontier areas across the United States. In fiscal year 2012, the NHSC launched the Student to Service Loan Repayment Pilot Program which pro-vides loan repayment awards to medical students in their last year of school as an incentive to pursue residency training in a primary care specialty. To date, 147 med-ical students have participated in this pilot program. In fiscal year 2015, the NHSC expects to award 100 new Student to Service Loan Repayment awards. In addition to the recruitment of providers, the NHSC also works to retain pri- mary care providers in underserved areas after their service commitment is com-pleted to further leverage the Federal investment and to build more integrated and sustainable systems of care. A 2012 retention assessment survey found that 55 per-cent of NHSC clinicians continue to practice in underserved areas 10 years after completing their service commitment. Another recent study completed in fiscal year 2013 showed 85 percent of those who had fulfilled their service commitment re-mained in service to the underserved in the short-term. Short-term is defined as up to 2 years after their service completion. The Primary Care Training Enhancement (PCTE) program strengthens primary care by supporting innovation in primary care curriculum development, education and practice (i.e. Patient-Centered Medical Homes, team-based care, etc.) as well as expanding training opportunities by funding primary care residency positions. In Academic Year 2012-2013, the PCTE program trained a total of 23,830 physician and physician assistant students, medical residents, and fellows. Of those individ-uals trained, approximately 532 received direct financial support. In addition, in fiscal year 2012, HRSA modified the Scholarships for Disadvan- taged Students Program to better support the primary care workforce by giving pri-314 ority to applicants who could demonstrate a 15 percent or better rate of graduates practicing in primary care. The program provides funding to eligible health profes-sions schools to support scholarships for financially needy students from disadvan-taged backgrounds. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget includes a new Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education program that will train 13,000 new physicians over 10 years. This new Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education Program will ex-pand residency slots, with a focus on ambulatory and preventive care in order to advance the ACA's goals of higher value healthcare that reduces long-term costs. Successful applicants will need to demonstrate that their training of residents ad-dresses key workforce objectives, such as: training and retaining residents in pri-mary care and providing comprehensive primary care that includes oral health, be-havioral health, prevention and population health. Question. How do you ensure that funding for primary care training will not only go to large tertiary care teaching hospitals but also the smaller clinics and commu-nity hospitals that make up the backbone or primary care? Answer. HRSA actively seeks to expand primary care training in community- based, ambulatory settings. The Affordable Care Act created the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program to help move primary care training into community-based settings. The 5-year investment in this program is expected to support the community-based training of over 600 new primary care physician and dental residents by 2015. The program supports community-based training sites in 30 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and FQHC look-alikes, 2 Area Health Education Centers, 2 Native American Health Authorities, 1 Community Mental Health Clinic and 4 additional community-based entities. To build on the success of the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Edu- cation program, the President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes a new initiative to expand residency training and build the health workforce needed for a changing healthcare system. The Targeted Support for Graduate Medical Education Program will focus specifically on key priorities for workforce development and transforming the healthcare delivery system. The program will fund new residency slots using a competitive approach in which applicants demonstrate how their training of resi-dents addresses key workforce objectives, such training in new models of care that are interprofessional. Unlike Medicare GME, which is only paid to hospitals, this funding will be avail- able to consortia of teaching hospitals and other community-based healthcare enti-ties, as well as to consortia of community-based healthcare entities. Consortia part-ners would partner to deliver a broad range of training experiences in different set-tings to strengthen experiential training in ambulatory care settings where the vast majority of the public receive care. Question. The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) administers grants to incorporate telehealth in underserved and rural communities. What is HRSA doing to help States like New Hampshire with a many rural communities benefit from telemedicine access? Answer. The Telehealth Network Grant Program (TNGP) helps communities build the human, technical, and financial capacity to develop sustainable telehealth pro-grams. These networks can be used to deliver quality healthcare to medically under-served populations in rural and frontier communities and also to provide informa-tion and training to healthcare providers in remote areas. Currently the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) funds 20 TNGP grantees, including Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital located in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Additionally, OAT funds the Telehealth Resource Center Grant Program (TRC), which provides funding to 14 centers of excellence that assist healthcare organiza-tions, healthcare networks, and healthcare providers in the implementation of cost- effective telehealth programs to serve rural and medically underserved areas and populations. The Northeast Telehealth Resource Center provides technical assist-ance to rural communities in New England (including New Hampshire), and New York. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR JERRY MORAN PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUND Question. What is the overall strategy in determining what HHS programs are funded with the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF)? What internal departmental discussions take place to determine which agencies are recipients from and which agencies are donors to the Fund? 315 Answer. Funding decisions for the Prevention Fund were made using the same formulation process used to develop the annual Federal budget and was decided in conjunction with other annual budget decisions. HHS works with public health, pro-grammatic, and scientific experts in agencies across the department to identify effec-tive and proven strategies that will improve health outcomes, promote prevention, and aim to reduce the cost of healthcare. Funds allocated to agencies are directly appropriated to HHS and are not based on contributions from agencies. NONRECURRING EXPENSES FUND Question. What analyses does the Department do before moving unobligated funds into the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund? Please detail this process. Answer. Prior to moving unobligated funds into the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund (NEF), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) works closely with the program offices in determining which funds are eligible. HHS is restricted in the types of Federal funds that may be transferred to the NEF. Funds must be expired and unobligated, meaning the funding is not available for current year obligations and is not obligated to a vendor or grantee. However, statutory requirements (31 U.S.C. 1551-1558) require expired unobligated balances be used for routine adjust-ments to previously recorded obligations, meaning not all expired unobligated funds may be transferred to the NEF. As an account nears its time of cancellation, HHS is able to identify with more accuracy the amounts eligible to transfer. These unobli-gated balances would otherwise cancel or return to the Department of the Treasury if not transferred to the NEF. In addition, HHS may only obligate funds after noti-fying the Committees on Appropriations in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the planned use. Question. How does HHS decide what information technology (IT) projects merit Nonrecurring Expenses Fund dollars? Answer. HHS has used the NEF to fund critical capital acquisition projects nec- essary for the operation of the Department. NEF funded projects have reduced the financial impacts on current year funds, thus ensuring appropriations support key programs targeted by Congress. When the Department considers funding a project with NEF funds, the HHS Office of the Chief Information Officer and subject matter experts conduct a thorough review of each project to confirm that each project is eli-gible to receive NEF funding consistent with HHS legal authority, regulations, and policies. Question. Does HHS solicit formal or informal requests from agencies for Non-re- curring Expenses Fund-related projects? Please provide details on what each HHS agency requested. Answer. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does work with components to determine investments made through use of the Nonrecurring Ex-penses Fund (NEF). As part of the budget development process, HHS examines the needs across the agency seeking to balance funds availability, project timing, and optimal use of the fund sources available. Determining eligibility on a specific project is a fluid process with multiple stages including internal review, subject mat-ter expert review, and approval by the Office of Management and Budget. In the fiscal year 2015 Congressional Justification to the Committees on Appropriations, HHS listed potential project investments, specifically financial system moderniza-tion and information technology infrastructure investments. Question. What programs would have received funding over the past 2 years had funding not been siphoned off to fund the implementation of the health insurance Exchanges? Answer. The NEF has funded a number of critical capital acquisition projects identified by the Department other than the implementation of the health insurance Marketplace, including the beginning work on financial system modernization, ena-bling HHS to upgrade its core financial platform for both functionality and security reasons, critical Cybersecurity infrastructure upgrades, and the initial stages for ac-quisition of an electronic case processing system in the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals. This system will aide in the processing of appeals and secure docu-ments that are currently stored in paper files. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Question. Describe the role of the department's Chief Information Officer in the oversight of IT purchases. How is this person involved in the decision to make an IT purchase, determine its scope, oversee its contract, and oversee the product's con-tinued operation and maintenance? Answer. HHS is a federated environment where IT purchase decisions are made at the Operating Division (OpDiv) level. To improve departmentwide visibility, the 316 HHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) chartered the HHS Domain Governance Office which provides oversight for IT acquisitions across the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services. The Domain Governance Office requires that OpDivs within HHS share IT acquisition and project forecasts through the Annual Procurement Forecast System. The HHS Chief Information Officer is a member of the IT Steering Committee, which reviews planned acquisitions and projects to di-rect strategy and to prioritize investments. Question. Describe the existing authorities, organizational structure, and report- ing relationship of your department Chief Information Officer. Note and explain any variance from that prescribed in the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (The Clinger-Cohen Act) for the above. Answer. The Department level Chief Information Officer (CIO) provides varying levels of oversight to HHS's OpDivs in regard to the Clinger-Cohen Act. Many of the authorities are delegated to the OpDiv CIOs, such as governance, program training and management since the OpDiv CIOs have a direct line of sight into their investments. Since the HHS CIO operates in a decentralized funding structure, the office is working towards efforts to increase its ability to strategically manage the Department's IT portfolio via the three Domains of the IT Steering Committee: Ad-ministrative, Health and Human Services, and Scientific Research. There is also an HHS CIO Council in order to provide transparency and communications throughout HHS. Question. What formal or informal mechanisms exist in your department to en- sure coordination and alignment within the CXO community (i.e., the Chief Infor-mation Officer, the Chief Acquisition Officer, the Chief Finance Officer, the Chief Human Capital Officer, and so on)? How does that alignment flow down to depart-ment subcomponents? Answer. The IT Steering Committees (ITSCs) that were recently chartered include membership from the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO). Additionally, the Deputy CFO has a Financial Governance Board that in-cludes representation from the Chief Information Officer (CIO), CAO, Chief of Budg-et, and the Chief Human Capital Officer. The ITSC charter is built upon informa-tion from the Senior Procurement Executive regarding use and analysis of the An-nual Procurement Forecast in order to leverage HHS's buying power proactively. The CIO has also been proactively engaging with the Chief Human Capital Officer in transformative processes used to hire IT professionals. Question. How much of the department's budget goes to Demonstration, Mod- ernization, and Enhancement of IT systems as opposed to supporting existing and ongoing programs and infrastructure? How has this changed in the last 5 years? Answer. In fiscal year 2014, 12.4 percent of HHS's total IT budget will go to De- velopment, Modernization, and Enhancement (DME) of IT Systems. When Grants to States and Local IT investments are excluded (representing 40 percent of the total HHS fiscal year 2014 IT budget), the DME portion rises to 20.2 percent. In each case, the trend over the past 5 years has been downward from a high of 22 percent in fiscal year 2010. An off-trend spike to 24.6 percent (30.8 percent without grants) in fiscal year 2011 represents DME activity related to implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Question. Where and how are you taking advantage of this administration's ''shared services'' initiative? How do you identify and utilize existing capabilities elsewhere in government or industry as opposed to recreating them internally? Answer. HHS used the administration's ''shared services'' initiative to institu- tionalize shared services requirements across the Department. A dedicated workgroup under the purview of the Enterprise Architecture Review Board devel-oped HHS's Shared Services Strategy which illustrates the long-term strategy and sets the foundations to successfully develop, deploy, and use shared services at HHS. To promote the identification and reuse of services, HHS documented and published the Shared Services Catalog (available to all HHS employees through the intranet). This catalog contains a list of services available to use across HHS or within a specific Operating Division (OpDiv). Additionally, HHS contributed a list of cross-Agency services to Uncle Sam's List so other Agencies can reuse HHS's services. A publicly available summary of the Shared Services Strategy can be found here: http://www.hhs.gov/ocio/ea/sharedservices.html. HHS continues to leverage cloud computing technologies, through carefully as- sessing technical, security, and contractual requirements to ensure seamless inte-gration to avoid disruption of current services and the mission that we provide for the American public. Question. Provide short summaries of three recent IT program successes, projects that were delivered on time, within budget, and delivered the promised functionality 317 and benefits to the end user. How does your department define ''success'' in IT pro- gram management? Answer. Human Resources IT (HRIT) .\u2014The HRIT Shared Service project is in progress and has gone through the Enterprise Project Life Cycle (EPLC) with the approval to proceed to the final phase of implementation. The implemented solution is expected to provide HHS with a true end-to-end hire to retire solution that im-proves data integrity by eliminating errors caused by using three separate platforms (HR, Time & Labor, Pay). The project is expected to be fully implemented on time and within budget. HRIT will strengthen internal controls and support the administration's PortfolioStat initiative which seeks opportunities to shift to commodity IT, leverage technology, procurement, and best practices across the whole of government, and build on existing investments. By implementing HRIT as a shared service, HHS is poised to achieve: \u2014reduction of manual data calls; \u2014implementation of a single data entry, multiple use model; \u2014elimination of manual data reconciliation processes; \u2014reduction in the number of handoffs to effect routine HR actions. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Implementation .\u2014HHS identified operational improvements to the Department Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) program in order to reduce costs and enhance security. The ICAM program reviewed the proposed design for the enhancements in the HHS Access Management System (AMS) to simplify the efforts by applications to integrate with the Depart-ment-wide Single Sign-On system. HHS has a mature capability to allow user access to the HHS network with a PIV badge issued at Level of Assurance (LOA 4). HHS also has the capability to accept PIV or Common Access Card (CAC) credentials from other Federal agencies/departments for access to applications that are inte-grated with the HHS Access Management System for Single Sign-On services. At this time there are 18 Enterprise systems and 5 Operational Division specific sys-tems integrated with AMS. HHS LMS SABA 7.2 Upgrade .\u2014The HHS Learning Portal, also referred to as the LMS (Learning Management System), is utilized by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide a single standardized training recording system for all of HHS. The LMS is currently used by approximately 80,000 HHS employees and 20,000 contractors. The LMS software is provided by Saba and is hosted by General Strategies (GS). GS also provides technical and consulting support to HHS for the LMS and associated technologies. HHS took advantage of new technology in SABA version 7.2 with a major upgrade that enabled the LMS application to run more efficiently and allow employees to have a more enjoyable user experience. Defining IT Program Management Success at HHS .\u2014Success at HHS in IT Pro- gram Management is supported by the HHS Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) established in 2008. It is an essential part of our IT management and gov-ernance. The process provides a framework for planning, managing and monitoring projects to ensure our projects are sufficiently resourced, well managed and achieve their objectives. In addition, the EPLC ensures compliance with a variety of IT man-agement mandates, including: security, privacy, records management, and accessi-bility. All HHS IT projects are required to follow the EPLC. The Department's ongoing commitment to the alignment between IT and business processes, organization structure, and strategy has strengthened Program Manage-ment at HHS. At the highest levels, this alignment is achieved through proper inte-gration of enterprise architecture, business architecture (business need), process de-sign, organization design, and performance metrics to provide value and support the mission of HHS. Question. What ''best practices'' have emerged and been adopted from these recent IT program successes? What have proven to be the most significant barriers encoun-tered to more common or frequent IT program successes? Answer. Best Practices .\u2014The Department will be offering an IT Project Manage- ment Training contract for all Operating Divisions to enhance the technical skill set of our project management community. HHS has also taken an active approach to advertise and reuse services that are shared between Government agencies, citizens, and industry at one or more levels. HHS has developed a catalog of inter-agency, intra-agency, and intra-OPDIV serv-ices that can be shared within HHS and with all Federal agencies as seen in our Shared Services Catalog. Currently, HHS offers 170 services within specific OPDIVs, across HHS, and to other Federal agencies. HHS also utilizes CIO Council Meetings as a forum within which best practices are collaboratively shared between the participating HHS Operational Divisions. 318 Significant Barriers .\u2014Some of the most significant barriers to IT program success are ensuring that secured and trusted information is constantly updated and mon-itored to align with the rapidly changing technology environments. The lengthy ac-quisition process itself can be a barrier to IT success given the rapid pace at which technologies continually evolve. Other notable barriers include a risk adverse cul-ture, lack of accountability, and shared risk. Lastly, one of the Department's most valuable resources is our Federal work- force\u2014hiring people with the right skill sets for the job. The HHS OCIO has pre-viously relied strongly on contract support to supplement our Federal workforce. OCIO is in the process of hiring Federal staff to fulfill the needs within areas of Enterprise Architecture, capital planning and project management. The hiring of these candidates will allow us to build a reliable, talented and innovative workforce within the agency that can help accelerate the goals of HHS. Question. Describe the progress being made in your department on the transition to new, cutting-edge technologies and applications such as cloud, mobility, social networking, and so on. What progress has been made in the CloudFirst and ShareFirst initiatives? Answer. HHS continues to make progress in transitioning to new, cutting-edge technologies and applications departmentwide. HHS has operationalized and inte-grated a departmentwide Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) security authorization process and is actively using FedRAMP. HHS is developing cloud based use cases that will enable other programs to implement and manage cloud computing systems in accordance with best practices and Federal standards, to improve the transition to a cloud environment. Question. How does your department implement acquisition strategies that in- volve each of the following: early collaboration with industry; RFP's with perform-ance measures that tie to strategic performance objectives; and risk mitigation throughout the life of the contract? Answer. Within the OCIO's office, the Vendor Management office provides out- reach and serves as a conduit to industry and the CIO's principal office to connect those vendors who provide products and services that meet the needs and require-ments for projects that are underway or in the planning stage. Each departmentwide RFP is developed based on the requirements and needs of the Operating Divisions. Service Level Agreements and other performance measures are included to ensure these requirements are met in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Question. According to the Office of Personnel Management, 46 percent of the more than 80,000 Federal IT workers are 50 years of age or older, and more than 10 percent are 60 or older. Just 4 percent of the Federal IT workforce is under 30 years of age. Does your department have such demographic imbalances? How is it addressing them? Does this create specific challenges for attracting and maintaining a workforce with skills in cutting edge technologies? What initiatives are underway to build your technology workforce's capabilities? Answer. OCIO completed an organizational assessment in March 2014 to update vision, goals, core principles and strategic mapping of OCIO goals which included efforts to position the IT workforce to readily meet new and complex challenges. OCIO is engaging the workforce through a series of communications efforts to in-clude quarterly Town Halls, monthly Brown Bag discussions with the CIO and pro-motion of close engagements and frequent communications between managers and employees. Communication efforts also include OCIO branding to reflect the one- team focus in response to OCIO customers. An IT Community Workforce Plan is under development which will allow us to: \u2014identify IT goals and external workforce trends; \u2014identify impact on IT Talent; \u2014establish the resulting talent needs; \u2014identify gaps in our IT competencies; and \u2014describe how IT is to attract high-quality talent and build the best IT team. Question. What information does your department collect on its IT and program management workforce? Please include, for example, details about current staffing versus future needs, development of the talent pipeline, special hiring authorities, and known knowledge gaps. Answer. HHS has a CIO Workplan that sets goals for each OpDiv. The overall goal is to create and administer a comprehensive plan that aligns with the Informa-tion Resource Management Strategic Plan and day-to-day work of HHS IT employ-ees that motivates them to achieve their best. One of the goals for 2014 is to develop an IT Community Workforce Development Plan to: \u2014provide challenging projects to work; \u2014ensure skills stay current with training; 319 \u2014hold employees accountable to deliver; and \u2014reward top performers. The OCIO is developing an IT workforce plan and establishing an OCIO led work- ing group to prioritize goals and implement this activity by expanding opportunities for leadership, training, and workforce development. We will position the IT work-force to meet new and complex challenges by promoting collaboration and enabling free flow of information to others who can use it to advance public health and human services. Additionally, OCIO is actively sponsoring student interns to engage new IT professionals in government services through the Pathways program and the Student Volunteer Program. QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY SENATOR RICHARD C. S HELBY AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTERS Question. The Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) program received a $1.8 million increase in fiscal year 2014. Please provide an explanation on how these funds were used, including a rationale for the allocation between the Infrastructure Development Grants and the Point of Service and Maintenance Grants. In the re-sponse, please include a comparison of the funding allocation to the past 2 fiscal years. Answer. HRSA is currently exploring options for fiscal year 2014 to support the AHEC program with available resources. The options may include increasing fund-ing to current AHEC grantees to the amount requested in their fiscal year 2012 grant proposals, or supporting new AHEC centers. Use of the funds will be consistent with past years, and with the requirements of the fiscal year 2012 funding opportunity announcement of the program. Recog-nizing that Infrastructure Development (ID) grantees need additional funding sup-port, the fiscal year 2012 AHEC Program funding opportunity announcement distin-guished between the ID and Point of Service Maintenance and Enhancement (POSME) phases of the program. These phases were treated as two separate options with distinct funding levels in the grant competition. AHEC ID applicants were able to request for up to $250,000 for each center, and AHEC POSME applicants were able to request up to $102,000 per AHEC center. The grant competition and review processes for each of the phases also play a fac- tor in how funding is allocated within program. No formula or targeted ratio of funding is utilized in making decisions for how much funding is allocated to grant-ees applying for the two phases. The proposals and funding requests of the grantees and the merit evidenced through their separate objective reviews guide decision-making for which grantees should receive an award, and at what amount. Applica-tions for both phases of the program received an objective and independent peer re-view performed by a committee of experts who assessed the technical merit of each grant application. In the case of this program, the objective review committee also made a specific recommendation for each application as applicable to approve or dis-approve any new center(s) requested. Last, based on the advice of the objective re-view committee, the HRSA was responsible for final selection of grantees and allo-cating funding as able per the grantee's requests, and in making these decisions consideration was given to the Sense of the Congress per section 751 of the Public Health Service Act ''that every State have an area health education center program in effect under this section.'' Question. Why has HRSA held back funding for building approved centers when grantees included these in their budget when they were awarded multicenter grants? Answer. While the fiscal year 2013 enacted budget for the AHEC program did in- clude an increase in funding for the AHEC program, sequestration significantly re-duced available funding, and there was not sufficient funding for new activity with-in the AHEC program to support all of the new centers that had been proposed to be added in fiscal year 2013. Accordingly, funding for existing AHEC activity was prioritized and no new AHEC centers were funded in fiscal year 2013. Note that, in anticipation of budgetary constraints, the Notices of Award for all fiscal year 2012 grantees informed them of the fact that funding for new center(s) would depend on future appropriation levels. Specifically, the Notices of Award Stat-ed if the fiscal year 2013 appropriation level for the AHEC program is the same or less than the fiscal year 2012 appropriation level, the additional new center(s) may not be funded. 320 Senator H ARKIN . And I would just say publicly, my good friend from Kansas, that Ms. Burwell is testifying tomorrow before my other committee, the authorizing committee. Hopefully, we will get her through and get her in place soon. I will, as the chairman, give her some time. Working with my ranking member here, I hope that sometime after she gets settled and gets fully briefed up, that we will have her up here to talk about implementation. CONCLUSION OF HEARINGS Senator M ORAN . Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I welcome that. I have requested an appointment with the nominee and ex-pect to have that within the next few days. I look forward to get-ting acquainted with her. The point I would make is that this kind of hearing that we just had today is valuable, but it ought not be in lieu of a Secretary. We ought to do this kind of thing on an ongoing basis, and I wel-come the opportunity to work with you to accomplish that. Senator H ARKIN . Thank you very much, Senator Moran. Thank you all very much. And with that, the committee will stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 11:40 a.m., Wednesday, May 7, the hearings were concluded, and the subcommittee was recessed, to reconvene at the call of the Chair.] (321) DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 U.S. S ENATE , SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS , Washington, DC. [CLERK 'S NOTE .\u2014The subcommittee was unable to hold hearings on departmental and nondepartmental witnesses. The statements and letters of those submitting written testimony are as follows:] DEPARTMENTAL WITNESSES PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC TELEVISION STATIONS AND THE PUBLIC BROADCASTING SERVICE On behalf of America's 170 public television licensees, we appreciate the oppor- tunity to submit testimony for the record on the importance of Federal funding for local public television stations and PBS. We urge the Subcommittee to support level funding of $445 million in 2-year advance funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in fiscal year 2017, and pre-sequester level funding of $27.3 mil-lion for the Ready To Learn program at the Department of Education in fiscal year 2015. Corporation for Public Broadcasting\u2014fiscal year 2017 Request: $445 million, 2-year advance funded Local stations and PBS are committed to serving the public good in education, public safety, creating a well-informed citizenry, preserving and promoting Amer-ican history and culture, and other essential fields. Federal funding for CPB makes these services possible and is deserving of continued support. The overwhelming ma-jority of Americans agree. In a bi-partisan Hart Research Associates/American View-point poll, nearly 70 percent of American voters, including majorities of self-identi-fying Republicans, Independents, and Democrats support continued Federal funding for public broadcasting. In addition, polls show that Americans consider PBS to be the second most appropriate expenditure of public funds, behind only military de-fense. Over 70 percent of the Federal funding for CPB goes directly to local stations, re- sulting in a nationwide system of locally owned and controlled, trusted, community- driven and community-responsive media entities that form an incredibly successful public-private partnership providing unique and essential local public services. Education Local public television stations are America's largest classroom, meeting their communities' lifelong education needs by providing the highest quality educational content and resources on multiple media platforms and in person. Public television's exceptional content, available to nearly every household in America, has helped more than 90 million pre-school age children get ready to learn and succeed in school. PBS, in partnership with local public television stations, has created PBS LearningMedia, an online portal where educators can access more than 35,000 standards-based, curriculum-aligned interactive digital learning objects created from public television content, as well as material from the Library of Congress, National Archives and other high-quality sources. More than 1.3 million teachers are reg-322 istered to use PBS LearningMedia in K-12 classrooms serving millions of students throughout the country. In addition, twenty-eight thousand homeschoolers use PBS LearningMedia to enrich their curriculum in history, science, the arts and other subjects. Public television stations also operate virtual high schools that bring high- quality instruction in the most specialized fields to the most remote locations in our country. Through the American Graduate Initiative, CPB and public media stations are working to confront the dropout crisis in America's high schools by providing re-sources and services to raise awareness, coordinate action with local community partners, and work directly with students, parents, teachers, mentors, volunteers and leaders to lower the drop-out rate in their respective communities. In addition, by operating one of the most comprehensive non-profit GED programs in the coun-try, public television stations have helped hundreds of thousands of second-chance students and adult learners get their high-school equivalency certificates and pre-pare themselves for meaningful work in a competitive marketplace. Public television stations have made it a top priority to help retrain the American workforce, including veterans, by providing digital learning opportunities for those looking for training, licensing, continuing education credits and more. Partners in Public Safety Public broadcasting stations throughout the country are also leading innovators and irreplaceable partners to local public safety officials\u2014working in communities with schools, businesses and stakeholders to provide real-time emergency support for local law officials in times of crisis. In many communities, public broadcasting stations are the last locally-owned and operated media outlets\u2014serving as a critical public safety life line. The Nation's digital presidential alert and warning system depends on the back- bone infrastructure of local public television stations to deliver critical national mes-sages. This same digital infrastructure provides the backbone for emergency alert, public safety, first responder and homeland security services in many states and local communities. Stations are partnering with their local emergency responders to customize and utilize public television's infrastructure for public safety in a variety of critical ways: equipping police cars with school blueprints when a crisis arises, providing access to 24/7 camera feeds for a variety of security challenges, connecting public safety agencies in real time, and more. Local public television stations are also using their broadcast equipment to help send emergency alert text messages to cell phone subscribers through their providers\u2014reaching citizens wherever they are, even when the power is out. Many local stations are serving as their states' primary Emergency Alert Service (EAS) hub for weather and AMBER alerts. Supporting an Informed Citizenry Public television strengthens the American democracy by providing citizens with access to the history, culture and civic affairs of their communities, their states and their country. Local public television stations serve as the ''C-SPAN'' of many state governments, providing the most remote corners of the country with access to the state legislative process, Governors' messages, court proceedings and more. As one of the only locally-owned and operated media remaining in America, public tele-vision provides more public affairs programming, local history, arts and culture, candidate debates, specialized agricultural news, and citizenship information of all kinds than anyone else in the media universe. Public Broadcasting is a Smart Investment All of this is made possible by the Federal funding to CPB which amounts to an annual cost of about $1.35 per year for each American. On average, Federal funding for CPB makes up approximately 15 percent of local television station's budgets. However, for many smaller and rural stations, Federal funding represents more than 30-50 percent of their total budget. This funding is particularly important to rural stations that struggle to raise local funds from individual donors due to the smaller and often economically strained population base. At the same time it is often more costly to serve rural areas due to the topography and distances between communities. As a result, public broadcasters, with their commitment to universal service, are often the only local broadcaster serving rural communities. For all sta-tions, Federal funding is the ''lifeblood'' of public broadcasting, providing critical seed money to local stations that enables them to build additional support from state legislatures, private foundations and corporations, and ''viewers like you.'' Public broadcasting creates important economic activity while providing an essen- tial educational and cultural service. For every Federal dollar, local public media stations raise an additional six dollars in non-Federal funding, providing a strong public-private partnership and an impressive 6 to 1 return on investment.

PBS KIDS Mathematics Transmedia Suites in Preschool Homes and Communities. A Report to the CPB-PBS Ready to Continued tion, public broadcasting supports approximately 20,000 jobs, with the vast majority in local public television and radio stations in hundreds of communities across America. Two-Year Advance Funding Two-year advance funding is essential to the mission of public broadcasting. This longstanding practice, proposed by President Ford and embraced by Congress in 1976, establishes a firewall insulating programming decisions from political inter-ference, enables the leveraging of funds to ensure a successful public-private part-nership, and provides stations with the necessary lead time to plan in-depth pro-gramming and curriculum coordination with educational institutions Public television's history of editorial independence has been rewarded in unprece- dented levels of public trust\u2014for the eleventh consecutive year, the American people have ranked PBS as one of the most trusted national institutions. Advance funding and the firewall it provides between the development of content and extraneous in-terference and control is vital to maintaining this credibility among the American public. In addition, local public broadcasting stations leverage the 2-year advance funding to raise state, local and private funds, ensuring the continuation of this strong pub-lic-private partnership. These Federal funds act as essential seed money for fund-raising efforts at every station, no matter its size, and since many state legislatures are part-time institutions that budget State funds on a 2-year cycle and relate state funding to Federal funding, advance Federal funding is essential to the success of this unique partnership Finally, the 2-year advance funding mechanism also gives stations and producers the critical lead time needed to partner with local community organizations and plan and produce high-quality programs. The signature series that demonstrate the depth and breadth of public television, like Ken Burns's The Civil War, take several years to produce. In addition, 2-year advance funding is essential to the creation of local programming over multiple fiscal years as stations convene the community to identify needs, recruit partners, conduct research, develop content and deliver serv-ices. Ready To Learn\u2014fiscal year 2015 Request: $27.3 million (Department of Education) The Ready To Learn (RTL) competitive grant program uses the power of public television's on-air, online, mobile, and on-the-ground educational content to build the literacy and STEM skills of children between the ages of two and eight, espe-cially those from low-income families. Through their RTL grant, CPB and PBS are delivering evidence-based, innovative, high-quality transmedia content to improve the math and literacy skills of high-need children via broadcast television, the Inter-net, mobile and other dynamic new technologies. CPB and PBS, in partnership with local stations, have been able to ensure that the kids and families that are most in need have access to these groundbreaking and proven effective educational re-sources. In addition to the content, CPB and PBS are creating new tools like a so-phisticated progress tracking system that gives parents the means to measure stu-dent progress, in real time. Results RTL is rigorously evaluated for its appeal and efficacy so the program can con- tinue to offer America's youngest citizens the tools they need to succeed in school and in life. Studies show that RTL content has a significant and positive effect on the educational lives of children who use it. Highlights of recent studies show that: use of PBS KIDS content and games by low-income parents and their preschool chil-dren improves math learning and helps prepare children for entry into kinder- garten; 1use of RTL content has been associated with a 29 percent improvement in reading ability in children grades K-2;2and parents who used RTL math resources in the home became considerably more involved in supporting their children's learn-ing outcomes. 3In combination, RTL games, activities and videos provide early 324 Learn Initiative. Redwood City, CA: WestEd. McCarthy, B., Li, L., Tiu, M. (2012). PBS KIDS Mathematics Transmedia Suites in Preschool Homes. Redwood City, CA: WestEd learners with the critical math and literacy skills needed to succeed in school, and in the process, help level the academic playing field. An Excellent Investment In addition to being research-based and teacher tested, the RTL Television pro- gram also provides excellent value for our Federal dollars. In the last 5-year grant round, public broadcasting leveraged an additional $50 million in funding to aug-ment the $73 million investment by the Department of Education for content pro-duction. Without the investment of the Federal government, this supplemental fund-ing would likely end. The Dangers of Consolidation The President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes consolidating RTL into a larger grant program. APTS and PBS oppose this proposal as it would abandon the unique national-local partnership that has resulted in RTL's ground-breaking educational impact on kids nationwide, particularly those with limited access to other edu-cational resources. The current model effectively uses an economy of scale to create high-quality television and online content at the national level and then distribute it through local stations who can tailor outreach to the specific needs of their com-munities. This model allows PBS and local stations to annually reach 80 percent of America's children ages 2 to 8 through television and another 13 million per month online and on mobile apps. The national-local partnership has made RTL tre-mendously efficient and effective and consolidation or elimination of the program would severely affect the ability of local stations to respond to their communities' educational needs, eliminating the critical resources provided by this program for children, parents and teachers. RTL symbolizes the mission of public media and is a successful public-private partnership that leverages Federal funds to create the most appealing and impactful children's educational content that is supplemented by online and on-the-ground resources. Without the RTL program, millions of fami-lies would lose access to this incredible high-quality education content, especially the low-income and underserved households that are a particular focus of this pro-gram. Conclusion Americans across the political spectrum rely on public broadcasting\u2014on tele- vision, on the radio, online, and in the classroom\u2014because we provide essential edu-cation, public safety, and informed citizenry services that are not available any-where else. And none of this would be possible without the Federal investment in public broadcasting. A 2007 GAO report concluded that these Federal Community Service Grants are an irreplaceable source of revenue for public broadcasting, and a 2012 study requested by this Subcommittee and conducted by an independent third party for CPB came to the same conclusion as the GAO: Federal funding for public broadcasting is irreplaceable. For all of these reasons we request that Congress continue its commitment to the highly successful, hugely popular public-private partnership that is public broad-casting by providing level funding of $445 million in fiscal year 2017 for the 2-year advance of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and pre-sequester level funding of $27.3 million in fiscal year 2015 for the stand alone Ready To Learn Program. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO Dear Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran and Members of the Sub- committee: Thank you for this opportunity to urge the Subcommittee's support for an annual Federal investment of $445 million in America's public media system through annual appropriations to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). With your support, the public radio system, consisting of some 950 locally managed, locally controlled and locally programmed stations, serves communities all across America. And these stations are as diverse as the communities they represent. Pub-lic radio is committed to being America's public radio, bringing the diverse and changing voices of Americans to the airwaves and the new platforms that so many Americans are using. We strive to create a more informed public, one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and culture within the United States and across the globe. The public radio system, a uniquely American public service, non-commercial, media enterprise, includes stations in every State capitol and hundreds of American 325 communities, large and small, urban and rural. Producers and distributors of public radio programming, including American Public Media (APM), Public Radio Inter-national (PRI), the Public Radio Exchange (PRX) and NPR are united by a commit-ment to the highest standards of journalist ethics. Every minute of every program broadcast to some 38 million Americans weekly is routed through the Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), a content distribution utility owned by the public radio system. Partnerships and collaborations are integral components of the programming and service found in the public radio system. Available on air, online, and on new and emerging mobile platforms, public radio is expanding its ability to reach audiences. And as traditional media undergoes dramatic changes, public radio is positioning itself to serve the needs of a growing audience in a shifting media landscape and rapidly changing world. A clear example of these new adaptations to improve journalism and meet audi- ence needs comes from the recently formed merger between St. Louis Public Radio and the St. Louis Beacon newspaper, the area's two largest nonprofit news organiza-tions. This move combines newsrooms and significantly changes the face of inde-pendent local news in the region by providing more depth and perspective on issues and stories that impact the community. The consolidation creates an innovative model for a multiplatform news operation that results in more in-depth coverage of urban events and issues. St. Louis Public Radio's move to join forces and expand serves as an example of how public radio news organizations are adjusting to an ever-changing media environment that involves greater competition for consumers and financial support. This new merger is just one among a growing list of public broadcasters teaming up with other nonprofit news outlets to beef up their local and investigative jour-nalism. In Denver, Rocky Mountain PBS, public radio station KUVO, and I-News, the Rocky Mountain Investigative News Network, merged to create a cross-platform news operation that could better cover Colorado. WWNO in New Orleans hired its first-ever news director last spring to expand its coverage of stories. Oregon Public Broadcasting is building a statewide news network with 40 to 50 small news outlets across Oregon. Lastly, Harvest Public Media, a reporting collaboration of public radio stations KCUR, KBIA, Iowa Public Radio, Nebraska Public Broadcasting, KUNC and WUIS, focuses on issues of food, fuel and field. Based at KCUR in Kan-sas City, Harvest covers these agriculture-related topics through an expanding net-work of reporters and partner stations throughout the Midwest. But the partnerships don't stop there for public radio. A recent collaboration in- cludes Boston's WBUR and NPR joining forces to expand and re-launch the daily public radio show Here & Now as a two-hour national news program for audiences in the middle of the day. The program airs weekday afternoons and is aggressively updated to provide local audiences with live, updated news coverage during mid- day. Public radio's partnerships with public safety officials play a critically important role when natural or man-made disasters strike. Public radio stations provide essen-tial and timely public emergency information, such as evacuation routes, shelter lo-cations and severe weather updates. Effective emergency warnings allow people to take actions that save lives, and reduce damage and human suffering. Federal fund-ing helps to bring crucial news and alerts to millions of Americans. Public radio's innovative partnerships also expand our public service mission by enabling radio reception to all Americans during local emergency situations. This year, 26 public radio stations based in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas are working with NPR Labs, the Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security/FEMA to demonstrate the delivery of emergency alerts to people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. This is the first effort to deliver real-time accessibility-targeted emergency messages, such as weather alerts, via radio broadcast texts. Our hope is to expand the pilot over time to other regions of our country thru the use of radio equipment to reach people who are both deaf and blind and non-English speaking. In addition, many public radio stations provide critical services through partner- ships with radio reading services. These long established centers are in every major market in the United States to provide millions of visually impaired persons the ability to function more independently in their communities. Music in America would sound very different without public radio. Local stations take creative risks, nurture new talent, and give emerging artists a chance to be heard. They celebrate traditional music genres like classical and jazz, and partner with local music organizations to take these art forms to new heights of performance excellence and new audiences. And they play a key role in their local music econo-mies, sustaining and growing the careers of musicians by connecting them to local 326 listeners. Across the country, more than 180 local public radio stations have full- time music formats and more than 650 stations air play music as part of their pro-gramming lineups. Mr. Chairman and Senator Moran, public radio is essential in providing news, in- formation and cultural programming to America and connecting with audiences wherever they are. We're embracing America's changing demographics and using digital media to connect better, more quickly and in more diverse ways. Today's public radio isn't going away, it's going everywhere and we are working every day to earn the trust of the 38 million Americans who rely on us for news and insights that guide and inform. We ask for your continuing support in funding for stations that serve your communities, your constituents and America's Democracy. [This statement was submitted by Michael Riksen, Vice President\u2014Policy & Rep- resentation, National Public Radio.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD Ms. Chairwoman and Members of the Committee: We are pleased to present the following information to support the Railroad Retirement Board's (RRB) fiscal year 2015 budget request of $112,150,000 for our retirement, unemployment and other programs. The RRB administers comprehensive retirement/survivor and unemployment/sick- ness insurance benefit programs for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Acts. The RRB also has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit pay-ments and Medicare coverage for railroad workers. The RRB has also administered special economic recovery payments and extended unemployment benefits under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) and extended unemployment benefits under the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assist-ance Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-92). More recently, we have administered ex- tended unemployment benefits under the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Re-authorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-312), the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-78), the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-96) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-240). During fiscal year 2013, the RRB paid $11.7 billion, net of recoveries, in retire- ment/survivor benefits to about 568,000 beneficiaries. We also paid $84.5 million in net unemployment/sickness insurance benefits to more than 26,000 claimants. Tem-porary extended unemployment benefits paid were $6.8 million. In addition, the RRB paid benefits on behalf of the Social Security Administration amounting to $1.4 billion to about 113,000 beneficiaries. PROPOSED FUNDING FOR AGENCY ADMINISTRATION The President's proposed budget would provide $112,150,000 for agency oper- ations, which would enable us to maintain a staffing level of 860 full-time equiva-lent staff years (FTEs) in 2015. The proposed budget would also provide $2,500,000 for information technology (IT) investments for the conversion of a legacy Program Accounts Receivable (PAR) system to a modern accounts receivable module within our cloud-based core financial system that was implemented October 1, 2013. AGENCY STAFFING The RRB's dedicated and experienced workforce is the foundation for our tradition of excellence in customer service and satisfaction. Like many Federal agencies, how-ever, the RRB has a number of employees at or near retirement age. About 63 per-cent of our employees have 20 or more years of service, and over 28 percent of our current workforce will be eligible for retirement by fiscal year 2015. As we continue to modernize our information technology infrastructure to automate and convert manual workloads, our agency will also improve training delivery and reporting within our workforce. We plan to acquire and implement a Learning Management System that will provide a comprehensive functionality for training administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of e-learning education and training programs. This will allow the agency to improve all aspects involved in the learning process to meet our human capital needs as we experience a high rate of change in personnel. Furthermore, we will complement this initiative by implementing an executive training program to prepare and mentor future agency leaders that are ready to replace a significant number of senior leaders within the agency that are eligible to retire. 327 In connection with these workforce planning efforts, the President's budget re- quest includes a legislative proposal to enable the RRB to utilize various hiring au-thorities available to other Federal agencies. Section 7(b) (9) of the Railroad Retire-ment Act contains language requiring that all employees of the RRB, except for one assistant for each Board Member, must be hired under the competitive civil service. We propose to eliminate this requirement, thereby enabling the RRB to use various hiring authorities offered by the Office of Personnel Management. Also, our budget request includes a legislative proposal to clarify the authority of the Railroad Retire-ment Board to retain in the competitive civil service attorneys hired prior to a change in OPM policy in 2013. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS We are actively pursuing further automation and modernization of the RRB's var- ious processing systems to support the agency's mission to administer benefit pro-grams for railroad workers and their families. In fiscal year 2015, funding is in-cluded for contractor support to complete the full design of the Financial Manage-ment Integrated System (FMIS) by migrating a benefit payment feeder system named Program Accounts Receivable (PAR) to FMIS. FMIS migration from an obso-lete financial system was started Oct 1, 2012 and completed Oct 1, 2013. Due to reduction in funds of the FMIS program during the sequestered fiscal year, PAR mi-gration into FMIS was delayed. Once completed, the PAR migration to FMIS will enhance the processing of debt transactions for improper benefit payments in an in-tegrated financial system hosted in a cloud environment. We expect PAR migration to FMIS to reduce staffing requirements and improve efficiency of the improper pay-ment process. OTHER REQUESTED FUNDING The President's proposed budget includes $34 million to fund the continuing phase-out of vested dual benefits, plus a 2 percent contingency reserve, $680,000, which ''shall be available proportional to the amount by which the product of recipi-ents and the average benefit received exceeds the amount available for payment of vested dual benefits.'' In addition, the President's proposed budget includes $150,000 for interest related to uncashed railroad retirement checks. FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE TRUST FUNDS Railroad Retirement Accounts\u2014The RRB coordinates its financial needs with the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (Trust), the Trust was established by the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 (RRSIA) to manage and invest railroad retirement assets. Pursuant to the RRSIA, the RRB has transferred a total of $21.276 billion to the Trust. All of these transfers were made in fiscal years 2002 through 2004. The Trust has invested the transferred funds, and the results of these investments are reported to the RRB and posted periodi-cally on the RRB's website. Through December 2013, the Trust had transferred ap-proximately $15.4 billion to the Railroad Retirement Board for payment of railroad retirement benefits. The net asset value of Trust-managed assets on September 30, 2013, was approximately $25.0 billion, an increase of almost $1.4 billion from the previous year. In June 2012, we released the 25th Actuarial Valuation of the railroad retirement system required by Sections 15(g) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974. That re-port also met the requirements of Section 22 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, and Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983. The report ad-dressed the 75-year period 2011-2085, including projections of the status of the re-tirement trust funds under three employment assumptions. It concluded that bar-ring a sudden, unanticipated, large decrease in railroad employment or substantial investment losses, the railroad retirement system would experience no cash flow problems for the next 23 years. Even under the most pessimistic assumption, the cash flow problems would not occur until the year 2035. The report did not rec-ommend any change in the rate of tax imposed by current law on employers and employees. The RRB's latest annual report required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retire- ment Solvency Act of 1983 was released in June 2013. The overall conclusion was that barring a sudden unanticipated, large decrease in railroad employment or sub-stantial investment losses, the railroad system will experience no cash flow prob-lems during the next 25 years. Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account\u2014The RRB's latest annual report on the financial status of the railroad unemployment insurance system was issued in June 2013. The report indicated that even as maximum daily benefit rates will rise 328 approximately 42 percent (from $66 to $94) from 2012 to 2023, experience-based contribution rates are expected to keep the unemployment insurance system solvent, except for small, short-term cash-flow problems in 2015 and 2016 under the most pessimistic assumption. However, projections show quick repayment of any loans by the end of each fiscal year. Unemployment levels are the single most significant factor affecting the financial status of the railroad unemployment insurance system. However, the system's expe-rience-rating provisions, which adjust contribution rates for changing benefit levels, and its surcharge trigger for maintaining a minimum balance, help to ensure finan-cial stability in the event of adverse economic conditions. No financing changes were recommended at this time by the report. Thank you for your consideration of our budget request. We will be happy to pro- vide further information in response to any questions you may have. [This statement was submitted by Michael S. Schwartz, Chairman, Walter A. Bar- rows, Labor Member, and Jerome F. Kever, Management Member, Railroad Retire-ment Board.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL , RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: My name is Martin J. Dickman, and I am the Inspector General for the Railroad Retirement Board. I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the members of the Subcommittee for your continued support of the Office of Inspector General. BUDGET REQUEST The President's proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 would provide $8,750,000 to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) to ensure the continuation of the OIG's inde-pendent oversight of the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB). During fiscal year 2015, the OIG will focus on areas affecting program performance; the efficiency and effec-tiveness of agency operations; and areas of potential fraud, waste and abuse. OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS The OIG has three operational components: the immediate Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Audit (OA), and the Office of Investigations (OI). The OIG conducts operations from several locations: the RRB's headquarters in Chicago, Illi-nois; an investigative field office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and five domicile in-vestigative offices located in Virginia, Texas, California, Florida, and New York. These domicile offices provide more effective and efficient coordination with other Inspector General offices and traditional law enforcement agencies, with which the OIG works joint investigations. OFFICE OF AUDIT The mission of the Office of Audit (OA) is to promote economy, efficiency, and ef- fectiveness in the administration of RRB programs and detect and prevent fraud and abuse in such programs. To accomplish its mission, OA conducts financial, per-formance, and compliance audits and evaluations of RRB programs. In addition, OA develops the OIG's response to audit-related requirements and requests for informa-tion. During fiscal year 2015, OA will focus on areas affecting program performance; the efficiency and effectiveness of agency operations; and areas of potential fraud, waste, and abuse. OA will continue its emphasis on long-term systemic problems and solutions, and will address major issues that affect the RRB's service to rail beneficiaries and their families. OA has identified four broad areas of potential audit coverage: Financial Accountability; Railroad Retirement Act and Railroad Un-employment Insurance Act Benefit Program Operations; Railroad Medicare Program Operations; and Security, Privacy, and Information Management. OA must also ac-complish the following mandated activities with its own staff: Audit of the RRB's financial statements pursuant to the requirements of the Accountability of Tax Dol-lars Act of 2002, evaluation of information security pursuant to the Federal Infor-mation Security Management Act (FISMA), and an audit of the RRB's compliance with the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010. During fiscal year 2015, OA will complete the audit of the RRB's fiscal year 2014 financial statements and begin its audit of the agency's fiscal year 2015 financial statements. OA contracts with a consulting actuary for technical assistance in audit-ing the RRB's ''Statement of Social Insurance'', which became basic financial infor-mation effective in fiscal year 2006. In addition to performing the annual evaluation 329 of information security, OA also conducts audits of individual computer application systems which are required to support the annual FISMA evaluation. Our work in this area is targeted toward the identification and elimination of security defi-ciencies and system vulnerabilities, including controls over sensitive personally identifiable information. OA undertakes additional projects with the objective of allocating available audit resources to areas in which they will have the greatest value. In making that deter-mination, OA considers staff availability, current trends in management, Congres-sional and Presidential concerns. OFFICE OF INVESTIGATIONS The Office of Investigations (OI) focuses its efforts on identifying, investigating, and presenting cases for prosecution, throughout the United States, concerning fraud in RRB benefit programs. OI conducts investigations relating to the fraudu-lent receipt of RRB disability, unemployment, sickness, and retirement/survivor ben-efits. OI investigates railroad employers and unions when there is an indication that they have submitted false reports to the RRB. OI also conducts investigations in-volving fraudulent claims submitted to the Railroad Medicare Program. These inves-tigative efforts can result in criminal convictions, administrative sanctions, civil penalties, and the recovery of program benefit funds. OI INVESTIGATIVE RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013 Civil Judgments Indictments/Informations Convictions Recoveries/Receivables 37 47 81 1$414,254,000 1This total includes the results of joint investigations with other agencies. OI anticipates an ongoing caseload of about 400 investigations in fiscal year 2015. During fiscal year 2013, OI opened 156 new cases and closed 238. At present, OI has cases open in 48 States, the District of Columbia, and Canada with estimated fraud losses of nearly $217 million. Disability fraud cases represent the largest por-tion of Ol's total caseload. These cases involve more complicated schemes and often result in the recovery of substantial amounts for the RRB's trust funds. They also require considerable resources such as travel by special agents to conduct surveil-lance, numerous witness interviews, and more sophisticated investigative tech-niques. Additionally, these fraud investigations are extremely document-intensive and require forensic financial analysis. Of particular significance is an ongoing disability fraud investigation in New York. To date, 33 individuals have been indicted; 28 of these have pleaded guilty and five more were convicted in Federal court. In addition, 44 former railroad em-ployees avoided prosecution by admitting their role in the fraud and agreeing to the termination of their benefits. OI agents will likely have to spend a substantial amount of time traveling to New York for continuing investigations and trial prepa-ration in fiscal year 2015. During fiscal year 2015, OI will continue to coordinate its efforts with agency pro- gram managers to address vulnerabilities in benefit programs that allow fraudulent activity to occur and will recommend changes to ensure program integrity. OI plans to continue proactive projects to identify fraud matters that are not detected through the agency's program policing mechanisms. CONCLUSION In fiscal year 2015, the OIG will continue to focus its resources on the review and improvement of RRB operations and will conduct activities to ensure the integrity of the agency's trust funds. This office will continue to work with agency officials to ensure the agency is providing quality service to railroad workers and their fami-lies. The OIG will also aggressively pursue all individuals who engage in activities to fraudulently receive RRB funds. The OIG will continue to keep the Subcommittee and other members of Congress informed of any agency operational problems or de-ficiencies. [This statement was submitted by Martin J. Dickman, Inspector General, Rail- road Retirement Board.] 330 NONDEPARTMENTAL WITNESSES PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS Dear Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Re- lated Agencies: The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics appreciates the opportunity to submit tes- timony for the fiscal year 2015 appropriations. The Academy is the world's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, and is committed to improving the Nation's health with nutrition services and interventions provided by registered die-titian nutritionists. Nationwide, The Academy has over 75,000 members. As Congress begins work on fiscal year 2015 appropriations, we strongly urge you to fully fund Federal nutrition programs that will provide a return on investment to improve health. Investment in these programs through the appropriations process will help prevent costly healthcare expenses due to chronic diseases. Senior Nutrition Funding: Administration for Community Living (ACL) The congregate and home-delivered (commonly known as Meals on Wheels) senior nutrition programs, the Native American Nutrition Program, and the Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP) are the largest and most visible components of the Older Americans Act. We strongly believe that the funding levels for the senior nutrition programs under the Administration for Community Living must be ade-quate, as these programs are key to keeping this population independent and in their homes. The President's budget proposes no increase for the senior nutrition programs in fiscal year 2015, yet we know that fuel and food costs\u2014primary costs borne by senior nutrition programs\u2014continue to increase. This is extremely alarm-ing as these programs ensure that vulnerable older adults can continue to receive cost-effective nutrition services, ultimately saving Medicare and Medicaid dollars. Due to an ever-increasing demand for services, even flat funding will result in sev-eral million fewer home-delivered and congregate meals served, which could lead to more expensive hospitalizations or a need for long term care for older adults who cannot safely prepare meals themselves. The Academy strongly supports the President's fiscal year 2015 request for $20 million for Preventive Health Services under the Older Americans Act. This pro-gram provides grants to States and Territories to support activities that educate older adults about the importance of health lifestyles and promotes healthy behav-iors that can help to prevent or delay chronic disease and disability, thereby reduc-ing the need for costly medical interventions. The Academy also supports the Administration's proposal for standalone funding of $8 million for Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs (CDSMP) in the Ad-ministration for Community Living. CDSMP is a low-cost, evidence-based disease prevention model that utilizes state-of-the-art techniques to help older Americans with chronic diseases better manage their conditions and improve their health sta-tus, thus reducing their need for more costly medical care such as hospital care and hospital readmissions. According to the National Center for Chronic Disease Preven-tion and Promotion, seven out of ten deaths and more than three-quarters of all health expenditures for older adults are the result of preventable chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, arthritis and depression. In addition, the Academy supports the President's fiscal year 2015 request for $25 million in funding for the Elder Justice Act. Cases of elder abuse, neglect and ex-ploitation are on the rise in this country; recent studies estimate that 14.1 percent of older adults face some sort of abuse, and another study estimates seniors lose a minimum of $2.5 billion each year as a result (MetLife and the National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse). Elder abuse is a major threat to the health of our elderly population. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Funding The Academy respectfully requests adequate funding for CDC's fiscal year 2015 ''core programs.'' We strongly believe that the activities and programs supported by CDC are essential to protect the health of the American people. CDC is faced with enormous challenges and responsibilities, from bioterrorism preparedness to chronic disease prevention and eliminating health disparities. In addition, CDC funds effec-tive community programs including health promotion efforts and nutrition interven-tions that help prevent heart and lung disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, and other chronic diseases. More than 70 percent of CDC's budget supports State and local health organizations and academic institutions. We support the President's budget proposal to reduce chronic diseases through di- abetes funding totaling $140 million and heart disease funding totaling $130 mil-331 lion. These expenditures will help reduce the heavy healthcare cost burden of these two diseases. We also ask that you maintain the fiscal year 2014 funding of $8 million (not the reduced level in the fiscal year 2015 President's Request) for Hospitals Promoting Breastfeeding. According to the CDC, childhood obesity is an epidemic. One in five preschoolers in our country is overweight, and half of these are obese. A baby's risk of becoming an overweight child is reduced with each month that the baby is breastfed. In the US, most babies start breastfeeding, but within the first week, half have already been given formula, and by 9 months, only 31 percent of babies are breastfeeding at all. Hospitals play a critical role in encouraging new moms to breastfeed. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Funding The Academy supports the President' budget of $1.48 billion for food safety. A ro- bust food safety system and the continued implementation of the Food Safety Mod-ernization Act will help reduce food-borne illness that costs the U.S. healthcare sys-tem $88 billion annually. Again, thank you for reviewing these comments and please feel free to contact us for any additional information. [This statement was submitted by Mary Pat Raimondi MS, RD, Vice President, Strategic Policy and Partnerships Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF ACADEMY HEALTH AcademyHealth is pleased to offer this testimony regarding funding for Federal agencies that support health services research and health data, including the Agen-cy for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). AcademyHealth's mission is to support research that leads to accessible, high value, high-quality healthcare; reduces disparities; and improves health. We represent the interests of more than 5,000 scientists and policy experts and 180 organizations that produce and use health services research to improve our Nation's health and the perform-ance of the healthcare and public health systems. For fiscal year 2015, we rec-ommend funding levels of $375 million for AHRQ, $182 million for NCHS, and $32 billion for NIH. The United States spent $2.8 trillion\u201417.2 percent of our economy\u2014on healthcare in 2012. Finding new ways to get the most out of every healthcare dollar is critical to our Nation's long-term fiscal health. Like any corporation making sure it is devel-oping and providing high quality products, the Federal Government\u2014as the Na-tion's largest healthcare purchaser\u2014has a responsibility to get the most value out of every taxpayer dollar it spends on Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insur-ance Program, and veterans' and service members' health. Health services research is our Nation's R&D enterprise for health improvement. Just as medical research discovers cures for disease, health services research dis-covers cures for the health system (see Figure 1). This research diagnoses problems in healthcare and public health delivery and identifies solutions to improve out-comes for more people, at greater value. And while biomedical and clinical research discoveries can take years and even decades to reach patients, discoveries from health services research can be used now by patients, healthcare providers, public health professionals, hospitals, employers, and public and private payers to improve care today. Put plainly, health services research helps Americans get their money's worth when it comes to healthcare. We need more of it, not less. Despite the positive im-pact health services research has had on the U.S. healthcare system, and the poten-tial for future improvements in quality and value, the United States spends less than one cent of every healthcare dollar on this research; research that can help Americans spend their healthcare dollars more wisely and make more informed healthcare choices. AcademyHealth realizes the pressure Congress and the administration face to re- duce the national debt. We respectfully ask that the subcommittee consider the value of health services research in achieving that goal, and to strengthen its capac-ity to address the pressing challenges America faces in providing access to high- quality, efficient care. The following list summarizes AcademyHealth's fiscal year 2015 funding recommendations for agencies that support health services research and health data under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. 332 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ is the only Federal research agency with the sole purpose of producing evi- dence to make healthcare safer; higher quality; more accessible, equitable, and af-fordable; and to ensure that the evidence is understood and used. AHRQ funds health services research and healthcare improvement programs in universities, medical centers, research institutions, hospitals, health clinics, and medical prac-tices that are transforming people's health in communities in every State around the Nation. The science funded by AHRQ provides consumers and their healthcare professionals with valuable evidence to make healthcare decisions. For example, medical societies use AHRQ-funded research to inform their recommendations for treatment of type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. These evidence-informed rec-ommendations give physicians a foundation for describing what the best care looks like, so millions of patients living with these and other conditions may determine what the right care might be for them. AHRQ's research also provides the basis for strategies that prevent medical er- rors, reduce hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and improve patient experiences and outcomes. For example, AHRQ's evidence-based Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections (CUSP)\u2014first applied on a large scale in 2003 across more than 100 ICUs across Michigan\u2014saved more than 1,500 lives and nearly $200 million in the program's first 18 months. The protocols have since been expanded to hospitals in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to continue the national implementation of this approach for reducing HAIs. AcademyHealth joins the Friends of AHRQ\u2014an alliance of health professional, re- search, consumer, and employer organizations that support the agency\u2014in recom-mending a base discretionary funding level of $375 million for AHRQ in fiscal year 2015. National Center for Health Statistics NCHS is the Nation's principal health statistics agency. Housed within the Cen- ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it provides critical data on all as-pects of our healthcare system through data cooperatives and surveys that serve as a gold standard for data collection around the world. AcademyHealth appreciates the subcommittee's support of NCHS in recent years. Such efforts have allowed NCHS to reinstate data collection and quality control efforts, continue the collection of vital statistics, and modernize surveys to reflect changes in demography, geog-raphy, and health delivery. We join the Friends of NCHS\u2014an alliance of health professional, research, con- sumer, industry, and employer organizations that support the agency\u2014in recom-mending an overall funding level of $182 million for NCHS in fiscal year 2015. This funding level will support the agency's core data collection activities, as well as new initiatives to enhance death data timeliness and security, restore survey expansions to better assess access to and utilization of healthcare services, and determine ''what works'' in the organization, financing, and delivery of public health services. National Institutes of Health NIH spends approximately $1 billion on health services research annually\u2014 roughly 3 percent of its entire budget\u2014making it the largest Federal sponsor of health services research. We join the research community in seeking at least $32 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2015. NIH has an important role in the Federal health services research continuum, and is well-positioned to ensure that discoveries from clinical trials are effectively translated into healthcare delivery. AcademyHealth supports efforts to help NIH foster greater coordination of its health services re-search investment among its institutes and across other Federal agencies to avoid duplication. AcademyHealth also recommends that the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) through the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) sustain investment in the full spectrum of translational research (T1-T4). The CTSA program enables innovative research teams to speed discovery and ad-vance science aimed at improving our Nation's health. The program encourages col-laboration in solving complex health and research challenges and finding ways to turn their discoveries into practical solutions for patients. Finally, AcademyHealth supports continued investment by NIH and its many Institutes and Centers in dis-semination and implementation research. This research helps us understand which approaches work to improve population health. In conclusion, the accomplishments of the field of health services research would not be possible without the leadership and support of this subcommittee. We hope the subcommittee gives strong consideration to our fiscal year 2015 funding rec-333 ommendations for the Federal agencies funding health services research and health data. If you have questions or comments about this testimony or wish to know more about health services research, please contact Dr. Lisa Simpson, President and CEO of AcademyHealth or lisa.simpson@academyhealth.org. FIGURE 1: THE HEALTH RESEARCH CONTINUUM These components of the health research continuum work in concert, and each plays an essential role\u2014 any one type of research on its own cannot effectively or appreciably improve health. Take heart disease as one example ... Basic research discov-ered the contributions of elevated blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and tobacco use to heart dis-ease. Clinical research deter- mined which treatments were safe and effective to treat hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, to-bacco addiction, and to prevent and treat heart disease, in general. Population-based re- search identified strate-gies to reduce the risks of heart disease in com-munities through non- medical interventions, such as reduction of trans fats in food and tobacco control meas-ures to reduce smoking. Health services research determined how to best deploy these discoveries to achieve the best health outcomes. This research helped identify who had the least ac-cess, what barriers ex-isted, and how to miti-gate them. This research also led to the develop-ment of quality meas-ures that are now used to report on the quality of cardiac care.

[This statement was submitted by Dr. Lisa Simpson, President & CEO, AcademyHealth.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ADHOCGROUP FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH The Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research is a coalition of patient and voluntary health groups, medical and scientific societies, academic and research organizations, and industry. We appreciate the opportunity to submit this statement in support of enhancing the Federal investment in biomedical, behavioral, social, and population- based research conducted and supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 included a welcome and much need- ed increase for the NIH. However, this increase did not restore all of the funds cut by sequestration in fiscal year 2013 or the purchasing power NIH has lost over the past decade due to inflation. We hope fiscal year 2014 represents a first step toward restoring our Nation's preeminence in medical research. The Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research recommends that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Nation's investment in medical research. The Ad Hoc Group also urges Congress and the Administration to work in a bipartisan manner to end sequestration and the continued cuts to medical research that squander invaluable scientific opportu-nities, discourage young scientists, threaten medical progress and continued im-provements in our Nation's health, and jeopardize our economic future. The Ad Hoc Group is deeply grateful to the Subcommittee for its long-standing and bipartisan leadership in support of NIH. We continue to believe that science and innovation are essential if we are to continue to improve our Nation's health, sustain our leadership in medical research, and remain competitive in today's global information and innovation-based economy. NIH: A Public-Private Partnership to Save Lives and Provide Hope The partnership between NIH and America's scientists, medical schools, teaching hospitals, universities, and research institutions is a unique and highly-productive relationship, leveraging the full strength of our Nation's research enterprise to fos-ter discovery, improve our understanding of the underlying cause of disease, and de-velop the next generation of medical advancements. Approximately 84 percent of the 334 NIH's budget goes to more than 300,000 research positions at over 2,500 univer- sities and research institutions located in every state. The Federal Government has an irreplaceable role in supporting medical research. No other public, corporate or charitable entity is willing or able to provide the broad and sustained funding for the cutting edge research necessary to yield new innova-tions and technologies of the future. Research funded by NIH has contributed to nearly every medical treatment, diag- nostic tool, and medical device developed in modern history, from a new treatment for cystic fibrosis to an awareness campaign that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of infants lost to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to a new vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. We are all enjoying longer, healthier lives thanks to the Federal government's wise investment in this lifesaving agency. Examples of recent clinical breakthroughs made by NIH-supported scientists include: \u2014NIH-funded researchers have discovered a way to harness the body's own im- mune system to fight cancer. The promising results in both adults and children with leukemia lead Science Magazine to name Cancer Immunotherapy as the 2013 Breakthrough of the Year for all of science; \u2014NIH scientists have developed new treatments for hepatitis C\u2014the leading rea- son for liver transplants in the U.S.\u2014that have shortened treatment times and produced cures in 85 to 95 percent of patients, even those with advanced dis-ease; \u2014NIH-funded researchers found that certain molecules in urine can provide an early sign of kidney transplant rejection, a test that allows doctors to act earlier to protect transplanted kidneys; \u2014An NIH-supported clinical trial demonstrated that an intensive early behavioral intervention delivered before the age of 2 years can improve symptoms as well as normalize brain activity in some children with autism; and \u2014NIH-funded scientists developed an innovative method to quickly identify anti- biotics that can treat multidrug-resistant bacteria\u2014and reveal how these bac-teria-killing medications work. For patients and their families, NIH is the ''National Institutes of Hope.'' NIH is the world's premier supporter of merit-reviewed, investigator-initiated basic research. This fundamental understanding of how disease works and insight into the cellular, molecular, and genetic processes underlying life itself, including the impact of social environment on these processes, underpin our ability to conquer devastating illnesses. The application of the results of basic research to the detec-tion, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease is the ultimate goal of medical research. Ensuring a steady pipeline of basic research discoveries while also sup-porting the translational efforts absolutely necessary to bring the promise of this knowledge to fruition requires a sustained investment in NIH. The research supported by NIH drives not only medical progress but also local and national economic activity, creating skilled, high-paying jobs and fostering new products and industries. According to a report released by United for Medical Re-search, a coalition of scientific advocates, institutions and industries, in fiscal year 2011, NIH-funded research supported an estimated 432,000 jobs all across the United States, enabled 13 states to experience job growth of more than 10,000 jobs, and generated more than $62 billion in new economic activity. Stagnant Funding Threatens Scientific Momentum Despite the increase provided in the current year, over the past decade NIH has lost more than 22 percent of its budget after inflation, significantly impacting the Nation's ability to sustain the scientific momentum that has contributed so greatly to our Nation's health and our economic vitality. The leadership and staff at NIH and its Institutes and Centers has engaged patient groups, scientific societies, and research institutions to identify emerging research opportunities and urgent health needs, and has worked resolutely to prioritize precious Federal dollars to those areas demonstrating the greatest promise. But a continued erosion of our national commitment to medical research threatens our ability to support a medical research enterprise that is capable of taking full advantage of existing and emerging sci-entific opportunities. Perhaps one of the greatest concerns is the obstacle these continued cuts will present to the next generation of scientists, who will see training funds slashed and the possibility of sustaining a career in research diminished. NIH plays a significant role in supporting the next generation of innovators, the young and talented sci-entists and physicians who will be responsible for the breakthroughs of tomorrow. The challenges of maintaining a cadre of physician-scientists to facilitate trans- lation of basic research to human medicine, ensuring a biomedical workforce that reflects the racial and gender diversity of our citizenry, and maximizing our Nation's 335 human capital to solve our most pressing health problems will only be addressed through continued support of NIH. NIH is Critical to U.S. Competitiveness Our country still has the most robust medical research capacity in the world, but that capacity simply cannot weather repeated blows such as persistent below-infla-tion funding levels and cuts of sequestration, which jeopardize our competitive edge in an increasingly innovation-based global marketplace. Other countries have recognized the critical role that biomedical science plays in innovation and economic growth and have significantly increased their investment in biomedical science. Between 1999 and 2009, Asia's share (including China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand) of worldwide re-search and development (R&D) expenditures grew from 24 percent to 32 percent, while U.S. R&D expenditures declined from 38 percent to 31 percent. While the U.S. currently leads the world in R&D spending, China's increasing investment in R&D is projected to close the gap and surpass the U.S. in total R&D spending by about 2022. The European Commission also has recently urged its member Nations to in-crease their investment in research substantially, recommending budgets of 80 bil-lion Euro (equivalent to $108 billion) from 2014 to 2020, a 40 percent increase over the previous 7-year period. This shift in funding raises the concern that talented medical researchers from all over the world, who once flocked to the U.S. for training and stayed to contribute to our innovation-driven economy, are now returning to better opportunities in their home countries. We cannot afford to lose that intellectual capacity, much less the jobs and industries fueled by medical research. The U.S. has been the global leader in medical research because of Congress's bipartisan recognition of NIH's critical role. To maintain our dominance, we must reaffirm this commitment to provide NIH the funds needed to maintain our competitive edge. NIH: An Answer to Challenging Times The Ad Hoc Group's members recognize the tremendous challenges facing our Na- tion's economy and acknowledge the difficult decisions that must be made to restore our country's fiscal health. Nevertheless, we believe strongly that NIH is an essen-tial part of the solution to the Nation's economic restoration. Strengthening our commitment to medical research, through robust funding of the NIH, is a critical element in ensuring the health and well-being of the American people and our econ-omy. Therefore, the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research recommends that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Nation's investment in medical research. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AIDS A LLIANCE FOR WOMEN , INFANTS , CHILDREN , YOUTH & F AMILIES Dear Chairman Harkin Ranking Moran, and Members of the Subcommittee: AIDS Alliance for Women, Infants, Children, Youth & Families was founded in 1994 to help respond to the unique concerns of HIV-positive and at-risk women, infants, children, youth, and families. AIDS Alliance conducts policy research, education, and advocacy on a broad range of HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and research issues. We are pleased to offer written testimony for the record in opposition of the fiscal year 2015 budget proposal consolidating Ryan White Part D funding into Part C and in support of maintaining Part D of the Ryan White Program as part of the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies ap-propriations measure. This testimony also has the support of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Ryan White Part D Funding Request Sufficient funding of the Ryan White Program is necessary to provide quality care for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. We thank the Subcommittee for its continuous support of Ryan White Part D Programs, providing $75 million to the program in fiscal year 2014. While the AIDS Alliance for Women, Infants, Children, Youth & Families understands that these are difficult economic times, we are requesting the Subcommittee to maintain its commitment to the Ryan White Part D program and restore its funding eliminated in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal and increase Ryan White Part D funding by $9.9 million in fiscal year 2015. 336 Ryan White Part D Background and History Over concerns with the increase in the number of pediatric AIDS cases, Congress first acted to address pediatric cases in 1987 by providing $5 million for the Pedi-atric AIDS Demonstration Projects in the fiscal year 1988 budget. Those demonstra-tion projects became part of the Ryan White CARE Act of 1990 which today is known as Ryan White Part D and have served thousands of women, infants, chil-dren, youth and families. Since the program's inception in 1988, Part D programs have been and continue to be the entry point into medical care for women and youth and, in many communities or regions, Part D programs are the only perinatal clin-ical service available to serve HIV-positive pregnant women and youth when pay-ments for such services are unavailable from other sources. Ryan White Part D pro-grams have been extremely effective in bringing the most vulnerable populations into and retained in care and is the lifeline for women, infants, children and youth living with HIV/AIDS. The Part D programs are instrumental in preventing mother- to-child transmission of HIV and for ensuring that women, including HIV- positive pregnant women, HIV exposed infants, children and youth have access to quality HIV care. The program is built on a foundation of combining medical care and es-sential support services that are coordinated, comprehensive, and culturally and lin-guistically competent. This model of care addresses the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable populations living with HIV/AIDS in order to achieve optimal health out-comes. In 2012, Part D provided funding to 114 community-based organizations, aca- demic medical centers and hospitals, federally qualified health centers, and health departments in 39 States and Puerto Rico. These federally, directly-funded grantees provide HIV primary care, specialty and subspecialty care, oral health services, treatment adherence monitoring and education services pertaining to opportunities to participate in HIV/AIDS-related clinical research. These grantees also provide support services which include case management (medical, non-medical, and family- centered); referrals for inpatient hospital services; treatment for substance use, and mental health services. Part D grantees also receive assistance from other parts of the Ryan White Program that help support HIV testing and linkage to care services; provide access to medication; additional medical care, such as dental services; and key support services, such as case management and transportation, which all are essential components of the highly effective Ryan White HIV care model. This model has continuously provided comprehensive quality healthcare delivery systems that have been responsive to women, infants, children, youth and families for two dec-ades. A Response to Women, Infants, Children, and Youth The Ryan White Program has been enormously successful in meeting its mission to provide life-extending care and services. Yet, even though we have made signifi-cant progress in decreasing HIV-related morbidity and mortality, much work re- mains to be done. While accounting for less that 6 percent of Ryan White direct care dollars (minus ADAP and Part F), Ryan White Part D programs have been ex-tremely effective in bringing our most vulnerable populations into care and devel-oping medical care and support services especially designed to reach women, chil-dren, youth, and families. Part D funded programs played a leading role in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV-from as many as 2,000 babies born HIV posi-tive in 1990 to roughly 200 cases in 2010 through aggressive efforts to reach out to pregnant women. Appropriate funding is critical to maintain and improve upon this success, as there are still approximately 8,000 HIV-positive women giving birth every year in the United States that need counseling, services and support to pre-vent pediatric HIV Infections. According to the CDC, youth account for 39 percent of all new HIV infections in the U.S. As of 2010, one in four new HIV infections occur among young people ages 13-24. Most new HIV infections in youth (about 70 percent) occur in gay and bisexual males, most of whom are African Americans. Of the new HIV infections among youth, 2,100 are among young women; two-thirds of these are among young African American women. Ryan White Part D programs are the entry point into medical care for many HIV positive youth and leads the Na-tion's effort in recruiting and retaining HIV positive youth to comprehensive medical care and support services. According to the Health Resources and Services Adminis-tration, more than 37 percent of women receiving medical care in Ryan White Pro-grams do so through Part D. Additionally, Part D provides medical and supportive services to a large number of women over 50 who are heading into their senior years as HIV survivors which is a testament to the high standard of care provided to Ryan White Part D programs. Support and care through the Ryan White Part D program was and continues to be funding of last resort for the most vulnerable women and children, who often have fallen through the cracks of other public health safety nets. 337 Full implementation of the Affordable Care Act with continuation of the Ryan White Program will dramatically improve health access and outcomes for many more women, infants, children, and youth living with HIV disease. Proposed Consolidation The medical and supportive services provided by Ryan White Part D are unique and are not currently being provided by other parts of the Ryan White Program, including Ryan White Part C. These services are uniquely tailored to address the needs of women, including HIV positive pregnant women, HIV exposed infants, chil-dren and youth living with HIV/AIDS. The proposed consolidation of Part D funding into Part C in the Federal budget would eliminate a strong safety net for our most vulnerable populations and weaken the systems of care Part D programs have cre-ated and invested in for more than 25 years. Furthermore, the loss of Part D funds in some community areas would profoundly impact access to comprehensive HIV care and treatment for women, infants, children and youth. Many of the population served by Part D will be lost or never enter into care. We will not make progress in ending HIV/AIDS in this country without supporting all of the Parts of Ryan White. Conclusion These are difficult economic times, and we recognize the considerable fiscal con- straints Congress faces in allocating limited Federal dollars as well as the need to reduce administrative burdens associated with the overall operational aspects of Ryan White programs. However, it is unclear how the proposed consolidation of Part D funding into Part C of the program will be implemented to ensure the continu-ation of the delivery of life-saving HIV/AIDS care and treatment to the most vulner-able populations without destabilizing existing models of care created to address the unique needs of these populations. Without the Ryan White Part D program, many of these medically-underserved women, infants, children and youth would not re-ceive the vital primary care and support services traditionally provided to them. The AIDS Alliance for Women, Infants, Children, Youth & Families respectfully requests that the Subcommittee consider this written testimony for the record as you develop your fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill. Thank you. [This statement was submitted by Dr. Ivy Turnbull, Deputy Executive Director, AIDS Alliance for Women, Infants, Children, Youth & Families.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THEAIDS I NSTITUTE Dear Chairman Harkin and Members of the Subcommittee: The AIDS Institute, a national public policy, research, advocacy, and education organization, is pleased to offer comments in support of critical HIV/AIDS and hepatitis programs as part of the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies appropriation measure. We thank you for supporting these programs over the years, and hope you will do your best to adequately fund them in the future in order to provide for and protect the health of many Americans. HIV/AIDS remains one of the world's worst health pandemics. According to the CDC, in the U.S. over 636,000 people have died of AIDS and there are 50,000 new infections each year. A record 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV. Persons of minority races and ethnicities are disproportionately affected. African Americans, who make up just 12 percent of the population, account for 44 percent of new infections. HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects low income people; nearly 90 percent of Ryan White Program clients have a household income of less than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. The U.S. government has played a leading role in fighting HIV/AIDS, both here and abroad. The vast majority of the discretionary programs supporting domestic HIV/AIDS efforts are funded through this Subcommittee. We are keenly aware of current budget constraints and competing interests for limited dollars, but programs that prevent and treat HIV are inherently in the Federal interest as they protect the public health against a highly infectious virus. If not adequately funded, there will certainly be increased infections, more deaths, and higher health costs. With the advent of antiretroviral medicines, HIV has turned from a near certain death sentence to a treatable chronic disease if people have access to consistent and affordable healthcare and medications. Through prevention, care and treatment, and research we now have the ability to actually end AIDS. In 2011, a ground-breaking clinical trial (HPTN 052)\u2014named the scientific breakthrough of the year by Science magazine\u2014found that HIV treatment not only saves the lives of people with HIV, but also reduces HIV transmission by more than 96 percent\u2014proving that HIV 338 treatment is also HIV prevention. In order to realize these benefits, people with HIV must be diagnosed through testing, and linked to and retained in care and treat-ment. We also have a National HIV/AIDS Strategy that sets clear goals and priorities, and brings the Federal agencies addressing HIV together to ensure resources are well coordinated. Over the past 30 years we have made great progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and are truly at a tipping point. However, without stable and adequate funding that progress is in jeopardy, as well as the lives of millions who are or will be infected. The Ryan White Program The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides some level of medical care, drug treatment, and support services to approximately 554,000 low-income, uninsured, and underinsured individuals with HIV/AIDS. With people living longer and contin-ued new diagnoses, the demands on the program continue to grow and many needs remain unmet. According to the CDC, only 37 percent of people living with HIV in the U.S. are retained in HIV care, only 33 percent have been prescribed antiretroviral treatment, and only 25 percent are virally suppressed. We have a long way to go before we can realize the dream of an AIDS-free generation. With contin-ued funding we can improve these numbers and health outcomes. The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), one component of the Ryan White Program, provides States with funds to pay for medications for over 200,000 people. Over the last couple of years, as more infections were identified due to increased HIV testing and people lost their jobs and health insurance, demand on the program far outpaced its budget. This led to ADAP wait lists of 9,300 people. We are thank-ful that President Obama and Congress allocated additional funds, which when combined with assistance from pharmaceutical companies has virtually eliminated the wait list. With inadequate funding that could all change. We urge you to ensure that ADAP and the rest of the Ryan White Program re- ceive adequate funding to keep up with the growing demand. According to NASTAD, enrollment in ADAP increased by 8 percent between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013, and utilization reached its highest level ever. With this increased demand for medications comes a corresponding increase in medical care and support services provided by all other parts of the program. As the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is implemented, there will be expanded oppor- tunities for healthcare coverage for some Ryan White clients. While it will result in some cost shifting for medications and primary care, it will never be a substitute for the Ryan White Program. Over 70 percent of Ryan White Program clients today have some sort of insurance coverage, mostly through traditional Medicaid and Medicare. Their coverage will not change with health reform; the Ryan White Pro-gram will be needed as it is today. The Medicaid expansion is a State option and not all States are moving forward with it at this time. As ACA is implemented, ben-efits will differ from State to State and there will be many gaps that will have to be filled by the Ryan White Program. Plans will not offer all of the comprehensive essential support services that the Program does, such as case management, trans-portation, and nutritional services, that are needed to ensure retention in medical care and adherence to drug treatment. This approach of coordinated, comprehensive, and culturally competent care leads to better health outcomes. Therefore, the Ryan White Program, while it may need to change in the future, must continue and must be adequately funded. The AIDS Institute urges the Committee to reject the President's budget proposal to eliminate dedicated funding for Part D of the Ryan White Program and transfer it to Part C. Part D serves women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS and is a well-established system of care that has worked since 1988 in nearly elimi-nating perinatal infection and providing medical care and family-centered support that helps ensure these vulnerable populations remain in care and adherent to their medications. With youth, particularly black gay youth, being the only population ex-periencing an increase in HIV incidence, we cannot afford to dramatically alter the only Ryan White Program part dedicated to their care. While changes to the struc-ture of the Ryan White Program might be needed in the future, it should not be done through the appropriations process and not without community input. CDC HIV Prevention As a Nation, we must do more to prevent new infections, but we only allocate 3 percent of our HIV/AIDS spending towards prevention. All the care and treatments costs would be saved if we did not have the infections in the first place. Preventing just one infection would save $402,000 in future lifetime medical costs. Preventing 339 all the new 50,000 cases in just 1 year would translate into an astounding $20 bil- lion saved in lifetime medical costs. With more people living with HIV than ever before, there are greater chances of HIV transmission. The CDC and its grantees have been doing their best with lim-ited resources to keep the number of infections stable, but that is not good enough. It is focusing resources on those populations and communities most impacted by HIV and investing in those programs that will prevent the most number of infec- tions. This includes young black gay men, who experienced a 38 percent increase in new infections from 2008-2010 and is a population which merits additional atten-tion and resources With over 200,000 people living with HIV who are unaware of their infection, the CDC is also focused on increased testing programs. Testing people early and linking them to care and treatment is critical not only for their own health outcomes but also in preventing new infections. The CDC estimates that in 2010, 26 percent of all new HIV infections occurred among youth ages 13 to 24. Nearly 75 percent of those infections were among young gay men. Clearly, we must do a better job of educating the youth of our Nation, in-cluding gay youth, about HIV. Adequately funding the HIV Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) will help address this critical need. CDC Viral Hepatitis Prevention Given that more than 5.3 million people in the U.S. are living with hepatitis B and/or C and 65-75 percent of them are undiagnosed, funding for the Hepatitis Pre-vention Division must be increased. With a 25 percent mortality rate among affected baby boomers\u2014those born between 1945 and 1965\u2014and with prevalence rates two times higher than whites for African Americans in that birth cohort, we cannot af-ford to inadequately fund this program. The current amount of only $29 million is far too small to conduct testing, surveillance, and other hepatitis prevention and educational programs for the entire country. Currently there is no national surveil-lance system to track hepatitis infections and testing programs are inadequate; therefore the majority of the millions affected will never become aware of their dis-ease until they present with liver cancer or cirrhosis. Increased funding for testing and surveillance could bring more people into care and treatment allowing them the chance to receive new and more effective treatments that actually can result in cur-ing their hepatitis. HIV/AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) While we have made great strides in the area of HIV/AIDS, there is still a long way to go. Continued research at the NIH is necessary to learn more about the dis-ease and to develop new treatments and prevention tools. Recent breakthroughs have provided functional cures in a few instances in infants and adults. Work also continues on vaccine research as scientists learn more about the disease, and com-bined with cure research it may be possible to see the end of AIDS if funding is maintained. Again, we thank you for your continued support of these programs critical to so many individuals and communities nationwide. We have made great progress, but we are still far from achieving our goal of an AIDS-free generation. We now have the tools, but we need continued leadership and the necessary resources to realize our goal. Thank you. [This statement was submitted by Carl E Schmid II, Deputy Executive Director, The AIDS Institute.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THEAIDS U NITED I am Ronald Johnson, Vice President of Policy and Advocacy at AIDS United writ- ing in reference to HIV funding at the Department of Health and Human Services, on behalf of the 32 organizational members of our Public Policy Committee and our over 90 programmatic directly funded organizational grantees all of whom are many of the leading AIDS Service Organizations across the Nation. AIDS United is a na-tional organization that seeks to end the AIDS epidemic in the United States by combining private-sector fundraising, philanthropy, coalition building, public policy expertise, and advocacy\u2014as well as a network of passionate local and State part-ners\u2014to respond effectively and efficiently to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the commu-nities most impacted by the epidemic. Through its unique Public/Private Partner-ships, Public Policy Committee and targeted special grant-making initiatives, AIDS United and its partners reach over 300 grassroots organizations. These organiza-tions provide HIV prevention, care, treatment, and support services to underserved 340 individuals and populations most impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic including communities of color, women and gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men (MSM) as well as education and training to providers of treatment services. It is our request that you increase funding for the Department of Health and Human Services by $7.361 billion in fiscal year 2015. This request includes an in-crease of $931 million over fiscal year 2014 throughout the detailed request listed below. AIDS United understands the fiscal environment that the country is wrestling with right now is austere. However, we know that investment in prevention and re-tention in HIV care are critical in lowering the number of new infections in the do-mestic HIV epidemic. As competing budget priorities are weighed please keep in mind that HIV is 100 percent preventable, if we as a Nation muster the political will and funding to address domestic HIV on level that meets the needs of the epi-demic. The increased funding for the domestic HIV/AIDS portfolio in fiscal year 2015 will help reach the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS). We look forward to working with you and your Administration in the coming year on the fiscal year 2015 budget. The Ryan White Program Early and reliable access to HIV care and treatment is cost effective and helps patients with HIV live healthy and productive lives. The needs of the Ryan White Program (RWP) continue to grow, even with the beginning of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the integration of the RWP there may still be many needs unmet. In order to improve the continuum of care and progress to-ward an AIDS-free generation, continued, robust funding for all parts of the Ryan White Program in fiscal year 2015 will be necessary. The Ryan White Program works in conjunction with Medicaid, Medicare and now the Affordable Care Act, and as a result we believe more people living with HIV will be able to receive and re-main in care and on treatment. It will take some time for enrollment to occur and assess the impact of the ACA on the Ryan White Program. In the meantime, we urge you to fund the Ryan White Program at a total of $2.44 billion in fiscal year 2015, an increase of $123 million over fiscal year 2014, distributed in the following manner: Part A: $687 million, Part B (Care): B $943 million, Part million, Part Part F/AETC: $35 million, Part F/Dental $15 million. AIDS United disagrees with the President's budget request and does not support the consolidation of Part D with Part C. We believe it should only be considered as part of a larger authorization process after key data questions about the value of consolidation are answered. HIV Prevention CDC HIV Prevention and Surveillance There still are 50,000 new infections annually and about 1 in 6 people living with HIV do not know they have the virus. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 66 percent of all new HIV infections. Between 2008 and 2010, infections among MSM increased by 12 percent, and among MSM aged 13-24 years by 22 percent. Black and Latino MSM, and especially those who are young continue to be disproportionately affected. While we are making progress in decreasing new infections among women, black women accounted for 64 percent of women infected in 2010. Black and Hispanic women ages 13-24 accounted for 82 percent of young women living with HIV in 2010 even though together they rep-resent only about 30 percent of women these ages. Investing in HIV prevention today translates into less spending in the future on care and treatment. Most CDC funding is distributed to the primary implementers of prevention activities\u2014State and local public health departments and community based organizations. Increased investments are critical to expand comprehensive prevention programs and to successfully reach individuals at highest risk for infec-tion. Early detection of HIV, linkage and retention in care, and adherence to treat-ment will suppress individual and community viral loads. Adequate resources are necessary to carry out increased HIV testing programs, targeted interventions, pub-lic education campaigns, and surveillance activities needed to track new infections andCD4 and viral load reporting. For fiscal year 2015, we request an increase of $55 million over fiscal year 2014 for a total of $812.7 million for the CDC Division of HIV prevention and surveillance activities. 341 Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) One-third of all new HIV infections are among young people under the age of 29, the largest share of any age group. DASH is the only federally funded adolescent health program in our Nation's schools, helping education agencies provide school districts and individual schools with the tools to implement high-quality, effective, and sustainable programs to reduce HIV and other STD infections in adolescents. Increased funding would help expand this vital infrastructure beyond the currently funded 36 State or local education agencies. We request that the CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health receive a total of $50 million, an increase of $21 million over fiscal year 2014 final funding. This request includes $3 million in evaluation transfer funds. CDC STD Prevention Given the strong link between HIV and other STDs, including high rates of co- infection among certain populations, an increased investment in STD programs is an essential component of HIV prevention. Investments in STD prevention and treatment further the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's goal of reducing new infections. We request an increase of $54 million for a total of $211 million for the CDC's Division of STD Prevention in fiscal year 2015. CDC Viral Hepatitis Prevention CDC estimates that up to 5.3 million people are living with hepatitis B (HBV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) in the U.S., and as many as 75 percent are not aware of their infection. In 2010 alone, 35,000 Americans were newly infected with HBV and 17,000 with HCV. It is estimated that 10 percent of people living with HIV are co- infected with hepatitis B and 25 percent are co-infected with hepatitis C. We request an increase of $31 million above the fiscal year 2014 level, for a total of $60 million for the CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis. Access to Sterile Syringes About 1 of 12 new infections (8.6 percent) of HIV in 2011 was related to injection drug use, a 28 percent decrease from 2008. One factor leading to this reduction has been syringe exchange programs. Numerous studies have shown syringe exchange programs can be an evidence-based and cost-effective means to lower HIV and hepa-titis infections, reduce the use of illegal drugs and help connect people to medical treatment, including substance abuse treatment. In a May 2012 letter, the Presi-dent's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS also supported ending the Federal ban on sy-ringe exchange and noted that doing so is supported by public health, HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and harm reduction communities as well. We urge you to add language to end the ban on the use of Federal funds for sy- ringe exchange programs and to maintain language that allows the use of local funds for syringe exchange programs in the District of Columbia. Abstinence-only We also request that you eliminate the funding for failed abstinence-only-until- marriage programs. HIV/AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Research continues until better, more effective and affordable prevention and treatment regimens\u2014and eventually a cure\u2014are developed and universally avail-able. For the U.S. to maintain its position as the global leader in HIV/AIDS research for the 33 million people globally of whom 1.1 million are Americans living with HIV, we must invest adequate resources in the NIH. NIH AIDS research has pro-duced startling advances, including the HPTN 052 study of the prevention effects of treatment that was named Breakthrough of the Year by Science magazine, im-proved treatment programming and the first partially effective HIV vaccine, contin-ued AIDS research funding is essential. In line with the Trans-NIH AIDS Research By-Pass Budget Estimate for fiscal year 2013, please include $3.6 billion for HIV research at the NIH, an increase of $610 million over fiscal year 2014. Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative HIV/AIDS continues to impact communities of color at an alarming rate. Accord- ing to the CDC, African Americans, more than any other racial/ethnic group, con-tinue to bear the greatest burden of HIV in the U.S. While blacks represent approxi-mately 12 percent of the total population, they accounted for 44 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010. Hispanics represent approximately 16 percent of the total population, but accounted for 21 percent of all new HIV infections. In the Asian Pa-342 cific Islander, and Native American communities the numbers of HIV infection are just as startling. We request that the MAI be funded at $610 million in fiscal year 2015. We note that most of these funds are contained within the budgets of the programs described above. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ALZHEIMER 'SASSOCIATION The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the opportunity to comment on the fiscal year 2015 appropriations for Alzheimer's disease research, education, outreach and support at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease and other dementias through the advancement of re-search; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health. As the world's largest non-profit funder of Alzheimer's research, the Association is committed to accelerating progress of new treatments, preventions and, ultimately, a cure. Through our fund-ed projects and partnerships, we have been part of every major research advance-ment over the past 30 years. Likewise, the Association works to enhance care and provide support for all those affected by Alzheimer's and reaches millions of people affected by Alzheimer's and their caregivers. Alzheimer's Impact on the American People and the Economy In addition to the human suffering caused by the disease, Alzheimer's is creating an enormous strain on the healthcare system, families and the Federal budget. Alz-heimer's is a progressive brain disorder that damages and eventually destroys brain cells, leading to a loss of memory, thinking and other brain functions. Ultimately, Alzheimer's is fatal. Currently, Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the only one of the top ten without a means to prevent, cure or slow its progression. Over five million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, with 200,000 under the age of 65. A Federal commitment can lower costs and improve health outcomes for people living with Alzheimer's today and in the future. By making Alzheimer's a national priority, we can create the same successes that we have been able to achieve in other diseases that have been prioritized by the Federal Government. Leadership from the Federal Government has helped to lower the number of deaths from other major diseases like heart disease, HIV/AIDS, many cancers, heart disease and stroke. While those deaths have declined, deaths from Alzheimer's have increased 68 percent between 2000 and 2010. Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease in America. In fact, an NIH-funded study in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed that Alzheimer's is the most costly disease in America, with costs set to skyrocket at unprecedented rates. If nothing is done, as many as 16 million Americans will have Alzheimer's disease by 2050 and costs will exceed $1.2 trillion (not adjusted for inflation), creating an enormous strain on the healthcare system, families and the Federal budget. The ex-pense involved in caring for those with Alzheimer's is not just a long-term problem. As the current generation of baby boomers age, near-term costs for caring for those with Alzheimer's will balloon, as Medicare and Medicaid will cover more than two- thirds of the costs for their care. Due to these projected increases, the graying of America threatens the bank- rupting of America. Caring for people with Alzheimer's will cost all payers\u2014Medi-care, Medicaid, individuals, private insurance and HMOs\u2014$20 trillion over the next 40 years, enough to pay off the national debt and still send a $10,000 check to every man, woman and child in America. In 2014, America will spend an estimated $214 billion in direct costs for those with Alzheimer's, including $150 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. Average per person Medicare costs for those with Alz-heimer's and other dementias are three times higher than those without these con- ditions. Average per senior Medicaid spending is 19 times higher. A primary reason for these costs is that Alzheimer's makes treating other diseases more expensive, as most individuals with Alzheimer's have one or more co-morbidity that complicate the management of the condition(s) and increase costs. For example, a senior with diabetes and Alzheimer's costs Medicare 81 percent more than a sen-ior who only has diabetes. Nearly 30 percent of people with Alzheimer's or another dementia who have Medicare also have Medicaid coverage, compared with 11 per-cent of individuals without Alzheimer's or dementia. Alzheimer's disease is also ex-343 tremely prevalent in nursing homes, where 64 percent of Medicare residents live with the disease. With Alzheimer's, it is not just those with the disease who suffer\u2014it is also their caregivers and families. In 2013, 15.5 million family members and friends provided unpaid care valued at over $220 billion. Caring for a person with Alzheimer's takes longer, lasts longer, is more personal and intrusive, and takes a heavy toll on the health of the caregivers themselves. More than 60 percent of Alzheimer's and de-mentia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high, with one-third reporting symptoms of depression. Caregiving may also have a negative impact on health, employment, income and family finances. Due to the physical and emotional toll of caregiving on their own health, Alzheimer's and dementia care-givers had $9.3 billion in additional health costs in 2013. Changing the Trajectory of Alzheimer's Until recently, there was no Federal Government strategy to address this looming crisis. In 2010, thanks to bipartisan support in Congress, the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) (Public Law 111-375) passed unanimously, requiring the cre-ation of an annually-updated strategic National Alzheimer's Plan (Plan) to help those with the disease and their families today and to change the trajectory of the disease for the future. The Plan is required to include an evaluation of all federally- funded efforts in Alzheimer's research, care and services\u2014along with their out-comes. In addition, the Plan must outline priority actions to reduce the financial im- pact of Alzheimer's on Federal programs and on families; improve health outcomes for all Americans living with Alzheimer's; and improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care, institutional-, home-, and community-based Alzheimer's programs for individuals with Alzheimer's and their caregivers. NAPA will allow Congress to assess whether the Nation is meeting the challenges of this disease for families, communities and the economy. Through its annual review process, NAPA has en-abled, for the first time, Congress and the American people to answer this simple question: Did we make satisfactory progress this past year in the fight against Alz-heimer's? As mandated by NAPA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collabo- ration with the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services, has developed the first-ever National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease in May of 2012 and subsequently released the 2014 Update to the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease this past April. The Advisory Council, composed of both Federal members and expert non-Federal members, is an integral part of the planning proc-ess as it advises the Secretary in developing and evaluating the annual Plan, makes recommendations to the Secretary and Congress, and assists in coordinating the work of Federal agencies involved in Alzheimer's research, care, and services. Having a plan with measurable outcomes is important. But unless there are re- sources to implement the plan and the will to abide by it, we cannot hope to make adequate progress. If we are going to succeed in the fight against Alzheimer's, Con-gress must provide the resources the scientists need. Understanding this and fol-lowing the recommendation of scientists at NIH, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-76) which included a $100 million in-crease for Alzheimer's research. These funds are a critically needed down payment for needed research and services for Alzheimer's patients and their families. A disease-modifying or preventive therapy would not only save millions of lives but would save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Specifically, if a treatment be-came available in 2015 that delayed onset of Alzheimer's for 5 years (a treatment similar to anti-cholesterol drugs), savings would be seen almost immediately, with Medicare and Medicaid spending reduced by $42 billion in 2020. Today, despite the Federal investment in Alzheimer's research, we are only just beginning to understand what causes the disease. Americans are growing increas-ingly concerned that we still lack effective treatments that will slow, stop, or cure the disease, and that the pace of progress in developing breakthrough discoveries is much too slow to significantly impact on this growing crisis. For every $26,500 Medicare and Medicaid spends caring for individuals with Alzheimer's, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spends only $100 on Alzheimer's research. Scientists fun-damentally believe that we have the ideas, the technology and the will to develop new Alzheimer's interventions, but that progress depends on a prioritized scientific agenda and on the resources necessary to carry out the scientific strategy for both discovery and translation for therapeutic development. For too many individuals with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this dev-astating disease. Despite the fact that an early and documented formal diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, manage other chronic 344 conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones, as many as half of the more than five million Americans with Alzheimer's have never received a formal diagnosis. Unless we cre-ate an effective, dementia-capable system that finds new solutions to providing high quality care, provides community support services and programs, and addresses Alz-heimer's health disparities, Alzheimer's will overwhelm the healthcare system in the coming years. For example, people with Alzheimer's and other dementias have more than three times as many hospital stays as other older people. Furthermore, one out of seven individuals with Alzheimer's or another dementia lives alone and up to half do not have an identifiable caregiver. These individuals are more likely to need emergency medical services because of self-neglect or injury, and are found to be placed into nursing homes earlier, on average, than others with dementia. Ulti-mately, supporting individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families and care-givers requires giving them the tools they need to plan for the future and ensuring the best quality of life for individuals and families impacted by the disease. It is vital that we make the investments in Alzheimer's that will fulfill the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. The Alzheimer's Association urges Congress to support an additional $200 million for research activities and priorities included in the Na-tional Alzheimer's Plan required under Public Law 111-375. Additional Alzheimer's programs National Alzheimer's Call Center: The National Alzheimer's Call Center, funded by the AoA, provides 24/7, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care con-sultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. In the 12 month period ending July 31, 2013, the Call Center handled over 300,000 calls through its national and local partners, and its online message board received over 40,000 visits a month. Additionally, the Association provides a two-to-one match on the Federal dollars received for the call center. The Alzheimer's Association urges Congress to support $1.3 million for the National Alzheimer's Call Center. Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) HBI program works to educate the public, the public health community and health professionals about Alzheimer's as a public health issue. Although there are currently no treatments to delay or stop the deterioration of brain cells caused by Alzheimer's, evidence suggests that preventing or controlling cardiovascular risk factors may benefit brain health. In light of the dramatic aging of the population, scientific advancements in risk behaviors, and the growing awareness of the signifi-cant health, social and economic burdens associated with cognitive decline, the Fed-eral commitment to a public health response to this challenge is imperative. The fiscal year 2014 omnibus funding bill increased funding for HBI by $1.5 million in order to bolster caregiver surveillance. The Alzheimer's Association urges Congress to support $3.3 million for the Healthy Brain Initiative. Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP): The ADSSP at the AoA supports family caregivers who provide countless hours of unpaid care, thereby enabling their family members with Alzheimer's and dementia to continue living in the community. The program develops coordinated, responsive and innovative com-munity-based support service systems for individuals and families affected by Alz-heimer's. The Alzheimer's Association urges Congress to support $13.4 million for the Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program. Conclusion The Association appreciates the steadfast support of the Subcommittee and its priority setting activities. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress in order to address the Alzheimer's crisis. We ask Congress to address Alzheimer's with the same bipartisan collaboration demonstrated in the passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (Public Law 111-375) and with a commitment equal to the scale of the crisis. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ALZHEIMER 'SFOUNDATION OF AMERICA On behalf of the Alzheimer's Foundation of America (AFA), a national nonprofit organization that unites more than 1,600 member organizations nationwide with the goal of providing optimal care and services to individuals confronting dementia, and to their caregivers and families, we are making the following appropriations re-quests for programs impacting Alzheimer's disease caregiving services and research in the fiscal year 2015 budget. These Federal programs and support services are 345 vital to providing necessary care supports and promoting best practice tools to fam- ily caregivers, and advancing promising clinical research. Specifically, AFA makes the following appropriations requests for these specific agencies and programs: National Institutes of Health (NIH): Adequate investment in scientific research that could lead to new treatments and cures is critical in order to reduce long-term healthcare costs. We appreciated Con-gress' efforts in the fiscal year 2014 budget which provided an additional $80 million for clinical research into Alzheimer's disease. AFA urges the Committee to build on this modest increase and provide an additional $500 million for Alzheimer's disease research and enhanced investments for caregiving supports and services in fiscal year 2015. Additional resources will fund effective pharmaceutical therapies to pre-vent, cure or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and provide the necessary seed money to implement and facilitate the ambitious and laudable goals of the ''Na-tional Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.'' AFA also urges the Committee to include $32 billion in total funding for NIH, as recommended by the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research and a bi-partisan group of Members of Congress including Reps. McKinley, Davis, Carson and King. Even if funding remains flat, NIH's actual budget will still be effectively cut as spending will not be able to keep pace with biomedical inflation. \u2014National Institute on Aging (NIA): Since NIA is the primary agency responsible for Alzheimer's disease research, AFA urges the Committee to include a minimum budget appropriation of $1.7 billion, an increase of $500 million for NIA for fiscal year 2015. NIA leads the national scientific effort to understand the nature of aging in order to promote the health and well-being of older adults, whose numbers are projected to rise dramatically in the coming years due to increased life expectancy and the aging of the baby boom generation. This funding is essential to increase the NIA's baseline to a level consistent with comparable research initiatives conducted under the auspices of NIH, and to sup-port additional research into Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This is par-ticularly vital, as Alzheimer's disease holds the infamous position of being the only one of the top ten leading causes of death with a rising death rate. Administration on Community Living (ACL) programs: AFA would like to single out the following programs within the ACL that are crit- ical to individuals with Alzheimer's disease their caregivers: \u2014National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP): NFCSP provides grants to States and territories, based on their share of the population aged 70 and over, to fund a range of supportive services that assist family and informal caregivers in caring for their loved ones at home for as long as possible, thus providing a more person-friendly and cost-effective approach than institutional care. Last year's ap-propriation of $146 million cannot possibly keep up with the need for respite care as our population ages. AFA urges that $156 million be appropriated in fiscal year 2015 to support this important program. \u2014Lifespan Respite Care Program (LRCP): AFA urges the Committee to commit $10 million to LRCP in fiscal year 2015. LRCP provides competitive grants to State agencies working with Aging and Disability Resource Centers and non-profit State respite coalitions and organizations to make quality respite care available and ac-cessible to family caregivers regardless of age or disability by establishing State Lifespan Respite Systems. \u2014Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants (ADDG): Existing resources for the Alzheimer's population and their caregivers are already tapped out, at a time when demand is continuing to rise in line with the skyrocketing incidence of this disease. AFA supports funding of $9 million for the ADDG program which fosters the devel-opment of innovative models of care for persons with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers and is designed to improve responsiveness of the home and community based care system to persons with dementia including underserved minority, rural and low-income persons. \u2014Alzheimer's Disease Initiative (ADI): AFA supports the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request of $12 million for this program that for services such as sup-port for caregivers in the community, improving healthcare provider training, and raising public awareness. Research shows that education, counseling and other sup-port for family caregivers can delay institutionalization of loved ones and improve a caregiver's own physical and mental well-being\u2014thus reducing costs to families and government. In addition, AFA supports an appropriation of $5 million for the Alzheimer's Disease Communications Campaign. 346 Food and Drug Administration (FDA): AFA supports FDA funding in fiscal year 2015 that fully restores the agency's base lost in the fiscal year 2013 sequester and provides for a modest additional funding above that level. Specifically, we are requesting budget authority appropria-tions of $2.78 billion for FDA, $223 million above fiscal year 2014 appropriated spending. FDA activities are necessary to ensure proper evaluation and testing of pharma- ceutical treatments for Alzheimer's disease before these drugs enter the market. In addition, with the science of this disease becoming more complex, FDA plays an in-creasingly important and often resource-intensive role in pharmaceutical innovation. AFA's request is in line with the appropriations request being recommended by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA and the Coalition to Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD). As we work toward meeting the goal of the historic ''National Plan to Address Alz- heimer's Disease'' to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025, ade-quate resources must be committed to meet the pending challenge. Taken together, these programs represent a lifeline to families who care for a loved one with Alz-heimer's disease and provide hope to Americans living with the disease and those who face it in the future that there will be funding for a cure. AFA thanks the Committee for the opportunity to present its recommendations and looks forward to working with you through the appropriations process. Please contact me or Eric Sokol, AFA's vice president of public policy, at esokol@alzfdn.org if you have any questions or require further information. [This statement was submitted by Hon. Charles J. Fuschillo, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Alzheimer's Foundation of America.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICA ACHIEVES Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran: Results for America (RFA), an initiative of America Achieves, is pleased to present our recommendations for fiscal year 2015 to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. The attached letter and table outline the evidence-based policies and programs RFA and our coalition partners are requesting from your Subcommittee for fiscal year 2015 to help improve outcomes for young people, their families, and commu-nities. Over the last several years, all levels of government have taken critical steps to change the way taxpayer dollars are invested to ensure limited resources are driven toward high-impact solutions that get results. To significantly improve outcomes for young people, their families, and communities in the context of constrained re-sources and mounting demands, the Federal Government should identify and invest in ''what works,'' and be a catalyst for, and funder of, effective and innovative solu-tions that produce greater social impact. While public debate focuses on more or less resources, it is critical to identify how to get better results from existing resources. This approach has a strong history of bipartisan support. President George W. Bush's Administration put a priority on improving the performance of Federal pro-grams and encouraged more rigorous evaluations to assess their effectiveness. The Obama Administration has built on this effort by supporting an increasing number of evidence and evaluation-based policies and programs. Mayors and governors from both parties across the country are also increasingly using data and evidence to steer public dollars to more effectively address needs in their communities and States. I want to thank you for the positive steps you have taken over the last several years toward building a strong evidence-based, results-driven policy agenda and look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead. On March 13, 2014, the following 72 organizations sent a letter to Chairwoman Mikulski, Chairman Rogers, and Ranking Members Shelby and Lowey requesting bill and report language to invest Federal funds in what works. The letter and a summary of our recommendations for fiscal year 2015 for the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Edu-cation follow: INVEST IN WHAT WORKS Dear Chairwoman Mikulski, Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Shelby, and Ranking Member Lowey: 347 We are writing to urge you to include the attached ''Invest in What Works'' provi- sions in the subcommittee appropriations bills and reports for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, and the De-partments of Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for fiscal year 2015. America is facing enormous social and economic shifts, budget constraints at all levels of government, significant demographic changes, and an increasingly globally competitive, changing workforce. While the recently-enacted fiscal year 14 omnibus appropriations law includes an unprecedented commitment to evidence and evalua-tion, we must continue to focus on improving the ways in which Federal taxpayer dollars are spent in fiscal year 15 and beyond in order to be able to significantly improve outcomes for young people, their families, and communities. We thank you for the positive steps you have taken over the last several years toward building a strong evidence-based, results-driven policy agenda and encourage you to reaffirm your commitment to improving outcomes for all Americans by incor-porating the attached ''Invest in What Works'' recommendations in the fiscal year 2015 appropriations bills and committee reports. Thank you for your consideration of our requests.

Founded in 1947, the AAFP is dedicated to preserving and promoting the science and art of family medicine and ensuring high-quality, cost-effective healthcare for patients of all ages. The AAFP appreciates the opportunity to comment on the fiscal year 2015 appropriations levels needed to achieve those important goals. HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (HRSA) Our Nation faces a shortage of primary care physicians. The total number of office visits to primary care physicians is projected to increase from 462 million in 2008 to 565 million in 2025 requiring nearly 52,000 additional primary care physicians by 2025. 1The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is the Federal agency charged with administering the health professions training programs author-ized under Title VII of the Public Health Services Act and first enacted in 1963. We urge the Committee to restore funding for discretionary HRSA programs to the fiscal year 2010 level of $7.48 billion in the fiscal year 2015 bill. Title VII Health Professions Training Programs .\u2014In the last 50 years, Congress has revised the Title VII authority in order to meet our Nation's changing healthcare workforce needs. We now face burgeoning demand for family physicians and must work to increase their number in the United States. As the only medical specialty society devoted entirely to primary care, the AAFP is gravely concerned that a failure to provide adequate funding for the Title VII, Section 747 Primary Care Training and Enhancement (PCTE) program, will destabilize education and training support for family physicians. Between 1998 and 2008, in spite of per-sistent primary care physician shortages, family medicine lost 46 training programs and 390 residency positions, and general internal medicine lost nearly 900 posi-tions. 2A study published in the Annals of Family Medicine on the impact of Title VII training programs found that physicians who work with the underserved in Community Health Centers and National Health Service Corps sites are more likely to have trained in Title VII-funded programs. 3Title VII primary care training grants are vital to departments of family medicine, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics; they strengthen curricula; and they offer incentives for training in underserved areas. In the coming years, medical services utilization is likely to rise given the increasing and aging population as well as the insured status of more people. These demographic trends will exacerbate family physician shortages. Al-though PCTE grants are important to family medicine, there has not been a com-petitive cycle for these grants since fiscal year 2010. The AAFP urges the Com-mittee to increase the level of Federal funding for primary care training to at least $71 million in fiscal year 2015 to allow for a robust new grant cycle to support fam-ily medicine education and training in the new competencies required to meet the needs of patients of all ages. Teaching Health Centers .\u2014The AAFP has long called for reforms to graduate medical education programs to encourage the training of primary care residents in non-hospital settings where most primary care is delivered. An excellent first step is the innovative Teaching Health Centers (THC) program authorized under Title VII, \u00a7 749A to increase primary care physician training capacity that HRSA admin-isters. Federal financing of graduate medical education has led to training mainly in hospital inpatient settings even though most patient care is delivered outside of hospitals in ambulatory settings. The THC program provides resources to any quali-fied community based ambulatory care setting that operates a primary care resi-dency. We believe that this program requires an investment of $10 million in fiscal year 2015 for planning grants. Rural Physician Workforce Needs .\u2014HRSA's Office of Rural Health focuses on rural health policy issues and administers rural grant programs. As the medical specialty most likely to enter rural practice, family physicians recognize the impor-350 4Rabinowitz,HK, et al. Medical School Rural Programs: A Comparison With International Medical Graduates in Addressing State-Level Rural Family Physician and Primary Care Supply. Academic Medicine, Vol. 87, No. 4/April 2012. tance of dedicating appropriate resources to rural health needs. A recent study found that medical school rural programs have had a significant impact on rural family physician supply and called for wider adoption of that model to substantially increase access to care in rural areas compared to a greater reliance on inter-national medical graduates or unfocused expansion of traditional medical schools. 4 HRSA's Rural Physician Training Grant program will help medical schools recruit students most likely to practice medicine in rural communities. This program will help provide rural-focused experience and increase the number of medical school graduates who practice in underserved rural communities. The AAFP recommends that the Committee provide $4 million for Rural Physician Training Grants in fiscal year 2015 as called for in the President's budget request. Primary Care in Underserved Areas .\u2014The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) recruits and places medical professionals in Health Professional Shortage Areas to meet the need for healthcare in rural and medically underserved areas. The NHSC offers scholarships or loan repayment as incentives for physicians to enter primary care and provide healthcare to Americans in Health Professional Shortage Areas. By addressing medical school debt burdens, the NHSC also helps to ensure wider access to medical education opportunities. The President's budget request includes $810 million for the NHSC, of which $710 million is mandatory funding. If the NHSC is funded at the President's requested level in fiscal year 2015, underserved patients will benefit from an NHSC field strength of more than 15,400 primary care clinicians compared to the fiscal year 2013 field strength of 8,899. The AAFP sup-ports the President's budget request for this important program and recommends that the Committee provide an appropriation of $100 million for the NHSC in fiscal year 2015 to supplement the authorized and requested mandatory funds. AGENCY FOR HEATLHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) AHRQ is the only Federal agency responsible for generating evidence to make healthcare safer; better; and more accessible, equitable and affordable. AHRQ pro-vides the critical evidence reviews that the AAFP and other physician specialty soci-eties use to produce clinical practice guidelines. These evidence-informed guidelines are important to family physicians as well as to patients and their families. AHRQ takes the results from the NIH whose research restricts subjects to limit the vari-ables in clinical studies and brings the practical information to the practicing physi-cians who treat patients without those clinical restrictions. ARHQ supports critical primary care investigations through Practice-based Research Networks that exam-ine practice transformation, patient quality and safety in non-hospital settings, multi-morbidity research, as well as mental and behavioral healthcare in commu-nities and primary care practices. The AAFP asks that the Committee provide $375 million in base discretionary funding for AHRQ in fiscal year 2015. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE COMMISSION Appointed on September 30, 2010, the 15-member National Health Care Work- force Commission was intended to serve as a resource with a broad array of exper-tise. The Commission was directed to analyze current workforce distribution and needs; evaluate healthcare education and training; identify barriers to improved co-ordination at the Federal, State, and local levels and recommend ways to address them; and encourage innovations. There is broad consensus about the waning avail-ability of primary care physicians in the United States, but estimates of the severity of the regional and local shortages vary. The AAFP supports the work of the Com-mission to analyze primary care shortages and propose innovations to help produce the physicians that our Nation needs and will need in the future. We request that the Committee provide $4 million in fiscal year 2015 so that this important Com-mission can finally begin this important work. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a non-profit professional organization of 62,000 primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and pediatric surgical specialists dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of infants, chil-dren, adolescents, and young adults, appreciates the opportunity to submit this statement for the record in support of strong Federal investments in children's 351 health in fiscal year 2015 and beyond. AAP urges all Members of Congress to put children first when considering short and long-term Federal spending decisions. AAP supports robust investment in programs that help ensure the health, safety and well-being of children, including $5 million for the Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program at the Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA), $21 million for the Emergency Medical Services for Children (HRSA), $139 million for the National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and $160 million for Polio Eradication and $49 million for the Measles program within CDC. Every adult was once a child. Many adult diseases have their origins in childhood. Early and continued investments in our children's health are needed to prevent obe-sity, heart disease, substance use, and other chronic conditions that threaten Amer-ica's health and fiscal solvency. As clinicians we not only diagnose and treat our pa-tients, we also promote preventive interventions to improve overall health. Likewise, as policymakers, you have an integral role in ensuring the health of future genera-tions through adequate and sustained funding of vital Federal programs. Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program The United States' supply of pediatric subspecialists is inadequate to meet chil- dren's health needs. Many children must wait more than 3 months for an appoint-ment with a pediatric subspecialist. Approximately 1 in 3 children must travel 40 miles or more to receive care from a pediatrician certified in adolescent medicine, developmental behavioral pediatrics, neurodevelopment disabilities, pulmonology, emergency medicine, nephrology, rheumatology, and sports medicine. This problem is compounded by the fact that fewer medical residents are choosing careers in pedi-atric subspecialties, and the existing subspecialist workforce continues to age. There is also a significant disparity in the geographic distribution of pediatric subspecial-ists across the country, resulting in many underserved rural and urban areas. The Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program (PSLRP) seeks to expand children's access to healthcare by creating a more robust pediatric work force. In the program, eligible participants must agree to practice full-time for not less than 2 years in a pediatric medical specialty, surgical specialty, or a child or adolescent mental and behavioral subspecialty in a health professional shortage area or a medically underserved area. In return, the program will pay up to $35,000 in loan repayment for each year of service, for a maximum of 3 years. Fiscal year 2015 Request: $5 million; fiscal year 2014 Level: Not Funded. Emergency Medical Services for Children Established by Congress in 1984 and last reauthorized in 2010, the Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) Program is the only Federal program that fo-cuses specifically on improving the pediatric components of the emergency medical services (EMS) system. Currently celebrating its 30th year, the EMSC program has made landmark improvements to the emergency care delivered to children all across the Nation. EMSC aims to ensure that state of the art emergency medical care for the ill and injured child or adolescent is well integrated into an EMS system. Every State has received EMSC funds, which they have used to ensure that hospitals and ambulances are properly equipped to treat pediatric emergencies, to provide pedi-atric training to paramedics and first responders, and to improve the systems that allow for efficient, effective pediatric emergency medical care. Continued support for EMSC has allowed the program to maintain its existing ac- tivities, improve pediatric capacity and transport of pediatric patients, and address emerging issues such as pediatric emergency care readiness and pediatric emer-gency medical services in rural and remote areas. Fiscal year 2015 Request: $21 million; fiscal year 2014 Level: $20.1 million. National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities The National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities is a center within CDC that seeks to promote the health of babies, children, and adults and enhance the potential for full, productive living. According to the CDC, birth defects affect 1 in 33 babies and are a leading cause of infant death in the United States; the center has done tremendous work in the way of identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities, helping children to develop and reach their full potential. The center also conducts important research on fetal alcohol syn-drome, infant health, autism, congenital heart defects, and other conditions like Tourette Syndrome, Fragile X, Spina Bifida and Hemophilia. NCBDDD has proven to be an asset to children and their families and supports extramural research in every State. Fiscal year 2015 Request: $139 million; fiscal year 2014 Level: $122.4 million. 352 Global Health at CDC The AAP calls on Congress to support and resource Health and Human Services to implement the recommendations of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee of the Global Immunizations Working Group on enhancing the work of the HHS Na-tional Vaccine Program in Global Immunizations. This includes support for HHS' role in building international cooperation for the common goal of reducing the bur-den of vaccine-preventable diseases. HHS has unique and timely opportunities to eradicate polio, to reduce measles mortality, and to ensure that the routine immuni-zation systems at the front lines of these efforts are maintained. The funding that Congress provides to CDC's Global Immunization account is also necessary to act on the Advisory Committee's recommendations that HHS enhance its ongoing ef-forts to strengthen global immunization systems, enhance global capacity for vaccine safety monitoring and post-marketing surveillance, build global immunization re-search and development capacity, and strengthen countries' capacity for vaccine de-cisionmaking. Since 1988 a coordinated global immunization campaign has reduced the number of polio cases globally by more than 99 percent, saving more than 10 million chil-dren from paralysis and bringing the disease close to eradication. Expanded immu-nization has reduced the global mortality attributed to measles by 74 percent be-tween 2000 and 2010. Polio fiscal year 2015 Request: $160 million; fiscal year 2014 2014 Level: $42.2 mil- lion America's children deserve better Twenty 2 percent of children in the United States now live in poverty\u2014up from 17 percent in 2007. Many children suffer from food insecurity, unstable housing, family dysfunction, abuse and neglect. Such adverse childhood experiences are linked with ''toxic stress,'' a biologic phenomenon associated with profound and irre-versible changes in brain anatomy and chemistry that have been implicated in the development of health-threatening behaviors and medical complications later in life including drug use, obesity, and altered immune function. Adults affected by such adverse childhood experiences are more likely to have experienced school failure, gang membership, unemployment, violent crime, and incarceration. Healthier children, healthier future On behalf of the 75 million American children and their families that we serve and treat, the Nation's pediatricians expect Congress to respond to mounting evi-dence that child health has life-long impacts and put children first during appro-priations negotiations. Investing in children is not only the right thing to do for the long-term physical, mental, and emotional health of the population, but is impera-tive for the Nation's long-term fiscal health as well. In addition to the programs we have specifically mentioned in this testimony, Federal support for children's health programs, such as early brain and child development, parenting and health edu-cation, and preventive health services, will yield high returns for the American economy. Cuts to these areas in the short-term will blunt the possible long-term savings these programs could achieve. We fully recognize the Nation's fiscal challenges and respect that difficult budg- etary decisions must be made; however, we do not support funding decisions made at the expense of the health and welfare of children and families. Rather, a focus on the long-term needs of children and adolescents will ensure that the United States can compete in the modern, highly-educated global marketplace. Strong and sustained financial investments in children's healthcare, research, and prevention programs will help keep our children healthy and pay dividends for years to come. The American Academy of Pediatrics looks forward to working with Members of Congress to prioritize the health of our Nation's children in fiscal year 2015 and be-yond. If we may be of further assistance please contact Pat Johnson at the AAP De-partment of Federal Affairs at 202-347-8600 or pjohnson@aap.org. Thank you for your consideration. [This statement was submitted by James, Perrin, MD, FAAP, President, American Academy of Pediatrics.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS On behalf of the more than 95,000 clinically practicing physician assistants in the United States, the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) is pleased to submit comments on fiscal year 2015 appropriations for Physician Assistant (PA) 353 educational programs that are authorized through Title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. AAPA respectfully requests the Senate Appropriations Com-mittee to approve funding at existing levels for the Title VII health professions edu-cation program\u2014$280,000,000, with an allocation of 15 percent of the Primary Care Training and Enhancement program line for PA educational programs. Federal support for Title VII is authorized through section 747 of the PHS Act. It is the only continuing Federal funding available to PA educational programs. Un-fortunately, in recent years, PA educational programs have received reduced support from Title VII funding, which is designed to educate PAs in primary care and to prepare PAs for practice in urban or rural medically underserved areas. This funding is essential to the development and training of the Nation's health workforce, and is critical to providing continued access to health services in under-served and minority communities. It also encourages PAs to return to these environ-ments with the greatest need after they have completed their educational prepara-tion, being one of the best recruitment tools to date. According to the Health Re-sources and Services Administration (HRSA), 37 percent of PAs practice in medi-cally underserved counties, including medically underserved areas and medically underserved populations. Additionally, Title VII funding has helped PA Programs expand clinical rotations in rural and underserved areas that have been in critically short supply and has enhanced primary care curriculum to better address the needs of disadvantaged populations. While the purview of the Title VII programs grant funding has expanded to in- clude assisting returning combat veterans, funding for PA educational programs has been significantly reduced. Additional reductions to this budget will disadvantage new PA programs that need these funds to help with student recruitment, faculty development, and establishing clinical rotation cites. Diverse clinical rotation sites and recruitment programs are critical to PA edu- cation and are paramount to the Title VII primary care medicine program. A review of PA graduates from 1990\u20142009 demonstrated that PAs who have graduated from PA educational programs supported by Title VII are 67 percent more likely to be from underrepresented minority populations and 47 percent more likely to work in a rural health clinic than graduates of programs that were not supported by Title VII. We wish to thank the members of this subcommittee for your historical role in supporting funding for the health professions programs, and we hope that we can count on your support to augment funding to these important programs in fiscal year 2015. Overview of PA Education The existing 181 accredited PA educational programs are all located within schools of medicine or health sciences, universities, teaching hospitals, and the Armed Services. All PA educational programs are accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant. The typical PA program consists of 26 months of instruction, and the typical stu- dent has a bachelor's degree and about 4 years of prior healthcare experience. The PA curriculum includes 400 hours of basic sciences and nearly 1,600 hours of clin-ical medicine. On average, students devote more than 2,000 hours, or 50 to 55 weeks, to clinical education, divided between primary care medicine\u2014family medi-cine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology\u2014and various spe-cialties, including surgery and surgical specialties, internal medicine subspecialties, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. After graduating from an accredited PA program, PAs must pass a national certi- fying examination developed by the National Commission on Certification of Physi-cian Assistants and become licensed by the State to provide medical care.. To main-tain certification, PAs must log 100 continuing medical education hours every 2 years, and they must take a recertification exam every 10 years. PA Practice PAs are licensed health professionals who practice medicine as members of a healthcare team. PAs exercise autonomy in medical decisionmaking and provide a broad range of medical and therapeutic services to diverse populations in rural and urban settings. PAs perform physical examinations, diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret lab tests, assist in surgery, provide patient education and coun-seling, and make rounds in nursing homes and hospitals. PAs are nationally cer-tified and State licensed to practice medicine and prescribe medication in all fifty States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-lands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 354 PAs in Primary Care An estimated 30,000 PAs (32 percent of the profession) work in primary care across the Nation\u201438.2 percent work in private practice (multi-and single specialty and solo practices); 23.3 percent in Family Medicine, 3.0 percent practice in commu-nity health centers, 3.3 percent practice in certified rural health clinics, and 2.7 per-cent work in a federally qualified health center. PAs are also one of three primary care providers who provide medical care through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). The NHSC is an important Federal program with nearly 10,000 healthcare providers, like PAs, who benefit from the program's loan-forgiveness and scholarship awards to those providers and students who commit 2 years to provide medical, dental, and mental healthcare in medically underserved areas. Additionally, PAs provide medical care in community health centers (CHCs), some as CHC medical directors. CHCs provide cost-effective healthcare throughout the country and serve as medical homes for millions in medically underserved areas. CHCs offer a wide variety of healthcare services through team-based care, providing high quality healthcare to CHC patients and significantly reducing medical ex-penses. Critical Role of the Title VII PHS Act Programs According to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an addi- tional 31,000 healthcare providers are needed to alleviate existing professional shortages. This existing shortage, combined with faculty shortages across PA edu-cation, the need to build greater diversity among healthcare providers, and an in-creasingly aging healthcare workforce, creates challenges in growing the primary healthcare workforce. Title VII programs are the only Federal educational programs that are designed to address the supply and distribution imbalances in the health professions. Since the establishment of Medicare, the costs of physician residencies, nurse training, and some allied health professions training have been paid through Graduate Med-ical Education (GME) funding; however, GME has not been available to support PA education. More importantly, GME was not intended to generate a supply of pro-viders who are willing to work in the Nation's medically underserved communities\u2014 the purpose of Title VII. Furthermore, Title VII programs seek to recruit students who are from under- served minority and disadvantaged populations, which is a critical step towards re-ducing persistent health disparities among certain racial and ethnic U.S. popu-lations. Research shows racial and ethnic health disparities cost the economy more than $230 billion in lost productivity and up to $1.24 trillion in indirect costs over 3 years; and studies have found that health professionals from disadvantaged re-gions of the country are three to five times more likely to return to underserved areas to provide care which would help alleviate the current health disparity crisis in America. Support for educating PAs to practice in underserved communities is particularly important given the market demand for PAs. Title VII funding is a critical link in addressing the natural geographic mal-distribution of healthcare providers by expos-ing students to underserved sites during their training, where they frequently choose to practice following graduation. Currently, 36 percent of PAs met their first clinical employer through their clinical rotations. Supplementary Recommendations on fiscal year 2015 Funding AAPA urges members of the Appropriations Committee to consider the inter-de- pendency of all public health agencies and programs when determining funding for fiscal year 2015. For instance, while it is critical, now more than ever, to fund clin-ical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and to have an infrastruc-ture at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that ensures a prompt response to an infectious disease outbreak or bioterrorist attack, the good work of both of these agencies will go unrealized if HRSA is inadequately funded. HRSA administers the ''people'' programs, such as Title VII, that bring the results of cutting edge research at NIH to patients through providers such as PAs who have been educated in Title VII-funded programs. Likewise, the CDC is heavily depend-ent upon an adequate supply of healthcare providers to be sure that disease out-breaks are reported, tracked, and contained. Thank you for the opportunity to present the AAPA's views on fiscal year 2015 appropriations concerning HRSA's Title VII Health Professions Program. [This statement was submitted by Sandy Harding, MSW, Senior Director, Federal Advocacy.] 355 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE OF MUSEUMS Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the Subcommittee, my name is Don Wildman, and for six highly rated seasons, I've had the extreme honor of hosting a television show, Mysteries at the Museum (Thursday nights on the Travel Channel), which tells the stories behind artifacts in museum collections. My testimony today is presented on behalf of the American Alliance of Museums, the largest organization of museums and museum professionals in the world, and we are respectfully asking the Subcommittee to provide $38.6 million for the Office of Museum Services (OMS) at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), its fully-authorized amount, in fiscal year 2015. Museums are among our Nation's most popular, most trusted and most beloved institutions. There are approximately 850 million visits to American museums each year, more than the attendance for all major league sporting events and theme parks combined. Museums also spend over $2 billion on educational programming, and a total of $21 billion in their local economies. Clearly museums are economic engines and job creators. IMLS is the primary Federal agency that supports the museum field, and OMS awards grants to help museums digitize, enhance and preserve their collections; pro-vide teacher training; and create innovative, cross-cultural and multi-disciplinary programs and exhibits for schools and the public. It's no surprise that the appropriations bill that funds education supports this agency, because museums are indeed key education providers. They design exhibi-tions, educational programs, classroom kits, and online resources in coordination with State, local and common core curriculum standards in math, science, art, lit-eracy, language arts, history, civics and government, economics and financial lit-eracy, geography, and social studies. Museums also offer experiential learning op-portunities, STEM education, mentoring, and job preparedness. Whatever education looks like in the future, one component will certainly be the development of a core set of skills: critical thinking; the ability to synthesize infor-mation; and the ability to innovate, to be creative and to collaborate. Museums are uniquely situated to help learners develop these core skills. In late 2010, legislation to reauthorize IMLS for 5 years was enacted (by voice vote in the House and by unanimous consent in the Senate). The bipartisan reau-thorization included several provisions proposed by the museum field, including en-hanced support for conservation and preservation, emergency preparedness and re-sponse and statewide capacity building. The reauthorization also specifically sup-ports efforts at the State level to leverage museum resources, including statewide needs assessments and the development of State plans to improve and maximize museum services throughout the State. The bill (now Public Law 111-340) author-ized $38.6 million for the IMLS Office of Museum Services to meet the growing de-mand for museum programs and services. The fiscal year 2014 appropriation of $30,131,000 represents a nearly 15 percent decrease from the fiscal year 2010 ap-propriation of $35,212,000. Grants are awarded in every State, but perhaps the best way to demonstrate the importance of the IMLS Office of Museum Services is to highlight just a few of the grants awarded in 2013 to museums in States represented by Subcommittee mem-bers: Public Programs and Energy Efficiency\u2014Reiman Gardens, Iowa State University of Science and Technology (Ames, IA) was awarded $95,040 to develop a comprehen-sive landscape design, architectural, and engineering plan. Designs will address community programming needs, visitor experience, facilities and maintenance needs, and energy efficiency standards. Recognizing Excellence\u2014The National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library (Cedar Rapids, IA) received $5,000 and the 2013 National Medal for Museum and Library Service. When the worst disaster in State history destroyed entire areas of Cedar Rapids in 2008, the National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library was instrumental in leading its devastated ethnic neighborhood in recovery, rebuilding, and revitaliza-tion. Youth Programs and Collections Care\u2014The Kansas African American Museum (Wichita, KS) was awarded $149,950 to create a public history youth program in partnership with the University of Kansas Libraries, serving 60 youth and training 25 volunteer docents annually. The museum is also using the grant to upgrade its collections management system and to address its most critical collections care and security needs. Environmental Science\u2014The Calvert Marine Museum Society (Solomons, MD) was awarded $142,500 to develop and install an exhibit on the ecosystem of the Pa-tuxent River and Chesapeake Bay. They are partnering with local schools and com-356 munity groups to facilitate lifelong learning of scientific concepts and environmental stewardship. Collections Care\u2014The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute (Birmingham, AL) was awarded $74,277 to safeguard its collections to ensure that they will be available for use by current and future students, the general public, researchers and staff. STEM Education\u2014The University of Alabama/Alabama Museum of Natural His- tory (Tuscaloosa, AL) was awarded $99,998 to create the Discovery Learning Lab to give middle and high school-aged students access to ''geek'' mentors who will guide them in explorations of digital technologies not readily available at home or school in low-income areas. This program exposes teens to STEM disciplines, skills, activities, and software at the lab and in a cyberspace environment. Science and Ocean Literacy\u2014The Seattle Aquarium (Seattle, WA) was awarded $103,821 to design, implement, and evaluate an aquarium classroom program. The museum will develop the program in cooperation with practicing scientists, empha-sizing both the scientific process and content based on sea otter and ocean acidifica-tion research. The project will also produce materials to help interpret its findings both in the museum and in the larger community. Cultural Identity\u2014The Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experi- ence (Seattle, WA) was awarded $150,000 to produce a newly designed tour program that emphasizes community storytelling and audience engagement. The Chinatown International District is Seattle's lowest-income neighborhood, and will benefit from increased museum attendance and enhanced community involvement. Recognizing Excellence\u2014The Delta Blues Museums (Clarksdale, MS) was award- ed $5,000 and the 2013 National Medal for Museum and Library Service for its work celebrating and nurturing this American art form. Participants young and old, from diverse economic and ethnic backgrounds participate in the museum's popular music classes while its travelling trunk exhibit inspires blues appreciation nation-wide. 3D Printing\u2014The Art Institute of Chicago (Chicago, IL) was awarded $25,000 to reach audiences of all ages by using 3D printing technologies. The museum will evaluate the potential impact of this technology on engagement with museum collec-tions, and will develop guidelines to be shared with other museums and educators. Collections Care\u2014The Hermann-Grima and Gallier Historic Houses (New Orle- ans, LA) were awarded $22,830 to develop a plan to improve their interior environ-ments to better conserve collections and the historical buildings. Professional Development\u2014The Newport Art Museum and Art Association (New- port, RI) was awarded $24,028 for an initiative that orients high school students to cultural administration careers through classroom learning, site visits, and men-toring. The grant will allow the museum to expand the reach of this initiative and establish paid internships for students, helping them develop their interests and build valuable skills for the future. Mobile Science Classroom\u2014The Discovery Center at Murfree Spring (Murfreesboro, TN) was awarded $103,849 to convert a school bus into a mobile science classroom for elementary school students. Digitization\u2014The Country Music Hall of Fame (Nashville, TN) was awarded $150,000 for a digitization initiative to preserve and increase access to the muse-um's unparalleled collection. Collections Care\u2014The University Museum, University of Arkansas (Fayetteville, AR) was awarded $31,464 to improve its zoology collection and make it more acces-sible to researchers. I am aware that this subcommittee wants to ensure that its investments in Fed- eral grant programs have measurable and significant impact. I believe that the grants listed above demonstrate the value of investing in museums as a means of investing in our communities. Further, it should be noted that each time a Federal grant is awarded, additional local and private funds are also leveraged. Two-thirds of IMLS grantees report that their Museums for America grant positioned the mu-seum to receive additional private funding. Even the most ardent deficit hawks view the IMLS grant-making process as a model for the Nation. Each grant is selected through a rigorous, peer-reviewed proc-ess. And due to the large number of grant applications and the limited funds avail-able, many highly-rated grant proposals go unfunded each year. \u2014Only 28 percent of Museums for America/Conservation Project Support project proposals were funded; \u2014Only 15 percent of National Leadership project proposals were funded; \u2014Only 15 percent of Sparks Ignition Grants for Museums project proposals were funded; \u2014Only 46 percent of Native American/Hawaiian Museum Services project pro- posals were funded; and 357 \u2014Only 31 percent of African American History and Culture project proposals were funded. On a final and personal note, the interviews I conduct with museum professionals for my television show have confirmed for me what I've known since I was a kid\u2014 that museums are cool, really cool. If there's one thing Americans young and old love, it's a good story about America and that's what museums have to offer. American museums do this job and they do it extremely well. They collect the sto- ries by preserving and curating the objects\u2014documents, inventions, clothing, paint-ings, sculptures and skeletons\u2014which explain who we've been, who we are and how we survive. I was raised outside of Philadelphia. Without museums, I'd have never walked through the left ventricle of the super-sized heart in the Ben Franklin Institute. But for the Academy of Natural Sciences, I'd have never understood the difference be-tween a stegosaurus and a triceratops. I wouldn't have had that first encounter with Vincent van Gogh at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It's impossible to imagine my childhood without museums or to imagine my adulthood. They're our lifeline to the past\u2014and an inspiration for the future. We hope you'll support our cause, and provide at least $38.6 million in fiscal year 2015 for the Office of Museum Services (OMS) at the Institute of Museum and Li-brary Services (IMLS), its fully-authorized amount. [This statement was submitted by Don Wildman, Host, Travel Channel's Mys- teries at the Museum, American Alliance of Museums.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR DENTAL RESEARCH On behalf of the 3,500 individual and 44 institutional members of the American Association for Dental Research (AADR), I am pleased to submit testimony describ-ing AADR's fiscal year 2015 requests, which include $32 billion for the National In-stitutes of Health (NIH) and $425 million for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). These funding recommendations represent the true needs of the research community while at the same time taking into consideration the continued tight budget climate dictated by the caps established by the Bipar-tisan Budget Act of 2013. I want to emphasize the recent Federal austerity meas-ures\u2014sequestration, government shutdown and the continued uncertainty\u2014had a significant impact on our members, universities and research supported via NIDCR. In actual dollars, NIDCR lost $23 million in funding in fiscal year 2013 and only $10 million was restored in fiscal year 2014. However, when adjusted for inflation, the NIDCR budget is 22 percent, or $75 million, less than it was in 2002, resulting in the lowest number of research grants awarded in 13 years. This creates an at-mosphere that is very discouraging to new scientific investigators whose research proposals are good enough to be funded but were not because of the budget cuts. We are at risk of losing them and their promising research ideas\u2014ideas that might lead to significant advances in dental, oral health and craniofacial health. The downward trend in lost purchasing power is particularly troubling because the improvements in oral health during the last half century are largely credited to research supported by NIDCR. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these declines in funding will slow or limit future breakthroughs. NIDCR is the largest institution in the world dedicated exclusively to research to improve dental, oral and craniofacial health. The health of the mouth and surrounding craniofacial (skull and face) structures is central to a person's overall health and well-being. Left un-treated, oral diseases and poor oral conditions go untreated, make it difficult to eat, drink, swallow, smile, talk and maintain proper nutrition. Scientists also have dis-covered important linkages between gum disease, or periodontal disease, and heart disease, stroke, diabetes and pancreatic cancer. In spite of these improvements, however, treating oral health conditions is costly with $110.9 billion in expenditures on dental services in 2012. While tooth decay and gum disease remain the most prevalent, complete tooth loss, oral cancer, and craniofacial congenital anomalies, like cleft lip and palate are also health and eco-nomic burdens to the American people. Moreover, oral health disparities exist for many racial and ethnic groups. By providing $425 million in fiscal year 2015, NIDCR, dental, oral and craniofacial researchers will be able to build upon the gains of the past decades, creating less invasive, cost effective and more efficient ways to improve oral health. Below are some examples highlighting the important work supported by NIDCR: \u2014Point of Care Diagnostics: Salivary diagnostics are measures that draw and analyze saliva to test for conditions such as HIV, HPV, substance abuse, caries, periodontitis and oral cancer. Through the work and support of NIDCR over the 358 last decade, these diagnostics are showing great promise in screening for diabe- tes, heart disease, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. Salivary diagnostics only require withdrawing saliva, unlike traditional methods that rely on withdrawing blood or on doing tissue biopsy. As a result, salivary diagnostics are less invasive. In addition, they are relatively inexpensive and have the potential of showing more immediate results which is particularly ben-eficial when results are urgently needed. \u2014Periodontal Disease: Periodontal or gum disease is a chronic inflammatory dis- ease that affects the gum tissue and bone supporting the teeth. Approximately 47.2 percent of Americans have mild, moderate or severe periodontitis. If left untreated, periodontal disease can lead to tooth loss. Research has shown that periodontal disease is associated with other chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To date, the prevention of gum disease has been limited to successful oral hygiene and regular professional care. Re-cently, however, scientists reported the discovery of resolvins, a biologically ac-tive product that has the potential to protect against soft tissue and bone loss associated with gum disease. More research is needed to further intensify ef-forts to apply the novel biological approach to treating inflammatory diseases. \u2014Dental Caries: Dental caries, or tooth decay, remains the most prevalent chronic disease in both children and adults resulting in a substantial economic and health burden to the American people. Although caries has significantly de-creased for most Americans over the past four decades, disparities remain among some population groups. In addition, this downward trend has recently reversed for young children. More research is needed to enhance efforts to ad-dress dental caries. \u2014HPV-Related Oral Cancer: This type of cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It is predicted that this cancer will be the most common HPV-related cancer by 2020. HPV-induced oral cancers among men are likely to exceed HPV-induced cervical cancers within the next 8 years. In fact, HPV is now causing more oral cancers than smoking. Identifying the presence of HPV in a mouth swab or a blood draw does not definitively indicate the impend-ing presence of cancer. As a result, more research is needed for the early detec-tion of HPV-related oral cancer, and for the development of therapies that would lead to the prevention of cancer progression. \u2014Evidenced-Based Practice: NIDCR recently awarded a seven-year grant that consolidates its dental practice-based research network initiative into a unified nationally coordinated effort. The consolidated initiative, the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) is headquartered at the Univer-sity of Alabama at Birmingham School of Dentistry. A dental practice-based re-search network is an investigative union of practicing dentists and academic sci-entists. The network provides practitioners with an opportunity to propose or participate in research studies that address daily issues in oral healthcare. These studies help to expand the profession's evidence base and further refine care. \u2014Cleft Lip and/or Cleft Palate\u2014Craniofacial anomalies such as cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CLP) are among the most common birth defects. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to oral clefts. Cleft lip is an abnormality in which the lip does not completely form during fetal development and cleft pal-ate occurs when the roof of the mouth does not fully close, leaving an opening that can extend into the nasal cavity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cleft lip and/or cleft palate supported by NIDCR are providing important new leads about the role genetic factors and gene-environment interactions play in the development of these conditions. In addition, a DNA sequencing study is un-derway to identify less common genetic variants that influence the risk of devel-oping cleft lip and/or cleft palate. NIDCR will continue to support the best science to understand craniofacial structures and anomalies more completely. Our members remain concerned that unless Congress fully reverses the erosion caused by sequestration our ability to attract the next generation of scientists will stall; our standing as a world leader in science will decline; and innovation nec-essary to push the boundaries of research will be stymied. Accordingly, I strongly urge you work in a bipartisan manner to prioritize funding for dental, oral and craniofacial research this year and undo sequestration permanently in fiscal year 2016 and beyond. Future advances in healthcare depend on a sustained investment in basic research to identify the fundamental causes and mechanisms of disease, ac-celerate technological development and discovery, and ensure a robust pipeline of creative and skillful biomedical researchers. For these reasons, I implore you to work in a bipartisan manner and provide funding increases for NIH and NIDCR in fiscal year 2015. 359 In addition to the NIH, AADR members care deeply about the Title VII Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) programs training the dental health workforce; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Oral Health's public health prevention efforts; data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ). Please support AADR's funding recommendations for these agencies depicted in the chart below.

Collectively, these institutions produce approximately half of our Na-tion's Registered Nurses (RNs) and all nurse faculty, Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), and nurse scientists. AACN requests that nursing education, re-search, and practice are strongly supported in fiscal year 2015 through an invest-ment of $251 million for HRSA's Nursing Workforce Development programs (author-ized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.]), $150 million for the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) within NIH, and $20 million in authorized funding for the Nurse-Managed Health Clinics (NMHCs) (Title III of the Public Health Service Act). These levels will ensure that our Nation's nurses are prepared to care for the growing number of patients requiring a complex range of healthcare services. DEMAND FOR NURSING CARE The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) publication Employment Projections for 2012-2022 anticipates significant growth in the nursing workforce from 2.71 million in 2012 to 3.24 million by 2022. This surge in demand translates to 526,800 nurses, or an increase of 19.4 percent. When considering the number of job openings for RNs due to the increasing demand for nursing care and replacements in an aging nursing workforce, more than one million nurses will be needed by 2022. In fact, according to the The U.S. Nursing Workforce: Trends in Supply and Education re-leased by HRSA in 2013, over the next 10 to 15 years, the nearly 1 million RNs older than age 50\u2014about one-third of the current workforce\u2014will reach retirement age. The retirement decisions of these experienced RNs may be influenced by the pace of economic recovery and have the potential to create a serious deficit in the nursing pipeline. Moreover, the BLS projects a need for 47,600 additional Nurse Practitioners, Cer- tified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, and Certified Nurse-Midwives (or APRNs) to meet the call for more primary and acute care services, particularly due to the aging baby boomer population and increased access to health insurance coverage. The BLS' Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that there will be a 31 percent in-crease in this sector of the workforce between 2012-2022. Investments are necessary to educate the RNs and APRNs who will provide the care that Americans need now and in the future. 360 TITLE VIII NURSING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS For fifty years, the Nursing Workforce Development programs, authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, have helped build the supply and dis-tribution of qualified nurses to meet our Nation's healthcare needs. Between fiscal year 2006 and 2012 alone, the Title VIII programs supported over 450,000 nurses and nursing students, as well as numerous academic nursing institutions and healthcare facilities. The programs bolster nursing education at all levels, from entry-level preparation through graduate study, and provide support to educate nurses for practice in rural and medically underserved communities. Today, the Title VIII programs are essential to ensuring that the demand for nursing care is met by supporting future practicing nurses and the faculty who educate them. However, faculty vacancies have repeatedly been cited as a fundamental obstacle to maximizing nursing school enrollment. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing's 2013-2014 Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate Programs in Nursing survey, 78,089 qualified applications were turned away from nursing schools in 2013 alone. A primary barrier to accepting all quali-fied students at nursing colleges and universities continues to be a shortage of fac-ulty. To counter this disparity, the Title VIII Nurse Faculty Loan Program aids in increasing nursing school enrollment capacity by supporting students pursuing graduate education, provided they serve as faculty for 4 years after graduation. The Title VIII programs also increase the number of practicing nurses entering the pipeline and the placement of these nurses into medically-underserved areas. AACN's Title VIII Student Recipient Survey, which gathers information annually about Title VIII funding and outcomes related to nursing education and career tra-jectories, provides evidence on the effectiveness of these programs in recruiting more students to the nursing profession and, more importantly, practice in rural and un-derserved areas. Results of the 2013-2014 Title VIII Student Recipient Survey in-cluded responses from 850 students who noted that these programs played a critical role in funding their nursing education. The survey showed that for 67 percent of respondents, Title VIII funding impacted their decision to enter nursing school. Moreover, 76 percent of the students receiving Title VIII funding are able to attend school full-time through this Federal support. By facilitating full-time education, the Title VIII programs are helping to ensure that students enter the workforce without delay. In addition, personal testimony of several survey respondents revealed that many Title VIII recipients intend to practice in the community in which they were educated\u2014a direct State investment. AACN respectfully requests $251 million for the Nursing Workforce Development programs authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act in fiscal year 2015. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH : ADVANCING NURSING SCIENCE The healthcare community is investigating methods to improve the delivery of high-quality care in a financially sustainable manner. As one of the 27 Institutes and Centers at the NIH, the NINR is dedicated to providing the healthcare work-force with evidence-based knowledge and the resources needed to accomplish this goal. Research conducted at NINR addresses disease prevention and health pro-motion efforts that improve quality of life and alleviate financial burden on individ-uals and the system. Specific areas targeted by NINR include chronic illness man-agement, disease prevention, pain management, and care-giver support. Nursing re-search is a critical compliment to biomedical research as it investigates how to pre-vent disease and promote healthy living. Moreover, research funded at NINR helps to integrate biology and behavior as well as design new technology and tools. At a time when healthcare needs are changing, nursing care must be firmly grounded in nursing science. NINR also allocates a generous 6 percent of its overall budget to the education and training of nurse researchers, many of whom dually serve as nurse faculty with-in our Nation's nursing schools. Increased investments must be made in the sci-entists that improve healthcare delivery through their groundbreaking discoveries. AACN respectfully requests $150 million for the NINR in fiscal year 2015. NURSE -MANAGED HEALTH CLINICS : EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE Managed by APRNs and staffed by an interdisciplinary health provider team, NMHCs provide necessary primary care services to medically-underserved commu-nities and serve as critical access points to keep patients out of the emergency room, saving the healthcare system millions of dollars annually. NMHCs provide care to vulnerable populations in a host of regions of the country, including rural commu-nities, Native American reservations, senior citizen centers, elementary schools, and 361 urban housing developments. These communities are the most susceptible to devel- oping chronic illnesses that create heavy financial burdens on patients and the healthcare system. NMHCs aim to reduce disease and create healthier communities through improved patient education and health practices. Often associated with a school, college, university, department of nursing, feder- ally qualified health center, or independent nonprofit healthcare agency, NMHCs also serve as clinical education training sites for students of nursing, medicine, physical therapy, social work, and ancillary healthcare services. Moreover, by serv-ing as clinical training sites, NMHCs help foster interprofessional education and practice so that patients receive individualized care from an array of providers. Ac-cording to AACN, the lack of clinical training sites is often pointed to as a top rea-son for turning away qualified applications in nursing programs. AACN respectfully requests $20 million for the Nurse-Managed Health Clinics in fiscal year 2015. AACN recognizes that the Subcommittee and Congress will need to make difficult decisions regarding appropriations for fiscal year 2015. AACN respectfully requests Congress to continue a strong investment in the health of our Nation by providing $251 million for the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development programs, $150 mil-lion for the National Institute of Nursing Research, and $20 million for Nurse-Man-aged Health Clinics in fiscal year 2015.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE The American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) strongly supports restoring funding for discretionary Health Resources and Services Admin-istration (HRSA) programs to the fiscal year 2010 level of $7.48 billion; funding of $520 million for HRSA's Title VII and VIII programs under the Public Health Serv-ice Act; $10 million minimally for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Development Grants; sustainment of student scholarship and loan repayment programs; $4 million for the Rural Physician Training grants; $3 million for the National Health Care Workforce Commission; $32 billion for the Na-tional Institutes of Health (NIH); and $375 million in base discretionary funding, restoring the base to fiscal year 2011 levels for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). AACOM represents the 30 accredited colleges of osteopathic medicine in the United States. These colleges are accredited to deliver instruction at 42 teaching lo-cations in 28 States. In the 2013-2014 academic year these colleges are educating over 23,000 future physicians\u2014more than 20 percent of U.S. medical students. Six of the colleges are publicly controlled; 24 are private institutions. The Title VII health professions education programs, authorized under the Public Health Service Act and administered through HRSA, support the training and edu-cation of health practitioners to enhance the supply, diversity, and distribution of the healthcare workforce, acting as an essential part of the healthcare safety net and filling the gaps in the supply of health professionals not met by traditional mar-ket forces. Title VII and Title VIII nurse education programs are the only Federal programs designed to train clinicians in interdisciplinary settings to meet the needs of special and underserved populations, as well as increase minority representation in the healthcare workforce. As demand for health professionals increase in the face of impending shortages combined with faculty shortages across health professions disciplines, racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare, a growing, aging population, and the anticipated de-mand for increased access to care, these needs strain an already fragile healthcare system. AACOM appreciates the investments that have been made in these pro-grams, and we urge the Subcommittee to fund $520 million for the Title VII and VIII programs to include support for the following programs in order to include: the Primary Care Training and Enhancement (PCTE) Program, the Health Careers Op-portunity Program (HCOP), the Centers of Excellence (COE), the Geriatric Edu-cation Centers (GECs) and the Area Health Education Centers (AHECs). We strong-ly oppose the Administration's proposals to eliminate funding for AHECs and the HCOP. AACOM has serious concerns with the Administration's budget request that would cut nearly $15 billion from Medicare graduate medical education (GME). Be-cause GME funding is critical to addressing the existing physician workforce short-age and ensuring patient access to our Nation's healthcare, AACOM believes that current GME funding should not be sacrificed and simply shifted to other healthcare 362 workforce programs of importance. Instead, additional investments in GME are crit- ical to an already insufficiently-funded system. AACOM strongly supports the continuation of the THCGME Program, which pro- vides funding to support primary care medical and dental residents training in com-munity-based settings. THCs currently train more than 350 medical and dental resi-dents and are providing more than 700,000 primary care visits in underserved rural and urban communities. This program will also provide long-term benefits. Accord-ing to the HRSA, physicians who train in THCs are three times more likely to work in such centers and more than twice as likely to work in underserved areas as phy-sicians who train in other settings. The THCGME Program's 5-year authorization expires in fiscal year 2015, but the recruitment of new residents is being impacted now. We support an investment of $10 million in fiscal year 2015 for development grants minimally. Through scholarships and loan repayment, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) supports the recruitment and retention of primary care clinicians to prac-tice in underserved communities. Approximately 50 million Americans live in com-munities with a shortage of health professionals, lacking adequate access to primary care. The self-reported average medical education debt of graduates of colleges of osteopathic medicine who borrowed to attend medical school has increased by al-most $85,000 in the last decade. Today, there are more than 23,000 students en-rolled at osteopathic medical schools across the Nation. Recent graduates report graduating with an average medical education debt of $211,423. Today, there are nearly 8,900 NHSC members providing culturally competent care to more than 9.3 million people. Care is provided at 5,100 NHSC-approved healthcare sites in urban, rural, and frontier areas. In addition to Corps providers currently providing care, nearly 1,100 students, residents, and health providers re-ceive scholarships or participate in the Student to Service Loan Repayment program to prepare to practice, which provides loan repayment assistance to medical stu-dents in their last year of education in return for their commitment to practice. AACOM appreciates the Administration's continued investment in the NHSC and strongly supports the preservation of student scholarship and loan repayment pro-grams. Furthermore, we encourage congressional authorizers and appropriators to work together before current mandatory funding for the NHSC expires at the end of fiscal year 2015. This critical funding works to address the primary care work-force shortage and advances innovative models of service. HRSA's Rural Physician Training grants will help rural-focused training pro- grams recruit and graduate students most likely to practice medicine in under-served rural communities. HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy analyzes potential effects of policy on residents of rural communities and administers grant programs designed to build healthcare capacity at both the local and State levels. Health pro-fessions workforce shortages are exacerbated in rural areas, where communities struggle to attract and keep well-trained providers. According to HRSA, approxi-mately 65 percent of primary care health professional shortage areas are rural. AACOM supports the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request of $4 million for the Rural Physician Training grants. The National Health Care Workforce Commission was designed to develop and evaluate training activities to meet demand for healthcare workers. Without fund-ing, the Commission cannot identify barriers that may create and exacerbate work-force shortages and improve coordination on the Federal, State, and local levels. Having this type of coordinating body in place is becoming more critical as more Americans have insurance coverage and as the population ages, requiring access to care. As the United States struggles to address healthcare provider shortages in cer-tain specialties and in rural and underserved areas, the country lacks a defined pol-icy to address these critical. For these reasons, AACOM recommends that $3 million be appropriated to fund the Commission so it can begin its important work. Research funded by the NIH leads to important medical discoveries regarding the causes, treatments, and cures for common and rare diseases, as well as disease pre-vention. These efforts improve our Nation's health and save lives. To maintain a ro-bust research agenda, further investment will be needed. AACOM recommends $32 billion for the NIH. In today's increasingly demanding and evolving medical curriculum, there is a critical need for more research geared toward evidence-based osteopathic medicine. AACOM believes that it is vitally important to maintain and increase funding for biomedical and clinical research in a variety of areas related to osteopathic prin-ciples and practice, including osteopathic manipulative medicine and comparative effectiveness. In this regard, AACOM encourages support for the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) to continue fulfilling this essential research role. 363 1After a highly competitive peer review process, which includes comprehensive review by pan- els of extramural scientists, NIH awards more than 80 percent of its $30.1 billion budget to ''more than 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools, and other re-search institutions in every State and around the world.'' About 10 percent of its budget sup-ports the work of the approximately 6,000 scientists who work in NIH's own laboratories. (http:// www.nih.gov/about/budget.htm). 2AAI is concerned that a Federal policy limits government scientists' ability to attend pri- vately sponsored scientific meetings and conferences. (See http://www.hhs.gov/travel/policies/ 2012 lpolicy lmanual.pdf AAI believes that ''the rules have had an unintended and deleterious effec t... [and] made government scientists feel cut off from the rest of the scientific commu- nity, wreaked havoc with their ability to fulfill professional commitments, and undermined the morale of some of the government's finest minds.'' Testimony (Amended) of Lauren G. Gross, J.D., on behalf of The American Association of Immunologists (AAI), Submitted to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for the Hearing Record of January 14, 2014: ''Examining Conference and Travel Spending Price Index (BRDPI) ''is developed each year for NIH by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce. It reflects the in-crease in prices of the resources needed to conduct biomedical research, including personnel, services, supplies, and equipment. It indicates how much the NIH budget must change to main-tain purchasing power.'' Johnson, Judith A., ''A History of NIH Funding: Fact Sheet,'' Congres-sional Research Service, R43341, p. 2 (2014). AHRQ supports research to improve healthcare quality, reduce costs, advance pa- tient safety, decrease medical errors, and broaden access to essential services. AHRQ plays an important role in producing the evidence base needed to improve our Nation's health and healthcare. The incremental increases for AHRQ's Patient Centered Health Research Program in recent years will help AHRQ generate more of this research and expand the infrastructure needed to increase capacity to produce this evidence; however, more investment is needed. AACOM recommends $375 million in base discretionary funding, restoring the base to fiscal year 2011 levels for the AHRQ. This investment will preserve AHRQ's current programs while helping to restore its critical healthcare safety, quality, and efficiency initiatives. AACOM is grateful for the opportunity to submit its views and looks forward to continuing to work with the Subcommittee on these important matters. [This statement was submitted by Stephen C. Shannon, D.O., M.P.H., President and Chief Executive Officer, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medi-cine.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF IMMUNOLOGISTS The American Association of Immunologists (AAI), the world's largest professional society of research scientists and physicians who study the immune system, respect-fully submits this testimony regarding fiscal year 2015 appropriations for the Na-tional Institutes of Health (NIH). AAI recommends an appropriation of at least $32 billion for NIH for fiscal year 2015 to support important ongoing research, fund a reasonable number of outstanding new grant applications, and restore NIH funding to a level that can sustain a robust and dynamic biomedical research enterprise in the United States. NIH'S CRUCIAL ROLE IN ADVANCING BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH NIH is essential to the advancement of biomedical research in the United States, where virtually all biomedical scientists rely on NIH leadership and funding.1Aca- demic scientists, many of whom conduct research while teaching the next generation of doctors and scientists, depend on NIH grants to support their research at univer-sities, colleges and research institutions all around the country. NIH intramural sci-entists require funding to do their own research as well as collaborate with their private sector colleagues. 2And scientists employed by industry, who generally do not receive NIH grants or awards, depend on NIH-funded scientific discoveries to develop products that bring research to the bedside. A strong NIH budget, therefore, is essential to all sectors of the U.S. biomedical research enterprise, and has enabled NIH to remain the key international leader influencing biomedical research around the globe. NIH BUDGET WOES SLOW RESEARCH AND THREATEN U .S. PREEMINENCE The slow growth of the NIH budget in recent years, exacerbated by the impact of biomedical research inflation,3has significantly reduced NIH's purchasing power, and in turn, the purchasing power of its grantees. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), ''[i]n constant 2003 dollars, fiscal year 2014 funding is 22 364 4Ibid. 5NIH should robustly fund and primarily rely on individual investigator-initiated research, in which researchers working in institutions across the Nation submit applications to, and fol-lowing independent peer review, receive grants from, NIH. Biomedical innovation and discovery are less likely to be achieved through ''top-down'' science, in which the government specifies the type of research it wishes to fund. 6Couzin-Frankel, Jennifer.

(See http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/health/second- success-raises-hope-for-a-way-to-rid-babies-of-hiv.html) A second study found that adult HIV-in-fected patients who were treated with ART within 4 months of infection display significantly percent lower than the fiscal year 2003 level.''4How many avenues of research have not been followed because of this reduction? How many potential treatments and cures have been delayed or not discovered? These are questions that cannot be an-swered definitively, but we do know that NIH budget reductions have already caused real and lasting damage: the loss of grant funding, even among the most highly qualified scientists; the closure of labs; the termination or interruption of im-portant research; and the emigration of talented scientists to other countries. And we do know that many scientists are spending too much time in a constant chase for funding, rather than conducting research and mentoring the Nation's future re-searchers, inventors and innovators. These budget woes threaten America's pre-eminence in advancing basic biomedical research, discovering urgently needed treat-ments and cures, and ''growing'' brilliant young scientists. RESEARCH ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM : ESSENTIAL TO OUR HEALTH , CRUCIAL TO OUR FUTURE The immune system is the body's primary defense against viruses, bacteria, and parasites that cause disease in millions of people every year. When the immune sys-tem is operating properly, it provides powerful protection against a wide variety of illnesses, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease. The im-mune system can, however, perform poorly, leaving the body vulnerable to infec-tions, including influenza, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and the common cold. It can also become overactive, damaging normal organs and tissues, and causing autoimmune diseases, such as allergy, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. Research scientists and clinicians are working to harness this powerful system to protect people and ani-mals from infectious diseases, cancer, and many other illnesses, and to protect against natural or man-made infectious organisms (including plague, smallpox and anthrax) that could be used for bioterrorism. 5 RECENT IMMUNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND THEIR PROMISE FOR TOMORROW 1. Cancer Immunotherapies: Offering Hope of Conquering Cancer NIH-funded scientists recently identified inhibitory receptors which suppress im- mune cell activation. Blocking these receptors can allow the immune system to de-stroy tumor cells. 6Today, therapeutics targeted against inhibitory receptors like CTLA4 are undergoing rigorous clinical trials against a variety of cancers. The suc-cess rates for these therapies have been astounding and unprecedented: for example, rates of tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma have increased from 10 percent to 50 percent. 7With this level of success, immunotherapy is one of the most exciting and promising areas of cancer treatment. 2. Early Antiretroviral Therapy: Eliminating HIV, Ending AIDS? NIH-funded researchers have discovered that early administration of antiviral medication, known as anti-retroviral therapy (ART), can have lasting effects on an HIV-infected patient's long-term prognosis. In one study, 8an infant born to an HIV- infected mother began receiving ART within hours of birth. The infant tested posi-tive for HIV and continued treatment for 18 months. Despite the HIV diagnosis and subsequent discontinuation of ART, the child remained virus-free 1 year later. A second baby with a similar history also showed an absence of HIV. 9Together with several additional unconfirmed cases of babies ''cured'' of HIV infection, these find-ings offer hope to the 250,000 babies born each year infected with HIV. 10 365 improved response to treatment.

One study involving fecal transplantation (which includes the transfer of intestinal bacteria from one person to another) has found that such transplantation in pill form is well tolerated and is 98-100 percent efficacious in curing infections with Clostridium difficile, a bacterium linked to 14,000 diarrheal deaths in the U.S. per year. 12 4. RSV Vaccine: Saving Infants' Lives Millions of infants are hospitalized and 160,000 children die each year each from pneumonia and other lung diseases caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).13 Until recently, however, a vaccine for RSV has been elusive. In an important break-through, scientists at the NIH discovered antibodies\u2014protective molecules produced by the immune system\u2014that helped identify a key protein for use in vaccine devel-opment. 14The NIH scientists were then able to engineer this protein and dem- onstrate its ability to produce a strong protective immune response against RSV in animals. 15This molecule is expected to be ready soon for testing in humans. Impor- tantly, the approach developed in this case can be applied to vaccine design for nu-merous other viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis C, dengue, and West Nile viruses, that have evaded the body's protective immune responses, and will provide insight into how viruses evade the immune system. CONCLUSION AAI thanks the members and staff of the subcommittee for their ongoing, strong bipartisan support for biomedical research, and recommends an appropriation of at least $32 billion for NIH for fiscal year 2015 to fund important ongoing research, strengthen the biomedical research enterprise, and ensure that the brightest sci-entists, trainees, and students are able to pursue careers in biomedical research in the United States.

Today, CRNAs deliver approximately 34 million anesthetics to patients each year in the U.S. CRNA services include administering the anesthetic, monitoring the patient's vital signs, staying with the patient throughout the sur-gery, and providing acute and chronic pain management services. CRNAs provide anesthesia for a wide variety of surgical cases and in some States are the sole anes-thesia providers in almost 100 percent of rural hospitals, affording these medical fa-cilities obstetrical, surgical, and trauma stabilization, and pain management capa-bilities. CRNAs work in every setting in which anesthesia is delivered, including hospital surgical suites and obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), pain management units and the offices of dentists, podiatrists and plastic surgeons. Nurse anesthetists are experienced and highly trained anesthesia professionals whose record of patient safety is underscored by scientific research findings. The landmark Institute of Medicine report To Err is Human found in 2000 that anes-thesia was 50 times safer then than in the 1980s. (Kohn L, Corrigan J, Donaldson M, ed. To Err is Human. Institute of Medicine, National Academy Press, Wash-ington DC, 2000.) Though many studies have demonstrated the high quality of nurse anesthesia care, the results of a new study published in Health Affairs led researchers to recommend that costly and duplicative supervision requirements for CRNAs be eliminated. Examining Medicare records from 1999-2005, the study com-pared anesthesia outcomes in 14 States that opted-out of the Medicare physician su-pervision requirement for CRNAs with those that did not opt out. (To date, 17 States have opted-out.) The researchers found that anesthesia has continued to grow more safe in opt-out and non-opt-out States alike. (Dulisse B, Cromwell J. No Harm Found When Nurse Anesthetists Work Without Supervision By Physicians. Health Aff. 2010;29(8):1469-1475.) CRNAs provide the lion's share of anesthesia care required by our U.S. Armed Forces through active duty and the reserves, staffing ships, remote U.S. military bases, and forward surgical teams without physician anesthesiologist support. In ad-dition, CRNAs predominate in rural and medically underserved areas, and where more Medicare patients live (Government Accountability Office. Medicare and pri-vate payment differences for anesthesia services. GAO-07-463, Washington DC, Jul. 27, 2007. http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-07-463). Importance of and Request for HRSA Title 8 Nurse Anesthesia Education Fund- ing Our profession's chief request of the Subcommittee is for $4 million to be reserved for nurse anesthesia education and $83.925 million for advanced education nursing from the HRSA Title 8 program, out of a total Title 8 budget of $251 million. We request that the Report accompanying the fiscal year 2014 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill include the following language: ''Within the allocation, the Com-mittee encourages HRSA to allocate funding at least at the fiscal year 2014 level for nurse anesthetist education.'' This funding request is justified by the safety and value proposition of nurse anesthesia, and by anticipated growth in demand for CRNA services as baby boomers retire, become Medicare eligible, and require more healthcare services. In making this request, we associate ourselves with the request made by The Nursing Community with respect to Title 8 and the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) at the National Institutes of Health. The Title 8 program, on which we will focus our testimony, is strongly supported by members of this Subcommittee in the past, and is an effective means to help ad-dress nurse anesthesia workforce demand. In expectation for dramatic growth in the number of U.S. retirees and their healthcare needs, funding the advanced education nursing program at $83.925 million is necessary to meet the continuing demand for nursing faculty and other advanced education nursing services throughout the U.S.,. The program funds competitive grants that help enhance advanced nursing edu-cation and practice, and traineeships for individuals in advanced nursing education programs. It also targets resources toward increasing the number of providers in rural and underserved America and preparing providers at the master's and doc-toral levels, thus increasing the supply of clinicians eligible to serve as nursing fac-ulty, a critical need. Demand remains high for CRNA workforce in clinical and educational settings. A 2007 AANA nurse anesthesia workforce study found a 12.6 percent CRNA va-cancy rate in hospitals and a 12.5 percent faculty vacancy rate. The supply of clin-ical providers has increased in recent years, stimulated by increases in the number of CRNAs trained. From 2002-2012, the annual number of nurse anesthesia edu-cational program graduates increased from 1,362 to 2,469, according to the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs (COA). The number of 367 accredited nurse anesthesia educational programs grew from 85 to 114. We antici- pate increased demand for anesthesia services as the population ages, the number of clinical sites requiring anesthesia services grows, and a portion of the CRNA workforce retires. The capacity of our 114 nurse anesthesia educational programs to educate quali- fied applicants is limited by the number of faculty, the number and characteristics of clinical practice educational sites, and other factors\u2014and they continue turning away hundreds of qualified applicants. A qualified applicant to a CRNA program is a bachelor's educated registered nurse who has spent at least 1 year serving in an acute care healthcare practice environment. They are prepared in nurse anesthesia educational programs located all across the country, including Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, and Tennessee. To meet the nurse anesthesia workforce challenge, the capacity and number of CRNA schools must continue to grow and modernize with the latest advancements in sim-ulation technology and distance learning consistent with improving educational quality and supplying demand for highly qualified providers. With the help of com-petitively awarded grants supported by Title 8 funding, the nurse anesthesia profes-sion is making significant progress, but more is required. This progress is extremely cost-effective from the standpoint of Federal funding. Anesthesia can be provided by nurse anesthetists, physician anesthesiologists, or by CRNAs and anesthesiologists working together. Of these, the nurse anesthesia prac-tice model is by far the most cost-effective, and ensures patient safety. (Hogan P et al. Cost effectiveness analysis of anesthesia providers. Nursing Economic$, Vol. 28 No. 3, May-June 2010, p. 159 et seq.) Nurse anesthesia education represents a significant educational cost-benefit for competitively awarded Federal funding in support of CRNA educational programs. Support for Safe Injection Practices and the Alliance for Injection Safety As a leader in patient safety, the AANA has been playing a vigorous role in the development and projects of the Alliance for Injection Safety, intended to reduce and eventually eliminate the incidence of healthcare facility acquired infections. In the interest of promoting safe injection practice, and reducing the incidence of healthcare facility acquired infections, we associate ourselves with the AIS rec-ommendation. Support Effective Implementation of Provider Non-Discrimination AANA applauds the Committee for including report language in its fiscal year 2014 bill directing the Administration to implement the provision in a manner con-sistent with its intent, to promote competition, quality and choice in a way that sup-ports access and controls costs. The AANA is firmly committed to supporting competition, access and choice with- in the healthcare delivery system and has been working to ensure effective imple-mentation of the Federal provider nondiscrimination provision in the Patient Protec-tion and Affordable Care Act (ACA). This provision, which prohibits health plans from discriminating against qualified licensed healthcare professionals solely on the basis of their licensure, went into effect on January 1, 2014. Proper implementation of the ACA provider nondiscrimination provision is crucial because health plans today may discriminate against whole classes of healthcare professionals based solely on their licensure or certification, limiting or denying pa- tient choice and access to beneficial, safe and cost-efficient healthcare professionals, impairing competition, patient access to care, and optimal healthcare delivery. For example, a commercial carrier in South Carolina stated in its policy manual that it will not reimburse CRNAs for monitored anesthesia care (MAC), but that it will pay anesthesiologists for these same services. Not only does such a policy impair pa-tient access to care provided by CRNAs; it expressly impairs competition and choice and contributes to unjustifiably higher healthcare costs without improving quality or access to care. The AANA urges the committee to include the following report language with the House Appropriation, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee legislation. The Committee directs HHS to continue its work with the Departments of Labor and Treasury to implement the provider non discrimination law to reflect the original Congressional intent of the provision. [This statement was submitted by Dennis Bless, CRNA, MS, President, American Association of Nurse Anesthetists.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS On behalf of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), the largest full service professional organization representing the 189,000 nurse practitioners 368 across the country, we would like to submit the below noted funding requests for fiscal year 2015. Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have been providing primary, acute, and specialty healthcare to patients of all ages for nearly half a century. As you know, in addition to treating acute and chronic illnesses of patients coming to them for care, they emphasize health promotion and disease prevention in all their under-takings. This includes assessments, ordering, performing, supervising and inter-preting diagnostic and laboratory tests, making diagnoses, initiating and managing treatment which includes prescribing medications as well as non-pharmacologic treatments, counselling and educating patients, their families and communities. They are the healthcare providers of choice for millions of patients; in fact last year they conducted over 900 million patient visits across the Nation. The vast majority of nurse practitioners throughout the United States are pri- mary care providers. Eighty 8 percent are prepared to be primary care clinicians and nearly seventy percent are currently practicing in a primary care setting. As clinicians that blend clinical expertise in diagnosing and treating health conditions with an added emphasis on disease prevention and health promotion, NPs bring a comprehensive perspective to healthcare that enhances health and well-being among their patients. Given the demand for primary care providers, NPs are and will con-tinue to fill a critical role in the American healthcare system. Likewise the need to create and fund more nurse managed clinics is critical. As the need for primary care services grows, funding such clinics becomes increasingly necessary. The need to adequately prepare nurse practitioners and facilitate the high quality outcomes of these clinics is clear. Equally clear is the need for funding assistance to nurse prac-titioner educational programs, students and nurse managed clinics. We are anxious to include among our ranks, students who would not be able to enter our programs without assistance as well as clinic sites that serve as clinical education sites and meet the unmet healthcare needs of a wide variety of populations throughout the country. Therefore we ask that at the very least the following funding be appro-priated: For fiscal year 2015, AANP respectfully requests $251 million for the Health Re- sources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Nursing Workforce Development pro-grams (authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.]), $150 million for the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and $20 million in authorized funding for the Nurse-Managed Health Clinics (Title III of the Public Health Service Act). These investments made through the appropriation process will help to ensure that our Nation's population receives high quality, cost effective healthcare. AANP would like to work closely with the committee on areas of common interest. We are happy to serve as a resource to the committee as you make decisions about these investments. We thank you for the opportunity to share our concerns with you and look forward to continuing to work with you and your staff on issues affecting our profession. Please contact AANP's Federal Government Affairs department at: governmentaffairs@aanp.org should you have any questions or need further informa-tion. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), representing 58,000 physicians and partners in women's healthcare, is pleased to offer this state-ment to the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We thank Chairman Harkin, and the entire Subcommittee for the opportunity to provide comments on some of the most impor-tant programs to women's health. Today, the U.S. lags behind many other Nations in healthy births. ACOG's Mak- ing Obstetrics and Maternity Safer (MOMS) Initiative would help improve maternal and infant health through Federal research investments, including comprehensive data collection and surveillance, biomedical research, and translating research into evidence-based care for women and babies. We urge you to make funding of the fol-lowing programs and agencies a top priority in fiscal year 2015. Data Collection and Surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) In order to conduct robust research, uniform, accurate and comprehensive data and surveillance are critical. The National Center for Health Statistics is the Na-tion's principal health statistics agency and collects State data from records like birth certificates that give us raw, vital statistics. Information from birth and death 369 certificates is key to gathering vital information about both mother and baby during pregnancy and labor and delivery. Uniform, accurate data collection depends on all States and territories using electronic birth and death records based on the 2003 US-standard birth and death certificates, yet 4 States are still not using the elec-tronic birth registries and 12 States are still not using the electronic death reg-istries. States not using the standard records likely underreport maternal and infant deaths and complications from childbirth; causes of these deaths remain unknown. Previous appropriations have helped increase the number of States using electronic birth and death registries, but NCHS needs increased resources to help enroll the remaining States, and to improve the accuracy of birth and death data, including through linking data from Electronic Health Records to State vital records systems. For fiscal year 2015, ACOG requests $182 million for the National Center for Health Statistics, $5 million of which we urge you to designate to modernize the National Vitals Statistics System, helping States update their birth and death records sys-tems. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) at CDC extends be- yond vital statistics and surveys new mothers on their experiences and attitudes during pregnancy, with questions on a range of topics, including what their insur-ance covered, whether they had stressful experiences during pregnancy, when they initiated prenatal care, and what kinds of questions their doctor covered during pre-natal care visits. By identifying trends and patterns in maternal health, CDC re-searchers and State health departments are better able to identify behaviors and environmental and health conditions that may lead to preterm births. Only 40 States use the PRAMS surveillance system today. ACOG requests adequate funding to expand PRAMS to all U.S. States and territories. Biomedical Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biomedical research is critically important to understanding the causes of mater- nal and infant mortality and morbidity, and developing effective interventions to lower the incidence of mortality and morbidity. The National Institute on Child Health and Human Development's (NICHD's) 2012 Scientific Vision identified the most promising research opportunities for the next decade. Goals include deter-mining the complex causes of prematurity and developing evidence-based measures for its prevention within the next 10 years, understanding the long term health im-plications of assisted reproductive technology, and understanding the role of the pla-centa in fetal health outcomes. The placenta, one of the least studied human organs, is essential to the viability and proper growth of the fetus. NICHD's Human Pla-centa Project will help discover the causes of placental failures, and ultimately ways to prevent failure and improve maternal and fetal birth outcomes. Another major issue that merits attention is that of clinical trials involving preg- nant women. Pregnant women have historically been excluded from most research trials due to concern that trial participation could harm the fetus. Although there has been substantial progress in the inclusion of women in federally funded re-search, pregnant women are still excluded, even from research that would advance our knowledge of medical conditions and treatments in pregnancy. Mindful of the important considerations of clinical trials on pregnant women, we support establish-ment of a Federal work group to propose how clinical research might be done appro-priately in this area. Adequate levels of research require a robust research workforce. The years of training combined with uncertainty in getting grant funding are huge disincentives for students considering a career in bio-medical research. This has resulted in a huge gap between the too-few women's reproductive health researchers being trained and the immense need for research. We urge continued investments in the Women's Reproductive Health Research (WRHR) Career Development program, Re-productive Scientist Development Program (RSDP), and the Building Interdiscipli-nary Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH) programs to address the shortfall of women's reproductive health researchers. ACOG supports a minimum of $32 billion for NIH and $1.37 billion within that funding request for NICHD in fis-cal year 2015. Public Health Programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Projects at HRSA and CDC are integral to translating research findings into evi- dence-based practice changes in communities. Where NIH conducts research to iden-tify causes of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, CDC and HRSA help ensure those research findings lead to improved maternal and infant health out-comes. 370 Maternal Child Health Block Grant (HRSA): The Maternal Child Health Block Grant at HRSA is the only Federal program that exclusively focuses on improving the health of mothers and children. State and territorial health agencies and their partners use MCH Block Grant funds to reduce infant mortality, deliver services to children and youth with special healthcare needs, support comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care, screen newborns for genetic and hereditary health conditions, deliver childhood immunizations, and prevent childhood injuries. These early healthcare services help keep women and children healthy, elimi- nating the need for later costly care. Every $1 spent on preconception care for a woman with diabetes can save up to $5.19 by preventing costly complications. Over $90 million has been cut from the Block Grant since 2003. ACOG requests $639 mil-lion for the Block Grant in fiscal year 2015 to maintain its current level of services. Title X Family Planning Program (HRSA): Family planning and interconception care are essential to helping ensure healthy women and healthy pregnancies. The Title X Family Planning Program provides services to more than 5 million low in-come men and women who may not otherwise have access to these services. Title X clinics accounting for $3.4 billion in healthcare savings in 2008 alone. ACOG sup-ports $327 million for Title X in fiscal year 2015 to sustain its level of services. Fetal Infant Mortality Review (HRSA): HRSA's Healthy Start Program promotes community-based programs to reduce infant mortality and racial disparities. These programs are encouraged to use the Fetal and Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) which brings together ob-gyn experts and local health departments to address local issues contributing to infant mortality. Today, more than 220 local programs in 42 States find FIMR a powerful tool to help reduce infant mortality and address issues related to preterm delivery. For over 20 years, ACOG has partnered with the Mater-nal and Child Health Bureau to sponsor the National FIMR Program. ACOG sup-ports $0.5 million in fiscal year 2015 for HRSA to increase the number of Healthy Start programs that use FIMR. Maternal Health Initiative (HRSA): The Maternal Child Health Bureau launched the Maternal Health Initiative to foster the notion of ''healthy moms make healthy babies.'' As part of this effort, ACOG has convened the National Partnership on Ma-ternal Safety to identify key factors to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. ACOG requests at a minimum level funding for MCHB to advance this important work. Safe Motherhood, Maternity and Perinatal Collaboratives (CDC): The Safe Moth- erhood Initiative at CDC works with State health departments to collect information on pregnancy-related deaths, track preterm births, and improve maternal outcomes. Through Safe Motherhood, CDC funds State-based Maternity and Perinatal Collaboratives that improve birth outcomes by encouraging use of evidence-based care, including reducing early elective deliveries. Through the Ohio Perinatal Qual-ity Collaborative, started in 2007 with funding from CDC, 21 OB teams in 25 hos-pitals have significantly decreased early non-medically necessary deliveries, in ac-cordance with ACOG guidelines, reducing costly and dangerous pre-term births. Avalere estimated that reducing early elective can save from $2.4 million to $9 mil-lion a year. The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act, enacted in 2013, authorizes funding to increase the number of States receiving assistance for perinatal collaboratives. ACOG urges you to re-instate the pre-term birth sub-line as authorized by PREEMIE and provide an additional $16 million to Safe Motherhood to implement PREEMIE and help States expand or establish maternity perinatal care collaboratives. Again, we would like to thank the Committee for commitment to improving wom- en's health, and we urge you to fund programs we've identified in our MOMS Initia-tive in fiscal year 2015. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS The American College of Physicians (ACP) is pleased to submit the following statement for the record on its priorities, as funded under the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, for fiscal year 2015. ACP is the largest medical specialty organization and the second-largest physician group in the United States. ACP members include 137,000 internal medicine physicians (internists), related sub-specialists, and medical students. Internal medicine physicians are specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness. As the Subcommittee begins deliberations on appropriations for fiscal year 2015, ACP is urging funding for the following proven programs to receive appropriations from the Subcommittee: 371 \u2014Title VII, Section 747, Primary Care Training and Enhancement, at no less than $71 million; \u2014National Health Service Corps, $810 million in funding, including the $310 mil- lion in enhanced funding through the Community Health Centers Fund; \u2014National Health Care Workforce Commission, $3 million; \u2014Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, $375 million; and \u2014Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Program Management for Market- places, $629 million. The United States is facing a growing shortage of physicians in key specialties, most notably in general internal medicine and family medicine\u2014the specialties that provide primary care to most adult and adolescent patients. With enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), we expect the demand for primary care services to in-crease with the addition of 25 million Americans receiving access to health insur-ance, including an additional 13 million under Medicaid/CHIP, once the law is fully implemented. With increased demand, current projections indicate there will be a shortage of over 45,000 primary care physicians by 2020, growing to a shortage of over 65,000 primary care physicians by 2025. (AAMC Center for Workforce Studies with the Lewin Group. The Impact of Health Care Reform on the Future Supply and Demand of Physicians Updated Projections Through 2025. June 2010. Accessed at: https://www.aamc.org/download/158076/data/updated lprojections lthrough l 2025.pdf). Without critical funding for vital workforce programs, this physician shortage will only grow worse. A strong primary care infrastructure is an essential part of any high-functioning healthcare system, with over 100 studies showing pri-mary care is associated with better outcomes and lower costs of care (http:// www.acponline.org/advocacy/where lwelstand/policy/primary lshortage.pdf). The health professions' education programs, authorized under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act and administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), support the training and education of healthcare providers to enhance the supply, diversity, and distribution of the healthcare work-force, filling the gaps in the supply of health professionals not met by traditional market forces, and are critical in helping institutions and programs respond to the current and emerging challenges of ensuring that all Americans have access to ap-propriate and timely health services. Within the Title VII program, we urge the Subcommittee to fund the Section 747, Primary Care Training and Enhancement program at $71 million, in order to maintain and expand the pipeline for individuals training in primary care. The Section 747 program is the only source of Federal training dollars available for general internal medicine, general pediatrics, and fam-ily medicine. For example, general internists, who have long been at the frontline of patient care, have benefitted from Title VII training models emphasizing inter-disciplinary training that have helped prepare them to work with other health pro-fessionals, such as physician assistants, patient educators, and psychologists. With- out a substantial increase in funding, for the fourth year in a row, HRSA will not be able to carry out a competitive grant cycle for physician training; the Nation needs new initiatives supporting expanded training in multi-professional care, the patient-centered medical home, and other new competencies required in our devel-oping health system. The College urges $810 million in funding for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), as requested in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget; this amount in-cludes the $310 million in enhanced funding the Health and Human Services Sec-retary has been given the authority to provide to the NHSC through the Community Health Centers Fund. Since the enactment of the ACA, the NHSC has awarded over $1 billion in scholarships and loan repayment to healthcare professionals to help ex-pand the country's primary care workforce and meet the healthcare needs of under-served communities across the country. With field strength of nearly 9,000 clini-cians, NHSC members are providing culturally competent care to more than 10.4 million people at nearly 14,000 NHSC-approved healthcare sites in urban, rural, and frontier areas. The increase in funds would expand NHSC field strength to 15,000 and would serve the needs of more than 16 million patients, helping to ad-dress the health professionals' workforce shortage and growing maldistribution. The programs under NHSC have proven to make an impact in meeting the healthcare needs of the underserved, and with increased appropriations, they can do more. We urge the Subcommittee to fully fund the National Health Care Workforce Commission, as authorized by the ACA, at $3 million. The Commission is authorized to review current and projected healthcare workforce supply and demand and make recommendations to Congress and the Administration regarding national healthcare workforce priorities, goals, and polices. Members of the Commission have been ap-pointed, but have not begun work due to a lack of funding. The College believes the Nation needs a comprehensive workforce policy founded on sound research to deter-372 mine the Nation's current and future needs for physicians by specialty and geo- graphic areas; the work of the Commission is imperative to ensure Congress is cre-ating the best policies for our Nation's needs. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the leading public health service agency focused on healthcare quality. AHRQ's research provides the evidence-based information needed by consumers, clinicians, health plans, pur-chasers, and policymakers to make informed healthcare decisions. The College is dedicated to ensuring AHRQ's vital role in improving the quality of our Nation's health and recommends a budget of $375 million. This amount will allow AHRQ to help providers help patients by making evidence-informed decisions, fund research that serves as the evidence engine for much of the private sector's work to keep pa-tients safe, make the healthcare market place more efficient by providing quality measures to health professionals, and ultimately, help transform health and healthcare. Finally, ACP supports $629 million in funding for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Program Management for Marketplaces as requested in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget in order to carry out its duties as necessary. Such funding would allow the Federal Government to continue to administer the in-surance marketplaces as authorized by the ACA if a State has declined to establish an exchange that meets Federal requirements. CMS now manages and operates some or all marketplace activities in over 30 States. If the Subcommittee decides to deny the requested funds, it will be much more difficult for the Federal Govern-ment to operate and manage a federally-facilitated exchange in those States, raising questions about where and how their residents would obtain and maintain coverage. It is ACP's belief that all legal Americans\u2014regardless of income level, health status, or geographic location\u2014must have access to affordable health insurance. In conclusion, the College is keenly aware of the fiscal pressures facing the Sub- committee today, but strongly believes the United States must invest in these pro-grams in order to achieve a high performance healthcare system and build capacity in our primary care workforce and public health system. The College greatly appre-ciates the support of the Subcommittee on these issues and looks forward to working with Congress as you begin to work on the fiscal year 2015 appropriations process. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE The American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) urges the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Sub-committee to reaffirm its support for training preventive medicine physicians and other public health professionals by providing $10 million in fiscal year 2015 for pre-ventive medicine residency training under the public health and preventive medi-cine line item in Title VII of the Public Health Service Act. We further respectfully request that funds allocated for ''public health and preventive medicine'' be sepa-rated into two distinct line items, with separation of funds for preventive medicine residency training from other funds allocated to the ''public health and preventive medicine'' line-item. In conjunction, ACPM also supports the recommendation of the Health Professions and Nursing Education Coalition of $520 million in fiscal year 2015 to support all health professions and nursing education and training programs authorized under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. In today's healthcare environment, the tools and expertise provided by preventive medicine physicians play an integral role in ensuring effective functioning of our Nation's public health system. These tools and skills include the ability to deliver evidence-based clinical preventive services, expertise in population-based health sciences, and knowledge of the social and behavioral determinants of health and dis-ease. These are the tools employed by preventive medicine physicians who practice at the health system level where improving the health of populations, enhancing ac-cess to quality care, and reducing the costs of medical care are paramount. As the body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of clinical and population-based inter-ventions continues to expand, so does the need for specialists trained in preventive medicine. Organizations across the spectrum have recognized the growing demand for pre- ventive medicine professionals. The Institute of Medicine released a report in 2007 calling for an expansion of preventive medicine training programs by an ''additional 400 residents per year,'' and the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Edu-cation (ACGME) recommends increased funding for preventive medicine residency training programs. Additionally, the Association of American Medical Colleges re-leased statements in 2011 that stressed the importance of incorporating behavioral and social sciences in medical education as well as announcing changes to the Med-373 ical College Admission Test that would test applicants on their knowledge in these areas. Such measures strongly indicate increasing recognition of the need to take a broader view of health that goes beyond just clinical care\u2014a view that is a unique focus and strength of preventive medicine residency training. In fact, preventive medicine is the only one of the 24 medical specialties recog- nized by the American Board of Medical Specialties that requires and provides training in both clinical and population-based medicine. Preventive medicine resi-dency training programs provide a blueprint on how to train our future physician workforce; physicians trained to zoom in on individual patient care needs and zoom out to the community and population level to identify and treat the social deter-minants of health. Preventive medicine physicians have the training and expertise to advance the population health outcomes that public and private payers are in-creasingly promoting to their providers. These physicians have a strong focus on quality care improvement and are at the forefront of efforts to integrate primary care and public health. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and health workforce experts, there are personnel shortages in many public health occu-pations, including epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and environmental health work-ers among others. According to the 2012 Physician Specialty Data Book released by the Association of American Medical Colleges, preventive medicine had one of the biggest decrease (-25 percent) in the number of first-year ACGME residents and fel-lows between 2005 and 2010. ACPM is deeply concerned about the shortage of pre-ventive medicine-trained physicians and the ominous trend of even fewer training opportunities. This deficiency in physicians trained to carry out core public health activities will lead to major gaps in the expertise needed to deliver clinical preven-tion and community public health. The impact on the health of those populations served by HRSA may be profound. Despite being recognized as an underdeveloped national resource and in shortage for many years, physicians training in the specialty of Preventive Medicine are the only medical residents whose graduate medical education (GME) costs are not sup-ported by Medicare, Medicaid or other third party insurers. Training occurs outside hospital-based settings and therefore is not financed by GME payments to hospitals. Both training programs and residency graduates are rapidly declining at a time of unprecedented national, State, and community need for properly trained physicians in public health and disaster preparedness, prevention-oriented practices, quality improvement, and patient safety. Currently, residency programs scramble to patch together funding packages for their residents. Limited stipend support has made it difficult for programs to attract and retain high-quality applicants. Support for faculty and tuition has been almost non-existent. Directors of residency programs note that they receive many inquiries about and applications for training in preventive medicine; however, training slots often are not available for those highly qualified physicians who are not directly sponsored by an outside agency or who do not have specific interests in areas for which limited stipends are available (such as research in cancer prevention). HRSA\u2014as authorized in Title VII of the Public Health Service Act\u2014is a critical funding source for several preventive medicine residency programs, as it represents the largest Federal funding source for these programs. HRSA funding ($3.8 million in fiscal year 2014) currently supports only 55 preventive medicine residents across 8 residency training programs. An increase of roughly $6 million will allow HRSA to support nearly 120 new preventive medicine residents. Of note, the preventive medicine residency programs directly support the mission of the HRSA health professions programs by facilitating practice in underserved communities and promoting training opportunities for underrepresented minorities: \u2014Thirty-five percent of HRSA-supported preventive medicine graduates practice in medically underserved communities, a rate of almost 3.5 times the average for all health professionals. These physicians are meeting a critical need in these underserved communities. \u2014Nearly one in five preventive medicine residents funded through HRSA pro- grams are under-represented minorities, which is almost twice the average of minority representation among all health professionals. \u2014Fourteen percent of all preventive medicine residents are under-represented mi- norities, the largest proportion of any medical specialty. In addition to training under-represented minorities and generating physicians who work in medically underserved areas, preventive medicine residency programs equip our society with health professionals and public health leaders who possess the tools and skills needed in the fight against the chronic disease epidemic that is threatening the future of our Nation's health and prosperity. Correcting the root causes of this critical problem of chronic diseases will require a multidisciplinary ap-374 proach that addresses issues of access to healthcare; social and environmental influ- ences; and behavioral choices. ACPM applauds the initiation of programs such as the Community Transformation Grant that take this broad view of the determinants of chronic disease. However, any efforts to strengthen the public health infrastruc-ture and transform our communities into places that encourage healthy choices must include measures to strengthen the existing training programs that help produce public health leaders. Many of the leaders of our Nation's local and State health departments are trained in preventive medicine. Their unique combination of expertise in both med-ical knowledge and public health makes them ideal choices to head the fight against chronic disease as well as other threats to our Nation's health. Their contributions are invaluable. Investing in the residency programs that provide physicians with the training and skills to take on these leadership positions is an essential part of keep-ing Americans healthy and productive. As such, the American College of Preventive Medicine urges the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee to reaffirm its support for training preven-tive medicine physicians and other public health professionals by providing $10 mil-lion in fiscal year 2015 for preventive medicine residency training under the public health and preventive medicine line item in Title VII of the Public Health Service Act. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY The American College of Radiology (ACR)\u2014a professional organization serving more than 35,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, interventional radiologists, nu-clear medicine physicians, and medical physicists\u2014recommends increased funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in fiscal year 2015 appropriations legis-lation. Specifically, the ACR endorses the position of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research\u2014a coalition of more than 300 patient and voluntary health groups, med-ical and scientific societies, academic and research organizations, and industry\u2014 that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Nation's investment in medical research. That rec-ommended funding level is approximately $1.874 billion above the President's Budg-et request for fiscal year 2015. Additionally, the ACR joins the Ad Hoc Group in urging Congress and the Administration to work in a bipartisan manner to end se-questration and the continued cuts to medical research that squander invaluable scientific opportunities, discourage young scientists, jeopardize our economic future, and threaten medical progress and continued improvements in our Nation's health. The value of the NIH to American taxpayers is immeasurable, and there have been several recent examples of impactful science in the biomedical imaging domain that would not have been realized and translated swiftly into patient care without NIH support and involvement. For instance, the NIH National Cancer Institute's (NCI) nearly decade-long National Lung Screening Trial\u2014conducted by the Amer-ican College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) and Lung Screening Study group\u2014found that computed tomography (CT) screening of high risk patients could reduce deaths from lung cancer by 20 percent versus chest X-ray screening. Another NCI-supported success, the National CT Colonography Trial\u2014also conducted by ACRIN\u2014found that virtual colonoscopy was effective as a screening method for colorectal cancer thanks to its accuracy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient ac-ceptability compared to more invasive and potentially intimidating screening op-tions. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) now a member of the NRG Oncology Group in the new National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), is the inter-national leader in investigating the appropriateness of advanced technologies such as proton therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in multi-center randomized trials examining the safety, effectiveness, and quality of life implica-tions of these treatments. Additional ACRIN (now ECOG-ACRIN in the NCTN) and NRG activities under NCI's purview promise to advance the areas of personalized early cancer detection, identify biomarkers to predict treatment effectiveness, reduce the rate of false-positive imaging examinations, and improve cancer screening out-comes. However, NCI's funding of cooperative groups in the evolved National Clin-ical Trials Network (NCTN) has been severely cut and the groups' planned budgets are considerably below expectations. We urge Congress to restore the full funding approved by the NCI's Board of Scientific Advisors for the organizations that transitioned from the cooperative group program into the new NCTN. Although smaller than NCI, the NIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) has likewise been successful in advancing the science behind evolving biomedical imaging technologies and techniques. The ACR played 375 a key role in NIBIB's creation through co-founding a coalition of likeminded organi- zations and working with Federal policymakers to successfully advance the estab-lishing legislation in 2000. Since its inception, NIBIB has been particularly effective in supporting training initiatives, educational symposia, and international collabora-tions, as well as fostering future generations of biomedical imaging and bio-engineering scientists via innovative initiatives and communications. Without significantly increased funding levels for NIH in fiscal year 2015 and be- yond, America's leadership in biomedical research will decline, scientists will be in-creasingly discouraged by the lack of funding opportunities, and innovative tech-nologies and techniques (such as those supported through NCI and NIBIB) will not be appropriately researched and translated into patient care. Therefore, the ACR endorses the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research's recommendation that NIH re-ceive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as part of a multi-year increase, and that Congress and the Administration work together to decisively end sequestration. Thank you for your consideration. [This statement was submitted by Gloria R. Romanelli, JD, Senior Director of Legislative and Regulatory Relations, and Michael Peters, Director of Legislative and Regulatory Affairs.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION The American Dental Education Association (ADEA), on behalf of all 65 U.S. den- tal schools, 700 dental residency training programs, nearly 600 allied dental pro-grams, as well as more than 12,000 faculty who educate and train the nearly 50,000 students and residents attending these institutions, submits this statement for the record and for your consideration as you begin to prioritize fiscal year 2015 appro-priation requests. ADEA urges you to protect the funding and fundamental struc-ture of Federal programs that provide access to oral healthcare to millions of Amer-ican, train the next generation of healthcare providers and fund cutting-edge dental and craniofacial research. At ADEA's academic dental institutions, future practitioners and researchers are trained and significant dental safety-net care is provided. Services are provided through campus and offsite dental clinics where students and faculty provide oral healthcare to the uninsured and underserved populations. And, in light of the find-ings that good oral health is inextricably linked to good systemic health, the need to provide access to oral healthcare is critical. However, in order to provide these services, there must be adequate funding. We are asking the committee to help ADEA's member institutions continue to pro- vide care to all segments of the population by maintaining adequate funding for pro-grams focused on access to oral healthcare, dental and craniofacial research, and training for oral healthcare providers. Specifically we request that you maintain and protect funding for Title VII of the Public Health Service Act; the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Re-search (NIDCR); the Dental Health Improvement Act; Part F of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment and Modernization Act: the Dental Reimbursement Program and the Community-Based Dental Partnerships Program; and State-Based Oral Health Programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These programs enhance and sustain State oral health departments, fund public health programs proven to prevent oral disease, fund research to eradicate dental disease and detect certain cancers, and fund programs to develop an adequate workforce of dentists with advanced training to serve American citizens including the under-served, the elderly, and those suffering from chronic immune-compromised condi-tions and life-threatening diseases. We respectfully make the following requests: \u2014$32 million for Oral Health Training Programs The dental programs in Title VII, Section 748 of the Public Health Service Act that provide training in general, pediatric, and public health dentistry and dental hygiene are critical. Support for these programs will help to ensure there will be an adequate oral healthcare workforce. The funding supports pre-doctoral oral health education and postdoctoral pediatric, general, and public health dentistry training. The investment that Title VII makes not only helps to educate dentists and dental hygienists, but also expands access to care for underserved communities. Additionally, Section 748 addresses the shortage of professors in dental schools with the dental faculty loan repayment program and faculty development courses for those who teach pediatric, general, or public health dentistry or dental hygiene. There are currently almost 200 open budgeted faculty positions in dental schools. These two programs provide schools with assistance in recruiting and retaining fac-376 ulty. ADEA is increasingly concerned that with projected restrained funding, the oral health research community will not be able to grow and that the pipeline of new researchers will be inadequate to the future need. Title VII Diversity and Student Aid programs play a critical role in helping to di- versify the health profession's student body and thereby the healthcare workforce. For the last several years, these programs have not received adequate funding to sustain the progress that is necessary to meet the challenges of an increasingly di-verse U.S. population. ADEA is most concerned that the Administration did not re-quest any funds for the Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP). This program provides a vital source of support for oral health professionals serving underserved and disadvantaged patients by providing a pipeline for such individuals from these populations to learn about careers in healthcare generally and dentistry specifically that is not available through other workforce programs. For example, a collaboration between the University of Connecticut's Schools of Dental Medicine and Medicine have used HCOP grants to perform extensive out-reach to colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU); support 30 week and 6 week summer science enrichment programs in middle schools; sup-port several high school programs, including a Bridge to the Future Science Men-toring, support mini dental and medical programs, and in support of a Junior and Senior Doctors' Academy program. And at the college level the two schools continue the Bridge to the Future Science Mentor program and conduct a 7 week Health Dis-parities Clinical Summer Research Fellowship program that explores an introduc-tion to health disparities, cross cultural issues, principles of clinical medicine and skills for public health research and interventions, techniques for work with diverse populate and interventions, techniques for work with diverse populations. UCONN's program is illustrative of programs that dental schools at the Univer- sity of Iowa, Kansas University, University of Maryland-Baltimore, the University of South Alabama, Marquette University, the University of Michigan, and many others have sponsored. HRSA reports that the average grant is only $670,000 and reaches over 7,100 students from underserved and disadvantaged background. If policy makers are serious about reversing health disparities and providing op- portunity for underrepresented minorities and economically disadvantaged individ-uals they will continue this program at current levels, if not expand it. Another vital program targeted at enhancing high quality culturally competent care in community-based interprofessional clinical training settings is the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) program. Again the Administration's has not re-quested any funds. The infrastructure development grants and point of service maintenance and expansion grants ensure that patients from underserved popu-lations receive quality care in a technologically current setting and that health pro-fessionals receive training in treating such diverse populations. The reason given by HRSA in not requesting any appropriations for next fiscal year is short-sighted and counterproductive. HRSA states that funding priorities is being redirected to programs that directly increase the number of primary care health professionals. Increasing the number of providers without the adequate op-portunities to treat underrepresented populations in their communities makes little clinical or cultural sense. This is the case especially if the policy goals remain to increase the number coming from those populations and practicing in rural and un-derserved areas. Exposure to the rewards and professional challenges of such care is a powerful enducement to accomplishing the goal. ADEA encourages the Com-mittee, in the strongest possible terms, to continue funding the AHEC program. \u2014$18 million for Part F of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment and Moderniza- tion Act: Dental Reimbursement Program (DRP) and the Community-Based Dental Partnerships Program Patients with compromised immune systems are more prone to oral infections like periodontal disease and tooth decay. By providing reimbursement to dental schools and schools of dental hygiene, the Dental Reimbursement Program (DRP) provides access to quality dental care for people living with HIV/AIDS while simultaneously providing educational and training opportunities to dental residents, dental stu-dents, and dental hygiene students who deliver the care. DRP is a cost-effective Fed-eral/institutional partnership that provides partial reimbursement to academic den-tal institutions for costs incurred in providing dental care to people living with HIV/ AIDS. This program, in fiscal year 2013, only reimbursed dental schools for the un-reimbursed costs at 23 percent of those costs, continuing the shift of the cost burden to the schools. This path is not sustainable to provide the necessary care. The in-crease requested would reimburse barely half of the dental school's incurred costs of care. \u2014$425 million for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) 377 Discoveries stemming from dental research have reduced the burden of oral dis- eases, led to better oral health for millions of Americans, and uncovered important associations between oral and systemic health. Dental researchers are poised to make breakthroughs that can result in dramatic progress in medicine and health, such as repairing natural form and function to faces destroyed by disease, accident, or war injuries; diagnosing systemic disease from saliva instead of blood samples (such as HIV, and certain types of cancer); and deciphering the complex interactions and causes of oral health disparities involving social, economic, cultural, environ-mental, racial, ethnic, and biological factors. Dental research is the underpinning of the profession of dentistry. With grants from NIDCR, dental researchers in aca-demic dental institutions have built a base of scientific and clinical knowledge that has been used to enhance the quality of the Nation's oral health and overall health. Also, dental scientists are putting science to work for the benefit of the healthcare system through translational research, comparative effectiveness research, health information technology, health research economics, and further research on health disparities. \u2014$19 million for the Division of Oral Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The CDC Division of Oral Health expands the coverage of effective prevention programs. The program increases the basic capacity of State oral health programs to accurately assess the needs of the State, organize and evaluate prevention pro-grams, develop coalitions, address oral health in State health plans, and effectively allocate resources to the programs. This strong public health response is needed to meet the challenges of oral disease affecting children and vulnerable populations. The level of funds available in recent fiscal years are below the level needed to adequately sustain an appropriately staffed State dental program, provide a robust surveillance system to monitor and report disease, and support State efforts with other governmental, non-profit, and corporate partners. The current path of funding will continue to have a negative effect upon the overall health and preparedness of the Nation's States and communities. Thank you for your consideration of these requests. ADEA looks forward to work- ing with you to ensure the continuation of congressional support for these critical programs. Also, please feel free to use ADEA as a resource on any matter pertaining to academic dentistry under your purview. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL HYGIENISTS ' ASSOCIATION On behalf of the American Dental Hygienists' Association (ADHA), thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding fiscal year 2015 appropriations. ADHA appreciates the Subcommittee's past support of programs that seek to im-prove the oral health of Americans and to bolster the oral health workforce. Oral health is a part of total health and authorized oral healthcare programs require ap-propriations support in order to increase the accessibility of oral health services, particularly for the underserved. ADHA urges that the block on funding for Section 340G-1 of the Public Health Service Act\u2014a much needed dental workforce dem-onstration program\u2014be lifted and that $1.25 million be appropriated. Lifting the block on this dental workforce grants program, officially titled the Alternative Den-tal Health Care Providers Demonstration Program, would send an important signal to States and to HRSA that innovation in dental workforce is a meritorious under-taking. Importantly, the authorizing language requires that the grants be conducted in compliance with State law and that they must increase access to dental healthcare in rural and other underserved communities. Further, the Institute of Medicine is required to provide a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the grants. Congress recognized the need to improve the oral healthcare delivery system when it authorized the Alternative Dental Health Care Provider Demonstration Grants, Section 340G-1 of the Public Health Service Act. The Alternative Dental Health Care Providers Demonstration Grants program is a Federal grant program that recognizes the need for innovations to be made in oral healthcare delivery to bring quality care to the underserved by pilot testing new models. The authorizing statute makes clear that pilots must ''increase access to dental care services in rural and underserved communities'' and comply with State licensing requirements. New dental providers are already authorized in Minnesota and are under consid- eration in a number of States, including Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Massachu-setts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Vermont, and Washington State. Both the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the PEW Charitable Trust Dental Campaign are investing in State efforts to increase oral healthcare access by adding new types of dental pro-378 viders to the dental team. Further, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission supported dental workforce expansion in December 2013, noting that ''expanding the supply of dental therapist s...i s likely to increase the output of basic dental services, en- hance competition, reduce costs and expand access to dental care.'' The National Governors Association's January 2014 issue brief on ''The Role of Dental Hygienists in Providing Access to Oral Health Care'' found that ''innovative State programs are showing that increased use of dental hygienists can promote access to oral healthcare, particularly for underserved populations, including children'' and that ''such access can reduce the incidence of serious tooth decay and other dental dis-ease in vulnerable populations.'' The fiscal year 2014 HHS funding bill included language designed to block fund- ing for this important demonstration program. We seek your leadership in removing this unjustified prohibition on funding for the Alternative Dental Health Care Pro-viders Demonstration Grants. Further, because the authorizing language required HRSA to begin the dental workforce grant program under Section 340G-1 within 2 years of its 2010 enactment (i.e., by 2012) and to conclude it within 7 years of enactment (2017), language directing HRSA to move forward with Section 340G-1 grants despite this timeline is needed. ADHA, along with more than 60 other oral healthcare organizations, advocated for funding of this important program. Without the appropriate supply, diversity and distribution of the oral health workforce, the current oral health access crisis will only be exacerbated. ADHA recommends fund-ing at a level of $1.25 million for fiscal year 2015 to support these vital dental work-force demonstration projects. Additionally, ADHA joins the American Dental Association, the American Dental Education Association and others in the oral health community, in recommending $32 million for Title VII Program Grants to expand and educate the dental work-force; $19 million for oral health programming at CDC, and funding of $425 million for National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. ADHA urges funding of all authorized oral health programs and describes some of the key oral health programs below: Title VII Program Grants to Expand and Educate the Dental Workforce\u2014Fund at a level of $32 million in fiscal year 2015 A number of existing grant programs offered under Title VII support health pro- fessions education programs, students, and faculty. ADHA is pleased dental hygien-ists are recognized as primary care providers of oral health services and are in-cluded as eligible to apply for several of the grants offered under ''General, Pedi-atric, and Public Health Dentistry.'' With millions more Americans eligible for den-tal coverage in coming years, it is critical that the oral health workforce is bolstered. Dental and dental hygiene education programs currently struggle with significant shortages in faculty and there is a dearth of providers pursuing careers in public health dentistry and pediatric dentistry. Securing appropriations to expand the Title VII grant offerings to additional dental hygienists and dentists will provide much needed support to programs, faculty, and students in the future. Oral Health Programming within the Centers for Disease Control\u2014Fund at a level of $19 million in fiscal year 2015 ADHA joins with others in the dental community in urging $19 million for oral health programming within the Centers for Disease Control. This funding level will enable CDC to continue its vital work to control and prevent oral disease, including vital work in community water fluoridation. Federal grants will serve to facilitate improved oral health leadership at the State level, support the collection and syn-thesis of data regarding oral health coverage and access, promote the integrated de-livery of oral health and other medical services, enable States to be innovative, and promote a data-driven approach to oral health programming. National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research\u2014Fund at a level of $425 million in fiscal year 2015 The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) cultivates oral health research that has led to a greater understanding of oral diseases and their treatments and the link between oral health and overall health. Research spurs innovation and efficiency, both of which are vital to improving access to oral healthcare services and improved oral status of Americans in the future. ADHA joins with others in the oral health community to support NIDCR funding at a level of $425 million in fiscal year 2015. ADHA is the largest national organization representing the professional interests of more than 150,000 licensed dental hygienists across the country. In order to be-come licensed as a dental hygienist, an individual must graduate from one of the Nation's 335 accredited dental hygiene education programs and successfully com-379 plete a national written and a State or regional clinical examination. Dental hygien- ists are primary care providers of oral health services and are licensed in each of the 50 States. Hygienists are committed to improving the Nation's oral health, a fundamental part of overall health and general well-being. In the past decade, the link between oral health and total health has become more apparent and the signifi-cant disparities in access to oral healthcare services have been well documented. At this time, when 130 million Americans struggle to obtain the oral healthcare re-quired to remain healthy, Congress has a great opportunity to support oral health prevention, infrastructure and workforce efforts that will make care more accessible and cost-effective. Conclusion ADHA appreciates the difficult task appropriators face in prioritizing and funding the many meritorious programs and grants offered by the Federal Government. ADHA urges the Committee to lift the block on funding for Section 340G-1 of the PHSA, dental workforce demonstration grants. Lifting the block on funding for these dental workforce grants would be an important signal to States and to healthcare stakeholders that exploring new ways of bringing oral health services to the underserved is a meritorious expenditure of resources. In addition to the items listed, ADHA also supports full funding for community health centers, and urges HRSA be directed to further bolster the delivery of oral health services at commu-nity health centers, including the use of new types of dental providers. ADHA re-mains a committed partner in advocating for meaningful oral health programming that makes efficient use of the existing oral health workforce and delivers high qual-ity, cost-effective care.

In 2010 (latest available data), suicide took the lives of more than 38,000 Americans, up 31 percent from 2000. AFSP supports at a minimum a $40 million investment in suicide prevention re- search as recommended by Representative Ron Barber in H.R. 4075 (the Suicide Prevention Research Innovation Act or SPRINT Act) so we can obtain similar reduc-tions in suicide mortality that have resulted from strategic investments in other major public health concerns. Full Funding of $25 Million for the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) The NVDRS collects in-depth information on the details of and circumstances sur- rounding each suicide, which goes beyond the basic information collected through the CDC's National Vital Statistics Reports/Fatal Injury Report and implementing the NVDRS nationwide is essential to developing, informing and evaluating suicide prevention programs. Currently, the National Violent Death Reporting System collects surveillance data in only 18 States (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin). The data collected helps inform policy makers on trends and characteristics of violent deaths within 380 specific communities so they can design appropriate prevention measures and evalu- ate ongoing efforts to curb violence. Included in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus appropriations bill was an additional $7.7 million (bringing the program total to $11.2 million) in funding to expand the program; however, AFSP requests the full $25 million be provided so the CDC would have the resources to scale up this effort to include all 50 States. Today, there exists no other data surveillance system that offers this benefit for such a modest investment. No other data collection or centralization effort carries the inherent value associated with NVDRS and, in fact, no other effort has the ability to directly inform and impact State and Federal suicide prevention activities. Funding of $60.15 Million for GLSMA Suicide Prevention Programs Since its creation in 2004, GLSMA has provided resources to communities and col- lege campuses all across the country, and supported needed technical assistance to develop and disseminate effective strategies and promising practices related to youth suicide prevention. To date, the GLSMA has supported youth suicide preven-tion grants in 49 States, the District of Columbia and Guam, 48 Tribes or Tribal organizations, and 138 institutions of higher education. AFSP requests that the Committee approve $60.15 million for GLSMA programs in fiscal year 2015 to ensure a continuation of these critically important youth and college suicide prevention programs. Funding of $20 Million for Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) Sometimes, first aid isn't a bandage, or CPR, or the Heimlich, or calling 911. Sometimes, first aid is you. While many Americans know how to administer first aid and seek medical help should they come across a person having a heart attack, few are trained to provide similar help to someone experiencing a mental health or substance abuse crisis. Mental Health First Aid is a public education program that helps people identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illnesses and substance abuse. The course teaches participants a 5-step action plan to reach out to a person in crisis and connect them with professional, peer, or other help. AFSP requests that $20 million be approved for MHFA training programs around the country that would train participants in recognizing the symptoms of common mental illnesses and addiction disorders, de-escalating crisis situations safely, and initiating timely referral to mental health and substance abuse resources available in the community. 381 Thank you for your time and consideration of these requests by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Should you have any questions I can be reached at jmadigan@afsp.org. [This statement was submitted by John Madigan, Vice President, Public Policy.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: We submit this testimony on behalf of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), a non-profit organization of over 6,000 geriatrics healthcare professionals dedicated to improving the health, inde-pendence and quality of life of all older Americans. As the Subcommittee works on its fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, we ask that you prioritize funding for the geriatrics education and training programs under Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act and for research funding within the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging. We ask that the subcommittee consider the following recommended funding levels for these programs in fiscal year 2015: \u2014$39.7 million for Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions Programs \u2014$5.0 million for Title VIII Comprehensive Geriatric Education Nursing Program \u2014An increase of $500 million for aging research within the National Institutes of Health While we recognize the fiscal challenges facing our Nation, sustained and en- hanced Federal investments in these initiatives are essential to delivering higher quality, better coordinated and more cost effective care to our Nation's seniors. We request that Congress provide the additional investments necessary to expand and enhance the geriatrics workforce, which is an integral component of the primary care workforce, and to foster groundbreaking medical research so that our Nation is prepared to meet the unique healthcare needs of the rapidly growing population of seniors. PROGRAMS TO TRAIN GERIATRICS HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS Our Nation is facing a critical shortage of geriatrics faculty and healthcare profes- sionals across disciplines. This trend must be reversed if we are to provide our sen-iors with the quality care they need and deserve. Care provided by geriatric healthcare professionals, who are trained to care for individuals who are the most complex and frail and who account for 80 percent of our Medicare expenditures, has been shown to reduce common and costly conditions that are often preventable with appropriate care, such as falls, polypharmacy, and delirium. Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions Programs ($39.7 million) These programs support three initiatives: the Geriatric Academic Career Awards (GACAs), the Geriatric Education Center (GEC) program, and geriatric faculty fel-lowships. These are the only programs specifically designed to address the well-doc-umented shortage of geriatrics healthcare professionals in the U.S. We ask the sub-committee to provide a fiscal year 2015 appropriation of $39.7 million for Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions Programs. Our funding request breaks down as follows: \u2014Geriatric Academic Career Awards (GACAs) ($5.5 million) GACAs support the development of newly trained geriatric clinicians in academic medicine who are committed to teaching geriatrics in medical schools across the country. GACA recipients are required to provide training in clinical geriatrics, in-cluding the training of interdisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals. HRSA, through the Affordable Care Act, expanded the awards to other disciplines\u2014a change long supported by AGS\u2014and requests adequate funding to reflect this. In addition, new awardees are only selected every 5 years and we believe that these awards should be available annually in order to ensure that we have an adequate number of faculty available to provide training in the principles of geriatric medi-cine. Our budget request of $5.5 million would support GACA program awardees in their development as clinician educators. Program Accomplishments .\u2014In Academic Year 2012-2013, the GACA program funded 62 full-time junior faculty. These awardees delivered over 1,100 different courses, workshops and other types of training activities to over 53,000 trainees across the health professions\u2014the most common of which included medical school students, residents in internal medicine and residents in geriatrics. In addition, GACA awardees are highly encouraged to engage in professional development and scholarly activities during each academic year as a way of advancing the field of ger-iatrics. Results showed that the awardees conducted presentations about their own 382 research and other related topics at over 215 conferences at the local, State or na- tional level and published a total of 108 peer-reviewed publications. \u2014Geriatric Education Centers (GECs) ($20.0 million) GECs provide grants to support collaborative arrangements involving several health professions, schools and healthcare facilities to provide multidisciplinary training in geriatrics, including assessment, chronic disease syndromes, care plan-ning, emergency preparedness, and cultural competence unique to older Americans. Our funding request of $20.0 million includes continued support for the core work of 45 GECs ($20.0). Program Accomplishments .\u2014In Academic Year 2012-2013, the GECs supported various types of geriatrics-specific training for health professions students and fac-ulty, as well as for current community-based providers\u2014delivering over 1,650 dif-ferent continuing education courses to over 94,000 trainees. This exceeded the pro-gram's performance target by 58.5 percent. GEC grantees also partnered with over 650 healthcare delivery sites across the country to provide clinical and experiential training, in areas such as nursing homes and chronic and acute disease hospitals, to over 25,000 trainees. It is estimated that 2 out of every 5 sites used by GEC grantees for the purposes of offering these types of training were primary care set-tings and/or were located in a medically underserved community. \u2014Alzheimer 's Disease Prevention, Education, and Outreach Program .\u2014Funding for this program was included in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget re- quest and allows HRSA to expand efforts to provide interprofessional con-tinuing education to healthcare practitioners on Alzheimer's disease and re-lated dementias through the already existing GECs. We are requesting $5.3 million to support this program. \u2014Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, Behavioral/Mental Health Profes- sions ($8.9 million) This program is designed to train physicians, dentists, and behavioral and mental health professionals who choose to teach geriatric medicine, dentistry or psychiatry. The program provides fellows with exposure to older adult patients in various levels of wellness and functioning, and from a range of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Our funding request of $8.9 million will support this important faculty development program. Program Accomplishments .\u2014In Academic Year 2012-2013, a total of 64 physi- cians, psychiatrists, dentists, and psychologists, were supported through this pro-gram. These fellows received clinical training in over 200 different healthcare deliv-ery sites across the country; the most common types of sites where fellows trained included Veteran's Affairs hospitals and clinics, private hospitals, and academic cen-ters. It is estimated that nearly half of the sites (49 percent) where GTPD fellows received clinical training were located in a medically underserved community. Addi-tionally, results showed that GTPD fellows delivered over 275 courses, workshops and other training activities focused on topics including oral health, chronic disease management and geriatric medicine, among others. It is estimated that over 5,600 trainees were trained as a result of these activities\u2014the most common of which in-cluded medical school students, dental school students, residents in geriatrics and residents in geriatric psychiatry. Title VIII Comprehensive Geriatric Education Nursing Program ($5.0 million) The American healthcare delivery system for older adults will be further strength- ened by Federal investments in Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Pro-grams, specifically the comprehensive geriatric education grants, as nurses provide cost-effective, quality care. This program supports additional training for nurses who care for the elderly, development and dissemination of curricula relating to geriatric care, and training of faculty in geriatrics. It also provides continuing edu-cation for nurses practicing in geriatrics. Our funding request of $5.0 million in-cludes funds to continue the training of nurses caring for older Americans. Program Accomplishments .\u2014In Academic Year 2012-2013, the Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP) supported numerous types of geriatric-related training programs and activities for health professions students and their faculty, as well as for community-based healthcare providers across the country. CGEP grantees offered over 150 different continuing education (CE) courses to over 11,600 trainees across the health professions. In addition, 74 students received traineeships\u2014the majority of which (81 percent) are pursuing a Masters Degree in Nursing to become Nurse Practitioners in the fields of Adult Gerontology or Acute Care in Adult Gerontology. Grantees of the CGEP also developed and implemented over 120 different geri- atric-focused training activities to include new continuing education courses for cur-rent providers, as well as new academic courses and clinical rotations for health pro-383 fessions students, residents and fellows across the country focused on these issues. It is estimated that a total of 4,500 trainees were reached as a result of these activi-ties. Lastly, CGEP grantees supported over 40 different faculty development activi-ties and programs. It is estimated that over 300 faculty-level trainees were trained on emerging issues in the field of geriatrics (e.g., pain management among the el-derly, advances in patient engagement, among others) as a result of these activities. RESEARCH FUNDING INITIATIVES \u2014NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH /NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING The institutes that make up the NIH, and in particular the NIA, lead a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. As a member of the Friends of the NIA, a broad-based coalition of aging, disease, research, and patient groups committed to the advancement of med-ical research that affects millions of older Americans, AGS urges an increase in NIH funding of $500 million to support aging research across all institutes. Considering what the Federal Government spends on the healthcare costs associ- ated with age-related diseases, it makes sound economic sense to increase Federal resources for aging research. Chronic diseases associated with aging afflict 80 per-cent of the age 65 population and account for more than 75 percent of Medicare and other Federal health expenditures. Continued Federal investments in scientific research, including comparative effectiveness initiatives, will ensure that the NIH has the resources to succeed in its mission to establish research networks, assess clinical interventions and disseminate credible research findings to patients, pro-viders and payers of healthcare. In closing, geriatrics is at a critical juncture, with our Nation facing an unprece- dented increase in the number of older patients with complex health needs. Strong support such as yours will help ensure that every older American is able to receive high-quality healthcare. Thank you for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION Although great progress has been made in prevention and treatment of cardio- vascular disease, including stroke, there is no cure and CVD remains America's No. 1 killer, costing a projected $315 billion in medical expenses and lost productivity each year. Stroke, alone, is our No. 4 killer, costing an estimated $37 billion a year. Both remain major causes of disability. Nearly 84 million U.S. adults suffer from some form of CVD. It is projected that by the year 2030, more than 44 percent of U.S. adults will live with CVD at a cost exceeding $1 trillion annually. So, it is disturbing that CVD research, prevention and treatment remain disproportionately underfunded with no sustained and stable funding from the National Institutes of Health. NIH is key for the U.S. to mount an ongoing and effective crusade against these devastating diseases. We appreciate Congress' and the Administration's partial stay of sequestration. These cuts jeopardize the health of tens of millions of CVD sufferers and weaken our fragile economy and erode our global leadership in medical research. We chal-lenge Congress to appropriate stable and sustained funding for CVD research, pre-vention and treatment. NIH funding is not only important for the health of our Na-tion, but also supports our economy through research-related employment opportu-nities it provides. FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS : INVESTING IN THE HEALTH OF OUR NATION Research that could move us closer to a cure for heart disease and stroke goes unfunded. Congress must capitalize on 50 years of progress or our Nation will pay more in lives lost and healthcare costs. Our recommendations tackle the topics in a fiscally responsible way. Capitalize on Investment for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AHA is disappointed Congress did not fully restore sequester cuts for NIH in Pub- lic Law 113-76. NIH funded studies help prevent and cure disease, revolutionize pa-tient care, drive economic growth, advance innovation, and sustain U.S. leadership in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. NIH is the world's leader of basic research\u2014 the starting point for all medical progress and an indispensable Federal Govern-ment role that the private sector cannot fill. The U.S. is in jeopardy of losing our competitive edge in scientific research. In addition to improving health, NIH creates a solid return on investment. In fis- cal year 2012, NIH supported 400,000 U.S. jobs and produced nearly $60 billion in 384 new economic activity. Every $1 in NIH funding produced $2 in economic activity in 2007. Yet, for the past decade, the NIH's budget has not kept pace with medical research inflation, resulting in more than a 20 percent loss in purchasing power. Such reductions, along with only a 50 percent restoration of sequester cuts, have occurred during a time of remarkable heightened scientific opportunity and when other countries have been increasing investment in science\u2014some by double digits. These cutbacks have also demoralized early career investigators who, sadly, may leave and never return to research. We cannot afford to lose one of our Nation's most valuable resources\u2014an innovative biomedical research workforce. American Heart Association Advocates: We ask Congress to appropriate $32 bil- lion for NIH to restore sequester cuts, provide for modest growth, and advance CVD research. Enhance Funding for NIH Heart and Stroke Research: A Proven and Wise Invest- ment Declining death rates from CVD is directly related to NIH research, with sci- entists on the verge of discoveries that could lead to groundbreaking treatments and even cures. In addition to saving lives, NIH research is cost-effective. For example, the first NIH tPA drug trial resulted in a 10-year net $6.47 billion drop reduction in stroke healthcare costs. Cardiovascular Disease Research: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) CVD death rates have greatly declined, with much of the reduction traced to re- search emanating from the NHLBI. Stable and sustained NHLBI funding is key to capitalize on investments that have led to major discoveries. For example, 10 per-cent of genetic changes leading to severe congenital heart disease are new and not passed down by a parent; people who maintained ideal health had better brain func-tion in mid-life; digestive system bacteria may cause red meat to raise two chemi-cals linked to CVD; and post-traumatic stress disorder may be a heart disease risk factor. Sustained funding will allow robust implementation of priority CVD strategic plan initiatives. Stroke Research: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) An estimated 795,000 Americans will suffer a stroke this year and more than 129,000 will die. Many of the 7 million survivors face grave physical and mental disabilities and emotional trauma. In addition to the physical and emotional toll, stroke costs an estimated $37 billion in medical expenses and lost productivity each year. Moreover, the future looks grim. A study projects that direct costs of stroke will triple between 2010 and 2030. Stable and sustained NINDS funding is needed to capitalize on investments, in- cluding one showing aggressive medical treatment is better than stents in pre-venting a second stroke, and to advance the BRAIN Initiative. More resources are required to facilitate the NIH Stroke Trials Network and other priorities in stroke prevention, treatment and recovery research. They include: hastening translation of preclinical animal models into clinical studies; preventing vascular cognitive dam-age; expediting comparative effectiveness research trials; developing imaging bio-markers; refining clot-busting treatments; achieving robust brain protection; tar-geting early stroke recovery; and using neural interface devices. American Heart Association Advocates: We recommend that NHLBI be funded at $3.2 billion and NINDS at $1.7 billion for fiscal year 2015. Increase Funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Prevention is the best way to promote good health and reduce the costs of heart disease and stroke. Yet, proven prevention approaches are not implemented due to limited funds. We applaud Congress for providing in Public Law 113-76 the Divi-sion for Heart Disease and Stroke Research with a much needed boost. In addition to supporting research and evaluation and developing a surveillance system, the DHDSP administers Sodium Reduction Communities and the Paul Coverdell Na-tional Acute Stroke Registry. DHDSP, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, implements Million Hearts TMto prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. DHDSP runs WISEWOMAN, serving uninsured and under-insured, low-income women ages 40 to 64. It helps them from becoming heart disease and stroke statis-tics by offering preventive health services, referrals to local healthcare, and tailored lifestyle programs to promote lasting behavioral change. American Heart Association Advocates: We join with the CDC Coalition in asking for $7.8 billion for CDC's program level. AHA requests $130.188 million for the DHDSP to sustain its participation in the State Public Health Actions to Prevent 385 and Control Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity and Associated Risk Factors and Pro- mote School Health and $37 million for WISEWOMAN. We ask for $3 million for Million Hearts TMto better control blood pressure. Restore Funding for Rural and Community Access to Emergency Devices (AED) Pro- gram About 90 percent of cardiac arrest victims die outside of a hospital. Yet, early CPR and use of an automated external defibrillator can more than double survival. Com- munities with full AED programs have survival rates near 40 percent. HRSA's Rural and Community AED Program awards competitive grants to States to buy AEDs, tactically place them, and train lay rescuers and first responders in their use. Nearly 800 patients were saved from August 1, 2009 to July 31, 2010. But scarce resources let only 22 percent of approved applicants in 6 States receive funds in fis-cal year 2013. American Heart Association Advocates: We ask for a fiscal year 2015 appropria- tion of $8.927 million to return this life-saving AED program to fiscal year 2005 lev-els when 47 States were funded. CONCLUSION Cardiovascular disease, including stroke, still wreak a deadly, disabling and costly toll on Americans. Our recommendations for NIH, CDC and HRSA will save lives and slash escalating healthcare costs. We challenge Congress to carefully study our requests that signify a wise investment for our country and for the health and well- being of this and future generations. [This statement was submitted by Mariell Jessup, M.D., President, American Heart Association.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN HIGHER EDUCATION CONSORTIUM This statement includes the fiscal year 2015 recommendations of the Nation's Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), in two areas of the Department of Edu-cation: Office of Postsecondary Education and Office of Vocational Education. HIGHER EDUCATION ACT PROGRAMS Strengthening Developing Institutions .\u2014Titles III and V of the Higher Education Act support institutions that enroll large proportions of financially disadvantaged students and have low per-student expenditures. The TCUs, which by any definition are truly developing institutions, funded under Title III-A Sec. 316 are providing quality higher education opportunities to some of the most rural/isolated, impover-ished, and historically underserved areas of the country. The goal of HEA-Titles III/ V programs is ''to improve the academic quality, institutional management and fis-cal stability of eligible institutions, in order to increase their self-sufficiency and strengthen their capacity to make a substantial contribution to the higher education resources of the Nation.'' The TCU Title III-A program is specifically designed to address the critical, unmet needs of their American Indian students and commu-nities, in order to effectively prepare them to succeed in a globally competitive work-force. Yet, in fiscal year 2011 this critical program was cut by over 11 percent, by another 4 percent in fiscal year 2012, and hit by sequestration\u2014on the lowered baseline\u2014in fiscal year 2013. Although sequestration was not imposed in fiscal year 2014, the TCUs have not recovered from the earlier cuts to this vitally important program. The TCUs urge the Subcommittee to restore the discretionary funding for HEA Title III-A, Sec. 316 to $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2015. TRIO .\u2014Retention and support services are vital to achieving the national goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. TRIO pro-grams, such as Student Support Services and Upward Bound, were created out of recognition that college access is not enough to ensure advancement and that mul-tiple factors work to prevent the successful completion of postsecondary programs for many low-income and first-generation students and students with disabilities. Therefore, in addition to providing the maximum Pell Grant award level, it is crit-ical that Congress also sustain student assistance programs, such as Student Sup-port Services and Upward Bound so that low-income and minority students have the Federal support necessary to allow them to remain enrolled in and ultimately com-plete their higher education degrees. Pell Grants .\u2014The importance of Pell Grants to TCU students cannot be over- stated. Approximately, 80 percent of TCU students receive Pell Grants, primarily because student income levels are so low and they have far less access to other 386 sources of financial aid than students at State-funded and other mainstream institu- tions. Within the TCU system, Pell Grants are doing exactly what they were in-tended to do\u2014they are serving the needs of the lowest income students by helping them gain access to quality higher education, an essential step toward becoming ac-tive, productive members of the workforce. However, the U.S. Department of Edu-cation has changed its regulations to limit Pell eligibility from 18 to 12 full-time se-mesters, without any consideration of those already in the process of earning a post-secondary degree. This change in policy has impeded some TCU students from com-pleting a postsecondary degree, which is widely recognized as being critical for ac-cess to, and advancement in, today's highly technical workforce. TCUs are open enrollment institutions. Recent placement tests administered at TCUs to first-time entering students indicated that 74 percent required remedial math, 54 percent required remedial reading, and 57 percent needed remedial writ-ing. These results clearly illustrate just how serious this new Pell Grant eligibility limit is to the success of TCU students in completing a postsecondary degree. Stu-dents requiring remediation can use as much as a full year of eligibility enhancing their math, and or reading/writing skills, thereby hampering their future postsec-ondary degree plans. A prior national goal was to provide access to quality higher education opportunities for all students regardless of economic means, at which TCUs have been extremely successful. While the new national goal intends to produce graduates with postsecondary degrees by 2020, this change in policy does not advance that objective. On the contrary, the new regulations will cause many low-income students to once again abandon their dream of a postsecondary degree, as they will simply not have the means to continue to pursue it. The goal of a well- trained technically savvy workforce will be greatly compromised. This new policy evokes the adage ''penny wise\u2014pound foolish.'' The TCUs urge the Subcommittee to continue to fund this essential program at the highest possible level, and to direct the Secretary of Education to implement a process to waive the very restrictive 12 semester Pell Grant eligibility for TCU students. PERKINS CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS Tribally-Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions .\u2014Section 117 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act provides a competitively awarded grant opportunity for tribally chartered and controlled career and technical institutions. AIHEC requests $8,200,000 to fund grants under Sec. 117 of the Per-kins Act. Native American Career and Technical Education Program (NACTEP) .\u2014NACTEP (Sec. 116) reserves 1.25 percent of appropriated funding to support American Indian career and technical programs. The TCUs strongly urge the Subcommittee to con-tinue to support NACTEP, which is vital to the continuation of career and technical education programs offered at TCUs that provide job training and certifications to remote reservation communities. AMERICAN INDIAN ADULT AND BASIC EDUCATION (OFFICE OF VOCATIONAL AND ADULT EDUCATION) This program supports adult basic education programs for American Indians of- fered by State and local education agencies, Indian tribes, agencies, and TCUs. De-spite the absence of dedicated funding, TCUs must find a way, often using already insufficient institutional operating funds, to continue to provide adult basic edu-cation classes for those American Indians that the present K-12 Indian education system has failed. Before many individuals can even begin the course work needed to learn a productive skill, they first must earn a GED or, in some cases, even learn to read. The new GED exam, which was instituted in January 2014, has a much stronger focus on mathematics. As noted earlier, placement tests for TCU entering students reveal a tremendous need for math remediation. Additionally, the new GED test is fully computerized. While younger GED seekers may be well versed and comfortable with computer-based testing, older and poorer citizens may not be. These factors indicate a further and growing need for adult basic educational pro-grams and GED preparation on Indian reservations. TCUs must have sufficient and stable funding to continue to provide these essential activities and to ensure their communities residents have the same chances to succeed as others throughout the country have. TCUs request that the Subcommittee direct that $8,000,000 of the funds appropriated annually for the Adult Education State Grants be made avail- able to make competitive awards to TCUs to help meet the growing demand for adult basic education and remediation program services on their respective Reserva-tions. 387 FURTHER JUSTIFICATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 APPROPRIATIONS REQUESTS FOR TCUS Tribal colleges and our students are already being disproportionately impacted by ongoing efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit and control Federal spending. The fiscal year 2011 Continuing Resolution eliminated all of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) community- based programs, including a critically needed TCU-HUD facilities program. TCUs were able to maximize leveraging potential, often securing even greater non-Federal funding to construct and equip Head Start and early childhood centers; student and community computer laboratories and public libraries; and student and faculty housing in rural and remote communities where few and sometimes none of these facilities existed. Important STEM programs, administered by the National Science Foundation and NASA were cut, and for the first time since the NSF program was established in fiscal year 2001, no new TCU-STEM awards were made in fiscal year 2011. While NSF-TCUP grants resumed in fiscal year 2012, a year of grant oppor-tunity was lost. TCUs Additionally, TCUs and their students suffer the realities of cuts to programs such as GEAR-UP, TRIO, SEOG, and as noted earlier, are seri-ously impacted by the new highly restrictive Pell Grant eligibility criteria more pro-foundly than mainstream institutions of higher education, which can realize econo-mies of scale due to large endowments, alternative funding sources, including the ability to charge higher tuition rates and enroll more financially stable students, and access to affluent alumni. The loss of opportunities that cuts to DoEd, HUD, NSF, and NASA programs represent to TCUs, and to other MSIs, is magnified by cuts to workforce development programs within the Department of Labor, nursing and allied health professions tuition forgiveness and scholarship programs operated by the Department of Health and Human Services, and an important TCU-based nutrition education program planned by USDA. Combined, these cuts strike at the most economically disadvantaged and health-challenged Americans. We respectfully request that the Members of the Subcommittee continue the Fed- eral investment in the Nation's Tribal Colleges and Universities and full consider-ation of our fiscal year 2015 appropriations needs and recommendations. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY The American Physiological Society (APS) thanks the subcommittee for its ongo- ing support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Research carried out by the NIH contributes to our understanding of health and disease, which allows all Ameri-cans to look forward to a healthier future. The APS urges you to make every effort to provide the NIH with a net funding level of $32 billion in fiscal year 2015. This is necessary to prevent further erosion of research capacity. Federal investment in research is critically important because breakthroughs in basic and translational research are the foundation for new drugs and therapies that help patients, fuel our economy, and provide jobs. The Federal Government is the primary funding source for discovery research through competitive grants awarded by the NIH. Although the private sector partners with academic research-ers to develop research findings into new treatments, industry relies upon federally funded research to identify where innovation opportunities can be found. This sys-tem of public-private partnership has been critical to U.S. leadership in the bio-medical sciences. However, this position of leadership is at risk as other nations, including China, increase their investments in research and development while the United States investment has lagged in recent years. Federal research dollars also have a significant impact at the local level: Approxi- mately 85 percent of the NIH budget is awarded throughout the country to re-searchers who use grant funds to pay research and administrative staff, purchase supplies and equipment, and cover other costs associated with their research. NIH funds outstanding science As a result of improved healthcare, Americans in the 21st century are living longer and healthier lives than ever before. However, chronic conditions such as car-diovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory illnesses, Alzheimer's and cancer continue to inflict a heavy burden in the United States and around the world. As the U.S. population ages, the prevalence and cost of these diseases will increase exponen-tially. The NIH invests heavily in basic research to understand the physiological mechanisms at work in health and disease. This knowledge is crucial to the develop-ment of safe and effective interventions and prevention strategies. Exciting new initiatives are underway at the NIH to advance science, including the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (''BRAIN'') ini-tiative and the Big Data 2 Knowledge project (BD2K). The BRAIN initiative will 388 1http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/201403/PresidentsMessage/ bring together researchers from diverse disciplines to tackle major gaps in current knowledge about the brain and brain diseases. BD2K will explore ways to capitalize on the immense volume of data being created by biomedical scientists, ultimately enhancing the work of the entire community by providing new tools and resources to make better use of that data. These important projects require significant re-sources, and at a time of constrained budgets, that will further diminish funding for investigator-initiated grants. The NIH system of allowing investigators to de-velop and propose ideas which are then evaluated by their peers and selected for funding based on their merit has fostered a research enterprise that is second to none. Increasing the NIH budget to $32 billion would provide funding for large projects as described above, while also providing resources for individual scientists to pursue creative new avenues of research. NIH nurtures the biomedical research enterprise In addition to supporting research, the NIH must also address workforce issues to ensure that our Nation's researchers are ready to meet the challenges they will face in the future. The pressures placed on the biomedical research enterprise after years of sub-inflationary budget increases were severely compounded by sequestra-tion cuts in fiscal year 2013. One analysis showed that NIH supported approxi-mately 1000 fewer investigators in fiscal year 2013 as a result of its declining budg-et. 1Researchers who lose their funding face an uncertain future as there are few options to sustain their research without Federal grants. Losing Federal support puts at risk the investment that it took to build those programs over many years. It also means that talented individuals working in those labs will have to look else-where for increasingly scarce jobs. As a result of stagnant funding for NIH, sci-entists at all stages of their careers struggle to maintain their research programs. Scientists in the early stages of their careers face a particular set of challenges as they work to establish themselves during a time of dwindling resources. To ad-dress some of these problems, the NIH is continuing its commitment to fund new investigators at approximately the same rate as established investigators. The NIH is also developing three new efforts to ensure a diverse and sustainable future bio-medical workforce. The National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) and the Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (BUILD) initiative are complementary programs that will develop innovative new mentorship programs to engage individ-uals from diverse backgrounds and help them prepare to succeed in biomedical re-search careers. The Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC) will play a role in coordinating and assessing NRMN and BUILD, providing program-wide goals and tools to assess progress. These efforts are critical to helping young scientists launch their careers. However, to sustain a talented workforce the NIH needs predictable and sustainable budget growth. If the current funding crisis is not resolved, the con-tinued loss of senior researchers will begin to erode the pool of experienced mentors for early career scientists on which the BUILD and NRMN programs rely. The NIH also uses the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Program to broaden the geographic distribution of NIH funds by providing support to research-ers and institutions in areas that have not previously received significant NIH fund-ing. IDeA builds research capacity and improves competitiveness in those States by developing shared resources, infrastructure and expertise. Networks established through this program expand research opportunities for students and faculty at pre-dominantly undergraduate institutions and enhance the level of science and tech-nology knowledge of the workforce in IDeA States. The program currently serves in-stitutions and researchers in 23 States and Puerto Rico. The APS believes this pro-gram is an important way to broaden participation in the scientific workforce. The APS appreciates the support of the committee in continuing the Science Edu- cation Partnership Awards (SEPA) program at the NIH. This program was slated for elimination last year under the proposed consolidation of science education pro-grams across Federal agencies. The SEPA program fosters important connections between biomedical researchers and K-12 students and teachers, providing an op-portunity for students at the earliest levels to learn about STEM careers. No other Federal STEM program addresses biomedicine or provides this kind of outreach con-cerning what NIH does to promote the health of our citizens. Thus, SEPA programs promote health literacy among young individuals, who will increasingly be expected to manage their own healthcare. Many of the programs sponsored by SEPA, includ-ing those at the APS, disproportionately reach underrepresented and disadvantaged students. The APS believes that the SEPA program helps establish the groundwork to address issues of workforce diversity and health literacy. 389 2www.faseb.org/fundingreport The APS is a professional society dedicated to fostering research and education as well as the dissemination of scientific knowledge concerning how the organs and systems of the body work. The Society was founded in 1887 and now has more than 10,000 member physiologists. APS members conduct NIH-supported research at col-leges, universities, medical schools, and other public and private research institu-tions across the U.S. The APS joins the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) in urging that NIH be provided with no less than $32 billion in fiscal year 2014. 2 [This statement was submitted by Kim E. Barrett, Ph.D., President, American Physiological Society.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION The American Psychological Association (APA) is the largest scientific and profes- sional organization representing psychology in the U.S.: its membership includes nearly 130,000 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students. APA works to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives. Many programs in the Labor-HHS-Education bill impact science, education, and the populations served by clinical psychologists. National Institutes of Health .\u2014The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 in- crease for NIH did not give back all of the funds cut by sequestration in fiscal year 2013 nor did it restore the purchasing power lost over the past decade. As a member of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research, APA recommends that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Nation's investment in health research. APA also urges Congress and the Ad-ministration to work in a bipartisan manner to end sequestration and the continued cuts to health research that squander invaluable scientific opportunities, discourage young scientists, threaten or slow improvements in our Nation's health, and jeop-ardize our economic future. Psychological scientists are supported by research grants or training programs in almost all of NIH's 27 institutes and centers. They are working with animal models or human participants to improve diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and autism, to understand the mechanisms underlying adoption of healthy behav-iors, and to help prevent transmission of HIV and unhealthy behaviors such as sub-stance abuse. Behavioral research is critical to NIH's mission: approximately 40 per-cent of premature mortality in the U.S. is due to behaviors such as smoking, sed-entary lifestyle, and alcohol and other drug consumption. APA encourages continued support for OppNet, the trans-institute initiative funded through the Office of Be-havioral and Social Sciences Research that has led to some $90 million in funding of basic research through fiscal year 2013 on critical issues such as sleep, stress, and multisensory perception. As NICHD develops initiatives to understand and pre-vent harmful and costly preterm births, APA encourages that institute to enhance research on psychological factors that may contribute. There remains a disturbing paucity of scientific evidence about the effects of spo- radic vs. regular use of marijuana, alcohol, nicotine and other substances on the de-veloping brain. A large-scale, prospective study that (a) includes brain imaging and (b) begins in late childhood (prior to substance exposure) and continues into early adulthood is urgently needed. Now is the time to begin an in-depth and definitive longitudinal study to document the short- and long-term effects of substance use and, in particular, the impact on young brains to inform future drug policy deci-sions. By tracking brain development and various life outcomes alongside behavioral data on substance use, the study would also illuminate the developmental effects of individual substances as well as substance interactions, as well as better estab-lish the relationship between substance use and other mental disorders (e.g., does substance use predispose adolescent users to mental illness; do subclinical or premorbid symptoms of mental illness lead to substance use; or are associations due to a shared vulnerability?). APA urges the NIH to conduct such a study as part of the Collaborative Research on Addictions at NIH (CRAN initiative) to comprehen-sively document the biological and behavioral effects of substance use on the devel-oping brain by conducting a longitudinal naturalistic study monitoring a nationally representative sample of 10,000 healthy 10-year-old children over the course of 10 years. 390 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\u2014As a member of the CDC Coalition, APA supports at least $7.8 billion for core programs in fiscal year 2015. Rather than relying on the Prevention Fund and other transfers, APA urges the committee to restore CDC's budget authority. As a member of the Friends of NCHS, APA rec-ommends a program level of $182 million for the National Center on Health Statis-tics. APA strongly supports the President's request for increased funding for the Na-tional Injury Prevention and Control Center, including $10 million research into the causes and prevention of gun violence, to allow the CDC to carry out the critical research agenda developed last year by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council, and for $23.57 million for the National Violent Death Reporting System, to allow for its expansion to all 50 States and DC. APA is pleased that the Committee provided an increase in funding for the Prevention Research Centers program in fiscal year 2014, and urges that funding be restored for the program to at least $28 million in fiscal year 2015, consistent with the fiscal year 2011 funding level, to support research essential to the focus on prevention. APA supports the President's request of $360.7 million for surveillance, research and programs to sup-port HIV prevention in the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, an increase of $4.3 million above fiscal year 2014. Additional resources should be directed toward be-havioral and social science research that optimizes outcomes along the HIV care continuum; implementation science to enhance linkage and retention in care; re-search on adherence to treatment; developing and scaling up interventions for most the impacted persons living with HIV/AIDS; development, adaptation and imple-mentation of innovative strategies to address stigma and discrimination; and re-search into structural and environmental factors that drive the HIV epidemic. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .\u2014APA strongly sup- ports: \u2014The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) program. APA rec- ommends increased support for the Network's efforts on behalf of the recovery of children, families, and communities affected by physical and sexual abuse, school and community violence, natural disasters, sudden death of a loved one, war's impact on military families, and other trauma. \u2014Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act programs\u2014Campus Suicide Prevention, State and Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention and the Suicide Prevention Resource Cen-ter. These effective national programs help meet the mental and behavioral health needs of youth and young adults through access to prevention, education, and outreach services to reduce suicide risk in these populations. First author-ized in 2004, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act has supported youth suicide prevention grants in 49 States, 48 Tribes or Tribal organizations, and 138 insti-tutions of higher education. \u2014Minority Fellowship Program. APA remains concerned that while minorities represent 30 percent of the population and are projected to increase to 40 per- cent by 2025, only 23 percent of recent doctorates in psychology, social work and nursing were awarded to minorities. We encourage the Committee to support the Administration's $5 million increase for the MFP as requested in the fiscal year 2015 budget proposal. The increase reflects the need to continually grow the pool of culturally competent mental health professionals. \u2014Mental Health Care Provider Education in HIV/AIDS Program, in CMHS. Con- tinuing education for mental health providers in these crucial clinical issues re-mains a high priority. APA urges Congress to maintain level funding in CMHS for the training of psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists in mental health and psychosocial issues related to HIV/AIDS. \u2014SAMHSA-funded programs providing vital substance abuse and mental health services to people with HIV/AIDS. \u2014SAMHSA's Safe Schools/Healthy Students program that expands access to men- tal and behavioral health services in schools and reduces violence through pre-vention and early intervention supports. Health Resources and Services Administration .\u2014APA recommends funding SSA Section 512 regarding services to individuals with a postpartum condition. Postpartum Depression (PPD) is one of the most common and frequently undiagnosed conditions associated with childbirth. In the U.S. approximately one in five women suffers from PPD each year. While PPD is a widespread problem, under the current USPSTF guidelines, depression screening is available as an Essential Health Benefit to all non-pregnant adults, yet excludes the vulnerable population of pregnant women. APA supports funding for this as-yet unfunded provision that supports PPD research and treatment and the incorporation of screening and link-ages to behavioral health treatment for families affected by this condition. APA en-courages the Committee to support incorporation of PPD screening into the Title V programs administered by HRSA as well as Healthy Start. APA also encourages the 391 Committee to urge the Secretary to prioritize the issue of PPD by raising awareness, expanding research, and establishing grants for the operation and coordination of cost-effective services to afflicted women and their families. APA recommends continued investments in the mental and behavioral health workforce, including $6.9 million for the Graduate Psychology Education program to increase the number of health service psychologists trained to provide services to high-need and high-demand underserved populations in both urban and rural communities. This program supports the training of doctoral psychology students, interns and postdoctoral residents with other health professionals while they pro-vide supervised mental and behavioral health services to underserved and vulner-able populations, including: children, older adults, veterans and their families, indi-viduals with chronic illnesses, and victims of abuse and trauma. In 2010-2011 alone, the GPE program supported the training of 620 graduate psychology students and provided mental and behavioral health services to over 46,000 underserved per-sons. APA encourages HRSA to maintain a strong emphasis on serving rural vet-eran populations and their families. There is a growing need for highly trained men-tal and behavioral health professionals to deliver evidence-based services to the rap-idly aging population. APA encourages HRSA to reinstate the geropsychology com-ponent, and help integrate health service psychology trainees at federally Qualified Health Centers. HHS programs on aging .\u2014Given that approximately 20-25 percent of older adults have a mental or behavioral health problem, and older white males (age 85 and over) currently have the highest rates of suicide of any group in the U.S. APA sup-ports an expanded effort to address the mental and behavioral health needs of older adults including implementation of the mental and behavioral health provisions in the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, grants to States for the delivery of mental health screening, and treatment services for older individuals and programs to increase public awareness and reduce the stigma associated with mental dis-orders in older individuals. APA also recommends continued support of the HHS's Lifespan Respite Program. Respite care can provide family caregivers with relief necessary to maintain their own health, bolster family stability and well-being, and avoid or delay more costly nursing home or foster care placements. Department of Education .\u2014APA supports strengthening our Federal investment in gifted and talented education and encourages Congress to fund the Javits Gifted and Talented Education Program in fiscal year 2015, funded last year at $5 million. And, as a member of the Friends of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), APA supports $202.3 million for IES's research, development and dissemination portfolio, consistent with the Administration's 2013 and 2014 requests. This would support critical investments to provide evidence-based information on effective educational practices to parents, teachers and schools, and new research to fill gaps in knowl-edge. Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony for the record in support of critical program areas funded by the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION The American Public Health Association is a diverse community of public health professionals who champion the health of all people and communities. We are pleased to submit our request to fund the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion at $7.8 billion and the Health Resources and Services Administration at $7.48 billion in fiscal year 2015. We urge you to take our recommendations to restore funding to at least fiscal year 2010 levels into consideration as you move forward with writing the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention APHA believes Congress should support CDC as an agency, not just the indi- vidual programs that it funds. Given the challenges and burdens of chronic disease and disability, public health emergencies, new and reemerging infectious diseases and other unmet public health needs, we urge a funding level of $7.8 billion for CDC's programs in fiscal year 2015. We appreciate some of the important new in-vestments in President Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal; however, under the president's proposal, CDC's total budget would be cut by nearly $243 million compared to fiscal year 2014. CDC's budget authority under the president's budget is lower than fiscal year 2003 levels. State and local health departments continue to operate on tight budgets and with a smaller workforce, losing more than 50,000 392 public health jobs since 2008. These cuts will reduce the ability of CDC and its State and local grantees to investigate and respond to public health emergencies, ensure adequate immunization rates and track environmental hazards. By translating research findings into effective intervention efforts, CDC is a crit- ical source of funding for many of our State and local programs that aim to improve the health of communities. Perhaps more importantly, Federal funding through CDC provides the foundation for our State and local public health departments, sup-porting a trained workforce, laboratory capacity and public health education commu-nications systems. It is notable that more than 70 percent of CDC's budget supports public health and prevention activities by State and local health organizations and agencies, national public health partners and academic institutions. CDC also serves as the command center for our Nation's public health defense system against emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. With the potential onset of a worldwide influenza pandemic and the many other natural and man- made threats that exist in the modern world, CDC has become the Nation's\u2014and the world's\u2014expert resource and response center, coordinating communications and action and serving as the laboratory reference center. States and communities rely on CDC for accurate information and direction in a crisis or outbreak. CDC serves as the lead agency for bioterrorism and other public health emergency preparedness and response programs and must receive sustained support for its pre-paredness programs in order for our Nation to meet future challenges. Given the challenges of terrorism and disaster preparedness, and our many unmet public health needs and missed prevention opportunities we urge you to provide adequate funding for State and local capacity grants. Unfortunately, this is not a threat that is going away. CDC plays a significant role in addressing chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and arthritis that continue to be the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. These diseases, many of which are preventable, are also among the most costly to our health system. CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion provides critical funding for State programs to prevent chronic disease, conducts surveillance to collect data on disease prevalence and monitor intervention efforts and translates scientific findings into public health practice in our communities. CDC's National Center for Environmental Health is essential to protecting the health and well being of the public by helping to control asthma, protect from threats associated with climate change and reduce exposure to lead and other haz-ards. We urge the subcommittee to provide adequate funding for NCEH which has been significantly cut in recent years. Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA operates programs in every State and U.S. territory and is a national lead- er in improving the health of Americans through the delivery of quality health serv-ices and supporting a well prepared workforce. The agency serves the health needs of people who are medically vulnerable, low-income and geographically isolated. The Nation faces a shortage of health professionals and continues to experience an ever growing, aging and increasingly diverse population, alongside health professionals that are nearing retirement age. We are deeply concerned that since fiscal year 2010, HRSA's discretionary budget authority has been cut by 19 percent in nominal dollars and 25 percent when adjusted for inflation. Funding for HRSA is far too low and keeping austerity measures in place will threaten the agency's ability to ad-dress the present and growing health needs of the U.S. To respond to the needs of our Nation, APHA recommends restoring funding to the fiscal year 2010 level of $7.48 billion for discretionary HRSA programs in fiscal year 2015. HRSA programs have a strong history of providing quality care to keep people healthy and improve health equity for those living outside of the economic and med-ical mainstream. HRSA has contributed to the decrease in infant mortality rate, a widely used indicator of the Nation's health, which is now at an all-time low. Most recently, preliminary data indicates that the infant mortality rate for black infants has decreased, resulting in a narrowing of the gap that exists between racial groups. HIV/AIDS programs administered by HRSA provide access to regular care and en-sure adherence to antiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV, which reduces HIV transmission by 96 percent and greatly contributes to the prevention of new HIV infections. A committed investment from Congress is required to continue achieving the health improvements HRSA has made and to pave the way for new achievements. Our recommendation is based on the need to continue improving the health of Americans by supporting critical HRSA programs, including: 393 \u2014Health Professions supports the education and training of a broad range of health professionals. With a focus on primary care and training in interdiscipli-nary, community-based settings, these are the only Federal programs focused on filling the gaps in the supply of health professionals, as well as improving the distribution and diversity of the workforce so health professionals are well- equipped to care for the growing and changing population. \u2014Primary Care supports 9,200 health sites in every State and U.S. territory, im- proving access to care for more than 21 million patients in geographically iso-lated and economically distressed communities. Close to half of these health centers serve rural populations. In addition, health centers target populations with special needs, including migrant and seasonal farm workers, homeless in-dividuals and families and those living in public housing. \u2014Maternal and Child Health including the Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, Healthy Start and others support initiatives designed to promote optimal health, reduce disparities, combat infant mortality, prevent chronic con-ditions and improve access to quality healthcare for more than 43 million women and children, including children with special healthcare needs. \u2014HIV/AIDS provides assistance to States and communities most severely affected by HIV/AIDS. The programs deliver comprehensive care, prescription drug as-sistance and support services for about half of the total population\u20141.1 million people\u2014living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. Additionally, the programs provide education and training for health professionals treating people with HIV/AIDS and work toward addressing the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on racial and ethnic minorities. \u2014Family Planning Title X services ensure access to a broad range of reproductive, sexual and related preventive healthcare for over 5 million poor and low-income women, men and adolescents at nearly 4,400 health centers nationwide. This program helps improve maternal and child health outcomes and promotes healthy families. \u2014Rural Health improves access to care for the nearly 50 million people living in rural areas that experience a persistent shortage of healthcare services. These programs are designed to support community-based disease prevention and health promotion projects, help rural hospitals and clinics implement new tech-nologies and strategies and build health system capacity in rural and frontier areas. Conclusion In closing, we emphasize that the public health system requires stronger financial investments at every stage. This funding makes up less than 1 percent of Federal spending and continued austerity measures that cut funding for public health and prevention programs will not balance our budget and will only lead to increased costs to our healthcare system. Successes in biomedical research must be translated into tangible prevention opportunities, screening programs, lifestyle and behavior changes and other population-based interventions that are effective and available for everyone. Without a robust and sustained investment in our public health agen-cies, we will fail to meet the mounting health challenges facing our Nation. [This statement was submitted by Georges Benjamin, MD, Executive Director American Public Health Association.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), the largest single life science Soci- ety with over 39,000 members, wishes to submit a statement in support of increased funding in the fiscal year 2015 budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention (CDC). As the Nation's health protection Agency, the CDC's programs are critical to preventing disease and injury. The CDC conducts scientific investigations, develops public health guidelines and provides information and expertise in re-sponse to threats against public health in the United States and worldwide. The ASM urges Congress to approve the requested budget of $445.3 million for the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (EZID), an over-all increase of $54.9 million over fiscal year 2104. The EZID budget includes an in-crease of $31 million for Core Infectious Diseases. A funding level of $30 million is included for Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD), year 2 of the 5 year initiative to enhance CDC's microbiology and bioinformatics capabilities to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. The AMD initiative will improve pathogen identi-fication and detection; adapt new diagnostics to meet evolving public health needs; help States meet future reference testing needs in a coordinated manner; implement 394 enhanced, sustainable and integrated laboratory information systems; and develop prediction modeling and early recognition tools. Advances in biotechnology and com-puting must be part of CDC efforts against the threat of infectious diseases. Because of the need for better molecular sequencing tools and bioinformatics, last year CDC proposed the AMD initiative, integrating cutting edge laboratory and computer tools to enhance infectious disease prevention and control. A 2013 pilot study tracking a Listeria outbreak demonstrated that AMD technologies and methods could detect outbreaks sooner, halting disease faster. The study used whole genome sequencing with diagnostic testing for the first time to help clarify which patients' illnesses were related to a listeriosis outbreak linked to contaminated cheese. Listeria ranks third as a cause of death from foodborne pathogens in the United States and sickens about 1,600 people each year. The EZID budget includes a $10 million increase for CDC's Food Safety program. This increase is essential to enhance national surveillance outbreak detection and response and food safety prevention efforts. It will help modernize PulseNet and apply advanced DNA technology and expand sites for FoodCORE to improve out-break detection and response. It will improve foodborne disease tracking, detection and response through the Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence. Food safety is one of CDC's foremost strategic goals and heavily reliant upon state of the art surveillance. Last year, the CDC published first ever estimates of which food types were causing foodborne illnesses in the United States. These attribution estimates guide regulators, industry and consumers toward more precise and effective meas-ures to prevent food contamination. In June, a new CDC report identified the key demographic groups most affected by Listeria bacteria infections. During 2009\u2014 2011, twelve Listeria outbreaks sickened people in 38 States. CDC partnerships with other public health agencies clearly extend the CDC's ability to prevent dis-ease. For example, data from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) are the source for CDC's most recent annual food safety report, which showed that 2012 rates of infection for two foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter and Vibrio) had increased significantly when compared to 2006\u20142008, while rates of most others have not changed during the same period. FoodNet involves CDC, ten State health departments, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. The ASM strongly supports the fiscal year 2015 EZID budget request of $30 mil- lion for the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Strategy, which will speed up outbreak detec-tion through regional labs, support development of new antibiotics and diagnostics and improve infection prevention and antibiotic prescribing. With a $30 million an-nual funding for 5 years, the AR initiative could achieve reductions in many infec-tions, including C. difficile, carbapenem aureus Salmonella. CDC efforts have intensified against microbial pathogens that have evolved resist- ance against known drug therapies. In September, a landmark CDC report warned that antimicrobial resistant infections infect more than two million people in the United States every year, causing at least 23,000 deaths. CDC ranked AR threats into three categories: urgent, serious and concerning. Infections classified as urgent include CRE, drug resistant gonorrhea and Clostridium difficile, a diarrheal infec-tion that causes about 250,000 U.S. hospitalizations and at least 14,000 deaths an-nually. Last year, CDC data showed more patients at hospitals and long term care facilities are being diagnosed with CRE infections; other AR reports are equally alarming. In November, CDC joined with the American Academy of Pediatrics to slow AR expansion with new guidelines, ''Principles of Judicious Antibiotic Prescribing for Bacterial Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Pediatrics.'' Every year, up to 10 million children in the United States risk side effects from antibiotic prescriptions unlikely to help their respiratory symptoms. Many of these infections are caused by viruses not treatable by antibiotics. Antibiotic use is the single most important fac-tor in antibiotic resistance, with up to 50 percent of prescriptions unnecessary or prescribed inappropriately. Studies estimate that AR adds $20 billion in excess di-rect health costs, with additional costs to Society for lost productivity as high as $35 billion a year. CDC guidelines that include science based prevention protocols can be very effec- tive, for example, the ongoing battle against healthcare acquired infections (HAIs). About 1 in every 20 hospitalized patients develops an infection caused by receiving medical care. Many of these are drug resistant (e.g., three quarters of Staphy-lococcus aureus infections in hospital ICUs are methicillin resistant MRSA). CDC aggressively promotes use of prevention protocols in all facilities in the United States. In 2013, CDC found that bloodstream infections in patients with central IV 395 lines had decreased by over 40 percent and surgical site infections by 20 percent since 2008 and that following CDC protocols could cut dialysis related bloodstream infections in half. Another CDC coauthored report last fall concluded that there were an estimated 30,800 fewer invasive MRSA infections in 2011 compared with 2005. More than 12,000 healthcare facilities now track HAI infections using CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Surveillance and Response CDC depends upon extensive surveillance networks and unique rapid response mobilization. Sustaining these CDC capabilities is critical to detect health threats, halt outbreaks and prevent illness and injury. Familiar threats like hepatitis and HIV/AIDS continue to affect lives. Public health institutions also are repeatedly challenged by emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), unexpected and often dangerous. CDC regularly confronts new threats, including the following EIDs in the past year: \u2014CDC scientists traced the newly discovered Heartland virus that infected two men from Missouri to lone star ticks in the region, adding another tick borne disease to those the CDC monitors. \u2014NCEZID helped identify a novel poxvirus (the same genus as smallpox) afflict- ing shepherds in the Republic of Georgia and is developing new diagnostic tests. \u2014International travel advisories released by CDC address threats posed by the new coronavirus MERS-CoV, first reported by Saudi Arabia in 2012. CDC is working with health departments, hospitals and other partners to prepare for possible cases in the United States. \u2014CDC is monitoring new reports of the mosquito borne chikungunya virus among residents of St. Martin in the Caribbean, the first time the disease has been detected among non-travelers in the Western Hemisphere. In 2013, CDC updated new surveillance results on several infectious diseases with serious healthcare and economic consequences in the United States: \u2014Each year there are about 19 to 21 million cases of norovirus illness, about 570 to 800 people die, and many thousands more are hospitalized or visit emergency rooms and outpatient clinics. Another CDC study found that the contagious stomach virus is now the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis among children less than 5 years of age who seek medical care. It caused nearly one million U.S. pediatric visits in 2009\u20142010. \u2014About 300,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease each year in the United States, making it the most commonly reported tick borne illness. The early esti-mate is based on findings from three ongoing CDC studies. It suggests that the total number is roughly 10 times higher than the number reported to CDC by healthcare providers. \u2014Valley Fever, a fungal respiratory infection, dramatically increased in several southwestern States, from 2,265 in 1998 to more than 22,000 in 2011. CDC is investigating whether the increase is related to changes in weather, rising pop-ulations or changes in the way the disease is detected and reported to the States or CDC. Each year, CDC gives financial support to all 50 State health departments, six local departments, and eight territories or affiliates. Since 2010, CDC has provided funds to 57 State, local and territorial health departments to increase the use of electronic lab reporting (ELR). About 10,400 labs send reportable data to health agencies but many do not report electronically. Global Health With globalization of our food supply and frequent travel to and from the United States, health security threats can come from anywhere. CDC's Center for Global Health and Office of Infectious Diseases oversee Agency efforts to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks in other countries. There are more than 1,600 CDC em-ployees located in over 60 countries. At present, only 1 in 5 countries can rapidly detect, respond to or prevent global health threats caused by emerging infections. Improvements overseas, such as strengthening surveillance and lab systems or training investigators, make both the United States and the rest of the world more secure against infectious disease. In January, CDC reported results from pilot projects in Uganda and Vietnam to improve disease detection and response capabilities. Work in Uganda modernized di-agnostic testing, developed real time information systems for faster outbreak re-sponse and improved emergency operations procedures. It focused on three priority diseases, drug resistant tuberculosis, cholera and viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola virus. The Vietnam project trained Vietnamese health officials in advanced PCR techniques to detect H7N9 influenza, enterovirus 71 and respiratory viruses. 396 The ASM strongly urges Congress to increase CDC's budget in fiscal year 2015 to the highest level possible and approve funding increases for infectious diseases. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), the largest single life science Soci- ety with over 39,000 members, wishes to submit the following comments and rec-ommendations for the record on the fiscal year 2015 budget for the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH). The ASM commends Congress for passage of the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations Bill which represents a step in the right direction al-though funding for NIH remains too low in view of the gaps in our knowledge of disease and the abundance of scientific opportunities that cannot be pursued be-cause of lack of funding. The ASM recommends that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in the Nation's investment in medical research. The ASM is very concerned about the future of biomedical research in the United States. NIH support for basic research is critical to health and security, job creation and growing the U.S. economy. In fiscal year 2013, the success rate for NIH re-search grant applicants fell to an historic low 16.8 percent. The average size of re-search project grants (RPGs) decreased to the lowest ever since 1999. During last year's sequestration, there were reports of delayed research projects, enforced layoffs of technical staff and waning innovation. Such stagnation undercuts biomedical re-search progress in the United States at a time when the opportunities are great and other Nations are growing their investment in basic and translational biomedical re-search. NIH is the primary supporter of biomedical research in the Nation. In 2012 alone, NIH funding supported more than 402,000 jobs and $57.8 billion in new economic activity nationwide. Among NIH's investments are those in the rapidly advancing field of genomics. A recent report from the nonprofit United for Medical Research (UMR) spotlighted the economics of Federal investment in the human genome project, which has generated $965 billion in economic impact, more than 53,000 di-rect genomics related jobs and $293 billion in personal income. Current trends in the Nation's R&D investments clearly do not bode well for fu- ture innovation and global competition. Federal R&D expenditures declined by 16.3 percent between fiscal years 2010 and 2013, while China's investment jumped more than 400 percent over the past decade. Since 2001, the U.S. share of global R&D performed has decreased from 37 percent to 30 percent. The Science Coalition Re-port in 2013 highlighted the importance of federally funded university research in creating new companies and R&D jobs. The report profiles R&D companies launched by relatively small Federal investment in university research, including NIH grants funding rapid pathogen detection technologies, vaccine development and advances in food and water safety. Several UMR reports from last year underscore how NIH supported research can propel private sector growth and innovation. U.S. biotech companies catalyzed by NIH funding illustrate the productive collaborations among NIH, university re-search scientists and the private sector. These companies are reshaping lucrative R&D sectors like gene sequencing and therapeutics for human disease, taking basic research to the marketplace. NIH support is responsible for several of Science maga-zine's top ten 2013 discoveries, all expected to return huge dividends, including the ''breakthrough of the year'' cancer immunotherapy, the new gene editing CRISPR technique and the astoundingly important human microbiome project. Also included was the first use of structural biology techniques to custom design a powerful immunogen with vaccine potential, in this case against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Worldwide, about 64 million cases of RSV infection occur each year, responsible for 160,000 deaths, making it the most common cause of severe respiratory illness in infants and young children. There is no approved vaccine, but the team led by NIAID Vaccine Research Center identified 3-D structures of attach-ment sites on the virus surface and potent antibodies against those sites, offering new tools to develop new or improved vaccines. NIH investments build the scientific foundation for the Nation's valuable bio- medical R&D sector, which employs 7 million and exports $90 billion in goods and services. In 2013, all three recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and all three winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry had at some point received NIH funding (for a total of 144 NIH supported Nobel laureates). Four NIH funded scientists also won prestigious 2013 Lasker Foundation awards. As the Nation's largest funder of biomedical research, NIH leads the Nation's ef- forts to discover new cures, preventions and therapies for difficult disease challenges 397 by funding intramural and extramural projects to combat infectious diseases that kill millions of people worldwide. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) contribute to new, paradigm shifting technologies like high throughput genomic se-quencing, as well as new multidisciplinary research approaches like systems biology. NIAID funded scientists have discovered therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests and other biomedical tools that improve human health. Lifesaving examples are vaccines for rabies, meningitis, whooping cough, hepatitis A and B, chickenpox and pneumo-coccal pneumonia. Developing new influenza vaccines is a high priority for NIAID, which has supported a health provider consortium for clinical trials since the 1960s. The NIAID Vaccine Research Center's influenza research has produced multiple promising advances like a DNA vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza and it helped establish the Southeast Asia Influenza Clinical Research Network to address global influenza threats. Ongoing NIAID research is making progress toward the highly significant goal of a universal influenza vaccine that would confer decades long pro-tection from any flu virus strain. In February, NIAID reported on its latest contributions in the battle to halt anti- microbial resistance (AR) spreading among pathogens, which is creating ever more dangerous diseases like multidrug resistant gonorrhea and extensively drug resist-ant tuberculosis. Each year, there are 2 million drug resistant infections and 23,000 deaths in the United States. Annual costs are an estimated $20 billion in added healthcare and $35 billion in lost productivity. NIAID leads U.S. research against drug resistant pathogens, making major investments in basic, translational and clinical research. Results include advances in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AR infections, as well as greater support for new drug discovery. The agency has helped support R&D of at least 25 percent of the antibiotics currently in clinical testing. Basic AR research funded by NIAID is detailing the ways that pathogens evade host defenses, to identify new therapeutic and diagnostic targets. Using the latest in technological tools, NIAID supported researchers are developing novel diagnostics platforms for more rapid and accurate detection of emerging AR infec-tions. NIAID's expansive AR portfolio also includes vaccine development against in-creasingly common AR threats like drug resistant staph and gonorrhea bacteria. One of NIAID's greatest challenges for the 21st century is developing defenses against familiar enemies, the world's three greatest microbial killers, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Recent research advances include the following: \u2014A novel compound, from a new class of potential antimalarial drugs, appears effective against multiple life stages of the malaria causing Plasmodium para-site. Most antimalarials only target the parasite as it grows in the host's blood-stream, giving the parasite more chances to spread and acquire drug resistance. \u2014After designing nanoparticles loaded with copies of mutated HIV selected via computerized screening, scientists have activated host immune cells to produce VRC01 neutralizing antibodies. The approach offers a new tool to potentially re-verse engineer neutralizing antibodies against HIV and other viruses. \u2014Using a systems biology approach, scientists have identified interactions among genetic regulators in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). The results help explain how Mtb lies latent for long periods in otherwise healthy people, then becomes active and transmissible TB. About one third of the world's population is infected, making Mtb switches be-tween different stages crucial to public health. Research strategies clearly rely upon previous scientific successes. Ever shifting influenza viruses and steady evolution of AR pathogens illustrate how any effort must build upon the past, respond to the present and plan for the future. New mi-crobial threats emerge as old threats persist, the recent spread of dengue fever, de-tection of influenza H7N9 last year and the newly emerging coronavirus caused Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). First identified in 2012, MERS-CoV in-fection has been implicated in 181 cases (as of February 4) and 79 deaths. With high mortality and no treatments, the disease's spread from the Middle East to Europe has health officials concerned. NIAID funded researchers now have reported some laboratory success using potential MERS-CoV therapy that combines two licensed antiviral drugs routinely used to treat diseases such as hepatitis C. At NIGMS, microbial genetics and cell/molecular biology are principal research emphases, recognition that microbiology not only provides insights to human health and biology in general, but also stimulates innovation in U.S. biotechnology. Each year, NIGMS awards more than 4,500 research grants and supports one fourth (4,000) of the NIH supported technical trainees. NIGMS funded research has generated high value technologies like PCR, high throughput DNA sequencing, and the human genome project. The latest exciting biotech tool to emerge is CRISPR technology (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short 398 Palindromic Repeats, DNA loci in bacterial genomes), innovation that evolved from basic research in both phage biology and advanced computing genomics. With huge potential for improved genome editing essential to the biotech industry, today the CRISPR system is increasingly used in gene cutting and other customized gene tar-geting. Without sustained NIH funding in diverse fields like microbiology, ASM strongly believes there will be fewer new discoveries and innovation in the United States. We urge Congress to build on bipartisan efforts to replace the random cuts of se-questration that have been devastating to basic research in the United States and to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. Increased investment will enable the scientific progress that is needed to improve the health, security and eco-nomic growth of the country. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR NUTRITION Dear Chairwoman Mikulski and Ranking Member Shelby: Thank you for the op- portunity to provide testimony regarding fiscal year 2015 appropriations. The Amer-ican Society for Nutrition (ASN) respectfully requests $32 billion dollars for the Na-tional Institutes of Health (NIH) and $182 million dollars for the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/ NCHS) in Fiscal Year 2015. ASN is dedicated to bringing together the world's top researchers to advance our knowledge and application of nutrition, and has more than 5,000 members working throughout academia, clinical practice, government, and industry. National Institutes of Health (NIH) The NIH is the Nation's premier sponsor of biomedical research and is the agency responsible for conducting and supporting 86 percent of federally-funded basic and clinical nutrition research. Although nutrition and obesity research makes up less than eight percent of the NIH budget, some of the most promising nutrition-related research discoveries have been made possible by NIH support. NIH nutrition-related discoveries have impacted the way clinicians prevent and treat heart disease, can-cer, diabetes and other chronic diseases. For example, U.S. death rates from heart disease and stroke have decreased by more than 60 percent, and the proportion of older adults with chronic disabilities has dropped by one-third. With additional sup-port for NIH, additional breakthroughs and discoveries to improve the health of all Americans will be made possible. Investment in biomedical research generates new knowledge, improved health, and leads to innovation and long-term economic growth. A decade of flat-funding, followed by sequestration cuts, has taken a significant toll on NIH's ability to sup-port research. Such economic stagnation is disruptive to training, careers, long- range projects and ultimately to progress. Increasing the NIH budget to $32 billion dollars would fully restore the funding that was lost to sequestration and support at least 600 additional competing research project grants. As a first step toward sus-tainable growth, ASN recommends a minimum of $32 billion dollars for NIH in fis-cal year 2015. NIH needs sustainable and predictable budget growth in order to ful-fill the full potential of biomedical research, including nutrition research, and to im-prove the health of all Americans. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics (CDC NCHS) The National Center for Health Statistics, housed within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is the Nation's principal health statistics agency. ASN rec-ommends a fiscal year 2015 funding level of $182 million dollars for NCHS, con-sistent with the President's budget request, to help ensure uninterrupted collection of vital health and nutrition statistics, and help cover the costs needed for tech-nology and information security maintenance and upgrades that are necessary to re-place aging survey infrastructure. More than half of NCHS's budget is supported through the evaluation tap. Therefore, ASN does not support efforts to eliminate the evaluation tap\u2014in part or in full\u2014unless a viable alternative funding mechanism is put in place to continue these important functions. The NCHS provides critical data on all aspects of our health care system, and it is responsible for monitoring the Nation's health and nutrition status through sur-veys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), that serve as a gold standard for data collection around the world. Nutrition and health data, largely collected through NHANES, are essential for tracking the nutri-tion, health and well-being of the American population, and are especially important for observing nutritional and health trends in our Nation's children. 399 Nutrition monitoring conducted by the Department of Health and Human Serv- ices in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service is a unique and critically important surveillance function in which dietary intake, nutritional status, and health status are evaluated in a rigorous and stand-ardized manner. Nutrition monitoring is an inherently governmental function and findings are essential for multiple government agencies, as well as the public and private sector. Nutrition monitoring is essential to track what Americans are eating, inform nutrition and dietary guidance policy, evaluate the effectiveness and effi-ciency of nutrition assistance programs, and study nutrition-related disease out-comes. Funds are needed to ensure the continuation of this critical surveillance of the Nation's nutritional status and the many benefits it provides. Through learning both what Americans eat and how their diets directly affect their health, the NCHS is able to monitor the prevalence of obesity and other chron-ic diseases in the U.S. and track the performance of preventive interventions, as well as assess 'nutrients of concern' such as calcium, which are consumed in inad-equate amounts by many subsets of our population. Data such as these are critical to guide policy development in the area of health and nutrition, including food safe-ty, food labeling, food assistance, military rations and dietary guidance. For exam-ple, NHANES data are used to determine funding levels for programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics, which provide nourishment to low-income women and chil-dren. To continue support for the agency and its important mission, ASN recommends an FY 2015 funding level of $162 million for NCHS. Sustained funding for NCHS can help to ensure uninterrupted collection of vital health and nutrition statistics, and will help to cover the costs needed for technology and information security up-grades that are necessary to replace aging survey infrastructure. Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding fiscal year 2015 ap- propriations for the National Institutes of Health and the CDC/National Center for Health Statistics. Please contact John E. Courtney, Ph.D., Executive Officer, if ASN may provide further assistance. [This statement was submitted by Gordon M. Jensen, M.D., Ph.D., 2013-2014 ident, American Society for Nutrition.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR PHARMACOLOGY & EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET) is pleased to submit written testimony in support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) fiscal year 2015 budget. ASPET recommends a fiscal year 2015 NIH budget of at least $32 billion. Sustained growth for the NIH should be an urgent national priority. Congress showed bipartisan support for the agency in fiscal year 2014 as evidenced by the $1 billion increase above the fiscal year 2013 sequestered level. While this 3.5 per-cent increase helps put NIH on the path to more sustainable funding levels, it does not begin to make up for a lost decade of funding. Adjusting for inflation, the fiscal year 2013 budget for the NIH is less than it was in 2003. For NIH to meet its vital role in improving public health, stimulating our economy, and improving global com-petitiveness it is critical that the agency continue to receive steady and sustainable increases. Additionally, if funding for the next 10 years is similar to that of the past decade, the Nation will lose a generation of young scientists. Increasingly, these individuals, seeing no prospects for careers in biomedical research, will leave the research enter-prise or look for employment in foreign countries. Not only are jobs increasingly lim-ited in the academic sector, but industry too is under stress. The ''brain drain'' of young scientific talent jeopardizes the Nation's leadership in biomedical research. A survey of ASPET's own graduate students and post-doctoral researchers indicates that 45 percent of post-doctoral trainees and 25 percent of graduate students say they are no longer considering a career in biomedical research due to the restrictive funding environment; 50 percent of graduate students and 29 percent of post-doc-toral trainees say they are willing to consider leaving the United States to pursue a career in biomedical research. A $32 billion budget for the NIH in fiscal year 2015 is a start to help restore NIH's biomedical research capacity. Currently, the NIH only can fund one in six grant applications, the lowest rate in the agency's history. Furthermore, the number of research project grants funded by NIH has declined every year since 2004. 400 A budget of at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 will help the agency manage its research portfolio more effectively without having to withhold funding for exist-ing grants to researchers throughout the country. Only through steady, sustained and predictable funding increases can NIH continue to fund the highest quality bio-medical research to help improve the health of all Americans and continue to make significant economic impact in many communities across the country. There is no substitute for a steady, sustained Federal investment in biomedical research. Industry, venture capital, and private philanthropy can supplement re-search but cannot replace the investment in basic, fundamental biomedical research provided by NIH. Neither the private sector nor industry will be able to fill a void for NIH funded basic biomedical research. Much of industry support is applied re-search that builds upon the discoveries generated from NIH-funded projects. The majority of the investment in basic biomedical research that NIH provides is broad and long-term providing a continuous development platform for industry, which would not typically invest in research that may be of higher risk and require several years to fully mature. In addition to this long term view, NIH also has mechanisms in place to rapidly build upon key technologies and discoveries that have the ability to have significant impact on the health and well being of our citizens. Many of the basic science initiatives supported by NIH have led to totally unex- pected discoveries and insight that have transformed our mechanistic understanding of and our ability to treat a wide range of diseases Diminished Support for NIH will Negatively Impact Human Health Continued diminishment of funding and loss of purchasing power will mean a loss of scientific opportunities to discover new therapeutic targets. Without a steady, sus-tained Federal investment in fundamental biomedical research, scientific progress will be slower and potentially helpful therapies or cures will not be developed. For example, more research is needed on Parkinson's disease to help identify the causes of the disease and help develop better therapies; discovery of gene variations in age- related macular degeneration could result in new screening tests and preventive therapies; more basic research is needed to focus on new molecular targets to im-prove treatment for Alzheimer's disease; and diminished support for NIH will pre-vent new and ongoing investigations into rare diseases that the Food and Drug Ad-ministration estimates almost 90 percent are serious or life-threatening. Historically, our past investment in basic biological research has led to many in- novative medicines. The National Research Council reported that of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact, only five were developed without input from the public sector. The significant past investment in the NIH has provided major gains in our knowledge of the human genome, resulting in the promise of pharmacogenomics and a reduction in adverse drug reactions that currently rep-resent a major worldwide health concern. Several completed human genome se-quence analyses have pinpointed disease-causing variants that have led to improved therapy and cures but further advances and improvements in technology will be de-layed or obstructed with diminished NIH funding. Investing in NIH Helps America Compete Economically A $32 billion budget in fiscal year 2015 will also help the NIH train the next gen- eration of scientists and provide a platform for broader workforce development that is so critical to our Nation's growth. Many individuals trained in the sciences through NIH support become educators in high schools and colleges. These individ-uals also enter into other aspects of technology development and evaluation in pub-lic and private sectors to further enrich the community and accelerate economic de-velopment. This investment will help to create jobs and promote economic growth. A stag- nating NIH budget will mean forfeiting future discoveries and jobs to other coun-tries. The U.S. share of global research and development investment from 1999-2009 is now only 31 percent, a decline of 18 percent. In contrast, other nations continue to invest aggressively in science. China has grown its science portfolio with annual increases to the research and development budget averaging over 23 percent annu-ally since 2000, including a 26 percent increase in 2012. Russia plans to increase support for research by 65 percent over the next 5 years. The European Union, de-spite great economic distress among its member nations, has proposed to increase spending on research and innovation by 45 percent between 2014 and 2020. NIH research funding catalyzes private sector growth. More than 83 percent of NIH funding is awarded to over 3,000 universities, medical schools, teaching hos-pitals and other research institutions in every State. One national study by an eco-nomic consulting firm found that Federal (and State) funded research at the Na-401 tion's medical schools and hospitals supported almost 300,000 jobs and added nearly $45 billion to the U.S. economy. NIH funding also provides the most significant sci-entific innovations of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Conclusion ASPET appreciates the many competing and important spending decisions the Subcommittee must make. However, the NIH's contribution to the Nation's eco-nomic and physical well being should make it one of the Nation's top priorities. With enhanced and sustained funding, NIH can begin to reverse its decline and help meet its potential to address many of the more promising scientific opportunities that currently challenge medicine. A budget of at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 will allow the agency to begin moving forward to full program capacity, ex-ploiting more scientific opportunities for investigation, and increasing investigator's chances of discoveries that prevent, diagnose and treat disease. NIH should be re-stored to its role as a national treasure, one that attracts and retains the best and brightest to biomedical research and provides hope to millions of individuals af-flicted with illness and disease. ASPET is a 5,100 member professional society whose members conduct basic, translational, and clinical pharmacological research within the academic, industrial and government sectors. Our members discover and develop new medicines and therapeutic agents that fight existing and emerging diseases, as well as increase our knowledge regarding how therapeutics affects humans. [This statement was submitted by James S. Bernstein, Director, Government and Public Affairs, American Society for Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the world's leading profes- sional organization representing nearly 35,000 physicians and other professionals who treat people with cancer, appreciates this opportunity to provide the following recommendations for fiscal year 2015 (fiscal year 2015) funding: \u2014National Institutes of Health (NIH): $32 billion \u2014National Cancer Institute (NCI): $5.26 billion ASCO's members set the standard for cancer care world-wide and lead the way in carrying out translational and clinical research aimed at improving the screening, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. ASCO advocates for policies that pro-vide access to high-quality care for all patients with cancer. ASCO's efforts are also directed toward supporting oncology clinical and translational research that is crit-ical to improving the lives of our citizens and that can inform cancer services for people worldwide. Cancer's Growing Footprint and the Importance of Federal Cancer Research According to ASCO's State of Cancer Care in America report (http://www.asco.org/ practice-research/cancer-care-america) released earlier this year, cancer will sur-pass heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States (US) over the next 16 years. While cancer deaths in the US are declining for all populations, the number of new cancer cases is expected to increase nearly 45 percent by 2030, from 1.6 million cases to 2.3 million cases annually. The leading overall risk factor for cancer is aging and these numbers reflect overall progress in healthcare, enabling more Americans to live longer. While we have made great strides in cancer treatment, now is not the time to cut back as cancer impacts more and more Americans. We now have more cancer sur-vivors alive today than at any point in our history and understand more about the diseases that make up cancer than ever before. This is largely because of Federal investment in cancer research, but we will not be able to harness the opportunities this new knowledge provides without further investment. Adjusting for inflation, funding for the NIH is down 23 percent since 2003. In addition, the NCI has become a smaller share of NIH's total budget. If NCI was funded as the same percentage of overall NIH spending that it was in 2003, it would mean an additional $350 mil-lion for cancer research. ASCO thanks the subcommittee for its past commitment to cancer research through the appropriations process and appreciates the unique effort made by the subcommittee in this challenging budget environment. We recognize the challenging environment, but caution that the current path of investment in cancer research will be devastating to attempts to find future cures. ASCO calls on this sub-committee to renew the commitment to clinical cancer research\u2014without which our basic science findings would never help improve the lives of patients. 402 While we appreciate the bipartisan efforts that led to a brief reprieve from seques- ter in fiscal year 2015, the lasting effects of these draconian cuts, exacerbated by years of stagnant funding, will be felt for decades to come if the trend is not re-versed. ASCO released a survey (http://www.asco.org/press-center/asco-survey-un-derscores-%E2%80%9Cdevastating%E2%80%9D-impact-stagnant-funding-cancer- research) of its members in September 2013 that showed the profound impact of se-quester on the U.S. cancer research enterprise. A large majority, 75 percent, of survey respondents, reported that the current Federal funding situation is having a direct impact on their ability to conduct cancer research, in many cases triggering ''devastating'' changes. Delayed clinical trials, the elimination of research staff positions, and the halting or slowing of promising re-search that could lead to new therapies for cancer were cited as specific results of stagnant funding. In order to stop these devastating trends and capitalize on forward progress, the NIH and the NCI must have sustained and predictable increases in funding. While private industry is a strong partner in cancer research, they do not conduct the broad scope of clinical research that is important to cancer patients. In contrast, the NCI conducts the high risk, high reward research that leads to practice-changing advancements that industry is often unwilling to undertake\u2014such as pediatric ap-plications, direct comparisons of approved drugs, and providing drugs in combina-tion with or prior to radiation or surgical treatments. Progress in fighting cancer would be faster, more efficient, and more sustainable if funding were steady and sustained. Our prior investments established the global leadership of American cancer re- search and care. Without maintenance of those investments, our global leadership and the benefits it offers everyday Americans in both health and economically are profoundly threatened. Clinical Trials and Translational Research NIH-funded translational research and clinical trials have significantly improved the standard of care in many diseases. At the same time, they also have dem-onstrated more cost-effective treatment options for many common cancers. Unfortu-nately, these trials are at risk, due to funding concerns that slow the launch and completion of trials. Of great concern is the deterioration of NCI support for feder-ally funded trials that take place in virtually every community in which cancer pro-viders treat patients. On March 1, 2014, the NCI launched the reorganized National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). The program currently involves over 3,000 institu-tions and community-based investigators in the US and provides approximately 17,000 patients with access to promising new treatments each year, at a $243 mil-lion annual cost to taxpayers. Due to funding constraints, the number of patients enrolled in clinical trials has fallen from a peak of almost 30,000 patients in 2009 to a planned enrollment of only 12,000 adults in the current fiscal year and some trials may be forced to close early potentially depriving patients of access to life- prolonging treatments. Please note that without patient accrual to clinical trials, there can be no changes in routine care, practice, and outcomes. This is where science becomes practice changing for patients in America. We understand that March 1 also marked the end of funding for the NCI Commu- nity Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP). NCI is transforming this program into the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). NCI is currently reviewing NCORP applications and does not expect to issue notices of award until September 2014. In the meantime, CCOP sites have ongoing ethical obligations to active trial participants to continue clinical trial procedures and required follow-up. At present, community practice sites are expected to do so without any transition in funding. These community sites are crucial to making cutting edge cancer care available to patients in the communities where they live. Without any assurance of sustained funding, some community sites will no longer be able to offer clinical trials to pa-tients. Clinical trials supported by Federal funding have led to important breakthroughs in cancer care that touch every American family and often these are in areas that industry has no incentive to pursue. Typically, the trial concepts are proposed di-rectly by clinician investigators who hypothesize ways to improve treatments for their patients and want to test those hypotheses through rigorously designed pro-spective clinical trials. Just as the NIH RO1 and R21 grant mechanisms inspire re-searcher creativity and innovation, the NCTN and NCORP programs are important in fostering research initiatives directly from clinician investigators who see first-hand the importance of answering questions vital to their patients. Publicly funded clinical trials involve establishing comparative effectiveness, examining promising regimens, optimizing multimodality treatments, developing therapies for rare can-403 cers, and studying prevention and survivorship strategies. These research goals may run parallel to those of commercial sponsors, but publicly funded trials are designed to benefit patients\u2014not intended to achieve regulatory approval or shareholder in-terest. Many of these trials are at risk due to funding constraints and the pace of further progress, especially against the most common cancers in America, will slow. For example, at the present time there is no publically funded breast cancer adju-vant treatment trial available in the US. ASCO's Clinical Cancer Advances report (http://www.cancerprogress.net/clinical- cancer-advances-2013) provides annual recognition of the major advances in patient treatments and care. The 2013 report details 76 research advances, 27 of which re-ceived NIH funding, in diseases impacting an estimated 1.6 million patients last year alone. Its top areas of progress include: using genomics to make treatment de-cisions for individual patients, discovering new cancer subtypes specifically associ-ated with potential new therapies, tackling treatment resistant forms of cancer through precision medicine approaches, enhancing the ability of patients' own im-mune systems to fight cancer, and implementing new cancer screening paradigms to reduce disparities. To maintain global American scientific leadership, ASCO urges a substantial in- crease in funding for the National Clinical Trials Network and NCI Community On-cology Research Program, as well as transition funding for CCOP sites until NCORP launches. ASCO is very concerned that the Federal funding situation is causing NCI to propose capping patient participation in clinical trials in order to stretch an ever- shrinking funding pot. NCI acknowledges that current payments are inadequate to cover the costs of conducting trials because they have not increased over nearly a decade. Making the needed increases at the expense of new scientific opportunities, however, is short-sighted and has long-term negative implications. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recognized this in its 2010 report, A National Cancer Clinical Trials System for the 21st Century: Reinvigorating the NCI Cooperative Group Program. The IOM pointed to the notable achievements of Cooperative Group trials that have dramatically improved the outcomes of today's cancer patients and recognized that increases in funding should accompany the changes that the NCI and Cooperative Groups have already implemented to increase the efficiency of their operations and to keep pace with scientific opportunity. An increase in NCI funding would enable the Institute to maintain or increase the number of accruals to trials at the same time as it increases payments to cover the cost of conducting the research. Threat to America's Global Leadership While the United States is slowing its investment in medical research, countries around the globe are making significant increases to theirs. Russia is increasing basic research funding by 65 percent, European investments are increasing by 40 percent over 7 years, South Korea has pledged a 50 percent increase, and China an-nounced a 26 percent boost in basic research funding in 2012. These investments result not only in additional research in these countries, but are attracting the best and brightest American-trained scientists to work abroad. The long-term con-sequences are easy to predict. If scientific progress is achieved elsewhere, Americans will be asked to import new treatments including drugs, intellectual property, and products. The previously referenced ASCO survey also revealed the disturbing finding that many young investigators are leaving the field altogether due to lack of funding. This too is a predictable effect of funding limits. With more than 35 percent of sur-vey participants reporting having to lay off skilled staff, many appear to be ques-tioning the viability of a career in research and raising serious concerns about the ultimate impact of budget cuts on patient care and outcomes. Declining Federal funding for clinical trials, coupled with the rising costs of in- creasingly complex studies, will severely harm the nation's clinical research enter-prise by limiting opportunities for innovation and demoralizing young clinical inves-tigators. As opportunities to develop and lead trials diminish and institutional pres-sures to generate research funding and clinical revenue continue to grow, young in-vestigators may leave the field of research, or choose to pursue research opportuni-ties in other countries. Not only does this threaten our progress against cancer, but it also diminishes the overall scientific workforce in America. In addition, clinical trials are increasingly being conducted overseas, due to the costs and regulatory complexities of conducting trials in the US. This denies your constituents the opportunity to participate, either as a patient receiving the most promising potential treatment or as a physician or research nurse conducting the clinical trial. Congress should demonstrate a continued commitment to ensure bio-medical research is federally funded. 404 Because of the incredible scientific opportunities facing us and the current threats to this opportunity, ASCO urges the NIH and NCI to focus more of its resources in the area of clinical trials and translational research. ASCO again thanks the Subcommittee for its continued support of cancer patients in the US through funding for the NIH and the NCI. We look forward to working with all members of the subcommittee to advance US cancer research. [This statement was submitted by Clifford A. Hudis, MD, FACP, President, Amer- ican Society of Clinical Oncology.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY The American Society of Hematology (ASH) thanks the Subcommittee for the op- portunity to submit written testimony on the fiscal year 2015 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. ASH represents more than 15,000 clinicians and scientists committed to the study and treatment of blood and blood-related diseases. These diseases encompass malig-nant disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma; life-threatening condi-tions, including thrombosis and bleeding disorders; and congenital diseases such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and hemophilia. In addition, hematologists have been pioneers in the fields of bone marrow transplantation, stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, gene- and immunotherapy, and the development of many drugs for the prevention and treatment of heart attacks and strokes. Funding for Hematology Research: An Investment in the Nation's Health Over the past 60 years, American biomedical research has led the world in prob- ing the nature of human disease. This research has led to new medical treatments, saved innumerable lives, reduced human suffering, and spawned entire new indus-tries. This research would not have been possible without support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Funding for hematology research has been an important component of this invest- ment in the Nation's health. Most of the research that produced cures and treat-ments for hematologic diseases has been funded by the NIH. The study of blood and its disorders is a trans-NIH issue involving many institutes at the NIH, including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the National Cancer Insti-tute (NCI), the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), and the National Institute on Aging (NIA). With the advances gained through an increasingly sophisticated understanding of how the blood system functions, hematologists have changed the face of medicine through their dedication to improving the lives of patients. As a result, children are routinely cured of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); more than 90 percent of pa-tients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are cured with a drug derived from vitamin A; older patients suffering from previously lethal chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are now effectively treated with well-tolerated pills; and patients with mul-tiple myeloma are treated with new classes of drugs. Additionally, as NIH Director Francis Collins recently noted in his testimony to the Subcommittee, researchers are ''aiming to harness the body's own immune sys-tem to fight cancer.'' One such method, known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell engineering, extracts T cells (naturally occurring immune cells) from the blood of a cancer patients and modifies the cells to produce special proteins on their sur-face. With these new engineered features, the T cells are injected back into the pa-tient, now primed to seek and destroy cancer cells. Preliminary studies have found that this process may generate responses in as many as two-thirds of cases in which all other treatment options have failed. Further, because the cells are derived from the patient, there is an inherently lower risk of toxicity because the cells are less likely to attack the host tissue than cells introduced from a foreign body. Promising results in patients with leukemia prompted Science magazine to name this its 2013 ''Breakthrough of the Year.'' Hematology advances also help patients with other types of cancers, heart dis- ease, and stroke. Even modest investments in hematology research have yielded large dividends for other disciplines. Basic research on blood has aided physicians who treat patients with heart disease, strokes, end-stage renal disease, cancer, and AIDS. Blood thinners effectively treat or prevent blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and strokes. Death rates from heart attacks are reduced by new forms of anticoagulation drugs. 405 Sequestration Threatens Scientific Momentum ASH is particularly concerned about the impact of continued cuts on biomedical research supported by the NIH. NIH's ability to continue current research capacity and encourage promising new areas of science is, and will be, significantly limited. At a time when we should be investing more in research to save lives, research funding remains in serious jeopardy. Trials to find new therapies and cures for mil-lions of Americans with blood cancers, bleeding disorders, clotting problems, and ge-netic diseases are just a few of the important projects that could be delayed unless NIH continues to receive predictable and sustained funding. Additionally, perhaps one of the greatest concerns is the obstacle these continued cuts will present to the next generation of scientists, who will see training funds slashed and the possibility of sustaining a career in research diminished. The Soci-ety is especially concerned about the number of scientists who have abandoned re-search careers; continued cuts will exacerbate this exodus, forcing researchers to abandon potentially life-enhancing research. Fiscal year 2015 NIH Funding Request ASH appreciates the welcome and much needed funding increase for the NIH that Congress provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. However, this in-crease did not give back all of the funds cut by sequestration in fiscal year 2013 nor did it restore the purchasing power lost over the past decade. ASH supports the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research recommendation that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Na-tion's investment in medical research. ASH also urges Congress and the Administra-tion to work in a bipartisan manner to end sequestration and the continued cuts to medical research that squander invaluable scientific opportunities, discourage young scientists, threaten medical progress and continued improvements in our Na-tion's health, and jeopardize our economic future. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Public Health Response for Blood Disorders The Society also recognizes the important role of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in preventing and controlling clotting, bleeding, and other hematologic disorders. Blood disorders\u2014such as sickle cell disease, anemia, blood clots, and hemophilia\u2014are a serious public health problem and affect millions of people each year in the United States, cutting across the boundaries of age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Men, women, and children of all backgrounds live with the complications associated with these conditions, many of which are painful and potentially life-threatening. CDC is uniquely positioned to reduce the public health burden resulting from blood disorders by contributing to a better understanding of these conditions and their complications; ensuring that prevention programs are developed, implemented, and evaluated; ensuring that information is accessible to consumers and healthcare providers; and encouraging action to improve the quality of life for people living with or affected by these conditions. The Society is concerned that the Division of Blood Disorders was cut by nearly $6 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 and the President's Budget for fiscal year 2015 did not restore this funding. ASH respectfully requests that the Division of Blood Disorders be funded in fiscal year 2015 at $19 million to assure that the programs funded by the Division for He-mophilia, Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Disease, and DVT/PE can be maintained. This funding will allow CDC to improve health outcomes and limit complications to those who are risk or currently have blood disorders, by promoting a comprehensive care model; identifying and evaluating effective prevention strategies; and increasing public and healthcare provider awareness of bleeding and clotting disorders such as such as hemophilia and thrombosis, and hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Thank you again for the opportunity to submit testimony. Please contact Tracy Roades, ASH Legislative Advocacy Manager, at troades@hematology.org, if you have any questions or need further information concerning hematology research or ASH's fiscal year 2015 funding request. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY The American Society of Nephrology (ASN) is the world's largest kidney health professional organization in the world, representing 15,000 physicians, other healthcare providers, and scientists, and committed to advancing research, preven-tion, and treatment options for the more than 20 million adults, children, and ado-406 lescents with kidney disease in the United States today. The society requests at least $2.066 billion for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The society also re-quests an additional $150 million/year over 10 years for kidney research above cur-rent funding for NIDDK. ASN believes these are crucial and necessary investments for preventing illness and maintaining fiscal responsibility. Investing in research to slow the progression of kidney disease and identify new therapies will save Medicare spending for the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Program in the long run. In 1972, Congress made a commitment to treat all Americans with kidney failure through the Medicare ESRD Program\u2014the only health entitlement program that provides coverage regardless of age or disability. Today, ESRD patients account for less than 1 percent of the Medicare population but 7 percent of the Medicare budget. Meanwhile, at approximately $650 million per year, total Federal funding for kidney research is equivalent to less than 1 percent of the nearly $77 billion Medicare spends annually for the care of patients with kidney disease. Given that the Medicare ESRD Program is unique in that it covers treatment for all patients with kidney failure regardless of age or disability, preventing kidney disease and improving therapy\u2014starting with innovative research at NIDDK\u2014 would yield significant savings to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The vast majority of Federal research leading to advances in the care and treat- ment of patients with kidney disease is funded by NIDDK. Examples of critical dis-coveries arising from NIDDK-funded research are numerous. For instance, investigative studies supported by NIDDK led to a groundbreaking discovery that helps explain racial and ethnic disparities that increase risks for kid-ney disease, which can lead to earlier detection and treatment. The finding that Af-rican Americans with two variants of the APOL1 gene are likely to progress to kid-ney failure faster than other ethnicities paves the way for future research to unlock better preventive therapies and gene-based cures. Recent findings from NIDDK's Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study led to the discovery that the progression of kidney disease is associated with less efficient pumping of blood by the heart. Further research exploring the mechanisms for this development could lead to new interventions that could slow down the pro-gression of kidney disease. Scientists supported by NIDDK have pursued cutting-edge basic, clinical, and translational research. While ASN fully understands the difficult economic environ-ment, the society firmly believes that funding NIDDK is a sound investment to cre- ate jobs, support the next generation of investigators, and ultimately provide quality care that is less expensive in order to improve the public health of Americans. Medical research is a major force in the economic health of communities nation- wide: every dollar invested in medical research generates $2.60 in economic activity. America must continue to capitalize on previous investments to drive research progress, train the next generation of scientists, create new jobs, promote economic growth, and maintain leadership in the global innovation economy\u2014particularly as other countries increase their investments in scientific research. Most important, a failure to maintain and strengthen NIDDK's ability to support the groundbreaking work of researchers across the country carries a palpable human toll, denying hope to the millions of patients awaiting the possibility of a healthier tomorrow. ASN urges Congress to uphold its longstanding legacy of bipartisan support for biomedical research.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLANT BIOLOGISTS On behalf of the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB), we would like to thank the Subcommittee for its support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). ASPB and its members strongly believe that sustained investments in scientific re-search will be a critical step toward economic recovery and job creation in our Na-tion. ASPB supports the maximum fiscal year 2015 appropriation for NIH and asks 407 that the Subcommittee Members encourage increased support for plant-related re- search within the agency; 25 percent of our medicines originate from discoveries re-lated to plant natural products, and such research has contributed in innumerable ways to improving the lives and health of Americans and people throughout the world. ASPB is an organization of some 4,500 professional plant biology researchers, edu- cators, students, and postdoctoral scientists with members across the Nation and throughout the world. A strong voice for the global plant science community, our mission\u2014achieved through work in the realms of research, education, and public policy\u2014is to promote the growth and development of plant biology, to encourage and communicate research in plant biology, and to promote the interests and growth of plant scientists in general. Plant Biology Research and America's Future Among many other functions, plants form much of the base of the food chain upon which all life depends. Importantly, plant research is also helping make many fun-damental contributions in the area of human health, including that of a sustainable supply and discovery of plant-derived pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals, and alter-native medicines. Plant research also contributes to the continued, sustainable, de-velopment of better and more nutritious foods and the understanding of basic bio-logical principles that underpin improvements in the health and nutrition of all Americans. Plant Biology and the National Institutes of Health Plant science and many of our ASPB member research activities have enormous positive impacts on the NIH mission to pursue ''fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to ex-tend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.'' In general, plant research aims to improve the overall human condition\u2014be it food, nutrition, medi-cine or agriculture\u2014and the benefits of plant science research readily extend across disciplines. In fact, plants are often the ideal model systems to advance our ''funda-mental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems'' as they provide the context of multi-cellularity while affording ease of genetic manipulation, a lesser regulatory burden, and maintenance requirements that are less expensive than those required for the use of animal systems. Many fundamental biological components and mechanisms (e.g., cell division, viral and bacterial invasion, polar growth, DNA methylation and repair, innate immunity signaling and circadian rhythms) are shared by both plants and animals. For exam-ple, a process known as RNA interference, which has potential application in the treatment of human disease, was first discovered in plants. Subsequent research eventually led to two American scientists, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, earning the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. More recently scientists engineered a class of proteins called TALENs capable of precisely editing genomes to potentially correct mutations that lead to disease. That these therapeutic proteins are derived from others initially discovered in a plant pathogen exemplifies the application of plant biology research to improving human health. These important discoveries again reflect the fact that some of the most important biological discoveries applica-ble to human physiology and medicine can find their origins in plant-related re-search endeavors. Health and Nutrition\u2014Plant biology research is also central to the application of basic knowledge to ''extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and dis-ability.'' Without good nutrition, there cannot be good health. Indeed, a World Health Organization study on childhood nutrition in developing countries concluded that over 50 percent of child deaths under the age of five could be attributed to mal-nutrition's effects in weakening the immune system and exacerbating common ill-nesses such as respiratory infections and diarrhea. Strikingly, most of these deaths were not linked to severe malnutrition, but chronic nutritional deficiencies brought about by overreliance on single crops for primary staples. Plant researchers are working today to address the root cause of this problem by balancing the nutritional content of major crop plants to provide the full range of essential micronutrients in plant-based diets. By contrast to developing countries, obesity, cardiac disease, and cancer take a striking toll in the developed world. Research to improve and optimize concentra-tions of plant compounds known to have, for example, anti-carcinogenic properties, will hopefully help in reducing disease incidence rates. Ongoing development of crop varieties with tailored nutraceutical content is an important contribution that plant biologists can and are making toward realizing the long-awaited goal of personalized medicine, especially for preventative medicine. 408 Drug Discovery\u2014Plants are also fundamentally important as sources of both ex- tant drugs and drug discovery leads. In fact, 60 percent of anti-cancer drugs in use within the last decade are of natural product origin\u2014plants being a significant source. An excellent example of the importance of plant-based pharmaceuticals is the anti-cancer drug taxol, which was discovered as an anti-carcinogenic compound from the bark of the Pacific yew tree through collaborative work involving scientists at the NIH National Cancer Institute and plant natural product chemists. Taxol is just one example of the many plant compounds that will continue to provide a fruit-ful source of new drug leads. While the pharmaceutical industry has largely neglected natural products-based drug discovery in recent years, research support from NIH offers yet another para-digm. Multidisciplinary teams of plant biologists, bioinformaticians, and synthetic biologists are being assembled to develop new tools and methods for natural prod-ucts discovery and creation of new pharmaceuticals. We appreciate NIH's current investment into understanding the biosynthesis of natural products through transcriptomics and metabolomics of medicinal plants. The recently released ''Genomes to Natural Products'' funding opportunity is also to be applauded as a po-tential avenue for new plant-related medicinal research, and we strongly encourage the continuation of these types of investments and other plant-related initiatives which can help further achievement of the NIH mission. Conclusion Although NIH does recognize that plants serve many important roles, the bound- aries of plant-related research are expansive and integrate seamlessly and syner-gistically with many different disciplines that are also highly relevant to NIH. As such, ASPB asks the Subcommittee to provide the maximum appropriation and di-rection to NIH to support additional plant research in order to continue to pioneer new discoveries and new methods with applicability and relevance in biomedical re-search. Thank you for your consideration of ASPB's testimony. For more information about ASPB, please see www.aspb.org. [This statement was submitted by Tyrone C.

LUNG DISEASE IN AMERICA Diseases of breathing constitute the third leading cause of death in the U.S., re- sponsible for one of every seven deaths. Diseases affecting the respiratory (breath-ing) system include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, tu-berculosis, influenza, sleep disordered breathing, pediatric lung disorders, occupa-tional lung disease, asthma, and critical illness. 409 National Institutes of Health The NIH is the world's leader in groundbreaking biomedical health research into the prevention, treatment and cure of diseases such as lung cancer, COPD and tu-berculosis. But due to eroded funding, the success rate for NIH research grants has plummeted to below 13 percent, which means that more than 85 percent of meri-torious research is not being funded. The implementation of budget sequestration in fiscal year 2013 cut NIH by an additional $1.5 billion, which resulted in the elimination of at least 1,000 grant opportunities and cuts of up to 10 percent for continuing grants. These cuts will result in the halting of vital research into dis-eases affecting millions around the world. We ask the subcommittee to provide $32 billion in funding for the NIH in fiscal year 2015. Despite the rising lung disease burden, lung disease research is underfunded. In fiscal year 2012, lung disease research represented just 23.2 percent of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) budget. Although lung disease is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., research funding for the disease is a small fraction of the money invested for the other three leading causes of death. In order to stem the devastating effects of lung disease, research funding must continue to grow. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In order to ensure that health promotion and chronic disease prevention are given top priority in Federal funding, the ATS supports a funding level for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that enables it to carry out its prevention mission, and ensure a translation of new research into effective State and local pub-lic health programs. We ask that the CDC budget be adjusted to reflect increased needs in chronic disease prevention, infectious disease control, including TB control and occupational safety and health research and training. The ATS recommends a funding level of $7.8 billion for the CDC in fiscal year 2015. CHRONIC OBSTUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the third lead- ing cause of death worldwide, yet the disease remains relatively unknown to most Americans. CDC estimates that 12 million patients have COPD; an additional 12 million Americans are unaware that they have this life threatening disease. In 2010, the estimated economic cost of lung disease in the U.S. was $186 billion, in-cluding $117 billion in direct health expenditures and $69 billion in indirect mor-bidity and mortality costs. The NHLBI is developing a national action plan on COPD, in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to expand COPD surveil-lance, development of public health interventions and research on the disease and increase public awareness of the disease and we urge Congress to support it. We also urge CDC to include COPD-based questions to future CDC health surveys, in-cluding the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) and the National Health Information Survey (NHIS). TOBACCO CONTROL Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S., respon- sible for one in five deaths annually. The ATS is pleased that the Department of Health and Human Services has made tobacco use prevention a key priority. The CDC's Office of Smoking and Health coordinates public health efforts to reduce to-bacco use. In order to significantly reduce tobacco use within 5 years, as rec-ommended by the subcommittee in fiscal year 2010, the ATS recommends a total funding level of $250 million for the Office of Smoking and Health in fiscal year 2015. ASTHMA Asthma is a significant public health problem in the United States. Approximately 25 million Americans currently have asthma. In 2010, 3,388 Americans died as a result of asthma exacerbations. Asthma is the third leading cause of hospitalization among children under the age of 15 and is a leading cause of school absences from chronic disease. The disease costs our healthcare system over $50.1 billion per year. African Americans have the highest asthma prevalence of any racial/ethnic group and the age-adjusted death rate for asthma in this population is three times the rate in whites. A study published in the American Journal of Respiratory Critical Care in 2012 found that for every dollar invested in asthma interventions, there was a $36 benefit. We ask that the subcommittee's appropriations request for fiscal year 410 2015 that funding for CDC's National Asthma Control Program be maintained at a funding level of at least $28 million. SLEEP Several research studies demonstrate that sleep-disordered breathing and sleep- related illnesses affect an estimated 50-70 million Americans. The public health im-pact of sleep illnesses and sleep disordered breathing is still being determined, but is known to include increased mortality, traffic accidents, cardiovascular disease, obesity, mental health disorders, and other sleep-related comorbidities. The ATS recommends a funding level of $1 million in fiscal year 15 to support activities re-lated to sleep and sleep disorders at the CDC, including for the National Sleep Awareness Roundtable (NSART), surveillance activities, and public educational ac-tivities. The ATS also recommends an increase of funding for research on sleep dis-orders at the Nation Center for Sleep Disordered Research (NCSDR) at the NHLBI. TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading global infectious disease killer, claiming 1.3 million lives each year. In the U.S., every State reports cases of TB annually. Drug-resistant TB poses a particular challenge to domestic TB control due to the high costs of treatment and intensive healthcare resources required. Treatment costs for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB range from $100,000 to $300,000. The global TB pandemic and spread of drug resistant TB present a persistent public health threat to the U.S. The Comprehensive Tuberculosis Elimination Act (CTEA, Public Law 110-392), enacted in 2008, reauthorized programs at CDC with the goal of putting the U.S. back on the path to eliminating TB. The ATS, recommends a funding level of $243 million in fiscal year 2015 for CDC's Division of TB Elimination, as authorized under the CTEA, and encourages the NIH to expand efforts to develop new tools to reduce the rising global TB burden. PEDIATRIC LUNG DISEASE The ATS is pleased to report that infant death rates for various lung diseases have declined for the past 10 years. In 2009, of the 10 leading causes of infant mor-tality, 4 were lung diseases or had a lung disease component. Many of the precur-sors of adult respiratory disease start in childhood. Many children with respiratory illness grow into adults with COPD. It is estimated that 7.1 million children suffer from asthma. While some children appear to outgrow their asthma when they reach adulthood, 75 percent will require life-long treatment and monitoring of their condi-tion. The ATS encourages the NHLBI to continue with its research efforts to study lung development and pediatric lung diseases. CRITICAL ILLNESS The burden associated with the provision of care to critically ill patients is enor- mous, and is anticipated to increase significantly as the population ages. Approxi-mately 200,000 people in the United States require hospitalization in an intensive care unit because they develop a form of pulmonary disease called Acute Lung In-jury. Despite the best available treatments, 75,000 of these individuals die each year from this disease. This is the approximately the same number of deaths each year due to breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer combined. Investigation into diagnosis, treatment and outcomes in critically ill patients should be a priority, and the NIH should be encouraged and funded to coordinate investigation in this area in order to meet this growing national imperative. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER The Fogarty International Center (FIC) provides training grants to U.S. univer- sities to teach AIDS treatment and research techniques to international physicians and researchers. Because of the link between AIDS and TB infection, FIC has cre-ated supplemental TB training grants for these institutions to train international health professionals in TB treatment and research. The ATS recommends Congress provide $72.8 million for FIC in fiscal year 2015, to allow expansion of the TB train-ing grant program from a supplemental grant to an open competition grant. RESEARCHING AND PREVENTING OCCUPATIONAL LUNG DISEASE As Congress considers funding priorities for fiscal year 2015, the ATS urges the subcommittee to provide at least level funding for the National Institute for Occupa-411 tional Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH, within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is the primary Federal agency responsible for conducting re-search and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related illness and injury. The ATS appreciates the opportunity to submit this statement to the sub- committee. [This statement was submitted by Thomas Ferkol, MD, President, American Tho- racic Society.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AMERICANS FOR NURSING SHORTAGE RELIEF The organizations of the ANSR Alliance greatly appreciate the opportunity to sub- mit written testimony recommending $251 million in fiscal year 2015 for the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Programs at the Health Resources and Serv-ices Administration (HRSA) and $20 million for the Nurse Managed Health Clinics as authorized under Title III of the Public Health Service Act. We represent a di-verse cross-section of healthcare and other related organizations, healthcare pro-viders, and supporters of nursing issues (http://www.ansralliance.org/Members.html) that have united to address the national nursing shortage. ANSR stands ready to work with Congress to advance programs and policy that will ensure our Nation has a sufficient and adequately prepared nursing workforce to provide quality care to all well into the 21st century. The Nursing Shortage Nursing is the largest healthcare profession in the United States and work in a variety of settings, including primary care, public health, long-term care, surgical care facilities, schools, and hospitals. In the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Em-ployment Projections for 2012-2022, the total employment of registered nurses (RNs) and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) will increase by 574,400 jobs. With upcoming RN retirements in the mix, the Nation will need to produce 1.13 million new RNs by 2022 to fill those jobs. Because of the retirements, the pro-jected number of RNs needed to fully staff healthcare facilities is virtually double the number of increased jobs due to expanded demand from new patients coupled with the aging baby boomer population wanting healthcare services. More new RNs are graduating from nursing programs than had been observed in the early 2000's but not sufficient numbers to make up the difference over the long-term. The Title VIII Nursing Workforce Education Programs will help fill these vacancies by sup-porting training programs designed to meet these healthcare needs. The Title VIII Nursing Workforce and Education programs provide training for entry-level and advanced degree nurses to improve the access to, and the quality of, healthcare in underserved areas. These programs provide the largest source of Federal funding for nursing education, providing loans, scholarships, traineeships, and programmatic support that, between fiscal year 2005 and 2010, supported over 400,000 nurses and nursing students as well as numerous academic nursing institu-tions and healthcare facilities. The Desperate Need for Nurse Faculty Nursing vacancies exist throughout the entire healthcare system, including long- term care, home care and public health. Government estimates indicate that this situation only promises to worsen due to an insufficient supply of individuals ma-triculating in nursing schools, an aging existing workforce, and the inadequate availability of nursing faculty to educate and train the next generation of nurses. At the exact same time that the nursing shortage is expected to worsen, the baby boom generation is aging and the number of individuals with serious, life-threat-ening, and chronic conditions requiring nursing care will increase. Each year, nursing schools turn away tens of thousands of qualified applications at all degree levels due to an insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, clinical preceptors, and budget constraints. Securing and retaining adequate numbers of faculty is essential to ensure that all individuals interested in\u2014and qualified for\u2014nursing school can matriculate in the year that they are accepted. ANSR supports the need for sustained attention on the efficacy and performance of existing and proposed programs to improve nursing practices and strengthen the nursing workforce. The support of research and evaluation studies that test models of nursing practice and workforce development is integral to advancing healthcare for all in America. Investments in research and evaluation studies have a direct ef-fect on the caliber of nursing care. Our collective goal of improving the quality of patient care, reducing costs, and efficiently delivering appropriate healthcare to 412 those in need is served best by aggressive nursing research and performance and impact evaluation at the program level. The Nursing Supply Impacts the Nation's Health and Economic Safety The demand for primary care services in the US is expected to increase over the next few years, particularly with the aging and growth of the population. One study projects that by the year 2019, the demand for primary care in the United States will increase by between 15 million and 25 million visits per year. HRSA estimates that more than 35.2 million people living within the 5,870 Health Professional Shortage Areas nationwide do not currently receive adequate primary care services. Research suggests that nurses and other health professionals are trained to and al-ready do deliver many primary care services and may therefore be able to help in-crease access to primary care, particularly in underserved areas. ANSR applauds the subcommittee's bipartisan efforts to recognize that a strong nursing workforce is essential to a health policy that provides high-value care for every dollar invested in capacity building for a 21st century nurse workforce. For 50 years, the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Programs have responded to the Nation's evolving workforce needs by providing education and training oppor-tunities to nurses. These programs are the only Federal programs focused on filling gaps in the supply of nurses not met by traditional market forces, as well as pro-ducing a workforce prepared to care for the Nation's increasingly diverse and aging population. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Title VIII programs grad- uate more minority and disadvantaged students more likely to serve in community health centers as well as rural and underserved areas. In a difficult economy, the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Education Programs help schools offer scholarships and affordable loans to nursing students, making such educational opportunities available to aspiring nurses of all backgrounds. By guiding job seekers to high-de-mand nursing jobs, the programs fulfill both their individual career goals and a community's health needs. Summary HRSA's Title VIII Nursing Workforce Education programs contribute to a suffi- cient nursing workforce to meet the demands of a highly diverse and aging popu-lation is an essential component to improving the health status of the Nation and reducing healthcare costs. While the ANSR Alliance understands the immense fiscal pressures facing the Nation, we respectfully urge support for $251 million in fund-ing for Nursing Workforce Development Programs under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act at HRSA and $20 million for the Nurse Managed Health Clinics under Title III of the Public Health Service Act in fiscal year 2015. We look forward to working with the Subcommittee to prioritize the Title VIII programs in fiscal year 2015 and the future.

CAPACITY FOR FEDERALLY -OWNED CHIMPANZEES RETIRED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH APNM and APV request NIH be given authority to use $5 million of funds appro- priated in this and subsequent appropriations bills for extramural construction and renovation within the National Chimpanzee Sanctuary System. In 2013, NIH announced their plan to retire hundreds of government owned chim- panzees to sanctuary. This decision followed years of scientific review that deter-mined chimpanzees are not necessary for research to advance human health along with broad public outcry over the ethics of holding chimpanzees in labs. Additional sanctuary construction is needed to enable NIH to move forward with their plan to retire the vast majority of government owned chimpanzees. Even taking into ac-count upfront construction expenditures, the sooner the construction is completed and the chimpanzees are moved to sanctuary, the more the government will save over the lifetimes of the chimpanzees\u2014which can be 60 years or more. Detailed information on the request follows. Background information In June of 2010, the National Institutes of Health proposed a plan to move 202 aging, sick chimpanzees from a facility New Mexico where they had not been used for invasive research for years to a laboratory in Texas for further research. Intense public scrutiny over the animal cruelty issues and taxpayer waste of this plan was bolstered by involvement from New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Dr. Jane Goodall, and many more. In December 2010 U.S. Senators Tom Udall, Tom Harkin, and Jeff Bingaman requested an independent study from the National Academy of Sciences on whether chimpanzees are necessary as invasive research subjects. The December 2011 Institute of Medicine study found that chimpanzees are not necessary for the vast majority of research and noted the serious ethical objections raised by keeping chimps in research labs. Immediately following the announcement of the IOM study results, NIH accepted the findings and assembled a panel of ex-perts to advise them on the best way to implement the IOM findings. NIH accepted 414 nearly all of the expert panel's recommendations in their final decision. In June of 2013, the National Institutes of Health announced their plan to retire all but 50 government-owned chimpanzees to sanctuary, significantly curtail the use of chimps in NIH funded studies and not to revitalize breeding of chimpanzees for research. NIH had already begun the transfer of the 110 government owned chimpanzees at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana to Chimp Haven (the National Chimpanzee Sanctuary), also located in Louisiana. This transfer is on schedule to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2014. At that point, approximately 350 gov-ernment-owned chimpanzees will remain in laboratories\u2014300 of whom are slated for retirement to sanctuary per NIH's plan. In late November of 2013, the President signed into law amendments to the Chimpanzee Health Improvement Maintenance and Protection (CHIMP Act) which continued funding for the care, maintenance and transportation of federally owned chimpanzees over the next 5 years. These amendments have enabled NIH to provide funds for basic care for chimpanzees the agency already approved into sanctuary and also set the stage for NIH to move forward with their plan to retire hundreds more chimpanzees. Costs in laboratories vs. sanctuary Accredited sanctuaries provide the highest welfare standards for chimps at a lower cost to taxpayers than housing chimpanzees in research laboratories (see at-tached chart). It is estimated that transferring the 300 government-owned chim-panzees who are slated for retirement from the laboratories where they are cur-rently housed to the national sanctuary will save taxpayers $1.7 million to $2.7 mil-lion per year in care and maintenance costs. Construction to house more chimpanzees in sanctuary will require an upfront ex- penditure. However, due to the lower per diem cost in sanctuary, retiring chim-panzees to sanctuary will still yield a significant savings to taxpayers. The sooner construction is completed and the chimpanzees are moved to sanctuary, the more the taxpayers will save. We respectfully request the subcommittee to consider the following language for inclu- sion in the appropriations bill: Of the funds appropriated to NIH, $5,000,000 shall be for grants or contracts for construction, renovation, or repair of the sanctuary system established by Section 404K of the Public Health Service Act.

Thi s number represents actual costs billed to NIH over the most recently completed contract year (06/30/2012\u201406/29/2013) 415 We appreciate the opportunity to share this testimony with the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2015. We hope the Committee will be able to accommodate this request. Thank you for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN CANCER INSTITUTES The Association of American Cancer Institutes (AACI), representing 93 of the Na- tion's premier academic and free-standing cancer centers, appreciates the oppor-tunity to submit this statement for consideration by the subcommittee. AACI sub-mits this request for the Department of Health and Human Services budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the amount of $32 billion for fiscal year 2015. AACI thanks Congress for its long-standing commitment to ensuring quality care for cancer patients, as well as for providing researchers with the resources that they need to develop better cancer treatments and, ultimately, to find cures for this dead-ly disease. The partnership between the Federal Government and our Nation's can-cer centers is mutually beneficial, and cancer centers continue to make strides in biomedical research thanks to a partnership with the Federal Government. Without such support, research projects with the potential to discover breakthrough thera-pies would not be possible. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes $30.2 billion for the NIH, an in- crease of $200 million (0.7 percent) over the fiscal year 2014 level. This amount in-cludes $4.931 billion for the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a $7.5 million increase over fiscal year 2014 (0.2 percent). Though we appreciate the president's support, NIH and NCI continue to endure a lag in funding. The fiscal year 2015 proposal falls far short of the inflation rate of 2.9 percent, a figure that NIH projected last year for the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI) for fiscal year 2015. AACI joins with our colleagues in the biomedical research community in recommending that the subcommittee recognize NIH as a critical national priority by providing at least $32 billion in funding in the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS-Edu-cation Appropriations bill, including an equivalent percentage increase in funding for NCI. This funding level represents the minimum investment necessary to avoid further loss of promising research. CANCER CENTERS MUST BE SUPPORTED IN ORDER TO MOVE RESEARCH FORWARD America's standing in research and scientific discovery is threatened with each dollar slashed from the NIH budget. The budgetary pain in fiscal year 2014 has been less intense than in recent years but still remains for cancer centers striving both to keep gifted scientists at their institutions and to resume halted research projects due to sequestration. For some labs, recovery is nowhere in sight. Many have closed their doors, while some scientists have taken early retirement or simply left the field. Even some well-established labs claim they will never recover from the damage caused by sequestration. With cancer centers challenged to provide infrastructure resources necessary to support researchers, the failure to keep pace with the biomedical inflation rate will limit AACI members' ability to provide well-functioning shared resources to inves-tigators who depend on them to complete their research. For most academic cancer centers, the majority of NCI grant funds are used to sustain shared resources that are essential to basic, translational, clinical and population cancer research, or to provide matching dollars which allow departments to recruit new cancer researchers to a university and support them until they receive their first grants. Center infra-structure is expensive and it is not clear where cancer centers would acquire alter-native funding if NCI grants for these efforts continue to dwindle. AACI cancer centers are at the forefront of the national effort to eradicate cancer. The cancer centers that AACI represents house more than 20,000 scientific, clinical and public health investigators who work collaboratively to translate promising re-search findings into new approaches to prevent and treat cancer. Making progress against cancer is complex and time-intensive. However, the pace of discovery and translation of novel basic research to new therapies could be quickened if research-ers could count on an appropriate and predictable investment in Federal cancer funding. As research costs and patient need increase, cancer centers continue to be highly dependent on Federal cancer center grants. CANCER CENTERS ARE PIONEERS IN RESEARCH The negative effects of diminished biomedical research funding reach beyond the lab as AACI cancer center directors have vocalized their concerns. The impact of flat 416 funding to the NIH continues to disturb advances in biomedical research and is of paramount concern to cancer center leaders. While AACI President Michelle M. Le Beau, PhD, director of the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, applauded the president's budget proposal, she asked that Congress build upon that budget. Dr. Le Beau has said that at a time when cancer centers continue to address the losses sustained due to budget se-questration, research institutions rely on robust aid from their partnership with the Federal Government. She said, ''Cancer centers have served as pioneers in bio-medical research, improving patient care and gaining a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through research. Advances in science are within reach, but without sufficient funding at the NIH and ultimately, the NCI, such progress in research will move at a slower pace.'' Speaking at a meeting of the AACI Government Relations Forum in Houston, TX, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center president Ronald DePinho, MD, echoed Dr. Le Beau's concerns. Dr. DePinho underscored the need for increased Fed-eral funding for cancer research, noting that cancer incidence in the U.S. is pro-jected to increase 45 percent between today and 2030. Dr. DePinho has acknowl-edged that the major solutions for patients will come from scientific innovations that will lead to transformation in cancer prevention, early detection and definitive cures. He said that academic medical centers are the engines for such discoveries. Dr. DePinho stressed that it is ''critical that we vigorously support these national treasures to deal with the onslaught of people who will need cancer services.'' University of New Mexico Cancer Center researchers, physicians, and staff work tirelessly to provide vital patient care and breakthrough cancer technology to a rich-ly diverse and widely dispersed population. Cancer center director and CEO Cheryl Lynn Willman, MD is dedicated to ensuring all patients who enter UNM Cancer Center receive unsurpassed care, yet she is troubled by worries that not everyone in New Mexico has the ability and means to seek care at the NCI-designated center. While Willman and her team at UNM Cancer Center devote their time, effort, and hard work to bringing the most advanced cancer treatments available to the public, providing all potential patients with access to care is not achieved without high costs. Without sustained and stable NIH funding UNM Cancer Center and other centers across the country will struggle to uphold their devoted mission in cancer care and research to the people of New Mexico. Robert S. DiPaola, MD, director of Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, knows the strides that can be made within cancer research due to increased NIH funding. Recently, Rutgers was awarded a competitive grant by the NCI to support their pre-cision experimental therapeutics endeavor. Dr. DiPaola was proud to announce their collaboration with investigators from the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center as well as with a network of cancer centers. Though Dr. DiPaola and his team are grateful for the NCI funding that has made this work possible, they are increasingly aware that without adequate increases to NIH funding, the future of cancer research collaboration could suffer. He asserted that, ''Ensuring that NIH ac-quires an increase at least relative to the inflation rate of 2.9 percent will help to keep the progress we are making in cancer research nationwide moving in the right direction.'' Samir N. Khleif, MD, director of GRU Cancer Center at Georgia Regents Univer- sity, testified before the appropriations subcommittee on March 25, noting that dec-ades of sustained strong investment in NIH and NCI have sparked remarkable progress in cancer research and treatment. Dr. Khleif asked for increased funding at the NIH and the NCI in order to ''keep our best and brightest minds focused on developing the biomedical research breakthroughs that save lives.'' He requested that support for NIH not falter in order for the U.S. to maintain its global edge in scientific discovery and innovation and maintain its progress in reducing the burden of cancer and other diseases. AACI President-Elect George Weiner, MD, director of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Iowa, agreed with Dr. Khleif's testimony. Dr. Weiner's greatest concern stems from the decrease in funding for the NIH and the NCI and the impact reduced Federal funding will have on young scientists and he has blogged about scientific and budgetary concerns. Dr. Weiner fears young sci-entists might not chose to conduct their research in the U.S. in the future, instead opting to go overseas as U.S. support for innovation has been flat or dropped and other countries begin to make progress. Dr. Weiner knows that the U.S. remains the world leader in biomedical research, but feels that ''ongoing success will be de-pendent on outstanding physicians and scientists, born here and abroad, having the collaborative culture, resources and infrastructure needed to accelerate progress to-ward our shared mission of reducing the burden of cancer.'' Dr. Weiner stated that providing these tools will have a positive impact on our Nation's ability to care for 417 1American Cancer Society.

Facts and Figures. patients, our ability to conduct research, and our economy. Dr. Weiner stressed the need to continue to emphasize the importance of investing in innovation through education and research. He maintained that a commitment to investing in the NIH and the NCI is vital to the successes achieved through science. CANCER RESEARCH IS IMPROVING AMERICA 'S HEALTH The broad portfolio of research supported by NIH and NCI is essential for improv- ing our basic understanding of diseases and has paid off considerably in terms of improving Americans' health. The 5-year relative survival rate for all cancers diag-nosed between 2002 and 2008 is 68 percent, up from 49 percent in 1975-1977. In addition, cancer death rates have dropped 11.4 percent among women and 19.2 per-cent among men over the past 15 years. 1The improvement in survival reflects both progress in diagnosing certain cancers at an earlier stage and better treatment. Despite that success, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the U.S., with almost 1,600 deaths per day. More than 1.6 million new cancer cases will be discovered in 2014 and over 580,000 cancer deaths are expected. 2NCI estimates that 41 percent of individuals born today will receive a cancer diagnosis at some point in their lifetime. 3 CONCLUSION NIH estimates that the overall costs of cancer in 2008 were $201.5 billion: $77.4 billion for direct medical costs (total of all health expenditures) and $124 billion for indirect mortality costs (cost of lost productivity due to premature death). 4The cost of cancer continues to rise, but the investment in cancer research will one day elimi-nate such economic burdens on Americans and the cancer center researchers who work tirelessly to find a cure for this deadly disease. Failure to keep pace with the biomedical rate of inflation will only hinder our Nation's cancer center researchers from grasping future knowledge that will aid in the prevention, detection and treat-ment of cancer. As Congress makes difficult appropriations decisions for fiscal year 2015 and be- yond, AACI asks that it recall that the Nation's financial support of NIH and NCI has paid dividends by introducing innovative therapies for cancers that years ago cut short far too many American lives. The future of scientific discovery in cancer research is in the hands of the scientists whose research is conducted in labs across the country. NIH's full support of NCI-designated centers and their programs re-mains a top priority for our Nation's research institutions and we ask that Congress aid our Nation's cancer centers in their goal to eradicate cancer. [This statement was submitted by Barbara Duffy Stewart, MPH, Executive Direc- tor, Association of American Cancer Institutes.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) is a not-for-profit associa- tion representing all 141 accredited U.S. and 17 accredited Canadian medical schools; nearly 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems; and nearly 90 aca-demic and scientific societies. Through these institutions and organizations, the AAMC represents 128,000 faculty members, 75,000 medical students, and 110,000 resident physicians. The AAMC requests the following for Federal priorities essen-tial in assisting medical schools and teaching hospitals to fulfill their missions of education, research, and patient care: at least $32 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH); $375 million for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); $520 million for the Title VII and VIII health professions workforce pro-grams the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)'s Bureau of Health Professions; and student aid through the Department of Education and HRSA's National Health Service Corps. The AAMC appreciates the Subcommittee's longstanding, bipartisan efforts to strengthen these programs. National Institutes of Health\u2014Congress's long-standing bipartisan support for medical research through the NIH has created a scientific enterprise that is the envy of the world and has contributed greatly to improving the health and well- 418 being of all Americans. The foundation of scientific knowledge built through NIH- funded research drives medical innovation that improves health through new and better diagnostics, improved prevention strategies, and more effective treatments. Nearly 84 percent of NIH research funding is awarded to more than 2,500 re- search institutions in every state. At least half of this funding supports life-saving research at America's medical schools and teaching hospitals, where scientists, clini-cians, fellows, residents, medical students, and trainees work side-by-side to im-prove the lives of Americans through research. This successful partnership between the Federal Government and academic medicine not only lays the foundation for im-proved health and quality of life, it also strengthens the Nation's long-term econ-omy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 included a welcome and much need- ed increase for NIH. However, this increase did not restore the funding cut from sequestration in fiscal year 2013 or the purchasing power lost over the past decade. The AAMC hopes fiscal year 2014 represents a first step toward restoring our Na-tion's preeminence in medical research. The AAMC supports the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research recommendation that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Nation's investment in medical research. The AAMC also urges Congress and the Administration to work in a bipartisan manner to end sequestration and the continued cuts to medical research that squander invaluable scientific opportunities, discourage young sci-entists, threaten medical progress and continued improvements in our Nation's health, and jeopardize our economic future. The AAMC thanks the Subcommittee for its efforts to retain the limit on salaries that can be drawn from NIH extramural awards at Executive Level II of the Federal Executive Pay Scale. Medical schools' and teaching hospitals' discretionary funds from clinical revenues and other sources have become increasingly constrained and less available to invest in research. If institutions and departments divert funds to compensate for a reduction in the salary limit, they have less funding for critical activities such as bridge funding to investigators between grants and start-up pack-ages to young investigators to launch their research programs. A lower salary cap also will disproportionately affect physician investigators, who will be forced to make up salaries from clinical revenues, thus leaving less time for research. This may serve as a deterrent to their recruitment into research careers. The AAMC urges the Subcommittee to continue its efforts to retain the limit at Executive Level II. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2014Complementing the medical re- search supported by NIH, AHRQ sponsors health services research designed to im-prove the quality of healthcare, decrease healthcare costs, and provide access to es-sential healthcare services by translating research into measurable improvements in the healthcare system. The AAMC firmly believes in the value of health services research as the Nation continues to strive to provide high-quality, evidence-based, efficient, and cost-effective healthcare to all of its citizens. The AAMC joins the Friends of AHRQ in recommending $375 million in base discretionary funding for the agency in fiscal year 2015. As the only Federal agency with the sole purpose of generating evidence to make healthcare safer; higher quality; and more accessible, equitable, and affordable, AHRQ also works to ensure such evidence is available across the continuum of healthcare stakeholders, from patients to payers to providers. These research find-ings will better guide and enhance consumer and clinical decisionmaking, provide improved healthcare services, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of healthcare delivery. Health Professions Funding\u2014HRSA's Title VII health professions and Title VIII nursing education programs are the only Federal programs designed to improve the supply, distribution, and diversity of the Nation's primary care workforce. Through loans, loan guarantees, and scholarships to students, and grants and contracts to academic institutions and non-profit organizations, the Title VII and Title VIII pro-grams fill the gaps in the supply of health professionals not met by traditional mar-ket forces. Titles VII and VIII are structured to allow grantees to test educational innova- tions, respond to changing delivery systems and models of care, and address timely topics in their communities. By assessing the needs of the communities they serve and emphasizing interprofessional education and training, Title VII and VIII pro-grams bring together knowledge and skills across disciplines to provide effective, ef-ficient and coordinated care. Further, numerous studies demonstrate that the pro-grams graduate more minority and disadvantaged students and prepare providers that are more likely to serve in Community Health Centers (CHC) and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). 419 The AAMC joins the Health Professions and Nursing Education Coalition (HPNEC) in recommending $520 million for these important workforce programs in fiscal year 2015. This funding level is necessary to ensure continuation of all Title VII and Title VIII programs while also supporting promising initiatives such as the Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment program, the Clinical Training in Inter-professional Practice program, the Rural Physician Training Grants, and other ef-forts to bolster the workforce. The AAMC strongly objects to the Administration's proposal to eliminate the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC), which, in 2012 alone, trained more than 20,000 health professions students in community-based settings, and the Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP), which research shows has helped students from dis-advantaged backgrounds achieve higher grade point averages and matriculate into health professions programs. Continued support for these and the full spectrum of Title VII and programs is essential to prepare our next generation of medical profes-sionals to adapt to the evolving healthcare needs of the changing population. In addition to funding for Title VII and Title VIII, HRSA's Bureau of Health Pro- fessions also supports the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) program. This program provides critical Federal graduate medical edu-cation support for children's hospitals to prepare the future primary care and spe-cialty care workforce for our Nation's children. At a time when the Nation faces a critical physician shortage, the AAMC has serious concerns about the proposed elimination of the CHGME program in the president's budget. We strongly support full funding for the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education program at $300 million in fiscal year 2015. Student Aid and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC)\u2014The AAMC urges the committee to sustain student loan and repayment programs for graduate and professional students at the Department of Education. The average graduating debt of medical students is currently $175,000, and typical repayment can range from $326,000 to $492,000. The AAMC urges Congress to reauthorize the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Fund, created under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, Public Law 111-142 and Public Law 111-152) and set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2015. In the absence of continued mandatory funding, the committee must address the NHSC funding shortfall in the already strained Labor-HHS spending bill. To date, the steady, sustained, and certain growth established by this mandatory funding for the NHSC has resulted in program expansion and innovative pilots such as the Student to Service (S2S) Loan Repayment Program that incentivizes fourth-year medical students to practice primary care in underserved areas after residency training. Once again, the AAMC appreciates the opportunity to submit this statement for the record and looks forward to working with the Subcommittee as it prepares its fiscal year 2015 spending bill. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT RESEARCH INSTITUTES The Association of Independent Research Institutes (AIRI) thanks the Sub- committee for its long-standing and bipartisan leadership in support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We continue to believe that science and innovation are essential if we are to continue to improve our Nation's health, sustain our leader-ship in medical research, and remain competitive in today's global information and innovation-based economy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 included a welcome and much needed increase for NIH. However, this increase did not give back all of the funds cut by sequestration in fiscal year 2013 nor did it restore the purchasing power NIH has lost over the past decade. We hope fiscal year 2014 rep-resents a first step toward restoring our Nation's preeminence in medical research. AIRI recommends that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Nation's investment in medical re-search. AIRI is a national organization of more than 80 independent, non-profit research institutes that perform basic and clinical research in the biological and behavioral sciences. AIRI institutes vary in size, with budgets ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, each AIRI member institution is gov-erned by its own independent Board of Directors, which allows our members to focus on discovery-based research while remaining structurally nimble and capable of ad-justing their research programs to emerging areas of inquiry. Researchers at inde-pendent research institutes consistently exceed the success rates of the overall NIH grantee pool, and they receive about 10 percent of NIH's peer-reviewed, competi-tively-awarded extramural grants. 420 The partnership between NIH and America's scientists, research institutions, uni- versities, and medical schools is a unique and highly-productive relationship, leveraging the full strength of our Nation's research enterprise to foster discovery, improve our understanding of the underlying cause of disease, and develop the next generation of medical advancements that deliver more treatments and cures to pa-tients. Not only is NIH research essential to advancing health, it also plays a key economic role in communities nationwide. Approximately 84 percent of the NIH's budget goes to more than 300,000 research positions at over 2,500 universities and research institutions located in every State. The Federal Government has an irreplaceable role in supporting medical research. No other public, corporate or charitable entity is willing or able to provide the broad and sustained funding for the cutting edge research necessary to yield new innova-tions and technologies of the future. NIH supports long-term competitiveness for American workers, forming one of the key foundations for U.S. industries like bio-technology, medical device and pharmaceutical development, and more. Unfortu-nately, continued erosion of the national commitment to medical research threatens our ability to support a medical research enterprise that is capable of taking full advantage of existing and emerging scientific opportunities. The NIH model for conducting biomedical research, which involves supporting sci- entists at universities, medical centers, and independent research institutes, pro-vides an effective approach to making fundamental discoveries in the laboratory that can be translated into medical advances that save lives. AIRI member institu-tions are private, stand-alone research centers that set their sights on the vast fron-tiers of medical science. AIRI institutes are specifically focused on pursuing knowl-edge around the biology and behavior of living systems and applying that knowledge to improve human health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. Addition-ally, AIRI member institutes have championed (and very frequently are called upon to lead) technologies and research centers to collaborate on biological research for all diseases. Using shared resources\u2014specifically, advanced technology platforms or ''cores,''\u2014as well as genomics, next-generation sequencing, electron and light compound imaging, and other tech-nologies, AIRI researchers advance therapeutics development and drug discovery. AIRI member institutes are especially vulnerable to reductions in the NIH budget, as they do not have other reliable sources of revenue to make up the shortfall. In addition to concerns over funding, AIRI member institutes oppose legislative provi-sions\u2014such as directives to reduce the salary limit for extramural researchers\u2014 which would harm the integrity of the research enterprise and disproportionately affect independent research institutes. Such prescriptive policies hinder AIRI mem-bers' research missions and their ability to recruit and retain talented researchers. AIRI also does not support legislative language limiting the flexibility of NIH to de-termine how to most effectively manage its resources while funding the best sci- entific ideas. AIRI member institutes' flexibility and research-only missions provide an environ- ment particularly conducive to creativity and innovation. Independent research in-stitutes possess a unique versatility and culture that encourages them to share ex-pertise, information, and equipment across research institutions, as well as neigh-boring universities. These collaborative activities help minimize bureaucracy and in-crease efficiency, allowing for fruitful partnerships in a variety of disciplines and in-dustries. Also, unlike institutes of higher education, AIRI member institutes focus primarily on scientific inquiry and discovery, allowing them to respond quickly to the research needs of the country. AIRI members are located in 25 States, including many smaller or less-populated States that do not have major academic research institutions. In many of these re-gions, independent research institutes are major employers and local economic en-gines, and they exemplify the positive impact of investing in research and science. The biomedical research community depends upon a knowledgeable, skilled, and diverse workforce to address current and future critical health research questions. While the primary function of AIRI member institutions is research, most are highly involved in training the next generation of biomedical researchers, ensuring that a pipeline of promising scientists is prepared to make significant and potentially transformative discoveries in a variety of areas. AIRI supports policies that promote the ability of the United States to maintain a competitive edge in biomedical science. The NIH initiatives focusing on career development and recruitment of a diverse scientific workforce are important to innovation in biomedical research and public health. AIRI thanks the Subcommittee for its important work dedicated to ensuring the health of the Nation, and we appreciate this opportunity to urge the Subcommittee to provide $32 billion for NIH in the fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill. AIRI also 421 urges Congress and the Administration to work in a bipartisan manner to end se- questration and the continued cuts to medical research that squander valuable sci-entific opportunities, discourage young scientists, threaten medical progress and continued improvements in our Nation's health, and jeopardize our economic future. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS IN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY On behalf of the Association of University Programs in Occupational Health and Safety (AUPOHS), an organization representing the 18 multidisciplinary, univer-sity-based Education and Research Centers (ERCs) and the ten Agricultural Centers for Disease and Injury Research, Education, and Prevention funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), we respectfully request that the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations bill include level funding of $27 million for the Education and Research Centers and $24 million for the Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (AFF) Program within the NIOSH budget. NIOSH is the Federal agency responsible for supporting education, training, and research for the prevention of work-related injuries and illnesses in the United States. The ERCs are regional resources for parties involved with occupational health and safety\u2014industry, labor, government, academia, and the public. Collec-tively, the ERCs provide training and research resources to every Public Health Re-gion in the United States. ERCs contribute to national efforts to reduce losses asso-ciated with work-related illnesses and injuries by offering: \u2014Prevention Research: Developing the basic knowledge and associated tech- to prevent work-related illnesses and injuries. \u2014Professional Training: ERCs support 86 graduate degree programs in Occupa- tional Medicine, Occupational Health Nursing, Safety Engineering, Industrial Hygiene, and other related fields to provide qualified professionals in essential disciplines. \u2014Research Training: Preparing doctoral-trained scientists who will respond to fu- ture research challenges and who will prepare the next generation of occupa-tional health and safety professionals. \u2014Continuing Education: Short courses designed to enhance professional skills and maintain professional certification for those who are currently practicing in occupational health and safety disciplines. These courses are delivered through-out the regions of the 18 ERCs, as well as through distance learning tech-nologies. \u2014Regional Outreach: Responding to specific requests from local employers and workers on issues related to occupational health and safety. Occupational injury and illness represent a striking burden on America's health and well-being. Despite significant improvements in workplace safety and health over the last several decades, each year nearly 1.2 million workers are injured seri-ously enough to require time off work and, daily, an average of 11,000 U.S. workers sustain disabling injuries on the job, 13 workers die from an injury suffered at work, and 146 workers die from work-related diseases. This burden costs industry and citizens an estimated $4 billion per week\u2014$250 billion dollars per year. This is an especially tragic situation because work-related fatalities, injuries and illnesses are preventable with effective, professionally directed, health and safety programs. The rapidly changing workplace continues to present new health risks to Amer- ican workers that need to be addressed through occupational safety and health re-search. For example, between 2000 and 2015, the number of workers 55 years and older will increase 72 percent to over 31 million. Work related injury and fatality rates increase at age 45, with rates for workers 65 years and older nearly three times greater than younger workers. In addition to changing demographics, the rapid development of new technologies (e.g., nanotechnology) poses many unan-swered questions with regard to workplace health and safety that require urgent attention. The heightened awareness of terrorist threats, and the increased responsibilities of first responders and other homeland security professionals, illustrates the need for strengthened workplace health and safety in the ongoing war on terror. The NIOSH ERCs play a crucial role in preparing occupational safety and health profes-sionals to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks and to increase readiness to respond to biological, chemical, or radiological attacks. In addition, oc-cupational health and safety professionals have worked for several years with emer-gency response teams to minimize disaster losses. For example, NIOSH took a lead role in protecting the safety of 9/11 emergency responders in New York City and Virginia, with ERC-trained professionals applying their technical expertise to meet 422 immediate protective needs and to implement evidence-based programs to safeguard the health of clean-up workers. Additionally, NIOSH is now administering grants to provide health screening of World Trade Center responders. We need manpower to address these challenges and it is the NIOSH ERCs that train the professionals who fill key positions in health and safety programs, regionally and around the Nation. And because ERCs provide multi-disciplinary training, ERC graduates protect workers in virtually every walk of life. Despite the success of the ERCs in training such qualified professionals, the country continues to have ongoing manpower shortages. The Agricultural Safety and Health Centers program was established by Congress in 1990 (Public Law 101-517) in response to evidence that agricultural workers were suffering substantially higher rates of occupational injury and illness than other U.S. workers. Today the NIOSH Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (AFF) Initiative includes nine regional Centers for Agricultural Disease and Injury Research, Education, and Prevention and one national center to address children's farm safety and health. The AFF program is the only substantive Federal effort to meet the obligation to ensure safe working conditions for workers in this most vital production sector. While agriculture, forestry, and fishing constitute one of the largest industry sectors in the U.S. (DOL 2011), most AFF operations are themselves small: nearly 78 per-cent employ fewer than 10 workers, and most rely on family members and/or immi-grants, part-time, contract and seasonal labor. Thus, many AFF workers are ex-cluded from labor protections, including many of those enforced by OSHA. In 2012 the AFF sector had a work-related fatality rate of 22 per 100,000 workers, the highest of any sector in the Nation. More than 1 in 100 AFF workers incur nonfatal injuries resulting in lost work days each year. These reported figures do not even include men, women, and youths on farms with fewer than 11 full-time employees. In addition to the harm to individual men, women, and families, these deaths and injuries inflict serious economic losses including medical costs and lost capital, productivity, and earnings. The life-saving, cost-effective work of the NIOSH AFF program is not replicated by any other agency: \u2014State and Federal OSHA personnel rely on NIOSH research in the development of evidence-based standards for protecting agricultural workers and would not be able to fulfill their mission without the NIOSH AFF program. \u2014While committed to the well-being of farmers, the USDA has little expertise in the medical or public health sciences. USDA no longer funds, as it did histori-cally, land grant university-based farm safety specialists. \u2014Staff members of USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture interact with NIOSH occupational safety and health research experts to keep abreast of cutting-edge research and new directions in this area. NIOSH Agricultural Center activities include: \u2014AFF research has shown that the use of rollover protective structures (ROPS or rollbars) and seatbelts on tractors can prevent 99 percent of overturn-related deaths. A New York program has increased the installation of ROPS by 10-fold and recorded over 140 close calls with no injuries among farmers who had in-stalled ROPS. 99 percent of program participants said they would recommend the program to other farmers. \u2014Working in partnership with producers and farm owners, the NIOSH AFF Cen- ters have developed evidence-based solutions for reducing exposure to pesticides and other farm chemicals among farmers, farm workers and their children. \u2014Commercial Fishing had a reported annual fatality rate 58 times higher than the rate for all U.S. workers in 2009. Research has shown that knowledge of maritime navigation rules and emergency preparedness means survival. A NIOSH AFF-funded team produced an interactive navigation training CD in three languages, demonstrated the effectiveness of refresher survival drill in-struction, and assisted the US Coast Guard's revision of regulations requiring commercial fishing vessel captains complete navigation training. \u2014The Centers have partnered with producers, employers, the Federal migrant health program, physicians, nurses, and Internet Technology specialists to edu-cate farmers, employers, and healthcare providers about the best way to treat and prevent agricultural injury and illness. \u2014In 2010, the logging industry had a reported fatality rate of 91.9 deaths per 100,000 workers (preliminary data), a rate more than 25 times higher than that of all US workers. NIOSH AFF Centers, including the Southeast and the North-west, are uniquely positioned to ensure the safety of our Nation's 86,000 work-ers in forestry & logging. 423 Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony on behalf of the many individ- uals committed to working to improve the safety and well being of others in our communities. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS Thank you Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran for allowing me to sub- mit testimony on behalf of the Nation's 213 U.S. accredited zoos and aquariums. Specifically, I want to express my support for the inclusion of $38.6 million for the Institute of Museum and Library Services' (IMLS) Office of Museum Services in the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agen-cies appropriations bill. Founded in 1924, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) is a nonprofit 501c(3) organization dedicated to the advancement of zoos and aquariums in the areas of conservation, education, science, and recreation. Accredited zoos and aquar-iums annually see more than 182 million visitors, collectively generate more than $21 billion in annual economic activity, and support more than 204,000 jobs across the country. Over the last 5 years, AZA-accredited institutions supported more than 4,000 field conservation and research projects with $160,000,000 annually in more than 100 countries. In the last 10 years, accredited zoos and aquariums formally trained more than 400,000 teachers, supporting science curricula with effective teaching materials and hands-on opportunities. School field trips annually connect more than 12,000,000 students with the natural world. Aquariums and zoological parks are defined by the ''Museum and Library Services Act of 2003'' (Public Law 108-81) as museums. The Office of Museum Services awards grants to museums to support them as institutions of learning and explo-ration, and keepers of cultural, historical, and scientific heritages. Grants are awarded in several areas including educational programming, professional develop-ment, and collections management, among others. The Nation's accredited zoos and aquariums, even while facing budget limitations, are thriving during these uncertain economic times. As valued members of local communities, zoos and aquariums offer a variety of programs ranging from unique educational opportunities for schoolchildren to conservation initiatives that benefit both local and global species. The competitive grants offered by the IMLS Office of Museum Services ensure that many of these programs, which otherwise may not exist because of insufficient funds, positively impact local communities and many varieties of species. For example, with a 2013 Museums for America\u2014Collections Stewardship grant the Toledo Zoo will obtain new life support systems for an interactive visitor touch tank containing invertebrates and another holding sharks and stingrays. The exhib-its provide multi-sensory experiences that connect people with animals, while the systems ensure the animals are properly cared for. Through its 2012 Museums for American grant, the Birmingham Zoo supported its Africa Zoo School program, which is serving 1,200 students over 2 years. Partnering with Birmingham City School, seventh-grade students from low-performing schools attend a week-long ''Zoo School'' session, where they learn about the crisis of the elephant species' survival in Africa, the cultures of people in Africa, and the scientific and engineering re-search involved in sustaining these populations. Finally, a 2011 Museums for Amer-ica grant enabled The National Aquarium in Baltimore to create a more robust vol-unteer program by developing and testing new techniques to attract, train, engage, and retain a new generation of more diverse volunteers. Unfortunately, current funding has allowed IMLS to fund only a small fraction of all highly-rated grant applications. Despite this funding shortfall, zoo and aquar-ium attendance has increased and the educational services zoos and aquariums pro-vide to schools and communities are in greater demand than ever. Zoos and aquar-iums are essential partners at the Federal, State, and local levels in providing edu-cation and cultural opportunities that adults and children may otherwise never enjoy. As museums, zoos and aquariums share the same mission of preserving the world's great treasures, educating the public about them, and contributing to the Nation's economic and cultural vitality. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to in-clude $38.6 million for the Institute of Museum and Library Services' Office of Mu-seum Services in the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-cation, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Thank you. [This statement was submitted by Jim Maddy, President and CEO, Association of Zoos and Aquariums.] 424 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE BRAIN INJURY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran, thank you for the opportunity to submit this written testimony with regard to the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS-Edu-cation appropriations bill. This testimony is on behalf of the Brain Injury Associa-tion of America (BIAA), our network of State affiliates, and hundreds of local chap-ters and support groups from across the country. In the civilian population alone every year, more than 2.5 million people sustain brain injuries from falls, car crashes, assaults and contact sports. Males are more likely than females to sustain brain injuries. Children, teens and seniors are at greatest risk. Increasing numbers of service members returning from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan with TBI and their families are seeking resources for information to better understand TBI and to obtain vital support services to facilitate successful reintegration into their communities. Since 1997, Congress has provided minimal funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Federal TBI Program to assist States in devel-oping services and systems to help individuals with brain injuries and their families who have a broad range of service and support needs. . Similarly, Congress has ap-propriated funds to HRSA for grants to State Protection and Advocacy Systems to assist individuals with TBI in accessing services through education, legal and advo-cacy remedies, but the program is woefully underfunded. Rehabilitation, community support and long-term care systems are still developing in many States, while stretched to capacity in others. Additional numbers of individuals with TBI as the result of war-related injuries only adds more stress to these inadequately funded systems. BIAA respectfully urges you to provide States with the resources they need to ad- dress both the civilian and military populations that look to them for much needed support in order to live and work in their communities. With broader regard to all of the programs authorized through the TBI Act, BIAA specifically requests: \u2014$10 million (+ $4 million) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention TBI Registries and Surveillance, Brain Injury Acute Care Guidelines, Preven-tion and National Public Education/Awareness \u2014$12 million (+ $1 million) for the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Federal TBI State Grant Program \u2014$4 million (+ $1 million) for the HRSA Federal TBI Protection & Advocacy (P&A) Systems Grant Program CDC\u2014National Injury Center\u2014The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Injury Center is responsible for assessing the incidence and prevalence of TBI in the United States. The CDC estimates that 2.5 million TBIs occur each year and 5.3 million Americans live with a life-long disability as a result of TBI. The TBI Act as amended in 2008 requires the CDC to coordinate with the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to include the number of TBIs occurring in the mili-tary. This coordination will likely increase CDC's estimate of the number of Ameri-cans sustaining TBI and living with the consequences. CDC also funds States for TBI registries, creates and disseminates public and pro- fessional educational materials, for families, caregivers and medical personnel, and has recently collaborated with the National Football League and National Hockey League to improve awareness of the incidence of concussion in sports. CDC plays a leading role in helping standardize evidence based guidelines for the management of TBI and $1 million of this request would go to fund CDC's work in this area. HRSA TBI State Grant Program\u2014The TBI Act authorizes HRSA to award grants to (1) States, American Indian Consortia and territories to improve access to service delivery and to (2) State Protection and Advocacy (P&A) Systems to expand advo-cacy services to include individuals with traumatic brain injury. Since 1997, the HRSA Federal TBI State Grant Program has supported State efforts to address the needs of persons with brain injury and their families and to expand and improve services to underserved and unserved populations including children and youth; vet-erans and returning troops; and individuals with co-occurring conditions In fiscal year 2009, HRSA reduced the number of State grant awards to 21, in order to increase each monetary award from $118,000 to $250,000. This means that many States that had participated in the program in prior years have now been forced to close down their operations, leaving many individuals with brain injury and their families unable to access needed care and supports. Increasing the program to $8 million will provide funding necessary to sustain the grants for the 21 States currently receiving funding along with the three additional States added this year and to ensure funding for four additional States. Steady in-425 creases over 5 years for this program will provide for each State including the Dis- trict of Columbia and the American Indian Consortium and territories to sustain and expand State service delivery; and to expand the use of the grant funds to pay for such services as Information & Referral (I&R), systems coordination and other necessary services and supports identified by the State. HRSA TBI P&A Program\u2014Similarly, the HRSA TBI vides funding to all State P&A systems for purposes of protecting the legal and human rights of individuals with TBI. State P&As provide a wide range of activities including training in self-advocacy, outreach, information & referral and legal as-sistance to people residing in nursing homes, to returning military seeking veterans benefits, and students who need educational services. Effective Protection and Advocacy services for people with traumatic brain injury is needed to help reduce government expenditures and increase productivity, inde-pendence and community integration. However, advocates must possess specialized skills, and their work is often time-intensive. A $4 million appropriation would en-sure that each P&A can move towards providing a significant PATBI program with appropriate staff time and expertise. NIDRR TBI Model Systems of Care\u2014Funding for the TBI Model Systems in the Department of Education is urgently needed to ensure that the Nation's valuable TBI research capacity is not diminished, and to maintain and build upon the 16 TBI Model Systems research centers around the country. The TBI Model Systems of Care program represents an already existing vital na- tional network of expertise and research in the field of TBI, and weakening this pro-gram would have resounding effects on both military and civilian populations. The TBI Model Systems are the only source of non-proprietary longitudinal data on what happens to people with brain injury. They are a key source of evidence-based medi-cine, and serve as a ''proving ground'' for future researchers. In order to make this program more comprehensive, Congress should provide $13 million (+ $1.5 million) in fiscal year 2015 for NIDRR's TBI Model Systems of Care program, in order to add two new Collaborative Research Projects. In addition, given the national importance of this research program, the TBI Model Systems of Care should receive ''line-item'' status within the broader NIDRR budget. We ask that you consider favorably these requests for the CDC, the HRSA Fed- eral TBI Program, and the NIDRR TBI Model Systems Program to further data col-lection, increase public awareness, improve medical care, assist States in coordi-nating services, protect the rights of persons with TBI, and bolster vital research. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS INTRODUCTION On behalf of approximately 14,000 California Licensed Psychiatric Technicians representing the Nation's ''gold standard'' in direct-care nursing services for people with developmental disabilities and mental illnesses, I am writing to respectfully re-quest that the Subcommittee, Committee and Congress as a whole end the practice of using Federal funds to downsize and close federally regulated and accredited homes for Americans with developmental disabilities. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES CAUGHT IN A FEDERAL WEB OF IRONIES In recent years, the national demand for developmental centers' closure has come perhaps most strongly\u2014and, perhaps, most surprisingly\u2014from the Federal Govern-ment: the very Federal Government which requires developmental centers to meet its own regulatory standards. To be federally certified through the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, State developmental centers must meet eight major criteria on manage-ment, client protections, facility staffing, active treatment, client behavior and facil-ity practices, healthcare services, physical environment and dietetic services. To meet all of these major criteria, developmental centers must comply with 378 spe-cific Federal standards and elements. Failure to comply with any one of these hun-dreds of requirements or to swiftly correct any deficiencies means the loss of Federal certification as well as Federal Medicaid funding. But in an interesting twist, other Federal funds go to support the efforts of the Protection and Advocacy system. Created by Congress, this federally mandated sys-tem acts as a legally based advocacy provider for people with developmental disabil-ities and other mental and physical disabilities throughout the Nation. Each State 426 has a P&A branch to investigate allegations of discrimination, abuse or other con- cerns affecting Americans with disabilities, wherever they reside. The P&A system and other Federal laws arose as responses to widespread con- cerns of neglect and abuse at an unlicensed New York developmental center called Willowbrook State School more than 40 years ago. The system and laws are the bases for the regulations that today's developmental centers must follow to achieve and continue Federal accreditation. However, nothing in this system or laws require the closure of developmental centers. In the case of the Federal law which creates P&As\u2014the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (often called the ''DD Act'')\u2014P&As' board charge is to ''protect and advocate'' for people with disabilities regardless of where they reside. In the DD Act's legislative history, Congress expressly cautioned against interpreting the act as mandating closures: ''The goals expressed in this act to promote the greatest possible integration and independence for some individuals with developmental disabilities may not be read as a Federal policy supporting the closure of residential institutions... .'' This Con-gressional intent is reinforced in the act itself, where individuals and their families, and no one else, are named as the ''primary decisionmakers'' regarding services (in-cluding residential supports) and policies. U.S. SUPREME COURT SUPPORTS RESIDENTIAL CHOICE To add to the paradox, another Federal group\u2014none other than the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014made key points in its touchstone 1999 Olmstead ruling: ''We emphasize that nothing in the [Americans with Disabilities Act] or its imple- menting regulations condone termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings...Nor is there any Federal requirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.'' The overall tragic irony of this Kafkaesque situation is not lost on those advo- cating for loved ones to have the choice of living in federally regulated and certified facilities. Adding to the personal and emotional toll of advocating to keep their loved ones' developmental-center homes open, family members must use their own per-sonal funds to fight the deep pockets of federally funded P&A and DOJ attorneys seeking center closures that families and residents often do not wish. Federal funds are being used by one Federal agency to sue another Federal agency for the purpose of evicting our Nation's most vulnerable people from their homes. In addition to wasting taxpayer dollars, it defies common sense and human decency. WHAT DOES 'MOST INTEGRATED ' MEAN? Those taking aim at developmental centers, in the Federal Government or else- where, feel that the centers are not the most integrated settings possible for those with developmental disabilities. But the ADA defines ''most integrated setting'' to be ''a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible [emphasis added].'' Families with loved ones in developmental centers who wish to continue their services strongly disagree with any interpretation that their family members are, in any way, restricted. They feel that the many on-site services offered at a develop-mental center provide the most integrated environments possible, allowing their loved ones live securely and to meet their fullest potentials. Professional developmental-center staff also echo families' concerns about how many group homes and placements with less safety and oversight and fewer pro-grams can be less ''restrictive.'' Developmental centers are required by Federal and State regulations to have dozens and dozens of federally regulated state-of-the-art therapeutic and rehabilitative programs in place, right there on grounds as well as in the broader community; but somehow a developmental center is always painted as ''less integrated'' and ''more restrictive'' than a house on a busy street with a postage-stamp yard, occasional visits by licensed staff, few or no programs and in-frequent and pre-announced visits by State regulators. California's Licensed Psychiatric Technicians are not '''anti-''community'''\u2014in fact, we actively advocate for group-home placements when it is in the clients' best inter-ests and is what they and their families wish. However, when taken as a whole, how is having more space, more programs both on and off the center campus, higher regulatory standards and a whole community of professionals there to help Ameri-cans enjoy the healthiest, happiest and most active life possible necessarily ''more restrictive?'' END THE PARADOX : STOP FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON FEDERAL CHOICES On behalf of CAPT and its dedicated professional membership, I wish to respect- fully request that the Subcommittee and Congress as a whole end the use of Federal 427 appropriations to discourage, downsize and close federally regulated developmental centers (''ICF/DDs and ICF/MRs'') throughout the country. It is the legal and moral choice and right for people with developmental disabilities and their loved ones to make decisions on their individual residential, service and support needs, and the choice of federally regulated developmental centers and related congregate settings should remain an option for them. Our Federal Government should not play a role in restricting or eliminating any viable, recognized and desired option for Americans with developmental disabilities. [This statement was submitted by Juan Nolasco, PT, State President, California Association of Psychiatric Technicians.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STATE HOSPITAL PARENT COUNCILS FOR THE RETARDED Dear Chairman Harkin and Members of the Subcommittee: The California Asso- ciation of State Hospital Parent Councils for the Retarded (CASHPCR) represents the families, friends, and advocates of loved ones living at Porterville Developmental Center and Fairview Developmental Center. As President of CASHPCR, a healthcare professional, and the sister of someone with a developmental disability, I am writing to urge the Senate Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), Education and Related Agencies to pro-hibit the use of Federal HHS appropriations in support of deinstitutionalization ac-tivities which evict, without regard to individual choice, eligible individuals with in-tellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) from their HHS-licensed and funded homes. The ability of our family members and others with developmental disabilities to achieve their full potential is greatly dependent upon the services and supports that they receive, including housing, medical care, and developmental programs. The homes licensed and funded by HHS are an important option for many individuals\u2014 in some cases, the only option. VOR, a national nonprofit organization advocating for high quality care and human rights for all people with I/DD, has submitted written testimony for the record with this same request. I support VOR's testimony and request. [This statement was submitted by Theresa DeBell, R.N., California Association of State Hospital Parent Councils for the Retarded.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION COALITION The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Coalition is a nonpartisan coalition of more than 140 organizations committed to strengthening our Nation's prevention programs. We represent millions of public health workers, clinicians, re-searchers, educators and citizens served by CDC programs. We believe Congress should support CDC as an agency, not just the individual programs that it funds. Given the challenges and burdens of chronic disease and disability, public health emergencies, new and reemerging infectious diseases and other unmet public health needs, we urge a funding level of $7.8 billion for CDC's programs in fiscal year 2015. We appreciate some of the important new investments in President Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal including those for prescrip-tion drug overdose prevention, antimicrobial resistance and global health security; however, under the president's proposal, CDC's budget would be cut by nearly $243 million compared to fiscal year 2014. CDC's budget authority under the president's budget is lower than fiscal year 2003 levels. State and local health departments con-tinue to operate on tight budgets and with a smaller workforce, losing more than 50,000 public health jobs since 2008. These cuts will reduce the ability of CDC and its State and local grantees to investigate and respond to public health emergencies, ensure adequate immunization rates and track environmental hazards. CDC is a key source of funding and technical assistance for State and local pro- grams that aim to improve the health of communities. CDC funding provides the foundation for State and local public health departments, supporting a trained workforce, laboratory capacity and public health education communications systems. CDC serves as the command center for our Nation's public health defense system, conducting surveillance and detection of emerging and reemerging infectious dis-eases. With the potential onset of a worldwide influenza pandemic, in addition to the many other natural and man-made threats that exist in the modern world, CDC 428 is the Nation's expert resource and response center, coordinating communications and action and serving as the laboratory reference center for identifying, testing and characterizing potential agents of biological, chemical and radiological terrorism, emerging infectious diseases and other public health emergencies. CDC serves as the lead agency for bioterrorism and public health emergency preparedness and must receive sustained support for its preparedness programs to meet future chal-lenges. We urge you to provide adequate funding for CDC's emergency preparedness and response activities. Heart disease is the Nation's No. 1 killer. In 2010, over 597,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, accounting for nearly 25 percent of all U.S. deaths. More males than females died of heart disease in 2010, while more females than males died of stroke that year. Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and is a leading cause of disability. In 2010, more than 129,000 people died of stroke, accounting for about one of every 19 deaths. CDC's Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program, WISEWOMAN, and the Million Hearts program work to improve cardiovascular health. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. More than1.6 mil- lion new cancer cases and 585,720 deaths from cancer are expected in 2014. In 2009 the overall cost for cancer in the U.S. was more than $216.6 billion: $86.6 billion for direct medical costs, $130 billion for indirect mortality costs. CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program helps millions of low-income, uninsured and medically underserved women gain access to lifesaving breast and cervical cancer screenings and provides a gateway to treatment upon diagnosis. CDC also funds grants to all 50 States to develop comprehensive cancer control plans, bringing together a broad partnership of public and private stakeholders to set joint priorities and implement specific cancer prevention and control activities customized to address each State's particular needs. An estimated 443,000 people die prematurely every year due to tobacco use. CDC's Office of Smoking and Health funds important programs and campaigns to prevent tobacco addiction and to help those who want to quit. We must continue to support these vital programs to reduce the enormous health and economic costs of tobacco use in the U.S. Of the 25.8 million Americans who have diabetes, nearly 7 million cases are undiagnosed. In 2010, about 1.9 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, nontrau-matic lower-limb amputations, and new cases of blindness among adults in the U.S. The total direct and indirect costs associated with diabetes were $245 billion in 2012. The Division of Diabetes Translation funds critical diabetes prevention, sur-veillance and control programs. Obesity prevalence in the U.S. remains high. While the obesity rates among chil- dren between the ages of 2-5 have significantly decreased over the past decade, more than one-third of adults are obese and 17 percent of children are obese. Obe-sity, diet and inactivity are cross-cutting risk factors that contribute significantly to heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes. CDC funds programs to encourage the consumption of fruits and vegetables, encourage sufficient exercise and develop other habits of healthy nutrition and physical activity. Arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the U.S., striking more than 52 million Americans of all ages, races and ethnicities. CDC's Arthritis Program plays a critical role in addressing this growing public health crisis and working to improve the quality of life for individuals affected by arthritis. CDC provides national leadership in helping control the HIV epidemic by working with community, State, national, and international partners in surveillance, re-search, prevention and evaluation activities. CDC estimates that about 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV, 16 percent of who are undiagnosed. The number of people living with HIV is increasing as new drug therapies are keeping HIV-infected persons healthy longer and dramatically reducing the death rate. Prevention of HIV transmission is the best defense against the AIDS epidemic that has already killed more than 636,000 in the U.S. and is devastating populations around the globe. The U.S. has the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases in the industri- alized world. Nearly 20 million new infections occur each year. CDC estimates that STDs, including HIV, cost the U.S. healthcare system almost $16 billion annually. An adequate investment in CDC's STD prevention programs could save millions in annual healthcare costs in the future. The National Center for Health Statistics collects data on chronic disease preva- lence, health disparities, emergency room use, teen pregnancy, infant mortality and causes of death. The health data collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-veillance System, Youth Risk Behavior Survey, Youth Tobacco Survey, National Vital Statistics System, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey are 429 an essential part of the Nation's statistical and public health infrastructure and must be adequately funded. CDC oversees immunization programs for children, adolescents and adults, and is a global partner in the ongoing effort to eradicate polio worldwide. Influenza vac-cination levels remain low for adults. Levels are substantially lower for pneumo-coccal vaccination among adults as well, with significant racial and ethnic dispari-ties in vaccination levels persisting among the elderly. Childhood immunizations provide one of the best returns on investment of any public health program. For every dollar spent on childhood vaccines to prevent thirteen diseases, $10.20 is saved in direct and indirect costs. An estimated 20 million cases of disease and 42,000 deaths are prevented each year through timely immunization. Injuries are the leading causes of death for people ages 1-44. Unintentional inju- ries and violence, such as older adult falls, prescription drug overdose, child mal-treatment and sexual violence, account for approximately 29 percent of emergency department visits each year. Annually, injury and violence cost the U.S. approxi-mately $406 billion in direct and indirect medical costs. The National Center for In-jury Prevention and Control works to prevent injuries and minimize their con-sequences by researching the problem, identifying the risk and protective factors, developing and testing interventions and ensuring widespread adoption of proven prevention strategies. Birth defects affect one in 33 babies and are a leading cause of infant death in the U.S. Children with birth defects who survive often experience lifelong physical and mental disabilities. Over 500,000 children are diagnosed with a developmental disability and more than 50 million people in the U.S. currently live with a dis-ability. The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities con-ducts important programs to prevent birth defects and developmental disabilities and promote the health of people living with disabilities and blood disorders. The National Center for Environmental Health works to protect public health by helping to control asthma, protecting from threats associated with natural disasters and climate change and reducing exposure to lead and other environmental hazards. To ensure it can carry out these vital programs, we ask you to support and restore adequate funding for NCEH. In order to meet the many ongoing public health challenges outlined above, we urge you to support our fiscal year 2015 request of $7.8 billion for CDC's programs. [This statement was submitted by Donald Hoppert, Director, Government Rela- tions, American Public Health Association.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CHILDREN 'SENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH NETWORK The Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN or the Network) is pleased to have this opportunity to submit testimony on fiscal year 2015 appropriations for the following programs and activities that safeguard the health and future of all of our children: \u2014Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ($7.8 billion), especially the Na- tional Center for Environmental Health ($181.1 million) and its programs, in-cluding: \u2014Healthy Homes and Lead Poisoning Prevention Program ($29 million) \u2014National Asthma Control Program ($28 million) \u2014National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program ($40 million) \u2014National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) ($717.7 million), especially the Children's Environmental Health Research Centers ($33 million) \u2014Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSUs) ($2 million) The Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN) was created more than 20 years ago by concerned pediatricians and researchers with a goal of protecting the developing child from environmental health hazards and to promote a healthy envi-ronment. Today's children are facing the distressing possibility that they may be the first generation to see a shorter life expectancy than their parents due to poor health. Key contributors to this trend are the modern pediatric epidemics of obesity, asth-ma, learning disabilities, and autism. For all of these conditions, the child's environ-ment plays a role in causing, contributing to or mitigating these chronic conditions. 430 1Trasande, Liu Y. ''Reducing The Staggering Costs Of Environmental Disease In Children, Estimated At $76.6 Billion In 2008, Health Affairs. No. (2011): doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1239. The estimated costs of environmental disease in children (such as lead poisoning, childhood cancer, and asthma) were $76.6 billion in 2008.1 Investments in programs that protect and promote children's health will be repaid by healthier children with brighter futures. Additionally, protecting our children\u2014those born as well as those yet to be born\u2014 from environmental hazards is truly a national security issue. When we protect chil-dren from harmful chemicals in their environment, we help to assure that they will reach their full potential. We have a responsibility to our Nation's children, and to the Nation that they will someday lead, to provide them with a healthy environ-ment. American competitiveness depends on having healthy, educated children who grow up to be healthy productive adults. Thus it is vital that the Federal programs and activities that protect children from environmental hazards receive adequate re-sources. We strongly urge the Committee to support and expand children's environ-mental health programs. Key programs in your jurisdiction deserving your support include: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) As the Nation's leader in public health promotion and disease prevention, the CDC should receive top priority in Federal funding. CDC continues to be faced with unprecedented challenges and responsibilities. CEHN applauds your support for CDC in past years and urges you to support a funding level of $7.8 billion for CDC's core programs in fiscal year 2015. The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) is particularly important in protecting the environmental health of young children. Current research is uncov-ering the extensive role that environment plays in human health and development. As a result, NCEH partners with public health agencies and a wide range of other organizations to bring their expertise and support to an expanding scope of environ-mental-human health challenges. NCEH's programs are key national assets. Yet in recent years, NCEH funding has been drastically cut. We urge the Subcommittee to at least restore NCEH to its fiscal year 2010 funding level of $181.1 million. We were deeply concerned with the fiscal year 2012 gutting of the Healthy Homes and Lead Poisoning Prevention Program and we commend you for the substantial increase the program received in fiscal year 2014. This program helps to prevent lead poisoning and helps children who have already been exposed to lead. Much more needs to be done just to return it to fiscal year 2011 levels. Millions of Amer-ican children remain at risk of lead poisoning and need this program, which sup-ports effective local and State efforts. As evidence increasingly demonstrates no safe level of lead exposure for children, this funding is all the more essential. We join with the National Safe and Healthy Housing Coalition to urge a funding level of $29 million in fiscal year 2015. NCEH's National Asthma Control Program not only has greatly increased data collection about this rampant epidemic but it also encourages States to use evi- dence-based approaches to reduce costs and improve outcomes for people living with asthma. Asthma is an epidemic in the U.S., affecting 10 percent of our Nation's chil-dren. We urge the Committee to fund this vital program at $28 million in fiscal year 2015. Public health officials need integrated health and environmental data so that they can protect the public's health. The CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program helps to track environmental hazards and the diseases they may cause and to coordinate and integrate local, State and Federal health agencies' col-lection of critical health and environmental data. Participation in the tracking net-work development will decline under further cuts and erase the progress we have made across the country to better link data with public health action. National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) NIEHS is the leading institute conducting research to understand how the envi- ronment influences human health. Unlike other NIH Institutes focused on one dis-ease or one body system, NIEHS is charged with all diseases, all human health and body systems, as they are affected by the environment\u2014a vital and monumental charge. NIEHS plays a critical role in our efforts to understand how to protect chil-dren, whether it is identifying and understanding the immediate impact of chemical substances or understanding childhood exposures that may not affect health until decades later. CEHN recommends that $717.7 million be provided for NIEHS' fiscal year 2015 budget. 431 Children's Environmental Health Research Centers of Excellence The Children's Environmental Health & Disease Prevention Research Centers, jointly funded by the NIEHS and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and located at research institutions across the Nation, play a vital role in providing the scientific basis for protecting children from environmental hazards. With their modest budgets, these centers are generating invaluable research. For example, these centers conducted the recent research that found links between prenatal expo- sures to either a common air pollutant or a common pesticide to lower IQs and poor-er working memory at age 7. Several Centers have established longitudinal cohorts, which in some cases are more than 10 years old. The ability to look for linkages between exposures and health outcomes in infants, toddlers, and, now, adolescents, is vital. If these cohorts are disbanded due to funding cuts, at best it will take years and untold resources before it is possible to replicate them. Few if any longitudinal cohort studies on ado-lescents, puberty and environmental exposures exist. The Network is concerned that inadequate funding may result in the loss of these valuable cohorts. We urge the Subcommittee to support these centers at $33 million in fiscal year 2015. Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSUs) form a valuable re- source network for parents and clinicians around the Nation. They are funded joint-ly by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the EPA with a very modest budget. PEHSU professionals provide medical consultation to healthcare professionals from individual cases of exposure to advice regarding large- scale community issues. PEHSUs also provide information and resources to school, child care, health and medical, and community groups and help inform policymakers by providing data and background on local or regional environmental health issues and implications for specific populations or areas. We urge the Subcommittee to fully fund ATSDR's portion of this program in fiscal year 2015. In conclusion, our Nation's future will depend upon its future leaders. Protecting children from harmful chemicals in their environment will result in healthier chil-dren with brighter futures, an outcome we can all support. Thank you for the oppor-tunity to testify. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CHILDREN 'SHOSPITAL ASSOCIATION The Children's Hospital Association advances child health through innovation in the quality, cost and delivery of care. Representing more than 220 children's hos-pitals, the Association is the voice of children's hospitals nationally. As institutions dedicated to protecting and advancing the health of America's children, we thank the Subcommittee for its longstanding bipartisan support of the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education program (CHGME). CHGME is an essential investment in our children's healthcare\u2014in promoting prevention and primary care, expanding healthcare for vulnerable and underserved children, and ensuring access to care for all children. The Children's Hospitals Asso-ciation urges the Subcommittee to protect this important program and provide $300 million in funding for CHGME in fiscal year 2015. The CHGME program protects children's access to high-quality medical care by providing independent children's hospitals with funding to support the training of pediatric providers, much as Medicare supports training in adult teaching hospitals. CHGME funding has had a tremendous impact, enabling children's hospitals to in-crease their overall training by more than 45 percent since the program began in 1999. In addition, the CHGME program has accounted for more than 74 percent of the growth in the number of new pediatric subspecialists being trained nationwide. Today, the 55 hospitals that receive CHGME, less than 1 percent of all hospitals, train over 6,000 residents annually, and 49 percent of all pediatric residents in the country, including 45 percent of general pediatricians and 51 percent of pediatric specialists. CHGME benefits all children, supporting the training of doctors who go on to care for children living in every State\u2014in cities, rural communities, suburbs and everywhere in between. Furthermore, CHGME is an example of a well-func-tioning public-private partnership; each of the participating children's hospitals in-vests significant resources into the success of their training programs along with the Federal dollars they receive. Since the program's beginning, CHGME has enjoyed strong, bipartisan support in Congress, under both Republican and Democratic leadership. Congress created CHGME because it recognized that the absence of dedicated GME support for inde-pendent children's teaching hospitals created gaps in the training of pediatric pro-432 viders, which potentially threatened access to care for children. At that time, inde- pendent children's hospitals were effectively left out of Federal GME support pro-vided through Medicare because children's hospitals treat children and not the el-derly, and received less than 0.5 percent of the GME support of other teaching hos-pitals. CHGME has helped close the gap, but support for training of pediatric providers in children's hospitals still lags significantly behind Medicare support for graduate medical education. Analysis commissioned by the Children's Hospitals Association shows that in 2014 CHGME provides children's hospitals, on a per-resident basis, about 45 percent of the support Medicare provides to adult teaching hospitals. Continued funding is essential to maintaining the gains that have been achieved under CHGME and strengthening the pediatric workforce pipeline. While much has been achieved, much remains to be done, as serious shortages persist in many pedi-atric specialties. The shortages affect children and their families' ability to receive timely, appropriate care, including surgery. Children's hospital clinics use a two- week benchmark when scheduling non-emergency appointments, but certain pedi-atric specialties experiencing physician shortages have wait times of 14.5 weeks or more, far exceeding the two-week standard. Unfortunately, funding for the CHGME program has been significantly reduced in recent years, from $317.5 million in fiscal year 2010 to $265 million in 2014, a 17 percent reduction. These cuts hurt the ability of children's hospitals to train enough pediatricians and pediatric specialists to keep up with growing demand at local, State and national levels. Furthermore, there are no adequate substitutes for CHGME. Other potential sources of support, such as Medicaid GME or competitive grants, are not available to many children's hospitals and cannot come close to supporting training on the scale necessary to meet workforce needs. Failing to adequately support CHGME would take us back to the same flawed system that was not meeting the needs of America's children. The White House's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes eliminating funding for CHGME and incorporating support for training at children's hospitals into a new competitive grant program under the Health Resources and Services Administration (the program would have to be created by Congress), funded from Medicare trust fund dollars, with $100 million set aside specifically for children's hospitals in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016. While we recognize that the White House includes funding for training in children's hospitals in the budget, the administration's pro-posal continues to underfund pediatric training. Furthermore, children's hospitals have strong concerns that replacing the current system with competitive grants that are limited in duration puts at risk the gains that have been made for children's health under CHGME. Children's hospitals welcome the idea of engaging with the administration and Congress on ways to strengthen the pediatric workforce for the future. In the present, however, financial support for GME in children's hospitals needs to be uninterrupted and undiminished. We recognize that the current budget climate is extraordinarily challenging and that Congress has a responsibility to carefully consider the Nation's spending prior-ities. However, now is not the time to take a step backwards in pediatric medicine. The CHGME program is critical to protecting gains in pediatric health and ensuring access to care for children nationwide. We respectfully request that the Subcommittee continue its history of bipartisan support for the CHGME program and include $300 million in funding in the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS appropriations bill for this vital program. The Children's Hospital Association, and the children and families we serve, thank you for your past support for this critical program and your leadership in pro-tecting children's health. The Children's Hospital Association advances child health through innovation in the quality, cost and delivery of care. Representing more than 220 children's hos-pitals, the Association is the voice of children's hospitals nationally. The Association champions public policies that enable hospitals to better serve children and is the premier resource for pediatric data and analytics, driving improved clinical and operational performance of member hospitals. Formed in 2011, Children's Hospital Association brings together the strengths and talents of three organizations: Child Health Corporation of America (CHCA), National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI) and National Association of Children's Hospitals (N.A.C.H.). The Children's Hospital Association has offices in Washington, DC, and Overland Park, KS. 433 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COALITION FOR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE Chairman Harkin and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for your time and your consideration of the priorities of the clinical and translational research community as you work to craft the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill. The community would like to thank you for your past support of the full spectrum of medical research. ABOUT THE COALITION FOR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE Coalition for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) is the unified voice of the clinical and translational science research community. CCTS is a nationwide, grass-roots network of dedicated individuals who work together to educate Congress and the Administration about the value and importance of Federal clinical and translational research and research training and career development activities. CCTS's goals are to ensure that the full spectrum of medical research is adequately funded, the next generation of researchers is well-prepared, and the regulatory and public policy environment facilitates ongoing expansion and advancement of the field of clinical and translational science. Association for Clinical and Translational Science (ACTS) ACTS supports investigations that continually improve team science, integrating multiple disciplines across the full translational science spectrum: from population based and policy research, through patient oriented and human subject clinical re-search, to basic discovery. Our goal is to improve the efficiency with which health needs inform research and new therapies reach the public. ACTS is the academic home for the disciplines of research education, training, and career development for the full spectrum of translational scientists. Through meetings, publications, and collaborative efforts, ACTS will provide a forum for members to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of research education pro-grams. ACTS provides a strong voice to advocate for translational science, clinical re- search, patient oriented research, and research education support. We will engage at the local, State, and Federal levels and coordinate efforts with other professional organizations. ACTS will promote investigations and dissemination of effective models for men- toring future generations of translational scientists. Through collaborative efforts, ACTS will provide a forum for members to share studies, promote best practices, and optimize professional relationships among trainees and mentors. The Clinical Research Forum (CRF) CRF was formed in 1996 to discuss unique and complex challenges to clinical re- search in academic health centers. Over the past decade, it has convened leaders in clinical research annually and has provided a forum for discussing common issues and interests in the full spectrum of research. Through its activities, the Forum has enabled sharing of best clinical practices and increasingly has played a national ad-vocacy role in support of the boarder interests and needs of clinical research. Governed by a Board of Directors constituted of clinical researchers from thirteen member institutions, CRF has grown to sixty members from academia, industry, and volunteer health organizations. CRF engages leaders in the clinical research en-terprise including leaders from government, foundations, other not-for-profit organi-zations, and industry in addressing the challenges and opportunities facing the clin-ical research enterprise. Parallel with our widening focus upon the broad needs of the entire national clin- ical research enterprise, CRF is committed to working in those areas where it is uniquely positioned to have a significant impact. Collaboration with other organiza-tions with similar goals and synergizing with their efforts strengthens all ap-proaches to the issues facing clinical research. SEQUESTRATION Thank you for providing sequestration relief in fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015. Federal medical research programs form the cornerstone of our Nation's biotech sector. In addition to undermining active and emerging research projects, across the board funding cuts create widespread disruption. Due to a number of factors, this disruption compounds significant challenges facing the clinical and translational re-search training and career development pipeline. 434 Recent years of near-level funding have curtailed NIH's ability to issue funding opportunities. As a result, the pay line at NIH has decreased substantially while the average age of an investigator receiving their first award has increased signifi-cantly. This dynamic creates a strong disincentive for young people to pursue a ca-reer in this field. Prior to sequestration, NIH would often discuss the decline in young investigators entering the research training and career development pipeline. Beyond public health, our country needs to ensure that we are adequately pre- paring the next generation of medical investigators for reasons related to both the economy and national security. Last year, China announced a $300 billion 5-year investment in medical research; this amount is double the current NIH budget over the same period of time. With strong competition from foreign countries, we run the risk of a researcher brain-drain from the U.S. to other Nations. Scientific break-throughs and innovation will continue, but our loss in this area will mean gains for other Nations. Foreign economies will benefit from the significant return-on-invest-ment that occurs through robust support of research. Sequestration has the potential to severely exacerbate an already difficult task of recruiting and training the next generation of scientific investigators. In order to en-sure that the U.S. maintains a strong research training and career development pipeline, please eliminate the threat of sequestration and further support key activi-ties. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH This Nation has a proud history as a global leader in medical research and bio- technology. This leadership has provided our country with cutting-edge patient care, high-quality jobs, and meaningful economic growth. The Milliken Institute recently calculated that every dollar invested in NIH returns about a $1.70 in economic out-put in the short term and as much as $3.20 long-term. Crucially, through a robust external research program, NIH resources flow out to the States where the benefit of the funding infusion is felt on the local level. NIH's impact on public health has been profound. Conditions once considered a death-sentence can now be managed, survival rates for patients with life-threat-ening diseases have increased dramatically, and additional innovative therapies and diagnostic tools come to market each year. NIH has been successful, but much more can be done. Please provide NIH with at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 so on-going research projects can be adequately supported and new research activities can be initiated. Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) NIH's CTSA Program, which is housed within the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), is transforming the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical and translational research. Since its establishment with 13 centers, the CTSA program has expanded to 62 medical research institutions located across the country. These centers are linked together and work in concert to improve human health by energizing the research and training environment to innovate and en-hance the quality of clinical and translational research. Last year, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a review of the CTSA pro- gram. The report entitled, The CTSA Program at NIH: Opportunities for Advancing Clinical and Translational Research, spoke favorably of the CTSA effort and made the following recommendations to improve the program: (1) Strengthen NCATS leadership of the CTSA program, (2) reconfigure and streamline the CTSA Consortium, (3) build on the strengths of individual CTSAs across the spectrum of clinical and translational research, (4) formalize and stand-ardize evaluation processes for individual CTSAs and the CTSA Program, (5) ad-vance innovation in education and training programs, (6) ensure community engage-ment in all phases of research, (7) strengthen clinical and translational research rel-evant to child health. CCTS supports the recommendations of the IOM report and the organization is hopeful these changes will be implemented quickly. Further, when the CTSA pro-gram was authorized, Congress indicated that the consortium would be considered fully-funded when it received an annual appropriation of $750 million. For fiscal year 2015, as part of an overall funding increase for NIH, please provide CTSAs with at least $500 million to ensure the program can continue to grow and advance. Additionally, we hope you will continue working over the coming years to provide CTSAs with $750 million to fully fund the program and establish a robust home for clinical and translational research. 435 Additional Programs In recent years, Congress and NIH have made important investments to support the full spectrum of medical research. Key clinical and translational research pro-grams at NIH include Research Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI), Institu-tional Development Awards (IDeA), and the new Accelerating Medicine Partnership (AMP). Supporting the full spectrum of medical research encourages outcomes-ori-ented investigation where breakthroughs in basic science are translated to new di-agnostic tools and treatments that improve health and lower healthcare expenses. In recognition of the future of the overall field of medical research, most individual NIH Institutes and Centers now provide some level of support for translational and clinical research activities. In order to ensure that clinical and translational research programs at NIH have adequate support to facilitate ongoing growth, please provide $32 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2015 with proportional increases for individual Institutes, Centers, and Offices. FEDERAL RESEARCH TRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS As we discussed previously, the future of our Nation's biomedical research enter- prise relies heavily on the maintenance and continued recruitment of promising young investigators. The ''T'' and ''K'' series awards at NIH and AHRQ provide much-needed support for the career development of young investigators. As clinical and translational medicine takes on increasing importance, there is a great need to grow these programs. Career development grants are crucial to the recruitment of promising young investigators, as well as to the continuing education of established investigators. Reduced commitment to the K and T awards would have a dev-astating impact on our pool of highly trained clinical researchers. CCTS urges you to support the ongoing commitment to research training through adequate funding for T and K series awards and a meaningful fiscal year 2015 funding increase for AHRQ. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views and recommendations of the clinical and translational research and research training and career development community. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COALITION FOR USHER SYNDROME RESEARCH My name is Mark Dunning from the State of Massachusetts. As Chairman of the Coalition for Usher Syndrome Research, I am here on behalf of the Usher syndrome community to respectfully request this committee encourage NIH to prioritize re-search that will eventually expand treatment options for individuals suffering from the severe hearing and vision loss related to Usher syndrome. We also respectfully request that the committee direct NIH to move expeditiously to direct additional re-sources to respond to any deficiencies in the funding level or the manner in which various ICs coordinate on common goals and objectives related to Usher syndrome. Usher syndrome is the leading cause of deaf-blindness. In the United States, it is estimated that about 45,000 people have this rare genetic disorder. My fifteen year old daughter Bella is one of them. She has Usher syndrome type 1b. She was born profoundly deaf and now she is losing her vision to retinitis pigmentosa. She also suffers from the severe balance issues common in her type of Usher syndrome. Imagine yourself as a fifteen year old girl. Adulthood stands before you. You dream of getting your driver's license, of the freedom it provides, of the limits it re-moves. We live in a small town. There is no public transportation. A car is the only way to get to work, to visit friends, to shop for food. But Bella's vision is too poor for driving. How will she survive? Or imagine yourself as a sophomore in high school. You dream of college, of the freedom it provides, of the limitless career opportunities. Only hard work and desire stand between you and your dreams. Unless, like Bella, you have Usher syndrome. Then you also face the barriers of access to information. You cannot hear the pro-fessor or see the board as well as your peers. You work many times harder to get the same grades. And some trades are closed to you before you start. Can you be an architect if you are losing your vision? Can you be a salesperson if you have no hearing? Can you dare to dream of an unfettered future? Is the American dream available to you if you have Usher syndrome? My daughter is an asset to this country. She is kind and empathetic. She puts all others before herself. She is hard working and fearless. She has been honored with a John F. Kennedy award for leadership and a StayClassy award for philan-thropy. She is the type of fifteen year old we should be grooming as a future leader in the country. 436 1Wittenborn, John S. & Rein, David B. ''Cost of Vision Problems: The Economic Burden of Vision Loss and Eye Disorders in the United States.'' NORC at the University of Chicago. Pre-pared for Prevent Blindness America, Chicago, IL. June 11, 2013. http://costofvision.preventblindness.org. But Bella has Usher syndrome. She was born profoundly deaf and she is going blind. She will fight it every step of the way, but without increased Federal funding, she will eventually lose. And when Bella loses, we all lose. Kids like Bella are our future. Unless they have Usher syndrome. Then they are not, and we are all the worse for it. People with Usher syndrome share the same range of intelligence and work ethic as any other slice of America. Yet they suffer from an 82 percent unemployment rate. People with Usher syndrome are born with the same emotional strength as any other American. Yet they have a suicide rate that is 2 12times greater than the general population. People with Usher syndrome not only have the capacity to con-tribute to America's future, they thirst for it. They want to be active members of society. Yet our country spends an estimated $139 billion annually in direct and in-direct costs for people with eye disorders and vision loss. 1That doesn't even include the costs associated with hearing impairment. In my role as the Chairman of the Coalition for Usher Syndrome Research, I have spoken with or met hundreds of people who are determined, focused, and working everyday to help themselves, their loved one, or in some cases complete strangers, figure out how to treat this syndrome. Usher genes are complex, long protein cells which require significant investment in research if we are ever to find a cure or treatment. We can't do it alone. Through the Coalition, we have brought the Usher community and researchers to- gether by: \u2014Establishing a registry of individuals with Usher syndrome which is available for research or clinical trials at no cost. Our registry currently has families from each of the 50 States and 29 countries. \u2014Sponsoring an International Symposium on Usher Syndrome at the Harvard Medical School in July 2014 to develop a roadmap for future research projects to bring us closer to viable clinical trials. \u2014Sponsoring annual family conferences, webinars and monthly conferences that provide information and support to all of those living with Usher. With this in place, we have begun bringing brilliant researchers together who are working on developing treatments every day. Researchers like those in Oregon and Pennsylvania who are working on gene therapy treatments, one of which began clin-ical trials last year. Researchers in Louisiana, who have been able to rescue the hearing in mice with Usher syndrome using a drug therapy that holds promise for rescuing vision as well. Researchers in Iowa, California, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, and many other States, who are collaborating with each other and with families through the Coalition to advance all kinds of Usher syndrome re-search. But still this is not enough. We cannot help any of the tens of thousands who have Usher, or countless others that will be born in the future with this devastating genetic disorder without Federal support. There are dozens of different mutations that cause Usher syndrome, and the pace of research is slowed dramatically by the lack of researchers and funding. The infrastructure is there to find treatments, but the significant financial support is not. We are asking you to supply this last critical resource to help us find a cure. When you review the report on categorical spending by the NIH, Usher syndrome is not even listed. Rare diseases with similar incident rates average around $50 mil-lion annually. These investments have resulted in significant discoveries for these diseases and there is reason to believe that we can see these same results or better for Usher syndrome. We do not ask that the committee throw dollars at the prob-lem. Only that they ensure the appropriate funding is available. The researchers are there, waiting to discover what now is just a dream. All we are asking for is a chance; a chance for deaf children and adults who are going blind, a chance to see. With your help, my daughter and others like her can once again dare to dream. I will leave you with the words of America's most famous deaf-blind person, Helen Keller. ''Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.'' Only together can we find a way to end deaf-blindness. I thank you on behalf of all those with Usher syndrome, their families, and most importantly to me, my daughter Bella. [This statement was submitted by Mark Dunning, Chairman, Coalition for Usher Syndrome Research.] 437 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COALITION OF NORTHEASTERN GOVERNORS The Coalition of Northeastern Governors (CONEG) is pleased to share with the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agen-cies its views regarding the fiscal year 2015 appropriations for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The CONEG Governors appreciate the Subcommittee's long-standing support for this vital program, and recognize the difficult fiscal decisions that face the Sub-committee. In recognition of the on-going challenges that the most vulnerable low- income households in our region face in heating their homes, the Governors urge the Subcommittee to fund the LIHEAP core block program in fiscal year 2015 at the authorized level of $5.1 billion but not less than $4.7 billion. In addition, the Governors request sufficient contingency funds to address unforeseen energy emer-gencies such as prolonged severe weather or price spikes in home heating fuels. Adequate, predictable and timely Federal funding is essential for LIHEAP to pro-vide a vital lifeline to those households struggling to afford the basic necessity of home energy. The Governors urge the Subcommittee to provide these funds in a manner consistent with the LIHEAP statutory objective: ''to assist low-income households, particularly those with the lowest incomes that pay a high proportion of household income for home energy, primarily in meeting their immediate home energy needs.'' LIHEAP funds are targeted to those households with the greatest energy burden. Most LIHEAP assistance is targeted to households whose income is less than 150 percent of the Federal poverty level, which for a two-person household is $23,595 in 2014. However the majority of LIHEAP recipients have incomes far below that level. Many of these households live on fixed incomes and are not likely to benefit from improvements in the job market and the national economy. More than ninety percent of LIHEAP households have at least one vulnerable member\u2014the elderly or disabled and young children\u2014for whom temperature extremes could have serious health and safety consequences. Approximately 20 percent of LIHEAP households contain at least one member who is a military veteran. Low-income households across the Nation spend a disproportionate amount of their income on home energy, often over three times more than non-low-income households. The AARP estimates low-income senior households (age 65 and older) heating with fuel oil will spend almost 20 percent of household income on heating costs, while all other households heating with fuel oil will spend roughly 5 percent of their income to heat their homes. In the colder climates of the Northeast, the av-erage household typically uses 800 gallons of heating oil per winter. At EIA's pro-jected average cost of $3.83 per gallon, an elderly LIHEAP recipient whose primary income is a Social Security check would need to spend almost 3 months of income to heat her home this winter. Many seniors will spend more than one-third of their monthly income just to get the minimum 100-gallon delivery of heating oil. The energy burden faced by low-income households is particularly acute in the Northeast. This region experiences some of the Nation's highest home heating bills due to a combination of the extended winter heating season and heating fuel ex-penditures that typically exceed national averages. According to the Energy Infor-mation Administration (EIA), the average consumer expenditures for heating fuels in the Northeast have consistently and significantly exceeded similar expenditures in all other regions regardless of the type of fuel used\u2014natural gas, heating oil, pro-pane, or electricity. Low-income households in the Northeast experience another aspect of ''energy burden''. More than any other region of the country, Northeast households are de-pendent upon delivered fuels\u2014heating oil, propane and kerosene. The 30 percent of Northeast households that rely upon delivered fuels account for approximately 80 percent of the homes nationwide that use home heating oil. These heating fuels are also the most expensive and volatile in price. The EIA estimates that households using heating oil can expect to pay $2,243 to keep warm this winter. The EIA also finds that households using delivered fuels see any change in wholesale prices re-flected in their energy bills almost immediately, unlike natural gas and electricity retail customers. These ''delivered fuel'' households experience another vulnerability compared to natural gas and electricity customers. Low-income households that use delivered fuels are less likely to have the option of payment plans, access to utility assistance programs, and the protection of utility service shut-off moratoria during the heating season. If LIHEAP funds are not available to these households, the fuel delivery truck simply does not come. The Northeast has some of the country's oldest homes and coldest climates. Re- ducing home energy costs presents unique challenges to northeast states. State LIHEAP programs, often working with their Weatherization Assistance Programs, 438 help low-income households take steps to reduce their energy use and lower their energy bills. Unlike the Federal weatherization program, LIHEAP funds can be used to provide repair or replace inefficient, unsafe and non-working home heating systems\u2014improvements that enhance the safety and reduce the energy use of low- income households. Even with these programs to reduce energy use, many of the lowest income fami- lies that benefit from LIHEAP have limited options to reduce their energy bills. Some older homes, especially older manufactured homes, have structural issues that make them ineligible for weatherization assistance. Throughout the region, many LIHEAP households have limited ability to switch to more energy efficient heating systems due to the lack of adequate resources for the upfront costs and the lack of access to less expensive heating fuels. For example, natural gas may provide a less expensive energy source to heat homes, but conversion is neither simple nor afford-able for low-income households. The New England Fuel Institute estimates that con-verting a complete home heating system from oil to natural gas can cost as much as $10,000. In addition, homes in rural and metropolitan areas throughout the Northeast are not served by natural gas infrastructure. State LIHEAP programs continue to seek innovative and efficient ways to ''do more with less'' and stretch scarce LIHEAP dollars to ensure that meaningful as-sistance can be provided to those households with the greatest needs. For example, LIHEAP funds are frequently leveraged by utility assistance programs for low-in-come households. States in the Northeast have worked with utilities to develop pay-ment plans to reduce arrearages and lessen the prospect of utility shut-offs after the heating season ends. They have negotiated with fuel dealers to receive discounts on deliverable fuels, and have entered into agreements to purchase fuel in the summer when prices are lowest. LIHEAP is one of the most efficiently run programs with low overhead costs. Even after taking significant cost-cutting steps, States have had to take actions such as tightening program eligibility, closing the program early, and reducing benefit levels. In summary, the CONEG Governors appreciate the Subcommittee's continued support for LIHEAP, and urge you to fund the core block grant at the authorized level of $5.1 billion, but not less than $4.7 billion, and sufficient contingency funds to address unforeseen energy emergencies. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COLLEGE ON PROBLEMS OF DRUG DEPENDENCE Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the Subcommittee in support of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD), a membership organization with over 1000 members, has been in existence since 1929. It is the longest standing group in the United States addressing problems of drug depend-ence and abuse. The organization serves as an interface among governmental, in-dustrial and academic communities maintaining liaisons with regulatory and re-search agencies as well as educational, treatment, and prevention facilities in the drug abuse field. CPDD also often works in collaboration with the World Health Or-ganization. Recognizing that so many health research issues are inter-related, we request that the subcommittee provide at least $32 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and within that amount a proportionate increase for the National In-stitute on Drug Abuse, in your Fiscal 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-cation and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. We also respectfully request the in-clusion of the following NIDA specific report language. Marijuana Research. Efforts to legalize or ''medicalize'' marijuana continue across the United States. The Committee understands that research from different areas of science is converging on the fact that regular marijuana use by young people can have a long-lasting negative impact on the structure and function of their brains, resulting in lower educational achievement, reduced IQ, etc. Research clearly dem-onstrates that marijuana has the potential to cause problems in daily life or make a person's existing problems worse. NIDA is encouraged to continue to fund re-search on preventing and treating marijuana abuse and addiction, and the possible health and policy implications of proposals to implement ''medical marijuana'' or marijuana legalization programs across the U.S. Opiate Abuse and Addiction. The Committee is concerned about the continued cri- sis of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. In particular, the June 2011 IOM report on pain indicates that abuse and misuse of prescription opioid drugs resulted in an annual estimated cost to the Nation of $72,500,000,000. Further, the Committee is very concerned with the potential rise in heroin abuse and addiction as a result of 439 successful efforts to combat the prescription drug side of this issue. The Committee urges NIDA to 1) continue funding research on medications to alleviate pain, includ-ing the development of pain medications with reduced abuse liability; 2) as appro-priate, work with private companies to fund innovative research into such medica-tions; and 3) report on what we know regarding the transition from opiate analge-sics to heroin abuse and addiction within affected populations. Medications Development. The Committee recognizes that next-generation phar- maceuticals will surely take advantage of new technologies. In the context of NIDA funding, chief among these are NIDA's current approaches to develop viable immunotherapeutic or biologic (e.g., bioengineered enzymes) approaches for treating addiction. The goal of this active area of research is the development of safe and effective vaccines or antibodies that target specific drugs, like nicotine, cocaine, and heroin, or drug combinations. The Committee is excited by this approach\u2014if suc-cessful, immunotherapies, alone or in combination with other medications, behav-ioral treatments, or enzymatic approaches, stand to revolutionize how we treat, and, maybe even someday, prevent addiction. The Committee looks forward to hearing more about work in this area. Nurturing Talent and Innovation in Research. The Committee commends NIDA for its continued support of innovative research on drug addiction and related health problems such as pain and HIV/AIDS, and the Institute's effort to be at the fore-front of training the next generation of innovative researchers. The 6 year-old Avant-Garde award is a good example of a program that stimulates high-impact re-search that could lead to groundbreaking opportunities for the prevention and treat-ment of HIV/AIDS in drug abusers. The Committee understands that NIDA is now crafting a new kind of award, which would blend NIH's Pioneer and New Innovator award mechanisms. This new opportunity, called ''AVENIR'' awards, is designed to attract creative young investigators into HIV/drug abuse public health research. The Committee strongly supports this effort, and asks the Institute to report on its progress in future appropriations and related requests. Research to Assist Military Personnel, Veterans, and Their Families. The Com- mittee recognizes the significant health challenges, including substance abuse and addiction, faced by military personnel, veterans, and their families. Many of these individuals need help confronting war-related problems including traumatic brain injury, PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and substance abuse and ad-diction. The Committee commends NIDA for its successful efforts to coordinate and support research with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and other NIH Institutes focusing on these populations, and strongly urges NIDA to continue work in this area. Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in Drug Abuse and Ad- diction Prevention and Treatment. The Committee is very pleased with NIDAMed, an initiative designed to reach out to physicians, physicians in training, and other healthcare professionals. The Committee urges the Institute to continue its focus on activities to provide physicians and other medical professionals with the tools and skills needed to incorporate drug abuse screening and treatment into their clinical practices. Drug abuse is costly to Americans; it ruins lives, while tearing at the fabric of our society and taking a huge financial toll on our resources. Beyond the unaccept-ably high rates of morbidity and mortality, drug abuse is often implicated in family disintegration, loss of employment, failure in school, domestic violence, child abuse, and other crimes. Placing dollar figures on the problem; smoking, alcohol and illegal drug use results in an exorbitant economic cost on our Nation, estimated at over $600 billion annually. We know that many of these problems can be prevented en-tirely, and that the longer we can delay initiation of any use, the more successfully we mitigate future morbidity, mortality and economic burdens. Over the past three decades, NIDA-supported research has revolutionized our un- derstanding of addiction as a chronic, often-relapsing brain disease \u2014this new knowledge has helped to correctly situate drug addiction as a serious public health issue that demands strategic solutions. By supporting research that reveals how drugs affect the brain and behavior and how multiple factors influence drug abuse and its consequences, scholars supported by NIDA continue to advance effective strategies to prevent people from ever using drugs and to treat them when they can-not stop. NIDA supports a comprehensive research portfolio that spans the continuum of basic neuroscience, behavior and genetics research through medications develop-ment and applied health services research and epidemiology. While supporting re-search on the positive effects of evidence-based prevention and treatment ap-proaches, NIDA also recognizes the need to keep pace with emerging problems. We have seen encouraging trends\u2014significant declines in a wide array of youth drug 440 use\u2014over the past several years that we think are due, at least in part, to NIDA's public education and awareness efforts. However, areas of significant concern in-clude the recent increase in lethalities due to heroine, as well as the continued abuse of prescription opioids and the recent increase in designer drugs availability and their deleterious effects. The need to increase our knowledge about the effects of marijuana is most important now that decisions are being made about its ap-proval for medical use and/or its legalization. We support NIDA in its efforts to find successful approaches to these difficult problems. The Nation's previous investment in scientific research to further understand the effects of abused drugs on the body has increased our ability to prevent and treat addiction. As with other diseases, much more needs be done to improve prevention and treatment of these dangerous and costly diseases. Our knowledge of how drugs work in the brain, their health consequences, how to treat people already addicted, and what constitutes effective prevention strategies has increased dramatically due to support of this research. However, since the number of individuals continuing to be affected is still rising, we need to continue the work until this disease is both prevented and eliminated from society. We understand that the fiscal year 2015 budget cycle will involve setting prior- ities and accepting compromise, however, in the current climate we believe a focus on substance abuse and addiction, which according to the World Health Organiza-tion account for nearly 20 percent of disabilities among 15-44 year olds, deserves to be prioritized accordingly. We look forward to working with you to make this a reality. Thank you for your support for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CONSORTIUM OF SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATIONS Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, the Consortium of Social Science Associations (COSSA) appreciates and welcomes the opportunity to com-ment on the fiscal year 2015 appropriations for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). COSSA joins the Ad Hoc Group for Med-ical Research in recommending that NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 as the next step toward a multi-year increase in our Nation's investment in medical research. As a member of the CDC Coalition, COSSA requests $7.8 billion in funding for the CDC in fiscal year 2015. We join the Friends of AHRQ in request-ing a funding level of $375 million for AHRQ in fiscal year 2015. COSSA is an advocacy group for the social and behavioral sciences supported by more than 100 professional associations, scientific societies, universities and re-search centers. It serves as a bridge between the academic research and Washington policy-making community. Our organizations are appreciative of the Subcommittee's and the Congress' continued support of NIH, CDC, and AHRQ. Strong, sustained funding for these agencies is essential to the national priorities of better health and economic revitalization. NIH BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES RESEARCH As this Committee knows, the NIH mission is to support scientifically rigorous, peer/merit-reviewed, investigator-initiated research, including basic and applied be-havioral and social science research in fulfilling its mission: ''Science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the ap-plication of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life and reduce illness and disability.'' The fundamental understanding of how disease works, including the impact of so- cial environment on these disease processes, underpins our ability to conquer dev-astating illnesses. Perhaps the grandest challenge we face is to understand the brain, behavior, and society\u2014 from responding to short-term pleasures to self-de-structive behavior, such as addiction, to lifestyle factors that determine the quality of life, infant mortality rate and longevity. And while Americans have achieved very high levels of health over the past century and are healthier than people in many other Nations, according to the 2013 National Academies' (NAS) report, U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health, ''a growing body of re-search suggests that the health of the U.S. population is not keeping pace with the health of people in other economically advanced, high-income countries.'' Nearly 125 million Americans are living with one or more chronic conditions, in- cluding heart disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, arthritis, asthma, mental ill-ness and Alzheimer's disease. At the same time, healthcare spending in the United States is being driven up by the aging of the U.S. population and the rapid rise in chronic diseases, many of which are caused or exacerbated by behavioral factors\u2014 441 including, obesity, caused by sedentary behavior and poor diet, and addictions re- sulting from health problems caused by tobacco and other drug use. As the NAS re-port notes, ''the United States is losing ground in the control of diseases, injuries, and other sources of morbidity.'' The behavioral and social sciences regularly make important contributions to the well-being of this Nation. Due in large part to the behavioral and social science re-search sponsored by the NIH, we are now aware of the enormous role behavior plays in our health. At a time when genetic control over disease is tantalizingly close but not yet possible, knowledge of the behavioral influences on health is a cru-cial component in the Nation's battles against the leading causes of morbidity and mortality: obesity, heart disease, cancer, AIDS, diabetes, age-related illnesses, acci-dents, substance abuse, and mental illness. As a result of the strong Congressional commitment to the NIH in years past, our knowledge of the social and behavioral factors surrounding chronic disease health outcomes is steadily increasing. The NIH's behavioral and social science portfolio has emphasized the development of effective and sustainable interventions and pre-vention programs targeting those very illnesses that are the greatest threats to our health, but the work is just beginning. This includes NIH's support of economic re-search, specifically, research on the linkages between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in the elderly and achievement and health outcomes in children. This research has been an integral part of the interdisciplinary science NIH has his- torically supported. Accordingly, the agency's investment has yielded key data, methodologies and substantive insights on some of the most important and pressing issues facing the U.S. For example, NIH-funded surveys such as the Health and Re-tirement Survey, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), parts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experiences, and surveys on international aging and retirement provide data necessary to monitor and detect changes in im-portant socioeconomic trends in health. This in turn allows NIH to support research that will provide the greatest return on its investment when it comes to the health of our citizens. CDC BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH As the country's leading health protection and surveillance agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) works with State, local, and international partners to protect Americans from infectious diseases; prevent the leading causes of disease, disability, and death; protect Americans from natural and bioterrorism threats; monitor health and ensure laboratory excellence; keep Americans safe from environmental and work-related hazard; and ensure global disease protection. Social and behavioral science research plays a crucial role in helping the CDC carry out its mission. Scientists in fields ranging from psychology, sociology, anthro-pology, and geography to health communications, social work, and demography work in every CDC Center to design, analyze, and evaluate behavioral surveillance sys-tems, public health interventions, and health promotion and communication pro-grams using a variety of both quantitative and qualitative methods. These scientists play a key role in the CDC's surveillance and monitoring efforts, which collect and analyze data to better target public health prevention efforts. Another vital con-tribution of the social and behavioral sciences to CDC activities is in identifying and understanding health disparities. Finally, the social and behavioral sciences play an important role in the evaluation of CDC programs, helping policymakers make in-formed, evidence-based decisions on how to prioritize in a resource-scarce environ-ment. The CDC is also the home of the Nation's principal health statistics agency, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS collects data on chronic dis-ease prevalence, healthcare disparities, emergency room use, teen pregnancy, infant mortality, causes of death and rates of insurance, to name a few. It provides critical data on all aspects of our healthcare system through data cooperatives and surveys that serve as the gold standard for data collection around the world. Data from NCHS surveys like the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the National Vital Sta-tistics System (NVSS) are used by agencies across the Federal Government, State and local governments, public health officials, Federal policymakers, and demog-raphers, epidemiologists, health services researchers, and other scientists. AHRQ HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AHRQ's sole purpose is to improve healthcare in America. Just as biomedical re- search helps us find cures for disease, the health services research AHRQ supports helps find ways to cure our healthcare system\u2014improving its quality, safety, and 442 efficiency for the benefit of patients. AHRQ's research identifies what works and what doesn't in healthcare to improve patient care and provide policymakers and other healthcare leaders with the information needed to make critical healthcare de-cisions. AHRQ helps providers help patients. AHRQ's research generates valuable evi- dence to help providers help patients make the right healthcare decisions for them-selves and their loved ones. The science funded by AHRQ ensures patients receive high quality, appropriate care every time they walk through the hospital, clinic, and medical office doors. AHRQ's research provides the basis for protocols that prevent medical errors and reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), and improve pa-tient experiences and outcomes. AHRQ helps healthcare providers\u2014from private practice physicians to large hospital systems\u2014understand how to deliver the best care most efficiently. The breadth of evidence available from AHRQ empowers healthcare providers to understand not just how they compare to their peers, but also how to improve their performance to be more competitive. COSSA expects this testimony to be only the beginning of an ongoing conversation between the Subcommittee and stakeholders on the fiscal year 2015 funding needs of these agencies. We would be pleased to provide any additional information. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING Chairman Harkin and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for allowing me to submit this testimony on behalf of America's public media service\u2014 public television and public radio\u2014on-air, online and in the community. The Cor-poration for Public Broadcasting (CPB) requests level funding of $445 million for fis-cal year 2017 and $27.3 million for the Department of Education's Ready To Learn program in fiscal year 2015. Forty-six years after passage of the Public Broadcasting Act, this uniquely Amer- ican public-private partnership is keeping its promise to the American people by providing a safe place where children can learn on-air and online; providing high- quality educational content for teachers in the classroom and children schooled at home; providing reliable and trusted news and information; and providing emer-gency alert services. Either by looking at each station individually or public media as a whole, this public-private partnership is making a big difference in the lives of individuals and communities. Today we are a system that comprises more than 1,400 locally owned and locally operated public radio and television stations serving rural and urban communities throughout the country. More than 98 percent of the American people turn to Amer-ican public media for high quality content that educates, informs, inspires and en-tertains. Public media's commitment to early and lifelong learning, available to all citizens, helps strengthen our civil society and our democracy. Our trusted, non-commercial services available for free to all Americans is especially important to those living in rural communities where the local public media station is sometimes the only source of broadcast news, information and educational programming. I understand that this committee is faced with the challenging task of allocating scarce Federal resources to a number of organizations, all doing worthy and impor-tant work. The financial support for the public broadcasting system that is derived from the Federal appropriation is the essential investment keeping public media free and commercial free for all Americans. Former President Ronald Reagan said, ''Government should provide the spark and the private sector should do the rest.'' And what stations do, with the spark of Federal dollars that amounts to approxi-mately 10 to 15 percent of a stations' budget, results in a uniquely entrepreneurial and American public media system with a track record of proven benefits delivered through stations to the American people. The Federal investment through CPB is the foundation on which the entire sys- tem is built. These critical funds leverage vital investments from other sources. Un-dermining this foundation would put the entire structure in jeopardy. While private donations and existing funding sources can help defray considerable costs for the much-honored programs of public television and radio\u2014nonFederal funding rep-resents five of every six dollars invested annually in public broadcasting\u2014the Fed-eral investment is indispensable to sustaining the operations of public broadcasting stations, the public service mission they pursue, local community-based account-ability, and the universal service to which the Public Broadcasting Act aspires. Further, it is this initial investment in public media that keeps it commercial free and available to all Americans for free. However, smaller stations serving rural, mi-443 nority and other underserved communities are hard pressed to raise six times the Federal appropriation, which can represent as much as 40 percent of their budget. Public media's contribution to education\u2014from early childhood through adult learning\u2014is well documented. We are America's largest classroom, with proven con-tent available to all children, including those who cannot afford preschool. Our con-tent is repeatedly regarded as ''most trusted'' by parents, caregivers and teachers. CPB's work with the Department of Education's Ready To Learn program is an excellent example of how public media brings together high-quality educational con-tent with on-the-ground work in local communities. We also invest in research that demonstrates and promotes the effectiveness of this content in formal and informal educational settings. We talk a lot about content that matters and engagement that counts, further de- fining public media from commercial media. An example of this is CPB's ''American Graduate: Let's Make it Happen'' Initiative, which tells the story behind the sta-tistic of one million American young people failing to graduate every year from high school. Our stations told the stories and communities throughout the country re-sponded. More than 75 public media stations located in 33 States with at-risk com-munities are working with more than 1000 national and community-based partners to bring together diverse stakeholders and community organizations; filling gaps in information, resources and solutions; sharing best practices for teacher training and student engagement; creating local programming around the dropout issue unique to their communities, and leveraging digital media and technology to engage stu-dents in an effort to keep them on the path to graduation. Those numbers are now declining because what our stations do, counts. But American Graduate is just one example of how public media stations are using their spectrum for the public good. Building on our education commitment, CPB recently announced that it will ex- pand on these successful models to bring meaningful impact and change to more communities at risk. Through the recently created $20 million American Graduate/ PBS KIDS Fund, CPB and PBS will invest in the development of new tools to help parents better prepare their children ages 2-8 for educational success, to support teacher development, and to engage middle and high school youth to improve learn-ing. Public media is utilizing today's technology to provide content of value to millions of citizens who trust us to deliver content that matters and is relevant to their lives today. CPB strategically focuses investments through the lens of what we refer to as the ''Three D's'' \u2014Digital, Diversity and Dialogue. This refers to support for inno-vation on digital platforms, extending public media's reach and service over multiple platforms; content that is for, by and about Americans of all backgrounds; and serv-ices that foster dialogue between the American people and the public service media organizations that serve them.CPB funding enables stations to provide content of consequence and to keep faith with the visions of political, educational, philan- thropic and community leaders who have seen in public broadcasting the potential to strengthen our nation by promoting lifelong learning and an informed citizenry. As the steward of these important taxpayer dollars, CPB ensures that 95 cents of every dollar received goes to support local stations and the programs and services they offer to their communities; no more than five cents of every dollar goes to the administration of funding programs and overhead. The Public Broadcasting Act ensures diversity in this programming by requiring CPB to fund independent and minority producers. CPB fulfills this obligation, in part, by funding the Independent Television Service, the five Minority Consortia en-tities in television (African American, Latino, Asian American, Native American and Pacific Islander), several public radio consortia (Latino Public Radio Consortia, Afri-can American Public Radio Stations, and Native Public Media) and numerous mi-nority public radio stations. In addition, CPB, through its Diversity and Innovation fund, makes direct investments in the development of diverse primetime and chil-dren's broadcast programs as well as innovative digital content. As newspapers across the country have scaled back their operations, public media has stepped into the void. Local stations have been working to fill the gap with cre-ative ventures and partnerships, such as our seven multimedia local journalism cen-ters (LJCs) that are providing their communities with much-needed local, regional and statewide coverage. For an investment of approximately $1.35 per American per year, public media stations are able to train teachers and help educate America's children; provide in- depth journalism that informs citizens about issues in their neighborhoods, their country, and around the globe; make the arts accessible to all Americans; and pro-vide emergency alert services for their communities. CPB's fiscal year 2017 request of $445 million balances the fiscal reality facing our nation with our statutory mandate to provide a valuable and trusted service to 444 all Americans. Today, the challenges we face are more complex than ever and re- quire new levels of thinking, innovation, and collaboration. Community organiza-tions often work in isolation, shouldering the burden of solving societal problems. But public media is the essential link, uniquely poised to add real value. CPB's fis-cal year 2017 request will allow stations to enhance their role as a trusted source of information and as a convener, help communities understand issues, and mobilize them toward positive, sustainable outcomes. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, this is only part of the story of our public media system in America. Public media is a national treasure that is available and accessible to all Americans. Every day public media works to strength-en and advance our civil society. I thank you for allowing me to submit this testi-mony and urge you to consider our request for funding. [This statement was submitted by Patricia Harrison, President and CEO, Cor- poration for Public Broadcasting.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF COUNCIL OF ACADEMIC FAMILY MEDICINE We urge the Committee to appropriate at least $71 million for the health profes- sions program, Primary Care Training and Enhancement, authorized under Title VII, Section 747 of the Public Health Service Act, under the jurisdiction of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA.) In addition, we recommend the Committee fund the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) at no less than $375 million in base discretionary funding to support research vital to pri-mary care. The member organizations of the Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM) are pleased to submit testimony on behalf of programs under the jurisdiction of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The programs we support in our testi-mony are ones that deliver an investment in our Nation's workforce and health in-frastructure. They are a down payment on a U.S. healthcare system with a founda-tion of primary care that will produce better health outcomes and reduce the ever rising costs of healthcare. We understand that hard decisions must be made in these difficult fiscal times, but even in this climate, we hope the Committee will recognize that the production of a robust primary care workforce for the future is a necessary investment that cannot wait and will ultimately produce long term savings. Primary Care Training and Enhancement The Primary Care Training and Enhancement Program (Title VII, Section 747 of the Public Health Service Act) has a long history of providing indispensable funding for the training of primary care physicians. With each successive reauthorization, Congress has modified the Title VII health professions programs to address relevant workforce needs. The most recent authorization directs the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to prioritize training in the new competencies rel-evant to providing care in the patient-centered medical home model. It also calls for the development of infrastructure within primary care departments for the improve-ment of clinical care and research critical to primary care delivery, as well as inno-vations in team management of chronic disease, integrated models of care, and transitioning between healthcare settings. Departments of family medicine and fam-ily medicine residency programs often rely on Title VII, Section 747, grants to help develop curricula and research training methods for transforming practice delivery. There has not been a competitive cycle for these grants since fiscal year 2010. There are currently over 200 grants, completing their cycle in fiscal year 2014 who will be eligible to apply in fiscal year 2015, as well as numerous other potential ap-plicants who did not receive funding in fiscal year 2010. The current funding level (approximately $36.9 million) is not enough to allow for the pent up demand. More importantly, the vital work of these grants to help reform primary care education and the health delivery system needs to be prioritized. As implementation of the Affordable Care Act proceeds with increasing numbers of insured persons, the Nation will need new initiatives relating to increased train-ing in inter-professional care, the patient-centered medical home, and other new competencies required in our developing health system. Such initiatives will be im-possible to implement without a competitive grant cycle with enough funding to allow for a robust result of new grants. Now is the time to ensure that critical fund-ing for the Primary Care Training and Enhancement program takes place. Title VII has a profound impact on States across the country and is vital to the continued development of a workforce designed to care for the most vulnerable populations 445 and meet the needs of the 21st century. We cannot allow the primary care pipeline to dry up. Below are some examples of how these grants have made lasting contributions: ''With funding from a Title VII Medical Student Education grant, we were able to expand our existing medical student family medicine clerkship clinic to include students from pharmacy, nursing, occupational and physical therapy, and law, who see patients together under the supervision of faculty from all disciplines. This has allowed us to create one of the few truly interprofessional clinical experiences.'' Joshua Freeman, MD, Chair, Department of Family Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine ''Our AAU HRSA Title VII Grant has allowed us to transform the education of medical students and residents at Brown University around the patient centered medical home, including new curricula and rotations, as well as the facilitation work to transform 10 family medicine teaching practices. In addition, we have run 3 na-tional ''think tanks'' to discuss practical and theoretical issues related to models for practice transformation, PCMH evaluation, and the Adolescent PCMH. This grant has had huge impact and the work could not have been done without it. Jeffrey Borkan, MD, PhD, Chair, Department of Family Medicine, Brown University ''Previous grants included starting a resident continuity clinic at an FQHC, and preparation for rural training (rural continuity clinic, curriculum, rural mentoring program, rural medicine interest group). More distant grants help set up rural training sites for medical students and residents in 1975 and 1980, both of which are still providing that important function. Steven C. Zweig, MD, MSPH, Chair, De-partment of Family Medicine, University of Missouri'' ''We have used HRSA funding to transform our curriculum and our Family Medi- cine Center using the principles of PCMH. We have partnered with a local income based elderly housing complex to provide clinical services on-site. We have partnered with a community senior center to provide on-site instruction to elderly community dwelling individuals. We have added instruction in quality and safety throughout the residency and using the PDSA cycle we improve care in asthma, asthma, and hypertension as well as our preventive care. As a consequence we have put ourselves in a position to become NCQA Level 3 certified by December 31.'' In addition, we were able to partner with the local FQHCs and create a longitudinal patient care track in the first 2 years of medical school. Beginning October of the first year, the students are placed in a primary care (and most in an underserved) site on an ongoing, monthly basis. They are given the skills to be a member of the care team and participate in all aspects of patient care.'' Allen Perkins, MD, Pro-fessor and Chair, Department of Family Medicine, University of South Alabama Col-lege of Medicine ''Title VII funding has allowed our residency site to implement an interprofes- sional team-based care curriculum as part of our patient-centered medical home transformation. Residents work with nurses, social workers, nurse midwives, com-munity health workers, nutritionists and certified diabetes educators and learn about optimal team communication and care for their patients through participation in several group visit programs (centering pregnancy, well baby visits and diabetes group visits). Their learning is also supplemented by a longitudinal video feedback to improve doctor-patient communication, which includes 360 degree feedback and preceptor training.'' Michelle Roett, MD, MPH, FAAFP, Residency Program Direc-tor, Georgetown University-Providence Hospital FMR, in Colmar Manor, MD Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) Two years ago, we were disappointed to see the subcommittee eliminate funding for AHRQ in its draft bill. We understand that in our current budgetary climate it is important to leverage research funding in the most effective ways possible. How-ever, the majority of research funding supports research of one specific disease, organ system, cellular, or chemical process\u2014not for primary care. This is in spite of the fact that the overall health of a population is directly linked to the strength of its primary healthcare system. Primary care research includes: translating science into the practice of medicine and caring for patients, understanding how to better organize healthcare to meet patient and population needs, evaluating innova-tions to provide the best healthcare to patients, and engaging patients, commu-nities, and practices to improve health. AHRQ is uniquely positioned to support this sort of best practice research and to help advance its dissemination to improve pri-mary care nationwide. There are six areas that we believe AHRQ excels at\u2014and that are not available elsewhere in the biomedical research infrastructure: primary care research through Practice-based Research Networks (PBRNs), practice transformation, patient quality 446 and safety in non-hospital settings, multi-morbidity research, mental and behavioral health provision in communities and primary care practices, and training future pri-mary care investigators. Critical to the successful engagement and development of primary care research is the constraint of not having an adequate cadre of well- trained researchers. We believe there is a need to deliberately promote this training as a way to aid in the development of all the areas we have emphasized. AHRQ has researcher training mechanisms in place, which we believe are important, and need to be expanded. Some examples from the field regarding the utility of AHRQ-funded grants: ''Three AHRQ grants supported the development of patient centered personal health records in 2007, 2009, and 2010, and studied whether these tools increased prevention. In our studies we found increases in important tests like colon and breast cancer screening as well as immunizations, blood pressure and cholesterol control. In addition, we were able to leave the functionality in place\u2014permanently\u2014 for 191 doctors and now 60,000 patients. One result is that the practices are now using the AHRQ created portal as their sole patient portal and abandoned the com-mercial portal that did not work as well.'' Alex Krist, M.D., M.P.H., Virginia Com-monwealth University ''The AHRQ-sponsored series of grants on Multiple Chronic Condition research were transformative for that field. They also sponsored regular meetings among grantees and established the Multiple Chronic Conditions Research Network, which has fostered many collaborations between researchers with shared expertise.'' Eliza-beth A. Bayliss, MD, MSPH, Kaiser Permanente Colorado ''Our AHRQ grant to study the transformation of medical practices into patient- centered medical homes allowed us to develop a good partnership with the Min-nesota Dept. of Health and Dept. of Human Services to evaluate a State experiment certifying primary care practices as medical homes. That partnership facilitated ac-cess to information and practices and helped us learn many lessons about this transformation and its impacts. These lessons were then provided to those MN de-partments and to the practices that were becoming medical homes, with the purpose of improving quality, cost, and access.'' Leif I. Solberg, MD, Director for Care Im-provement Research, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research, Bloom-ington, MN Research related to the most common acute, chronic, and comorbid conditions that primary care clinicians treat is lacking. AHRQ supports research to improve healthcare quality, reduce costs, advance patient safety, decrease medical errors, and broaden access to essential services. This research is essential to create a robust primary care system for our Nation\u2014one that delivers higher quality of care and better health while reducing the rising cost of care. Despite this need, little is known about how patients can best decide how and when to seek care, how to intro-duce and disseminate new discoveries into real life practice, and how to maximize appropriate care. This type of research requires sufficient funding for AHRQ, so it can help researchers address the problems confronting our health system today. We recommend the Committee fund AHRQ at a base, discretionary level of at least $375 million for fiscal year 2015. [This statement was submitted by Grant Hoekzema, MD, Chair, Council of Aca- demic Family Medicine.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL ON SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION On behalf of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), I am pleased to offer this written testimony to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies for inclusion in the official Committee record. I will focus my testimony on the importance of fostering a skilled, sustainable, and diverse social work workforce to meet the healthcare needs of the nation through professional education, training, and financial support programs for social workers at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the De-partment of Education (ED). CSWE is a nonprofit national association representing more than 2,500 individual members and more than 700 master's and baccalaureate programs of professional social work education. Founded in 1952, this partnership of educational and profes-sional institutions, social welfare agencies, and private citizens houses the sole ac-crediting body for social work education in the United States. Social work education prepares students for leadership and professional interdisciplinary practice with in-dividuals, families, groups, and communities in a wide array of service sectors, in-cluding health, mental health, adult and juvenile justice, PK-12 education, child 447 1U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2012.

Social work practice is facilitated by a longstanding tra- dition of collaborative relationships working with health professions colleagues in-cluding direct care workers, families, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others yield-ing a result that empowers individuals to be healthy, productive, contributing mem-bers of their communities. Social workers recognize that social determinants of health are a critical component in meeting the health needs of certain populations, and social work education and practice follow this framework. As Federal agencies look to reduce cost and improve quality, social workers can help lead in this area. Recruitment and retention in social work continues to be a serious challenge that threatens the workforce's ability to meet societal needs. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that employment for social workers is expected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2022, particularly for social workers specializing in the aging population and working in rural areas. In addition, the need for social workers specializing in mental health and substance use is expected to grow by 23 percent over the 2012-2022 decade. 1 CSWE understands the difficult funding decisions Congress is faced with. In these challenging times, it is my hope that the Committee will prioritize funding for health professions training in fiscal year (FY) 2015 to help to ensure that the nation continues to foster a sustainable, skilled, and culturally competent workforce that will be able to keep up with the increasing demand for social work services and meet the unique healthcare needs of diverse communities. HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (HRSA) TITLE VII AND TITLE VIII HEALTH PROFESSIONS PROGRAMS CSWE urges the Committee to provide $520 million in fiscal year 2015 for the health professions education programs authorized under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act and administered through HRSA, which is equal to the fiscal year 2012 enacted level. HRSA's Title VII and Title VIII health professions programs represent Federal programs designed to train healthcare providers in an interdisciplinary way to meet the healthcare needs of all Americans, including the underserved and those with special needs. These programs also serve to increase minority representation in the healthcare workforce through targeted programs that improve the quality, diversity, and geographic distribution of the health professions workforce. The Title VII and Title VIII programs provide loans, loan guarantees and scholarships to students, and grants to institutions of higher education and non- profit organizations to help build and maintain a robust healthcare workforce. Social workers and social work students are eligible for funding from the suite of Title VII health professions programs. The Title VII and Title VIII programs were reauthorized in 2010, which helped to improve the efficiency of the programs as well as enhance efforts to recruit and retain health professionals in underserved communities. Recognizing the severe shortages of mental and behavioral health providers within the healthcare work-force, a new Title VII program was authorized in the Patient Protection and Afford-able Care Act (Public Law 111-148). The Mental and Behavioral Health Education and Training Grants program provides grants to institutions of higher education (schools of social work and other mental health professions) for faculty and student recruitment and professional education and training. The program received first- time funding of $10 million in the final fiscal year 2012 appropriations bill. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget request would continue to support the program at HRSA and also through a partnership with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to expand the mental health workforce by almost 3,500 professionals focused on transition-age youth (16-25). CSWE urges the Committee to maintain funding at HRSA for this critically important program at the highest level possible in fiscal year 2015 and include schools of social work as eligible entities. CSWE supports the proposed expansion of the program but en-courages the committee to be inclusive of non-youth populations needing mental and behavioral health services and not to reduce the scope of the original intent of the program through the expansion. 448 2According to SAMHSA, minorities make up over one-fourth of the population, but less than 20 percent of behavioral health providers come from ethnic minority communities.

Retrieved from http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/cre/sma-01-3613.pdf. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA) MINORITY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM CSWE urges the Committee to appropriate the highest level possible for the Mi- nority Fellowship Program (MFP) in fiscal year 2015. The goal of the SAMHSA Mi-nority Fellowship Program (MFP) is to achieve greater numbers of minority doctoral students preparing for leadership roles in the mental health and substance use fields. 2CSWE is one of six grantees of this critical program and administers funds to exceptional minority doctoral social work students. Other grantees include na-tional organizations representing nursing, psychology, psychiatry, marriage and family therapy, and professional counselors. SAMHSA makes grants to these six or-ganizations, who in turn recruit minority doctoral students into the program from the six distinct professions. CSWE administers the funds to qualified doctoral stu-dents and helps facilitate mentoring and networking throughout the duration of the fellowship as well as facilitates an alumni group to help continue to engage former fellows long after their formal fellowship has ended. Since its inception in 1974, the MFP has helped support doctoral-level profes- sional education for over 1,000 ethnic minority social workers, psychiatrists, psy-chologists, psychiatric nurses, and family and marriage therapists. Still, the pro-gram continues to struggle to keep up with the demands facing these health profes-sions. Severe shortages of mental health professionals often arise in underserved areas due to the difficulty of recruitment and retention in the public sector. No-where are these shortages more prevalent than within Tribal communities, where mental illness and substance use go largely untreated and incidences of suicide con-tinue to increase. Studies have shown that ethnic minority mental health profes-sionals practice in underserved areas at a higher rate than non-minorities. Further-more, a direct positive relationship exists between the numbers of ethnic minority mental health professionals and the utilization of needed services by ethnic minori-ties. 3The President's fiscal year 2015 budget request includes $10 million for MFP activities. CSWE urges the committee to support this request, including at least $5.4 million for MFP core activities. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STUDENT AID PROGRAMS CSWE supports full funding to keep the maximum Pell Grant at $5,830 in fiscal year 2015. While Congress is understandably focused on identifying a solution that will place the Pell Grant program on solid ground in regards to its fiscal future, we urge you to remember that these grants help to ensure that all students, regardless of their economic situation, can achieve higher education. Moreover, as described above with regard to the SAMHSA Minority Fellowship Program, one goal of social work education is recruiting students from diverse backgrounds (which includes ra-cial, economic, religious, and other forms of diversity) with the hope that they will return to serve diverse communities once they have completed their education. In many cases, this includes encouraging social workers to return to their own commu-nities and apply the skills they have acquired through their social work education to individuals, groups, or families in need. Without support such as Pell Grants, many low-income individuals would not be able to access higher education, and in turn, would not acquire skills needed to best serve in the communities that would most benefit from their service. The Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program provides graduate traineeships in critical fields of study. Currently, social work is not defined as an area of national need for this program; however it was recognized by Congress as an area of national need in the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. We encourage ED to recognize the importance of including social work in the GAANN program in future years. Inclusion of social work would help to significantly enhance graduate education in social work, which is critically needed in the country's efforts to foster a sustainable health professions workforce. CSWE urges the Subcommittee to provide $31 million for the GAANN Program and include social as an area of na- tional need. 449 CSWE supports efforts at ED to help students with high debt loads serve in low paying positions. The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) program and the Public Serv-ice Loan Forgiveness programs in particular help students graduating from social work programs who wish to serve in high-needs communities, often at a low salary level. CSWE urges the Subcommittee to support loan repayment programs without a cap on repayment support at ED. Thank you for the opportunity to express these views. Please do not hesitate to call on the Council on Social Work Education should you have any questions or re-quire additional information.

Increase funding for the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) by 12 percent. \u2014Continued focus on Digestive Disease Research and Education At NIH, includ- ing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Colorectal Cancer. \u2014$6,860,000 For the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) IBD Epidemiology Activities. \u2014$50 Million For the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Colorectal Cancerscreening and Prevention Program. Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the Subcommittee. CCFA has remained committed to its mission of finding a cure for Crohn's disease and ul-cerative colitis and improving the quality of life of children and adults affected by these diseases for over 46 years. Impacting an estimated 1.4 million Americans, 30 percent of whom are diagnosed in their childhood years, Inflammatory Bowel Dis-eases (IBD) are chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract which cause abdom-inal pain, fever, and intestinal bleeding. IBD represents a major cause of morbidity from digestive illness and has a devastating impact on both patients and their fami-lies. The social and economic impact of digestive disease is enormous and difficult to grasp. Digestive disorders afflict approximately 65 million Americans. This results in 50 million visits to physicians, over 10 million hospitalizations, collectively 230 million days of restricted activity. The total cost associated with digestive diseases has been conservatively estimated at $60 billion a year. The CCFA would like to thank the subcommittee for its past support of digestive disease research and prevention programs at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifically the CCFA recommends: \u2014$32 billion for the NIH. \u2014$2.16 billion for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK). We at the CCFA respectfully request that any increase for NIH does not come at the expense of other Public Health Service agencies. With the competing and the challenging budgetary constraints the Subcommittee currently operates under, the CCFA would like to highlight the research being accomplished by NIDDK which warrants the in-crease for NIH. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE In the United States today about one million people suffer from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as IBD. These are serious diseases that af-fect the gastrointestinal tract causing bleeding, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Complications arising from IBD can include anemia, ulcers of the skin, eye disease, colon cancer, liver disease, arthritis, and osteoporosis. The cause of IBD is still un-known, but research has led to great breakthroughs in therapy. In recent years researchers have made significant progress in the fight against IBD. The CCFA encourages the subcommittee to continue its support of IBD re-450 search at NIDDK and NIAID at a level commensurate with the overall increase for each institute. The DDNC would like to applaud the NIDDK for its strong commit-ment to IBD research through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Research Consortium. The CCFA urges the Consortium to continue its work in IBD research. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION IBD EPIDEMIOLOGY CDC, in collaboration with a nationwide, geographically diverse network of large managed healthcare delivery systems, has led an epidemiological study of IBD to understand IBD incidence, prevalence, demographics, and healthcare utilization. The group, comprised of investigators at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Rhode Island Hospital, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, and CDC, has piloted the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Registry (OSCAR), which in-cludes both pediatric and adult patients. Since 2008, the OSCAR investigators have recruited 22 private-practice groups and hospital based physicians in Rhode Island and are that enrolling newly diagnosed patients into the registry. This study found an average annual incidence rate of 8.4 per 100,000 people for Crohn's disease and 12.4 per 100,000 for Ulcerative Colitis; published in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Journal, April 2007. \u2014Over the course of the initial 3-year epidemiologic collaboration, CDC laboratory scientists and epidemiologists worked to improve detection tools and epidemio-logic methods to study the role of infections (infectious disease epidemiology) in pediatric IBD, collaborating with extramural researchers who were funded by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research award. \u2014Since 2006, CDC epidemiologists have been working in conjunction with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of American and a large health maintenance or-ganization to better understand the natural history of IBD and factors that pre-dict the course of disease. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America encourages the CDC to continue to support a nationwide IBD surveillance and epidemiological program in fiscal year 2014. COLORECTAL CANCER PREVENTION Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer for both men and woman in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Colorectal cancer affects men and women equally. The CCFA recommends a funding level of $50 million for the CDC's Colorectal Cancer Screening and Prevention Program. This important program supports en-hanced colorectal screening and public awareness activities throughout the United States. The DDNC also supports the continued development of the CDC-supported National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, which provides a forum among organiza-tions concerned with colorectal cancer to develop and implement consistent preven-tion, screening, and awareness strategies. CONCLUSION The CCFA understands the challenging budgetary constraints and times we live in that this Subcommittee is operating under, yet we hope you will carefully con-sider the tremendous benefits to be gained by supporting a strong research and edu-cation program at NIH and CDC. Millions of Americans are pinning their hopes for a better life, or even life itself, on digestive disease research conducted through the National Institutes of Health. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of our patients, we appre-ciate your consideration of our view. We look forward to working with you and your staff. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS FOUNDATION On behalf of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the 30,000 people with cys- tic fibrosis (CF) in the United States, we submit the following testimony to the Sen-ate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Serv-ices, Education, and Related Agencies on our funding requests for fiscal year 2015. The Foundation requests the highest possible funding level for the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH), particularly the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and programs under its jurisdiction, including the Cures Accel-eration Network (CAN) and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA). 451 Collaboration and Innovation: The Future of Drug Development NIH uses appropriated funds wisely and effectively by supporting programs that promote efficiency and innovation in drug discovery and encouraging collaboration across sectors. Many of these effective, collaborative ventures aim to translate basic research into promising potential treatments, speeding the discovery of therapies for those with serious illnesses like cystic fibrosis. We urge you to ensure that these critical programs are sufficiently funded and receive the support they need. For those with rare genetic diseases like CF, treatments and cures cannot wait. As an example of the NIH's cooperative, innovative approach, in February the agency announced the establishment of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP), a joint venture between NIH, pharmaceutical companies, and several non- profit organizations to characterize biomarkers and distinguish biological targets that are most likely to respond to new therapies. The AMP will begin with three to five year pilot projects in Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthri-tis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Through this cross-sector partnership, NIH and industry partners share expertise, resources, and data in order to speed the development of treatments. Furthermore, industry partners have agreed to make AMP data and analyses available to the bio-medical community for use in future study. Drug development is risky, expensive, and time-consuming, and there is a 95 per- cent failure rate for drug candidates. This kind of cross-sector partnership aims to reduce the time, cost, and risk of drug development by sharing resources so diseases can be analyzed in ways that drug companies have not been able to do on their own. Importantly, industry will fund one-half of the $230 million budget while NIH will provide the other half. The Federal money used for this project acts as seed money, a jumping off point for private sector investment in drug discovery for serious dis-eases. This type of cooperative approach saves taxpayer funds in the long run and can save lives. While AMP is not administered by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), this NIH center spearheads similarly innovative programs that encourage collaboration, improve the process by which diagnostics and therapeutics are developed, and improve the efficiency of the translation of basic scientific discoveries into new therapies. For example, the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN), a program under the um- brella of NCATS, funds a variety of initiatives designed to address scientific and technical challenges that hinder transitional research. For instance, CAN provides funding for the Tissue Chip for Drug Screening Initiative, a joint project with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) to develop 3-D human tissue chips. These chips, composed of di-verse human cells and tissues, mimic how drugs interact with the human body. If successful, these chips could make drug safety and efficacy assessments possible at an earlier stage in drug development, enabling investigators to concentrate on the most promising new drugs. Unfortunately, CAN has been chronically underfunded. Since its inception as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, it has been funded at approximately $10 million per year for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. We urge the Committee to provide at least the funding level requested in the President's fis-cal year 2015 budget\u2014$29.8 million. CAN needs additional funding for projects that will help move new treatments to patients. Similarly, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program in the NCATS Division of Clinical Innovation demonstrates NCATS' innovative, collabo-rative approach. This program supports a national consortium of more than 60 med-ical research institutions that work together on research. Its goals are to accelerate the process of translating laboratory discoveries into treatments for patients, train a new generation of researchers, and engage communities in clinical research ef-forts. Institutional CTSA awards provide academic homes for translational sciences and support research resources needed by local and national research communities to improve the quality and efficiency of all phases of translational research. They also support the training of clinical and translational scientists and the development of all disciplines needed for a robust translational research workforce. CTSA funds have the potential to be used in new ways. For example, CTSA's aca- demic homes can serve as a platform for sharing patient registry data. As the CF Foundation has seen with its Therapeutics Development Network of clinical trial sites, the sharing of patient registry information, including demographics and health outcomes, among sites is integral to conducting CF research. This strategy could be beneficial in the wider disease community. 452 A Culture of Collaboration: The Cystic Fibrosis Model The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has long been engaged in partnerships with in- dustry and supports a collaborative network of care centers and clinical trial sites. As such, CFF knows firsthand that this type of cooperation can lead to the targeted treatments that change the face of many life-threatening diseases. Because drug research and development is a lengthy, expensive and risky process, CFF pioneered a successful ''venture philanthropy'' business model to drive drug de-velopment for this rare disease. By collaborating with pharmaceutical companies and providing financial, scientific, and clinical support in order to ''de-risk'' the de-velopment process, CFF speeds development of much-needed treatments. Through its venture philanthropy model, the Foundation is able to invest in prom- ising CF research and a robust pipeline of potential therapies that target the dis-ease from every angle. Nearly every CF drug available today was made possible be-cause of the Foundation's support and ongoing work with researchers and the phar-maceutical industry to find a cure. In January 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved Kalydeco, a groundbreaking cystic fibrosis drug developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in part-nership with the CF Foundation. This targeted drug is the first to address the un-derlying genetic cause of cystic fibrosis in a subset of the CF population. Kalydeco was approved in only 3 months, one of the fastest approvals in the FDA's history. According to Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D., Commissioner of the FDA, ''The unique and mutually beneficial partnership that led to the approval of Kalydeco serves as a great model for what companies and patient groups can achieve if they collaborate on drug development.'' Throughout Kalydeco's review, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and renowned CF experts worked closely with Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the FDA, providing valu-able insight on specific issues related to CF, clinical research on CF treatments, and other issues related to the product and its review. We believe that this collaborative process contributed to a more efficient evaluation, and is a testament to what can be achieved when stakeholders collaborate across sectors on critical drugs for pa-tients. Akin to AMP, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation also recognizes the profound impor- tance of data sharing, which is a critical way to enable efficient drug development. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) of clin-ical trial centers has accumulated data from over 40 cystic fibrosis studies in the last 15 years. This data resides in a repository specifically meant to facilitate shar-ing among our research community. *** As the Committee determines its funding levels for fiscal year 2015, we request your attention to the critical nature of NIH's work and the innovation it supports, and urge robust funding for this important agency. The CF Foundation stands ready to work with the Committee, NIH, and Congressional leaders on the challenges ahead. Thank you for your consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE DIGESTIVE DISEASE NATIONAL COALITION SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR 2015 RECOMMENDATIONS \u2014$32 Billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at an increase of $1 bil- lion over fiscal year 2014. Increase funding for the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) by 12 percent. \u2014Continue focus on Digestive Disease Research and Education at NIH, Including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Hepatitis and other Liver Diseases, Irri-table Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Colorectal Cancer, Endoscopic Research, Pan-creatic Cancer, and Celiac Disease. \u2014$50 Million for the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Hepa- titis Prevention and Control Activities. \u2014$50 Million for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Colorectal Cancerscreening and Prevention Program. Chairman Harkin, thank you for the opportunity to again submit testimony to the Subcommittee. Founded in 1978, the Digestive Disease National Coalition (DDNC) 453 is a voluntary health organization comprised of 35 professional societies and patient organizations concerned with the many diseases of the digestive tract. The DDNC promotes a strong Federal investment in digestive disease research, patient care, disease prevention, and public awareness. The DDNC is a broad coalition of groups representing disorders such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Hepatitis and other liver diseases, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Pancreatic Cancer, Ulcers, Pe-diatric and Adult Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Colorectal Cancer, and Celiac Disease. The social and economic impact of digestive disease is enormous and difficult to grasp. Digestive disorders afflict approximately 65 million Americans. This results in 50 million visits to physicians, over 10 million hospitalizations, collectively 230 million days of restricted activity. The total cost associated with digestive diseases has been conservatively estimated at $60 billion a year. The DDNC would like to thank the Subcommittee for its past support of digestive disease research and prevention programs at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifically the DDNC recommends: \u201432 billion for the NIH. \u2014$2.16 billion for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK). We at the DDNC respectfully request that any increase for NIH does not come at the expense of other Public Health Service agencies. With the competing and the challenging budgetary constraints the Subcommittee currently operates under, the DDNC would like to highlight the research being accomplished by NIDDK which warrants the in-crease for NIH. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE In the United States today about one million people suffer from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). These are serious diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract causing bleeding, di-arrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Complications arising from IBD can include ane-mia, ulcers of the skin, eye disease, colon cancer, liver disease, arthritis, and osteoporosis. The cause of IBD is still unknown, but research has led to great break-throughs in therapy. In recent years researchers have made significant progress in the fight against IBD. The DDNC encourages the subcommittee to continue its support of IBD re-search at NIDDK and NIAID at a level commensurate with the overall increase for each institute. The DDNC would like to applaud the NIDDK for its strong commit-ment to IBD research through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Research Consortium. The DDNC urges the Consortium to continue its work in IBD research. Therefore the DDNC and its member organization the Crohn's and Colitis Founda-tion of America encourage the CDC to continue to support a nationwide IBD surveil-lance and epidemiological program in fiscal year 2015. VIRAL HEPATITIS : A LOOMING THREAT TO HEALTH The DDNC applauds all the work NIH and CDC have accomplished over the past year in the areas of hepatitis and liver disease. The DDNC urges that funding be focused on expanding the capability of State health departments, particularly to en-hance resources available to the hepatitis State coordinators. The DDNC also urges that CDC increase the number of cooperative agreements with coalition partners to develop and distribute health education, communication, and training materials about prevention, diagnosis and medical management for viral hepatitis. The DDNC supports $50 million for the CDC's Hepatitis Prevention and Control activities. The hepatitis division at CDC supports the hepatitis C prevention strat-egy and other cooperative nationwide activities aimed at prevention and awareness of hepatitis A, B, and C. The DDNC also urges the CDC's leadership and support for the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable to establish a comprehensive approach among all stakeholders for viral hepatitis prevention, education, strategic coordina-tion, and advocacy. COLORECTAL CANCER PREVENTION Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer for both men and woman in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Colorectal cancer affects men and women equally. The DDNC recommends a funding level of $50 million for the CDC's Colorectal Cancer Screening and Prevention Program. This important program supports en-454 hanced colorectal screening and public awareness activities throughout the United States. The DDNC also supports the continued development of the CDC-supported National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, which provides a forum among organiza-tions concerned with colorectal cancer to develop and implement consistent preven-tion, screening, and awareness strategies. PANCREATIC CANCER In 2013, an estimated 33,730 people in the United States will be found to have pancreatic cancer and approximately 32,300 died from the disease. Pancreatic can-cer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Only l out of 4 patients will live 1 year after the cancer is found and only l out of 25 will survive five or more years. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established a Pancreatic Cancer Progress Review Group charged with developing a detailed research agenda for the disease. The DDNC encourages the Subcommittee to provide an increase for pancreatic can-cer research at a level commensurate with the overall percentage increase for NCI and NIDDK. IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) IBS is a disorder that affects an estimated 35 million Americans. The medical community has been slow in recognizing IBS as a legitimate disease and the burden of illness associated with it. Patients often see several doctors before they are given an accurate diagnosis. Once a diagnosis of IBS is made, medical treatment is limited because the medical community still does not understand the pathophysiology of the underlying conditions. Living with IBS is a challenge, patients face a life of learning to manage a chronic illness that is accompanied by pain and unrelenting gastrointestinal symptoms. Try-ing to learn how to manage the symptoms is not easy. There is a loss of spontaneity when symptoms may intrude at any time. IBS is an unpredictable disease. A patient can wake up in the morning feeling fine and within a short time encounter abdom-inal cramping to the point of being doubled over in pain and unable to function. The DDNC recommends that NIDDK increase its research portfolio on Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Motility Disorders. CONCLUSION The DDNC understands the challenging budgetary constraints and times we live in that this Subcommittee is operating under, yet we hope you will carefully con-sider the tremendous benefits to be gained by supporting a strong research and edu-cation program at NIH and CDC. Millions of Americans are pinning their hopes for a better life, or even life itself, on digestive disease research conducted through the National Institutes of Health. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the millions of digestive disease sufferers, we appreciate your consideration of the views of the Digestive Dis-ease National Coalition. We look forward to working with you and your staff. PREPARED STATEMENT OF DYSTONIA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 \u2014$32 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and proportional in- creases across its institutes and centers. \u2014Continue to support the Dystonia Coalition Within the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) coordinated by the Office of Rare Diseases Re-search (ORDR) in the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). \u2014Expand Dystonia Research supported by NIH through the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) and the National Eye Institute (NEI). Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle spasms that cause the body to twist, repetitively jerk, and sustain postural deformi-ties. Focal dystonia affects specific parts of the body, while generalized dystonia af-fects multiple parts of the body at the same time. Some forms of dystonia are ge-netic but dystonia can also be caused by injury or illness. Although dystonia is a 455 chronic and progressive disease, it does not impact cognition, intelligence, or shorten a person's life span. Conservative estimates indicate that between 300,000 and 500,000 individuals suffer from some form of dystonia in North America alone. Dystonia does not discriminate, affecting all demographic groups. There is no known cure for dystonia and treatment options remain limited. Although little is known regarding the causes and onset of dystonia, two therapies have been developed that have demonstrated a great benefit to patients and have been particularly useful for controlling patient symptoms. Botulinum toxin (e.g., Botox, Xeomin, Disport and Myobloc) injections and deep brain stimulation have shown varying degrees of success alleviating dystonia symptoms. Until a cure is dis-covered, the development of management therapies such as these remains vital, and more research is needed to fully understand the onset and progression of the disease in order to better treat patients. DYSTONIA RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) Currently, dystonia research at NIH is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), the National Eye Institute (NEI), and the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) within the National Center for Ad-vancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). ORDR coordinates the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) which provides support for studies on the natural history, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases. RDCRN includes the Dystonia Coalition, a partnership between researchers, patients, and patient advocacy groups to advance the pace of clinical research on cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, spasmodic dysphonia, craniofacial Coalition has made tremen-dous progress in preparing the patient community for clinical trials as well as fund-ing promising studies that hold great hope for advancing our understanding and ca-pacity to treat primary focal dystonias. DAN urges the subcommittee to continue its support for the Dystonia Coalition, part of the Rare Disease Clinical Research Net-work coordinated by ORDR within NCATS. The majority of dystonia research at NIH is supported by NINDS. NINDS has uti- lized a number of funding mechanisms in recent years to study the causes and mechanisms of dystonia. These grants cover a wide range of research including the genetics and genomics of dystonia, the development of animal models of primary and secondary dystonia, molecular and cellular studies in inherited forms of dystonia, epidemiology studies, and brain imaging. DAN urges the subcommittee to support NINDS in conducting and expanding critical research on dystonia. NIDCD and NEI also support research on dystonia. NIDCD has funded many studies on brainstem systems and role in spasmodic dysphonia, or laryngeal dystonia. Spasmodic dysphonia is a form of focal dystonia which involves involun-tary spasms of the vocal cords causing interruptions of speech and affecting voice quality. NEI focuses some of its resources on the study of blepharospasm. Blepharospasm is an abnormal, involuntary blinking of the eyelids which can render a patient legally blind due to a patient's inability to open their eyelids. DAN encour-ages partnerships between NINDS, NIDCD and NEI to further dystonia research. In summary, DAN recommends the following for fiscal year 2015: \u2014$32 billion for NIH and a proportional increase for its Institutes and Centers \u2014Support for the Dystonia Coalition within the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network coordinated by ORDR within NCATS \u2014Expansion of the dystonia research portfolio at NIH through NINDS, NIDCD, NEI, and ORDR THE DYSTONIA ADVOCACY NETWORK The Dystonia Medical Research Foundation submits these comments on behalf of the Dystonia Advocacy Network (DAN), a collaborative network of five patient orga-nizations: the Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation, the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, the National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association, the National Spasmodic Torticollis Association, and ST/Dystonia, Inc. DAN advocates for all persons affected by dystonia and supports a legislative agenda that meets the needs of the dystonia community. DMRF was founded in 1976. Since its inception, the goals of DMRF have re- mained to advance research for more effective treatments of dystonia and ultimately find a cure; to promote awareness and education; and support the needs and well being of affected individuals and their families. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the dystonia community, we look forward to providing any additional information. 456 [This statement was submitted by Janet Hieshetter, Executive Director, Dystonia Medical Research Foundation.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ELDER JUSTICE COALITION Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran: On behalf of the Elder Justice Coali- tion, a bipartisan 3000 member organization, we thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of the Department of Health and Human Services' proposed Elder Justice Initiative in the amount of $25 million. Our topic has been and must always be a bipartisan issue: preventing elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. We ask this Subcommittee to provide the necessary funding in a bipartisan fashion as part of the solution to the real national disgrace of elder abuse. There are more than six million victims of elder abuse; roughly one of every ten persons over 60. Victims of elder financial abuse lose an estimated $2.9 billion a year which can include entire life savings. Other data points to a 16 percent in-crease in reported cases. However, a New York State study said for every elder abuse case known to agencies, twenty-four were unknown. The $25 million requested in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget for an Elder Justice Initiative which if approved by Congress would be the first direct appropria-tion for the bipartisan Elder Justice Act sponsored in the Senate by Senators Breaux, Hatch and Baucus. The funding request includes: \u2014$13.8 million for Adult Protective Services, including an APS National Data System and Technical Assistance and national demonstration grants to both en-hance APS data systems and development of program standards as well as an full evaluation of APS practices. \u2014$11.2 million for research including elder abuse screening and to establish a better knowledge base about elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. Data collection is important. The lack of good data has hurt the elder abuse field and our ability to target efforts to prevent abuse. Data often drives dollars. For elder abuse to compete effectively for resources, we must have a good system to col-lect and analyze data. This appropriation will also help assess the most likely per-petrators and victims and direct resources to those most vulnerable. We support the development of APS program standards. Interventions for victims of elder abuse are far more complicated than for younger victims of abuse and fam-ily violence. To be effective, APS programs must have consistency and quality on a national basis. Elder abuse is happening in all States and districts and in some cases an older person can be victimized in more than one State. This initial investment of $25 million means existing Federal resources could be used more efficiently while also responding to elder abuse with a systematic ap-proach. This and slowing future victimization is a solid return on investment. Why else is this an investment? According to the National Center on Elder Abuse, the direct medical costs associated with elder abuse now exceed $5 billion. Victims often end up having to turn to other Federal programs, especially Medicare and Medicaid, and for financial abuse victims they may require other assistance includ-ing income support. Some of this can clearly be avoided and savings achieved for these programs if we make this investment today. Elder abuse victims are household names like Mickey Rooney or the late Brooke Astor. We testify for them today but also for those who are not household names. The voices we don't hear are the ones who need a voice that you can listen to today. We say that elder justice is a bipartisan issue. Leaders have included Senator Hatch, Representative King, as well as former Senator Lincoln and Representative Emanuel to name a few. Again on a bipartisan basis this Congress reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act. The reality is that elder abuse is also a women's issue. The average victim is an older woman living alone between 75 and 80 at a time when the Census reports that almost 50 percent of all women over 75 now live alone\u2014another reason to act now to get resources into elder abuse prevention. If one in ten seniors in your State were victims of crime, you would likely respond by seeking more support for law enforcement as first responders in the fight against crime. Elder abuse hits one out of every ten seniors. Let us give needed support to Adult Protective Services who are the first responders for elder abuse. Our Coalition also supports funding the Social Services Block Grant the only funding source for Adult Protective Services today at the level proposed in the Presi-dent's budget. Just as 40 years ago when witnesses came to this Subcommittee seeking initial funding for the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974 we come today 457 **The positions of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance reflect a consensus of 75 percent or more of its members. This testimony reflects the consensus of the Alliance and does not necessarily represent the position of individual Alliance member organizations. The Eldercare Workforce Alliance is a project of The Advocacy Fund. asking for this initial $25 million for elder justice. What is common? A victim of child abuse, like a victim of elder abuse, is never the same. The role of government should always be to help the vulnerable of all ages. Elder justice warrants considerably more than the requested $25 million. The Elder Justice Act also includes increased support for long term care ombudsmen as-sisting nursing home residents and funding forensic centers important to the pros-ecution of abusers. Since these are not included, please view the $25 million as a floor to build on, not a ceiling. We look forward to working with you on ensuring that this first time appropriations for elder justice provides us with the best possible value and positive outcomes. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ELDERCARE WORKFORCE ALLIANCE Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Moran, and Members of the Subcommittee: We are writing on behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance (EWA), which is com-prised of 30 national organizations united to address the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America. As the Subcommittee begins consid-eration of funding for programs in fiscal year 2015, the Alliance **urges you to pro- vide adequate funding for programs designed to increase the number of healthcare professionals prepared to care for America's growing senior population and to sup-port family caregivers in the essential role they play in this regard. Today's healthcare workforce is inadequate to meet the special needs of older Americans, many of whom have multiple chronic physical and mental health condi-tions and cognitive impairments. It is estimated that an additional 3.5 million trained healthcare workers will be needed by 2030 just to maintain the current level of access and quality. Without a national commitment to expand training and edu-cational opportunities, the workforce will be even more constrained in its ability to care for the growth in the elderly population as the baby boom generation ages. Re-flecting this urgency, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has identified ''enhancing geriatric/elder care training and expertise'' as one of its top five priorities. Of equal importance is supporting the legions of family caregivers who annually provide billions of hours of uncompensated care that allows older adults to remain in their homes and communities. The estimated economic value of family caregivers' unpaid care was approximately $450 billion in 2009. The number of Americans over age 65 is expected to reach 70 million by 2030, representing a 71 percent increase from today's 41 million older adults. That is why Title VII and Title VIII geriatrics programs and Administration for Community Liv-ing (ACL) programs that support family caregivers are so critical to ensure that there is a skilled eldercare workforce and knowledgeable, well-supported family caregivers available to meet the complex and unique needs of older adults. We hope you will support a total of $44.7 million in funding for geriatrics pro- grams in Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, $172.9 million in funding for programs administered by the Administration on Aging that support the vital role of family caregivers in providing care for older adults, and $3 million to convene a White House Conference on Aging. Specifically, we recommend the fol-lowing levels: \u2014$39.7 million for Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions million for Title VIII Comprehensive Education million for Family Caregiver Support Programs; and \u2014$3 million for a White House Conference on Aging. Geriatrics health profession training programs are integral to ensuring that America's healthcare workforce is prepared to care for the Nation's rapidly expand-ing population of older adults. In light of current fiscal constraints, EWA specifically requests $44.7 million in funding for the following programs administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Serv-ice Act. In the 2012-2013 Academic Year, these geriatrics and gerontology programs provided training to more than 200,000 individuals. Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions: Appropriations Request: $39.7 Million Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions programs are the only Federal programs that seek to increase the number of faculty with geriatrics expertise in a variety 458 of disciplines. These programs offer critically important training for the healthcare workforce overall to improve the quality of care for America's elders. \u2014Geriatric Academic Career Awards (GACA) .\u2014The goal of this program is to pro- mote the development of academic clinician educators in geriatrics. Program Ac-complishments: In the In the Academic Year 2012-2013, the GACA program funded 62 full-time junior faculty. These awardees delivered over 1,100 inter-professional continuing education courses specific to geriatric-related topics to over 53,000 students and providers. Additionally, they presented on research and other topics at 215 local, State and national conference and published 108 peer-reviewed publications. HRSA, through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), ex-panded the awards to be available to more disciplines. EWA strongly supports this expansion and requests adequate funding to reflect this change. Currently, new awardees are selected only every 5 years. To meet the need for clinician educators in all disciplines, EWA believes that awards should be made available to clinical educators annually in order to develop an adequate number of faculty that can provide geriatric instruction and training. EWA's fiscal year 2015 re-quest of $5.5 million will support GAC Awardees in their development as clini-cian educators. \u2014Geriatric Education Centers (GEC) .\u2014The goal of Geriatric Education Centers is to provide high quality interprofessional geriatric education and training to cur-rent members of the health professions workforce, including geriatrics special- ists and non-specialists. Program Accomplishments: In Academic Year 2012- 2013, the 45 GEC grantees developed and provided over 1,650 different con-tinuing education and clinical training offerings to more than 135,000 health professionals, students, faculty, and practitioners, significantly exceeding the program's performance target. Three quarters of the continuing education offer-ings were interprofessional in focus. Of the sites that offered clinical training sessions, 2 out of every 5 of these sites were in a medically underserved commu-nity and/or Health Professional Shortage Area. The GECs provide much needed education and training. Our funding request of $20 million includes support for the core work of these 45 GECs. \u2014Alzheimer's Disease Prevention, Education, and Outreach Program (GECs) .\u2014 These funds, included in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request, allow HRSA to expand efforts to provide interprofessional continuing education to healthcare practitioners on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, utilizing the already existing Geriatric Education Centers (GECs). EWA Requests $5.3 million. \u2014Geriatric Training Program for Physicians, Dentists, (GTPD) and Behavioral and Mental Health Professions .\u2014The goal of the GTPD program is to increase the number and quality of clinical faculty with geriatrics and cultural com-petence, including retraining mid-career faculty in geriatrics. Program Accom-plishments: In Academic Year 2012-2013, a total of 64 physicians-including psychiatrists-, dentists, and psychologists, were supported through this fellow-ship program. Fellows delivered over 275 courses to 5,600 trainees. This pro-gram supports training additional faculty in medicine, dentistry, and behavioral and mental health so that they have the expertise, skills, and knowledge to teach geriatrics and gerontology to the next generation of health professionals in their disciplines. EWA's funding request of $8.9 million will support this im-portant faculty development program. Title VIII Geriatrics Nursing Workforce Development Programs: Appropriations Re- quest: $5 million Title VIII programs, administered by the HRSA, are the primary source of Fed- eral funding for advanced education nursing, workforce diversity, nursing faculty loan programs, nurse education, practice and retention, comprehensive geriatric education, loan repayment, and scholarship. \u2014Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program .\u2014The goal of this program is to provide quality geriatric education and training to individuals caring for the el-derly. Program Accomplishments: In Academic Year 2012-2013, a total of 18 00Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP) grantees provided a va-riety of services, including over 150 different continuing education courses to over 11,600 trainees. This program supports additional training for nurses who care for the elderly; development and dissemination of curricula relating to geri-atric care; training of faculty in geriatrics; and continuing education for nurses practicing in geriatrics. \u2014Traineeships for Advanced Practice Nurses .\u2014Through the ACA, the Comprehen- sive Geriatric Education Program was expanded to include advanced practice nurses who are pursuing long-term care, geropsychiatric nursing, or other nurs-459 ing areas that specialize in care of older adults. In Academic Year 2012-2013, a total of 74 grantees were awarded traineeships. One in every 4 grantee is con-sidered an underrepresented minority in their prospective profession. EWA's funding request of $5 million will support the education and training of individ-uals who provide geriatric care. Administration for Community Living Family Caregiver Support and White House Conference on Aging: Appropriations Request: $175.9 million These programs support caregivers, elders, and people with disabilities by pro- viding critical respite care and other support services for family caregivers, training and recruitment of care workers and volunteers, information and outreach, coun-seling, and other supplemental services. \u2014Family Caregiver Support Services .\u2014This program provides a range of support services to approximately 700,000 family and informal caregivers annually in States, including counseling, respite care, training, and assistance with locating services that help family caregivers in caring for their loved ones at home for as long as possible. EWA requests $154.5 million. \u2014Native American Caregiver Support .\u2014This program provides a range of services to Native American caregivers, including information and outreach, access as-sistance, individual counseling, support groups and training, respite care and other supplemental services. EWA requests $6.4 million. \u2014Alzheimer's Disease Support Services: .\u2014One critical focus of this program is to support the family caregivers who provide countless hours of unpaid care, there-by enabling their family members with dementia to continue living in the com-munity. Funds go towards evidence-based interventions and expand the demen-tia-capable home and community-based services, enabling older adults to re-main in the community for as long as possible. EWA requests $9.5 million. \u2014Lifespan Respite Care .\u2014This program funds grants to improve the quality of and access to respite care for family caregivers of children or adults of any age with special needs. EWA requests $2.5 million. \u2014White House Conference on Aging .\u2014As recommended by the bi-partisan Com- mission on Long-Term Care, the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request in-cludes $3 million for the convening of a decennial White House Conference on Aging to bring together stakeholders and consumers from across the country to discuss the range of aging issues they face. EWA requests $3 million. On behalf of the members of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, we commend you on your past support for geriatrics workforce programs and ask that you join us in supporting the eldercare workforce at this critical time\u2014for all older Americans de-serve quality care, now and in the future. Thank you for your consideration.

Founded in 1970, ENA develops and disseminates education and practice standards and guidelines, and affords consultation to both private and public entities regarding emergency nurses and their practice. ENA has a great in-terest in the work of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Sub-committee and especially its efforts to improve the quality of emergency care for pa-tients in the United States. For fiscal year 2015, ENA respectfully requests $28 million for Trauma and Emer- gency Care Programs (HHS; De-velopment programs (HHS; HRSA), $21.116 million for the Emergency Medical Services for Children program (HHS; HRSA), $30.1 million to fund poison control centers (HHS; HRSA), $150 million for the National Institute of Nursing Research (HHS; NIH), and $8.927 million for Rural Health\u2014Access to Emergency Devices (HHS; HRSA). TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY CARE PROGRAMS Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons younger than 44 and the fourth- leading cause of death for all ages. In States with an established trauma system, patients are 20 percent more likely to survive a traumatic injury. Victims of trau-matic injury treated at a Level I trauma center are 25 percent more likely to survive than those treated at a general hospital. 460 Our trauma and emergency medical systems are designed to transport seriously injured individuals to trauma centers quickly. However, due to a lack of financial resources, 45 million Americans do not have access to a major trauma center within the ''golden hour'' following an injury when chances of survival are highest. Trauma and emergency care programs, which are authorized under the Public Health Service Act, provide much-needed money to the States to develop and en-hance of trauma systems. These programs are critical to the efficient delivery of services through trauma centers, as well as to the development of regionalized sys-tems of trauma and emergency care that ensure timely access for injured patients to appropriate facilities. This modest investment can yield substantial returns in terms of cost efficiencies and, most importantly, saved lives. Therefore, ENA respectfully requests $28 million in fiscal year 2015 for trauma and emergency care programs. NURSING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS The nursing profession faces significant challenges to ensure that there will be an adequate number of qualified nurses to meet the growing healthcare needs of Amer-icans. It is estimated that 80 million Baby Boomers turned 65 last year. This grow-ing elderly population will seek healthcare services in a multitude of settings and the care they depend upon will require a highly educated and skilled nursing work-force. A 2014 projection from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2013-2014 Em-ployment Outlook Handbook anticipates that the number of practicing RNs will grow 19 percent by 2022. The aging of the Baby Boom generation will deplete the nursing ranks as well. During the next 10 to 15 years, approximately one-third of the current nurse work-force will reach retirement age. The retirement of these experienced nurses has the potential to create a serious deficit in the nursing pipeline. At the same time, our colleges cannot keep up with the demand for new nurses. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing's (AACN) 2013-2014 Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate Programs in Nursing survey, 78,089 qualified appli-cations were turned away from nursing schools in 2013 alone. Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development programs address these factors and help support the training of qualified nurses. They not only enhance nursing edu-cation at all levels, from entry-level to graduate study, but they also support nurs-ing schools that educate nurses for practice in rural and medically underserved com-munities. Another important part of Title VIII is the Faculty Loan Program which is critical to alleviating the large shortage in nursing faculty. Overall, more than 80,000 nurses and nursing students were trained and educated last year with the help of Title VIII nursing workforce development programs. Therefore, ENA respectfully requests $251 million in fiscal year 2015 for the Nursing Workforce Development programs authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN The Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) program is the only Fed- eral program that focuses specifically on improving the pediatric components of the emergency medical services (EMS) system. EMSC aims to ensure state-of-the-art emergency medical care for ill and injured children or adolescents; that pediatric services are well integrated into an EMS system backed by optimal resources; and that the entire spectrum of emergency services is provided to children and adoles-cents no matter where they live, attend school, or travel. The Federal investment in the EMSC program produces a wide array of benefits to children's health through EMSC State Partnership Grants, EMSC Targeted Issue Grants, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the National EMSC Data Analysis Resource Center. Therefore, ENA respectfully requests $21.116 million in fiscal year 2015 for the EMSC program. POISON CONTROL CENTERS Poisoning is the second most common form of unintentional death in the United States. In 2009, 31,768 deaths nationwide were attributed to unintentional poi-soning. Children are especially vulnerable to injury by poisoning and each day 300 children are treated for poisoning in emergency departments across the country and two die. The Nation's 56 poison control centers handle 3.4 million calls each year, includ- ing approximately 680,000 calls from nurses and doctors who rely on poison centers for an immediate assessment and expert advice on poisoning cases. 461 Not only are America's network of poison centers invaluable for treating victims of poisonings, but the work of the centers also results in substantial savings to our healthcare system. About 90 percent of people who call with poison emergencies are treated at home and do not have to visit an emergency department. In more severe poisoning cases, the expertise provided by poison control centers can decrease the length of hospital stays. It has been estimated that every dollar spent on America's poison control centers saves $13.39 in healthcare costs and lost productivity. The positive impact to the Federal budget is also significant. A 2012 study by the Lewin Group found that poison control centers resulted in $313.5 million in savings to Medicare and $390.2 million in savings to Medicaid. Therefore, ENA respectfully requests $30.1 million in fiscal year 2015 for poison control centers THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH (NINR) As one of the 27 Institutes and Centers at the NIH, NINR funds research that lays the groundwork for evidence-based nursing practice. NINR's mission is to pro-mote and improve the health of individuals, families, communities, and populations. The Institute supports and conducts clinical and basic research on health and ill-ness to build the scientific foundation for clinical practice, prevent disease and dis-ability, manage and eliminate symptoms caused by illness, and improve palliative and end-of-life care. NINR nurse-scientists examine ways to improve care models to deliver safe, high- quality, and cost-effective health services to the Nation. Our country must look to-ward prevention as a way of reducing healthcare expenditures and improving out-comes. The work of NINR is an important part of this effort. Moreover, NINR helps to provide needed faculty to support the education of fu- ture generations of nurses. Training programs at NINR develop future nurse-re-searchers, many of whom also serve as faculty in our Nation's nursing schools. Therefore, ENA respectfully requests $150 million in fiscal year 2015 for the NINR. RURAL AND COMMUNITY ACCESS TO EMERGENCY DEVICES PROGRAM Fewer than 10 percent of people who suffer a cardiac arrest outside of a hospital setting survive. According to a 2011 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, immediate CPR and prompt defibrillation using an automated external defibrillator (AED) can more than double a patient's chance of survival. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)'s Rural and Commu- nity Access to Emergency Devices Program saves lives of patients with cardiac ar-rest. Between August 1, 2008, and July 31, 2010, nearly 800 cardiac arrest victims were reportedly saved through this program. Funding for this initiative is used to buy AEDs, locate them in public places where cardiac arrests are more likely to happen, and instruct lay rescuers and first responders in their use. Between March 1, 2010, and Feb. 28, 2011, 3,928 AEDs were placed and 28,776 people were trained in their use. Therefore, ENA respectfully requests $8.927 million in fiscal year 2015 for the Rural and Community Access to Emergency Devices Program. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THEENDOCRINE SOCIETY The Endocrine Society is pleased to submit the following testimony regarding fis- cal year 2015 Federal appropriations for biomedical research, with an emphasis on appropriations for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Endocrine Society is the world's largest and most active professional organization of endocrinologists representing more than 17,000 members worldwide. Our organization is dedicated to promoting excellence in research, education, and clinical practice in the field of endocrinology. The Society's membership includes thousands of basic and clinical scientists who receive Federal support from the NIH to fund endocrine-related re-search on topics such as diabetes, cancer, fertility, aging, obesity and bone disease. The Society's membership also includes clinicians who depend on new scientific ad-vances to better treat and cure their patients' diseases. As a result of Federal in-vestment in endocrine research, individuals with diabetes have made dramatic im-provements in managing their disease, and the obesity rate for children age 2 to 462 1Casagrande et al., ''The Prevalence of Meeting A1C, Blood Pressure, and LDL Goals Among People With Diabetes, 1988-2010.''

United for Medical Research. (2012). 5 years old has dropped 43 percent.1,2The Endocrine Society recommends that the NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015. This funding recommendation represents the minimum investment necessary to avoid further erosion of national research priorities and global preeminence, while allowing the NIH's budget to keep pace with biomedical inflation. Sustained investment by the United States Federal government in biomedical re- search has dramatically advanced the health and improved the lives of the Amer-ican people. The United States' NIH-supported scientists represent the vanguard of researchers making fundamental biological discoveries and developing applied therapies that advance our understanding of, and ability to treat human disease. In the past year NIH funded scientists have made fundamental insights into how mild traumatic brain injury causes brain damage; identified potential drug targets for Parkinson's disease; and identified a safe and protective candidate malaria vac-cine. 3In the field of endocrinology, NIH-funded researchers have made remarkable contributions in areas of critical national interest, for example: \u2014Endocrinologists have made insightful discoveries describing newly understood contributors to body weight and obesity.4Obesity is a growing national concern, with related medical costs in the United States as high as $190 billion in 2005 alone. 5 \u2014Endocrinologists have discovered that higher vitamin D levels are associated with increased mobility and physical function in older individuals. As the popu-lation of the United States increasingly lives longer, this research has the po-tential to dramatically improve the quality of life for Americans. 6 \u2014Endocrinologists are also at the leading edge of research on testosterone ther- apy and maintaining appropriate levels of sex hormones. For instance, endocrinologists are investigating links between testosterone levels and heart disease in men. 7 These discoveries represent but a fraction of the contributions made by endocrinologists and other NIH funded scientists in the past year. The foundation for these research products are the NIH research grants that support the basic and clinical research done by scientists. Since 2004, the number of NIH research grants to scientists in the United States has been declining. Consequently, the likelihood of a scientist with a highly-regarded grant application successfully being awarded a grant has dropped from 31.5 percent in 2000 to an historic low of 16.8 percent in 2013. 8This means that experienced scientists are increasingly spending time writing grant applications instead of applying their expertise to productive research. Additionally, younger scientists struggle to find a job in the United States that makes use of the unique skills generated during graduate training. The lack of sustained government support compounded by austerity measures such as sequestration has created an environment that is leading to a ''brain drain'' as brilliant scientists pursue other careers or leave the United States to develop impactful research products elsewhere. In 2013, the number of NIH supported sci-entists declined significantly, with nearly 1,000 NIH scientists dropping out of the workforce. 9NIH scientists run labs that support high-quality jobs and education while generating breakthrough innovations. In 2011, the NIH directly or indirectly supported over 432,000 jobs across the country. 10As a result of sequestration, 463 11''NIH State Information Factsheets.'' http://www.faseb.org/Policy-and-Government-Affairs/ Advocacy-on-Capitol-Hill/Advocacy-Resources-for-Scientists/NIH-State-Information-Fact-sheets.aspx.

States such as Georgia and Connecticut lost $62 million and $32 million respec- tively.11 We may never be able to quantify the opportunities we have missed to improve the health and economic status of the United States due to persistent underinvest-ment in research. We do know however, that when ''laboratories lose financing, they lose people, ideas, innovations and patient treatments.'' 12Based on the personal sto- ries of researchers who have been forced to curtail research programs, we know that research programs to understand how genetics can influence heart disease, develop therapeutic treatments for Parkinson's disease, and evaluate the effect of metal con-taminants on reproductive health; among many others, are delayed or terminated. 13 As the world's largest source of funding for medical research, the NIH is vitally important to the United States' global preeminence in research. However, this glob-al preeminence is being tested due to flat funding that has reduced the inflation- adjusted budget of the NIH to a level that is nearly 22 percent below the NIH budg-et in fiscal year 2003. 14As a consequence of this underinvestment, the United States' global share of pharmaceutical industry output has declined, our global share of biopharmaceutical patents has declined, and our trade balance in pharma-ceutical products is worsening. 15While the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and omni- bus appropriations bill have provided some much needed additional resources, over-all levels of funding remain well below the $32 billion required for adequate, sus-tainable growth in biomedical research. We live during an age of tremendous scientific opportunity that can only be real- ized through Federal funding of biomedical research. Researchers are only begin-ning to harness the power of big data to solve complicated problems. Innovative new experiments and clinical research hold promise to solve some of the United States' greatest medical challenges and discover new ways to improve our quality of life. Government support is critical to these opportunities, and we encourage the Appro-priations Committee to actively support promising and innovative research. As the Appropriations Committee considers funding for the NIH, the Endocrine Society also asks the Committee to encourage the NIH to look at ways to increase data reporting to address gaps in gender and sex differences in research. Sex dif-ferences need to be acknowledged as a critical biological variable. 16In addition to including more women in clinical research, the Endocrine Society believes sex dif-ferences should be c as part of the design of all basic biological studies and clinical research. If the NIH required researchers to consider sex differences in grant appli-cations when appropriate, and incorporate data on sex as a biological variable in animal and human studies, more appropriate conclusions could be drawn from basic research, and clinical research would provide more representative data on safety and efficacy of drugs. 17 The Endocrine Society remains deeply concerned about the future of biomedical research in the United States without sustained support from the Federal govern-ment. Flat funding in recent years, combined with the impact of sequestration, threaten the Nation's scientific enterprise and make adequate fiscal year 2015 ap-propriations for the NIH increasingly important. The Society strongly supports in-creased Federal funding for biomedical research in order to provide the additional resources needed to enable American scientists to address scientific opportunities and maintain the country's status as the preeminent research engine. The Endo-crine Society therefore asks that the NIH receive at least $32 billion in fiscal year 2015. 464 1CDC DVBD factsheet: http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/pdf/dvbd lfactsheet.pdf. 2Tauxe, GM, et al.

ESA requests a robust fis-cal year 2015 appropriation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including increased funding for insect-borne disease research at the National Institute of Al-lergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The Society also supports increased invest-ment in the core infectious diseases budget and the global health budget within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in order to fund scientific activi-ties related to vector-borne diseases. Advances in the biological sciences, including the field of entomology, help to ad- dress some of our most pressing societal needs related to environmental and human health. Certain species of insects carry, spread, and transmit an array of infectious diseases that threaten populations across the globe, including those in the United States as well as U.S. military personnel undertaking missions abroad. Insect-borne diseases can present an especially challenging health problem; few vaccines have been developed against them, and insects are often difficult to control and can de-velop resistance to insecticides. The risk of emerging infectious diseases grows as global travel becomes easier and environmental factors continue to change. For ex-ample, West Nile virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and was not present in the U.S. before 1999, infected 5,674 Americans in 2012. 1Entomological research to understand the biological relationship between insect vectors and the infectious diseases they carry\u2014such as dengue, malaria, West Nile virus, and Lyme disease\u2014 can significantly contribute to our ability to monitor and predict outbreaks, prevent disease spread and transmission, and more reliably diagnose and treat infection. Given the important role that insect vectors play in impacting human health, ESA urges the subcommittee to support vector-borne disease research programs that in-corporate the entomological sciences as part of a comprehensive approach to ad-dressing infectious diseases. NIH, the Nation's premier medical research agency, advances human health by funding research on basic human biology and disease and the development of pre-vention and treatment strategies. In fiscal year 2012, about 84 percent of NIH fund-ing was competitively awarded to scientists at approximately 2,500 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions across the Nation. As one of NIH's 27 institutes and centers, NIAID conducts and supports fundamental and applied research related to the understanding, prevention, and treatment of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. One example of NIAID-funded research on infec-tious diseases is a recent study examining the mechanism by which certain species of mosquitoes known to transmit dengue and malaria are attracted to humans. The scientists discovered that specific types of nerve cells in the insects act as sensitive detectors of human odors. With this knowledge, the researchers were able to iden-tify safe and natural chemical compounds with the potential to neutralize or over-whelm the specific insect nerve cells, a discovery that could have implications for the control of mosquitoes and their associated diseases. 2In another recent study supported by NIAID, researchers determined that live, disease-free ticks can be used as a safe tool for testing for the presence of Lyme disease bacteria in patients who have completed antibiotic therapy. 3To ensure funding for future groundbreaking projects like these, ESA requests increased funding for NIAID and encourages the committee to support insect-borne disease research at NIH. CDC, serving as the Nation's health protection agency, conducts science and pro- vides health information to prevent and respond to infectious diseases and other global health threats, whether naturally arising or related to bioterrorism. Within the core infectious diseases budget of CDC, the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases (DVBD) seeks to protect our Nation from the threat of viruses and bacteria trans-mitted primarily by mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. DVBD's mission is carried out by a staff of experts in several scientific disciplines, including entomology. For example, among the activities supported by DVBD are the ArboNET surveillance system for 465 mosquito-borne diseases and the TickNET system for tick-borne diseases. ArboNET is a nationwide network that monitors West Nile virus and other diseases through activities such as the collection and testing of mosquitoes, and TickNET is a part-nership between 16 States to track tick-borne-diseases like Lyme disease and test preventions. Furthermore, a component of CDC's global health budget supports ac-tivities on parasitic diseases and malaria; this includes the maintenance of a global reference insectary that houses colonies of mosquitoes from around the world to be used by the agency for studies on malaria transmission. Given the important con-tributions of CDC, ESA requests that the committee provide increased support for CDC programs addressing vector-borne diseases and malaria. ESA, headquartered in Annapolis, Maryland, is the largest organization in the world serving the professional and scientific needs of entomologists and individuals in related disciplines. Founded in 1889, ESA has nearly 7,000 members affiliated with educational institutions, health agencies, private industry, and government. Members are researchers, teachers, extension service personnel, administrators, marketing representatives, research technicians, consultants, students, pest man-agement professionals, and hobbyists. Thank you for the opportunity to offer the Entomological Society of America's sup- port for HHS research programs. [This statement was submitted by Frank G. Zalom, PhD, President, Entomological Society of America.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF FAMILIES & F RIENDS OF CAREFACILITY RESIDENTS Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for this opportunity to provide information to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human Services Education & Related Agencies. This is a letter-request that the Subcommittee cease funding Federal programs which use public funds to achieve public policies of deinstitutionalization of persons identified as benefiting from congregate (institutional) care, typically those with se-vere forms of cognitive-developmental disabilities. I am the mother and co-guardian of an adult son, aged 45, who from birth has lived with the effects of severe brain injuries. John is a large, mobile and nonverbal man with pica behavior who functions on the mental level of a young toddler. Our son has slight or little awareness of danger and his direct care is beyond our fam-ily's capacities. For many years John's safe home has been a state-operated con-gregate care program, an intermediate care facility for persons with intellectual dis-abilities (formerly known as a medical diagnosis of mental retardation). The future viability of John's home is in jeopardy due to the undermining work of federally funded entities and programs in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv-ices and the Department of Justice/Civil Rights Division. I represent as public affairs chairman Families and Friends of Care Facility Resi- dents (FF/CFR), Arkansas' statewide parent-guardian association. FF/CFR is an all- volunteer organization; we employ no lobbyist; we receive no public funds. I have reviewed the testimonies of Department of Health and Human Services representatives presented before this subcommittee for the past several years. DHHS did not disclose that the Department is engaged in a social experiment to dismantle the States' residential safety net programs for persons who have been ad-judicated incompetent and that the Department is using public funds to support or-ganizations which lobby decision-makers to deinstitutionalize persons who are with-out self-preservation skills, who cannot assist in their own care and who cannot communicate their hurts and needs or who can do so only in limited ways. The following are examples of how government dollars are spent in the wrong way by the Department of Health and Human Services: (1) National Council on Disability (NCD), an independent Federal agency engaged in disability policy recommendations. On Tuesday, October 23, 2012, the National Council on Disability (NCD) released its policy project\u2014''Deinstitutionalization: Unfinished Business.'' The press release read: ''NCD Launches Toolkit to Speed Closure of State-Run Institutions.'' Although NCD is a Federal agency, it has no congressional oversight and is not accountable for its actions, except as Congress may provide. Prior to releasing its deinstitu-tionalization policy recommendations and documents, there were no public hearings or Notice to those most affected. There was no public in-put process. Arkansas' statewide parent-guardian association, FF-CFR, is comprised of volunteer advocates who work in behalf of the vulnerable people who live and receive services at our State's five human development centers (HDCs). Arkansas' five HDCs provide 24/ 466 7 care for 950 individuals. Over 64 percent of the residents function in the profound range of cognitive ability. We object to use of a Federal agency/Federal funds to pro-mote public policies which are harmful. We object to empowerment of Federal agen-cies to formulate public policies in camera without public hearings and without the easy involvement of those most affected. NCD inappropriately collaborates with oth-ers in promoting its national de-institutionalization agenda out of the public eye. REQUEST: Public funds should not be used to support National Council on Dis- ability and its extreme agendas. Please discontinue its funding. (2) Programs funded under Public Law 106 402, Developmental Disabilities Assist- ance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act). The DD Act funds three discretionary pro-grams which operate in every State: (1) State Councils on Developmental Dis-abilities, (2) Protection & Advocacy Systems for Developmental Disabilities (P&As) and (3) University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities. The DD Act also funds a fourth program, Projects of National Significance. The four DD Act programs are administered by DHHS/Adm. on Community Living/ Adm. on Intellectual-Developmental Disabilities Through litigation, lobbying and other strategies, DD Act programs and their na- tional organizations have used and are using public funds to achieve forced-dein-stitutionalization of individuals with profound cognitive-developmental disabilities from their congregate care homes and the closures of Medicaid-certified public facili-ties for these individuals with profound disabilities. The DD Act programs' adminis- trative office (Adm-IDD) has embraced an extreme agenda and is not responsive to the complaints and concerns of families, friends and legal guardians of individuals with disabilities who require close 24/7 care. The DD Act was last re-authorized in 2000; its current authorization ended in 2007. At the last reauthorization, there was no public hearing and no opportunity to object to the ways in which grantees (State Councils on DD, Protection & Advo-cacy (P&A) systems and University Centers on DD) were collaborating with each other and with others for use of Federal appropriations to undermine and close con-gregate care programs for those persons with the most severe forms of develop-mental disabilities. There have been no hearings on reauthorization of the DD Act where families might participate and provide information about and objections to the programs' activities. The Arkansas DD Act P&A system has: (1) joined with Arc in a Federal lawsuit to close all Arkansas human development centers (HDCs), (2) brought 3 Federal lawsuits in succession seeking to change our AR HDC admission and discharge policies naming HDC residents as plaintiffs without notice or consent of their legal guardians (in two of the cases the AR P&A sought class certification with no opportunity for residents to opt out of the class); (3) filed a complaint with Civil Rights Division-U.S. Dept. of Justice regarding care at our HDCs without con-sulting families of HDC residents and cheered in the media when DOJ brought a systems-change lawsuit against all HDCs; (4) testified against AR HDC funding be-fore State legislative panels; (5) organized a public rally calling on the AR Governor to close one of our HDCs; (6) denigrated congregate care and AR HDC programs in the media during a Federal trial, USA v. State of AR (Conway HDC); (7) provided erroneous information to AR policy makers regarding cost of care and the U.S. Su-preme Court decision in Olmstead v. L. C. (119 S. Ct. 2176); and (8) sent financial support to its Washington D.C.-based national organization, National Disability Rights Network (NDRN), an organization with no oversight which lobbies the Ad-ministration, Congress and CMS, collaborating with other organizations in cam-paigns to shift Medicaid funding from congregate care programs for persons with life-long cognitive and other developmental disabilities. Most recently (January & February, 2014), the Arkansas DD Act P&A in testimony before a legislative panel and in a letter to members of the State legislature worked against funding for cap-ital improvements at our State's five human development centers. Families with whom I correspond in other States report that DD Act programs have used grant funds to fund other organizations to plan and lobby for the closure of State-operated congregate care programs for individuals with cognitive-developmental disabilities. In November and December, 2012 , the national organizations for two DD Act pro-grams (Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) and protection and advocacy (National Disability Rights Network\u2014NDRN) led the work of lobbying to prevent the mark-up of H.R. 2032 in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee. Had 2032 passed, some egregious protection and advocacy activities employing litigation as a tactic to undermine and close congregate care centers might have been addressed and prohibited. REQUEST: Public funds should not be used to support the DD Act Programs' ex- treme agendas of deinstitutionalization. Please discontinue funding the groups' harmful deinstitutionalization work. 467 (3) DHHS Financial incentive grants\u2014Money Follows the Person (MFP), Balance In- centive Payment Plan (BIP), Community First Choice Option (CFCO) Through generous financial incentive demonstration grants (Money Follows the Person, Balance Incentive Plan, Community First Choice Option), CMS is promoting thoughtless policies of de-institutionalization for persons with developmental disabil-ities by funding generous incentive grants for one needed program (home and com-munity based waiver care) but not another needed program (licensed safety-net con-gregate care facilities). The majority of persons with cognitive-developmental dis-abilities can and are being served through States' home and community based wavier programs. There is no ''institutional bias'' in our State of Arkansas for per-sons with developmental disabilities: 74.2 percent of Medicaid dollars are spent on home and community based waiver programs. Over 4,000 individuals with develop-mental disabilities are served in Arkansas' community-based waiver programs versus approximately 950 residents in the State's public safety-net institutions for people with developmental disabilities. For clinically complex cases and for people with profound cognitive-and other severe forms of developmental disabilities requir-ing 24/7 supervision whose needs cannot be successfully met at home, or whose fam-ilies can no longer provide their care, the option of institutional programs such as Arkansas' Human Development Centers (HDCs) is life-saving. HDCs are cost-effi-cient and they also provide a proven safe model of long term care. When all costs are taken into account, there are no cost savings to shift from institutional care to community care for this vulnerable population. Persons with little or no awareness of danger who cannot or who cannot adequately communicate their hurts and needs will be at greater risk of abuse, exploitation and death when they are forced from their safe congregate care homes. The testimony of Secretary HHS Kathleen Sebelius before House Committee on Appropriations (April 25, 2013, ''Protecting Vulnerable Populations'') does not comport with our family's experiences with the outcomes of DHS/CMS financial incentive grants and other DHHS de-institutional-ization programs. The push by CMS to entice States through financial rewards to shift from providing care for persons in specialized residential programs does not comport with realities in the field of long-term care. The American Medical Associa-tion (AMA) has designated persons with intellectual\u2014developmental disabilities (formerly termed mental retardation) as a medically underserved population. The AMA Policy (CMS Rep. 3-1-11) ''encourages support for healthcare facilities whose primary mission is to meet the healthcare needs of persons with profound develop-mental disabilities.'' The National Crime Victimization Survey (Feb. 2014) found that ''Individuals with disabilities encountered violent crime at nearly three times the rate of those in the general population ..... Those with cognitive disabilities had the highest rate of victimization and about half of violent crime victims with disabilities had multiple conditions.'' The use by CMS of public funds\u2014through financial incentive grants\u2014to reward States when they shift Medicaid long-term care funding from institutional care pro-grams to community programs which generally have less oversight and account-ability is misguided and dangerous. Families of individuals who require close care had little or no opportunity to review, comment and object that CMS incentive grants favor one needed program over another critically needed program. The exten-sion of Federal funding for Money Follows the Person (MFP) grants and Community First Choice Option (CFCO) are optional programs offered to the States in the volu-minous Affordable Care Act, inserted without adequate review, without debate, and without adequate notice to families most affected. Extension of MFP, BIP, and CFCO were created by DHHS out of the public eye with inadequate opportunity for the public to review, comment or object. DHHS is too far removed from the realities which families understand and which are based on their years of experiences with their disabled family members. REQUEST: Public funds should not be used to promote DHHS policies of dein- stitutionalization. Please address the unfair, unsafe CMS de-institutionalization in-centive grants. SUMMARY Policy decisions which destroyed the Nation's safety net programs for persons with mental illness are now understood to be disastrous and ill-conceived for a small but significant percent of persons living with severe, chronic mental illness. Please resist funding DHHS programs and policies which promote harmful dein- stitutionalization of persons with severest forms of developmental disabilities. My son and his peers cannot appear before committees, engage in protests or advocate for their health and safety. Please use your powerful authority to direct DHHS to cease its partisan use of public funds to achieve deinstitutionalization. 468 [This statement was submitted by Carole L. Sherman, Arkansas' statewide par- ent-guardian association.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SOCIETIES FOR EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) respect- fully requests a minimum of $32 billion in fiscal year 2015 for the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH) within the Department of Health and Human Services. In- creasing the NIH budget to $32 billion would support vital initiatives to train the next generation of scientists, and fund at least 600 additional competing research grants. FASEB, a federation of 26 scientific societies, represents more than 115,000 life scientists and engineers, making it the largest coalition of biomedical research asso-ciations in the United States. Our mission is to advance health and welfare by pro-moting progress and education in biological and biomedical sciences. NIH has produced an outstanding legacy of discoveries that have generated new knowledge, improved health, and saved lives. Many of these advances arose from investigations designed to explain basic molecular, cellular, and biological mecha-nisms. In addition, research supported by NIH led to innovative technologies and created entirely new global industries resulting in economic growth and new, high- tech jobs. As a result of our prior investment in NIH, we have reduced the death toll of many diseases and reduced the disability and suffering from many others. For ex-ample, U.S. death rates from heart disease and stroke have decreased by more than 60 percent in the last 50 years, the rate of acute hepatitis B has been reduced by 80 percent since the 1980's, and the proportion of older people with chronic disabil-ities has dropped by one-third over the last quarter century. Research funded by NIH helped develop new treatments that have significantly reduced the trans-mission of human immunodeficiency virus from mother to child and provided in-sights into traumatic brain injury. In addition, with the completion of the Human Genome Project and subsequent technological advances in rapidly sequencing DNA, scientists have been able to identify genes that are responsible for more than half of the 7,000 rare diseases known to affect humans and evaluate the genetic composi-tion of various cancers with the hopes of pinpointing the most effective therapy for each individual patient. NIH-supported research is continuing to produce the insights that are needed for tomorrow's improvements in health and clinical care. Recent discoveries include: \u2014Advances in Treating Melanoma: Years of basic research supported by NIH have provided insights into biological changes that occur in the development of cancer, including the observation that a protein called b-Raf appears in a mu-tated form in more than 50 percent of melanomas, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Studies showing that this protein plays a critical role in melanoma led pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs to inhibit mutant b-Raf. These drugs can s improve quality of life and prolong survival in the majority of pa-tients with advanced melanoma who harbor b-Raf mutations. Since most of these patients eventually relapse and die from their disease, studies are under-way to understand why melanomas become resistant to treatment. It is hoped that this will lead to new treatments that can overcome or bypass resistance, with the goal of achieving long-term remissions and cures. \u2014Developing Structure-Based Vaccines: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is re- sponsible for nearly 7 percent of deaths of infants under 12 months of age. It also causes death and disability in the elderly. NIH-funded research has illumi-nated many aspects of RSV infection and pathogenesis, yet an effective vaccine has remained elusive. Recently, investigators made a breakthrough by deter-mining the three-dimensional structure of an RSV protein required for cell entry. This structural information was then used to design a stabilized vaccine antigen that elicited high titers of protective antibodies in mice and non-human primates. In the next few years, this promising vaccine candidate will be tested in clinical trials, and it is hoped that this structure-based approach to vaccine design will be successful for other viruses, such as HIV-1. \u2014Testing New Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: In the 1990's, NIH supported a few aca- demic researchers to study molecules called glycans for their function in inflam-mation, the process the body uses to fight infection. In 2013, these studies came to fruition with the first tests of a new, glycan-based anti-inflammatory drug. In an initial test to fight inflammation during the painful crises that occur in sickle cell disease, both children and adult patients who got this treatment had 469 1Collins, F. (2013, December 24). Investing in the Nation's Health at NIH. Washington Post. shorter disease crises, spent less time in the hospital, and needed fewer nar- cotics for pain relief. This new drug that will benefit tens of thousands of people in the U.S. each year could never have been developed without NIH's invest-ment in exploratory basic research. \u2014Harnessing the Immune System to Fight Cancer: Science magazine named can- cer immunotherapy\u2014using the immune system to attack tumors\u2014the 2013 Breakthrough of the Year. The early work that led to the development of immunotherapy was made possible by NIH-funded research on many basic bio-logical processes, including the biology of T cells, a family of cells that are crit-ical to the immune system. Researchers discovered that when a certain receptor on the outside of T cells is activated, cells cannot mount an effective immune response. They then reasoned that if an antibody blocked the activation of this receptor, T cells could be induced to attack tumor cells. Ongoing clinical trials testing antibody immunotherapies in individuals found that tumors shrunk by almost 50 percent in 31 percent of those with melanoma and 29 percent in those with kidney cancer. Further Progress Depends on Sustained Investment Research supported by NIH advances our understanding of the nature of living systems and enables us to apply that knowledge to the improvement of human health. In a recent op-ed in The Washington Post, NIH Director Francis S. Collins, MD, PhD, wrote, ''Biomedical research is at a critical juncture\u2014a moment of excep-tional opportunities that demand exceptional attention if their promise is to be fully realized.'' 1But without continued support for basic biomedical research, Dr. Collins fears that we will miss out on new discoveries that will give us the next generation of cures and therapies for such conditions as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as a universal vaccine to protect adults and children against all flu strains without needing an annual shot. While the opportunities to increase our understanding of diseases and develop new therapies are unprecedented, a decade of flat-funding\u2014followed by $1.55 billion in sequestration cuts in fiscal year 2013\u2014have taken a significant toll on NIH's abil-ity to support research. In constant dollars (adjusted for inflation), the fiscal year 2013 budget for NIH was the lowest in thirteen years. The number of competing R01-equivalent grants, the primary mechanism for supporting investigator-initiated research, awarded each year fell by 34 percent between 2003 and 2013. The current situation is decimating the ranks of our scientific workforce, causing productive sci-entists to seek alternative careers and discouraging talented trainees from pursuing jobs in academic research. It surrenders our future leadership in medical research. As a first step toward a multi-year program of sustainable growth, FASEB rec- ommends a minimum of $32 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2015. Thank you for the opportunity to offer FASEB's fiscal year 2015 funding recommendation for NIH. PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHERYL FELAK Dear Committee Members: Thank you very much for the opportunity to submit personal and professional testimony to this committee. I am writing as a healthcare professional with an abundance of experience work- ing with clients and family members who experience life with developmental disabil-ities. I am also the parent of a young man who has profound developmental disabil-ities due to a rare genetic condition which is similar to pediatric Alzheimer's. I would like you to be aware that many of the advocacy agencies in this country (The Arc and it's many State and local chapters), Developmental Disability Councils and affiliates, all who receive Federal funds for advocacy, are forgetting that our citizens with developmental disabilities live on a continuum and have a large vari-ation in support needs. It is shameful that these so-called advocacy groups forget about those with the most profound needs, misinterpret the 1999 U.S. Supreme Court Olmstead decision on choice and community, and force their opinions regarding these issues discrimi-natory practices. It is a fact that people need communities\u2014yet why are these so called advocacy groups allowed to determine what ''community'' is for those with developmental dis-abilities. Rather than allowing choice and opportunities, they are restricting choice and opportunities to this group of people. This is discrimination. I am not aware of any other population which has ''community'' defined for them, which has funds for housing, medical care, education, vocational support tied to the 470 artificial definition of ''community'' which is made up for people with developmental disabilities. I believe it is time to go back and really read the Olmstead Decision\u2014not just take for granted what is heard because what is heard is not what the decision States. We need to honor this decision and stop discriminating against our most vul-nerable citizens. Thank you very much. [This statement was submitted by Cheryl Felak, RN, BSN, Because We Care\u2014 Beyond Inclusion.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FRIENDS OF THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION The Friends of HRSA is a non-partisan coalition of more than 170 national orga- nizations representing millions of public health and healthcare professionals, acad-emicians and consumers invested in HRSA's mission to improve health and achieve health equity. For fiscal year 2015, we recommend restoring HRSA's discretionary budget authority to the fiscal year 2010 level of $7.48 billion. We are deeply con-cerned that since fiscal year 2010, HRSA's discretionary budget authority has been cut by 19 percent in nominal dollars and 25 percent when adjusted for inflation. Funding for HRSA is far too low and keeping austerity measures in place will threaten the agency's ability to address the present and growing health needs of the U.S. Of additional concern, cuts will be compounded by the fact that multiple man-datory programs are set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2015. In the absence of continued mandatory funding for the National Health Service Corps Fund and Com-munity Health Center Fund, the committee will be faced with addressing these shortfalls in the following Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. The Nation faces a shortage of health professionals and continues to experience an ever growing, aging and increasingly diverse population, alongside health profes-sionals that are nearing retirement age. Additionally, national estimates of work-force shortages are often masked by significant distributional disparities\u2014particu-larly in rural and certain inner-city populations that experience greater shortages. By restoring funding to HRSA, the agency will be able to more effectively fill the primary and preventive care gaps for people living outside of the medical and eco-nomic mainstream through supporting a well prepared workforce and high-quality health services. HRSA operates programs in every State and U.S. territory and is a national lead- er in improving the health of Americans. HRSA programs have reduced AIDS-re-lated deaths through providing drug treatment regimens for people living with HIV and have the potential to prevent the spread of HIV by 96 percent by ensuring that people living with HIV have access to regular care and adhere to their antiretroviral medications. Less than 10 percent of people who experience a cardiac arrest outside of a hospital setting survive. HRSA provides rural communities with training and access to emergency devices which can more than double a patient's chance of sur-vival. HRSA has contributed to the decrease in infant mortality rate, a widely used indicator of the Nation's health, which is now at an all-time low. Most recently, pre-liminary data indicates that the infant mortality rate for black infants has de-creased, resulting in a narrowing of the gap that exists between racial groups. Now is the time to make a strong investment in a robust workforce and to im- prove access to care to continue achieving the health improvements HRSA has made and to pave the way for new achievements. The Nation only stands to benefit from a healthier population through a thriving workforce and reduced healthcare costs. Our recommendation is based on the need to continue improving the health of Americans by supporting critical HRSA programs including: \u2014Health professions programs support the education and training of primary care physicians, nurses, oral health professionals, optometrists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, public health personnel, mental and behavioral health professionals, pharmacists and other allied health pro-viders. With a focus on primary care and training in interdisciplinary, commu-nity-based settings, these are the only Federal programs focused on filling the gaps in the supply of health professionals, as well as improving the distribution and diversity of the workforce so health professionals are well-equipped to care for the Nation's growing, aging and increasingly diverse population. Addition-ally, HRSA provides interdisciplinary training to health professionals to accu-rately screen, diagnose and treat children with autism and other developmental disabilities. 471 \u2014Primary care programs support nearly 9,200 service delivery sites in every State and territory, improving access to preventive and primary care to more than 21 million patients in geographically isolated and economically distressed communities. Close to half of the health centers serve rural populations. The health centers coordinate a full spectrum of health services including medical, dental, behavioral and social services\u2014often delivering the range of services in one location. In addition, health centers target populations with special needs, including agricultural workers, homeless individuals and families and those liv-ing in public housing. Following health insurance reform in Massachusetts, health centers experienced a substantial increase in newly-insured patients. We expect the same will be true nationally, as health insurance expands to millions of Americans who were previously uninsured. Health centers and other pro-grams administered by HRSA will remain vital sources of care for patients and continue to reduce costs to the health system. \u2014Maternal and child health programs, including the Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, Healthy Start and others, support initiatives designed to promote optimal health, reduce disparities, combat infant mortality, prevent chronic conditions and improve access to quality healthcare for 43 million women and children. MCH programs help assure that nearly all babies born in the U.S. are screened for a range of serious genetic or metabolic diseases and that a community-based system of family centered services is available for co-ordinated long-term follow up for babies with a positive screen and for all chil-dren with special healthcare needs. \u2014HIV/AIDS programs provide the largest source of Federal discretionary funding assistance to States and communities most severely affected by HIV/AIDS. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program delivers comprehensive care, prescription drug assistance and support services for more than half a million low-income people impacted by HIV/AIDS, which accounts for about half of the total population liv-ing with the disease in the U.S. Additionally, the programs provide education and training for health professionals treating people with HIV/AIDS and work toward addressing the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on racial and eth-nic minorities. \u2014Family planning Title X services ensure access to a broad range of reproductive, sexual and related preventive healthcare for over 5 million poor and low-income women, men and adolescents at nearly 4,400 health centers nationwide. Healthcare services include patient education and counseling, cervical and breast cancer screening, sexually transmitted disease prevention education, testing and referral, as well as pregnancy diagnosis and counseling. This pro-gram helps improve maternal and child health outcomes and promotes healthy families. Often, Title X service sites provide the only continuing source of healthcare and education for many individuals. \u2014Rural health programs improve access to care for the nearly 50 million people living in rural areas that experience a persistent shortage of healthcare serv-ices. The Office of Rural Health Policy serves as the Nation's primary voice for programs and research on rural health issues. Rural Health Outreach and Net-work Development Grants, Rural Health Research Centers, Rural and Commu-nity Access to Emergency Devices Program and other programs are designed to support community-based disease prevention and health promotion projects, help rural hospitals and clinics implement new technologies and strategies and build health system capacity in rural and frontier areas. \u2014Special programs include the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net- work, the National Marrow Donor Program, the C.W. Bill Young Cell Trans-plantation Program and National Cord Blood Inventory. These programs main-tain and facilitate organ marrow and cord blood donation, transplantation and research, along with efforts to promote awareness and increase organ donation rates. Special programs also include the Poison Control Program, the Nation's primary defense against injury and death from poisoning. For every dollar spent on the poison center system, $13.39 is saved in medical costs and lost produc-tivity, totaling more than $1.8 billion every year in savings. While the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 provided modest and temporary relief from sequestration, austerity measures remain firmly in place, which pose serious threats for the viability of HRSA's impor-tant programs and compromise the agency's ability to address our Nation's health needs. We urge you to consider HRSA's central role in strengthening the Nation's health and advise you to adopt our fiscal year 2015 request of $7.48 billion for HRSA's discretionary budget authority. Thank you for the opportunity to submit our recommendation to the subcommittee. 472 PREPARED STATEMENT OF FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT My name is Kate Ryan. I currently serve as Co-Chair of the Friends of the Na- tional Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). On behalf of the Friends, I urge the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Subcommittee to support at least $32 billion for the NIH, including $1.37 billion for NICHD for fiscal year 2015. Our coalition includes over 100 organizations rep-resenting scientists, physicians, healthcare providers, patients and parents con-cerned with the health and welfare of women, children, families, and people with disabilities. We are pleased to support the extraordinary work of the Eunice Ken-nedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Since its establishment in 1963, NICHD has achieved great success in meeting the objectives of its broad biomedical and behavioral research mission, which in-cludes research on child development before and after birth; maternal, child, and family health; learning and language development; women's health and reproductive biology; population issues; and medical rehabilitation. With sufficient resources, NICHD could build upon the promising initiatives described in this testimony and produce new insights into human development and solutions to health and develop-mental problems throughout the world, including for women, children and families in your districts. Scientific breakthroughs supported by NICHD serve to prevent and treat many of the Nation's most devastating health problems including infant mor-tality and low birthweight, birth defects, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the reproductive and gynecologic health of women throughout their lifespan, among others. Some of these research areas are described below. Preterm Birth .\u2014NICHD supports a comprehensive research program to study the causes of preterm birth and prevention strategies and treatment regimens. Pre-term birth costs our Nation $26 billion annually and is a leading cause of infant mortality and intellectual and physical disabilities. Continued prioritization of extramural preterm birth prevention research, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network, the Neonatal Research Network and intramural research program related to pre-maturity are necessary to further this work. Resources also should be available to support transdisiplinary science as recommended in NICHD's Scientific Vision to study and identify the complex causes of preterm birth. NICHD supports research on the causes of preterm birth with the goal of discov- ering effective ways to prevent it. In the U.S., the rate of preterm birth is approxi-mately 12 percent, one of the highest rates in all industrialized countries, resulting in neonatal death, infant mortality and severe neurological disability, including cer-ebral palsy, mental retardation, and visual/auditory problems. Preterm birth also significantly impacts families emotionally and financially. Although research has identified some factors that influence preterm birth (e.g., multiple gestation, infec-tions, diabetes, high blood pressure), it cannot be fully explained by physical health. There is growing evidence of the role of psychological factors such as pregnancy-re-lated anxiety and stress, behavioral issues such as substance abuse, and sociological issues such as cultural disparities. Thus, support is needed for research on the com-plex interaction of factors including psychological, behavioral, social, and environ-mental factors in addition to genetic and biological influences, with the ultimate goal of developing efficacious interventions to decrease this country's epidemic of ba-bies being born far too soon. National Children's Study (NCS) .\u2014The NCS is the largest and most comprehen- sive study of children's health and development ever planned in the United States. The Friends of NICHD thank the Committee for its' longstanding support of the NCS. The Friends look forward to roll-out of the main study that includes a science- based design and recruitment strategy. When fully implemented, this study will in-form the work of scientists in universities and research organizations, helping them identify precursors to disease and to develop new strategies for prevention and treatment. Identifying the root causes of many childhood diseases and conditions, including preterm birth, developmental delay, asthma, obesity, heart disease, injury and diabetes, will reduce healthcare costs and improve the health of children. NCS also provides an opportunity to collect data on social and behavioral aspects of child and adolescent health, such as important information on the sexual and reproduc-tive health of adolescents Contraceptive Research and Development .\u2014NICHD's Contraceptive Discovery and Development Branch supports basic, applied and clinical research on contraceptive methods, including mechanisms of action, the effects of contraceptive hormones and drugs, and optimal formulations of contraceptive agents. Through its investment in contraceptive evaluation research, NICHD plays a key leadership role in ensuring acceptability and effective use of existing products in various settings and popu-473 lations and in addressing behavioral issues related to fertility and contraceptive use. Specific opportunities and research priorities in the area of contraceptive evaluation include evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive options for women who are overweight or obese. The Institute's investment in contraceptive research and development is critical for producing new contraceptive modalities that are more effective, affordable, acceptable, and easier to deliver, by, for example, of-fering couples options with fewer side-effects and addressing women's other con-cerns about contraceptive use. Specific opportunities and research priorities in the area of contraceptive research and development include the need for non-hormonal contraception, pericoital contraception, and multipurpose prevention technologies that would prevent both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Reproductive Sciences .\u2014Through its investment in reproductive science, NICHD conducts research to improve women's health by developing innovative medical therapies and technologies and improving existing treatment options for gyneco-logical conditions affecting overall health and fertility. The Institute's reproductive science research makes a vital contribution to women's health by focusing on serious conditions that have been overlooked and underfunded, despite the fact that they impact many women. Future work could focus on infertility research into the need for treatments for disorders such as endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and uterine fibroids which can prevent couples from achieving desired preg-nancies. Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) .\u2014Female pelvic floor disorders (PFD) rep- resent an under-appreciated but major public health burden with high prevalence, impaired quality of life and substantial economic costs affecting approximately 25 percent of American women. The PFDN is conducting research to improve treatment of these extremely painful gynecological conditions. Current research is aimed at im-proving female urinary incontinence outcome measures and ensuring high quality patient-centered outcomes. Development of the Research Workforce .\u2014Adequate levels of research require a ro- bust research workforce. The years of training combined with uncertainty in getting grant funding are huge disincentives for students considering a career in bio-med-ical research. This has resulted in a huge gap between the too-few women's repro-ductive health researchers being trained and the immense need for research. NICHD's Women's Reproductive Health Research (WRHR) Program and Reproduc-tive Scientist Development Program (RSDP), both aimed at obstetrician-gyne-cologists to further their education and experience in basic, translational, and clin-ical research, provide training grants to hundreds of researchers and provide new insight into a host of diseases, such as ovarian cancer. Continued investment in these training programs is critical to helping ensure future scientific advances in women's health research. Population Research .\u2014The NICHD Population Dynamics branch supports a di- verse portfolio of scientific research and research training programs, exploring the social, economic and health-related impacts of population change on families, chil-dren, and communities. The branch is well respected for investing wisely in the de-velopment of longitudinal, representative surveys, providing scientists with reliable data that can be used to examine the influence of early life course events on long- term health and achievement outcomes in particular. As an example, in 2012, NICHD-supported demographers using data from the Panel Study of Income Dy-namics survey found that growing up in poor neighborhoods throughout the entire childhood life course can have a devastating effect on educational attainment. In an-other study, using data from the National Study of Adolescent Health, researchers found that women who are overweight or obese years during the transition from adolescence to adulthood are more likely to later deliver babies with a higher birth weight, putting the next generation at a higher risk of obesity-related health out-comes. Sex Differences in Research .\u2014The Friends encourages NICHD to look at ways to increase data reporting to address gaps in gender and sex differences in research. Sex differences need to be acknowledged as a critical biological variable. In addition to including more women in clinical research, we believe sex differences should be included as part of the design of all basic biological studies and clinical research. If the researchers were to consider sex differences in the design of basic science studies, and incorporate data on sex as a biological variable in animal and human studies, more appropriate conclusions could be drawn from basic research, and clin-ical research would provide more representative data on safety and efficacy of drug. Clinical Trials in Pregnant Women .\u2014Pregnant women have historically been ex- cluded from most research trials due to concern that trial participation could harm the fetus. Although there has been substantial progress in the inclusion of women in federally funded research, pregnant women are still excluded, even from research 474 that would advance our knowledge of medical conditions and treatments in preg- nancy. Mindful of the important considerations of clinical trials on pregnant women, we support establishment of a Federal work group to propose how clinical research might be done appropriately in this area. Data on Pediatric Enrollment in NIH Trials .\u2014NIH policy mandates the inclusion of women, minorities, and children in clinical trials whenever appropriate. While NIH collects enrollment data on sex/gender and race, it does not collect enrollment data broken down by age. We urge NIH, with leadership from NICHD, to improve data collection and reporting on pediatric enrollment sufficient to determine if chil-dren are appropriately represented in trials with relevance to child health. Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) .\u2014NICHD funds meaningful re- search into pediatric pharmacology through the BPCA program. This program pro-vides for the study of drug products that are important to children but have been inadequately studied in pediatric populations. We urge continued funding and sup-port for this important research, as well as for training the next generation of pedi-atric clinical investigators. Brain Development .\u2014Research on learning disabilities\u2014neurological disorders that can make it difficult to acquire certain academic and social skills\u2014shows that they can be prevented through effective evidence-based programs in school and that when children improve their reading and math skills, brain function normalizes. Rehabilitation Science .\u2014The National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) currently resides within NICHD, yet there is a strong need for elevating the stature of NCMRR. We recommend moving the NCMRR to an independent In-stitute or Center reporting directly to the NIH Director, or to establish a new Office of Rehabilitation Research within the Office of the NIH Director. Implementation of this structural recommendation would require a statutory change. Elevation of NCMRR has been viewed from the start as a critical step in achieving sufficient crit-ical mass to coordinate rehabilitation science across all the Independent Centers at NIH that conduct and support research directly addressing or related to rehabilita-tion science. These research efforts have made significant contributions to the well-being of all Americans, but there is still much to discover. We support the NICHD's recently re-leased Scientific Vision and urge you to support NICHD at funding levels that meet current needs for addressing health issues across the lifespan. Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to working with you on these critical issues. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and distinguished Members of the Sub- committee, the members of the Friends of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (FNIDCR), a leading broad-based consortium of individuals, academic institutions, patient advocate groups, dental societies, and corporations, that understands the importance of dental, oral and craniofacial health to our soci-ety, are requesting fiscal year 2015 funding under section 301 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Re-search (NIDCR) to be appropriated at a recommended level of 1.33 percent of the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) total fiscal year 2015 funding level. The fiscal year 2014 level enacted by the omnibus bill is $398.65 million for NIDCR. After transfers, NIDCR's total amount for obligation in fiscal year 2014 is $397.10 million. President Barack Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal for NIDCR, $397.13, is at best stagnate if compared to total obligations, and at worse, a decrease of $1,519,000 if compared to the level Congress appropriated in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus bill. The end result is ongoing diminished grant opportunities that will only discourage young and talented researchers. Also, stagnated funding means NIDCR will not be able to keep up with the increasing rate of medical infla-tion. Background From 1998 to 2011, NIDCR's percentage of total NIH funding decreased from 1.53 percent to 1.33 percent, its lowest percentage, amid a period when NIH's budget doubled. Save for a slight bump in 2012, this percentage remains at 1.33 percent. The Friends of NIDCR has been working to reverse this troublesome trend\u2014and re-turn NIDCR research to a percentage of total NIH funding that is more appropriate and proper. For fiscal year 2014, NIDCR's percentage of total NIH funding is 1.33 percent. 475 \u2014If Congress enacts the president's fiscal year 2015 budget figures for NIH and NIDCR, then NIDCR's percentage of total NIH funding would be at an all-time low, 1.31 percent. The Friends of NIDCR would welcome the opportunity to work with members of this Subcommittee to ensure NIDCR funding realizes a percentage of total NIH funding that is appropriate, yet realistic. The research performed by NIDCR justi-fies this approach. This is why the Friends of NIDCR recommends a modest in-crease in NIDCR's percentage of total NIH funding for fiscal year 2015 of 1.33 per-cent based upon the president's fiscal year 2015 budget request. This is also a con-sistent recommendation based upon the level enacted by Congress for fiscal year 2014. NIDCR: A Renown Leader in Research For 66 years, NIDCR has been the leading sponsor of research and research train- ing in biomedical and behavioral sciences. Its mission is to ''improve oral, dental and craniofacial health through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information.'' NIDCR meets its mission by: \u2014Performing and supporting basic and clinical research; \u2014Conducting and funding research training and career development programs to ensure an adequate number of talented, well-prepared and diverse investigators is sustained; \u2014Coordinating and assisting relevant research and research-related activities among all sectors of the research community; and \u2014Promoting the timely transfer of knowledge gained from research and its impli- cations for health to the public, health professionals, researchers, and policy- makers. In addition, NIDCR's Gold Standard Peer Review System ensures that taxpayers' dollars are being utilized in a wise, effective and productive manner. NIDCR Research Benefits All Americans Proper Federal funding of NIDCR will transform the future of medical and dental practice to the benefit of our society and ease the burden on our Nation's healthcare system. Examples of where NIDCR research has and will benefit society are: Tooth Decay: Fluorides and sealants have cut the rate of the number of American adults, aged 45 and older, who are without teeth by more than half since the 1950s. Government investment in oral health research saved Americans $3 for every $1 in-vested. Oral Cancer Detection: Oral cancer affects 38,000 Americans each year and ap- proximately 22 Americans die each day from it. Survival rates are among the lowest of all the major cancers. It is difficult to detect and hard to predict its outcome. However, if detected in early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83 percent. NIDCR- supported research has yielded initial success with developing new diagnostic tech-niques that can lead to early detection and life-saving interventions. For example, oral cancer is the first cancer to have its biomarkers mapped using Salivary Diagnostics and the presence of these biomarkers resulted in an early diagnosis of oral cancer 93 percent of the time. Furthermore, as a testament to scientific discov-eries, oral researchers have confirmed that oral cancer (traditionally thought of as being driven by extensive use of tobacco and alcohol) possesses a strong and growing link to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). HPV is now the cause of more oral cancers than smoking. NIDCR supports research aimed to gain a clearer take on HPV-re-lated oral cancers, including their incidence, risk factors, natural history and biol-ogy. Craniofacial Biology. Scientists are defining the genetics that underlie the forma- tion of the head and skull, and researchers are identifying the key areas for craniofacial malformations. For example, NIDCR-supported research has detected proteins associated with craniosynostosis, which is the premature fusion of a baby's skull bones that causes asymmetric skull growth. NIDCR believes this research could provide the foundation for the development of early detection methods and more effective treatments. Genome-wide Association Studies. NIDCR supports the first genome-wide associa- tion studies (''GWAS'') of cleft lip and/or palate and dental caries. The studies offer significant potential for understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cleft lip and/or palate and dental caries with the goal of improving the ability to predict and manage them by providing the first comprehensive compilation of the biological in-structions required to construct the middle region of the human face and to define the genetics that create its developmental disorders, according to NIDCR. The den-tal caries GWAS revealed areas of the genome that make an individual more likely 476 1''More than Half of Americans Doubt U.S. Global Leadership in 2020,'' Research!America press release, March 14, 2012, http://www.researchamerica.org/release \u201414march12\u2014poll. 22 Ibid. to develop decay. Moreover, NIDCR researchers have identified six areas of the ge- nome that may put a person at risk for moderate or severe periodontal disease and patients afflicted with Sjo \u00a8gren's Syndrome and TMJD can benefit from this pro- gram. Moreover, NIDCR research benefits millions of Americans with: \u2014Periodontal Disease, \u2014Chronic Dry Mouth, \u2014Chronic Facial and Oral Pain, such as TMJD, and \u2014Bone and Cartilage Regeneration. How NIDCR Research Makes a Difference Because Friends of NIDCR is a broad-based coalition of members, we are able to share first-hand perspectives from across the spectrum of the oral health commu-nity. The TMJ Association: During the past decade, NIDCR-funded research directed toward Temporomandibular Disorders has been a ''game changer.'' Previously thought to be a condition about teeth and jaws, research has demonstrated that this is a complex condition mediated by genes, sex, age, and epigenetics. We now also know that for many, TMD is a chronic pain condition and that in addition these patients also present with other comorbid pain conditions that co-occur more than by chance. These findings have truly revolutionized the way that these conditions are re-searched and will ultimately be treated. It is important to note that the National Institutes of Health are the only sources of funding of TM Disorders in the United States. We rely on their resources to improve the healthcare and quality of life for the 35 million TMJ patients in this country. Our hope is in science and the NIH, through its Institutes such as NIDCR, provides us with that hope. Ostrow School of Dentistry of the University of Southern California: NIDCR funding is essential to the success of several areas of research at USC that directly impact millions of people in the U.S. and worldwide. First, thanks to the NIDCR, we have made progress in understanding cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis, and other birth defects of the craniofacial region. According to the CDC, the lifetime cost of treating the children born each year in the U.S. with cleft lip or palate is $697 million. Every day, our researchers come closer to better treat-ments and preventive measures to help reduce this cost and improve quality of life. Moreover, we are working to leverage the dramatic potential of stem cells to regen-erate bone and other tissues that may be lost due to birth defects, trauma, or dis-ease. The NIDCR also funds our efforts to prevent dental caries, which is a major global health concern affecting 92 percent of American adults. Finally, the NIDCR supports our community outreach program in California's diverse population, through which we are investigating how to improve oral health for everyone in America. Research Drives the Economy, Innovates Despite the fact 54 percent of Americans thought Federal spending for medical and health research should be exempt from across-the-board cuts outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011 1, the ramifications of sequestration still linger. How- ever, Friends of NIDCR maintains that investment in medical research powers our innovation economy and provides life-saving treatments and cures. For example, a typical NIH grant supports the salaries of about seven high-tech jobs. Moreover, cuts or stagnate funding will only set the U.S. back at a time when other countries are rapidly increasing investment in research. Eighty-five percent of likely voters are concerned about the impact of a decreased Federal investment in research, in- cluding the possibility of scientists leaving their profession or moving abroad to countries with a stronger investment in research. 2NIDCR-funded grants contribute to our Nation's economy and keep scientists from looking abroad for work. fiscal year 2013 NIDCR-funded grants had a presence in 120 congressional districts (often multiple awards for a congressional district) in 43 States and territories. This equates to 75 percent of NIDCR-funded research being distributed to grantees at universities, dental schools, and medical schools, primarily in the U.S. Therefore, a significant portion of NIDCR-funded research occurs away from the NIH campus. However, this nationwide NIDCR presence will surely decline with decreased invest-ment in research. 477 3''America Speaks,'' Poll Data Summary Volume 13, Research!America, http:// www.researchamerica.org/uploads/AmericaSpeaksV13.pdf. Health Disparities Research Program Finally, through the NIDCR Health Disparities Research Program, a difference is being made in meeting the health needs of our Nation's low-income, underserved, and high-risk populations. Sadly, this need was made apparent with the tragic pass-ing of 12-year-old Deamonte Driver who died from a tooth infection in 2007. As a result of the program, tailored interventions to prevent dental caries and oral cancer are being tested in community settings such as urban public housing, community health centers, rural Project Head Start centers, low-income senior housing facili-ties, and primary medical care offices. RECOMMENDATION Eighty-five percent of Americans are concerned about stagnate funding for med- ical research.3Proper funding of medical and health research is essential to the overall health and well-being of our fellow Americans. We firmly contend that med-ical discoveries and advances from NIDCR funding lead to improvements in dental practices and change the scope of public health policies across the Nation. Whether it is detecting a clear link between bacteria in the mouth and heart disease\u2014or dis-covering early stages of oral cancer\u2014or searching for breakthroughs to help combat facial and oral pain\u2014we all benefit when we make NIDCR a priority. Therefore, based upon the merits of the research conducted by NIDCR, and its demonstrated benefits to the lives of countless Americans, we respectfully request the Sub-committee to fund NIDCR at 1.33 percent of NIH's funding level, so that it can real-ize the full potential of its worthy mission and sustain its beneficial scientific re-search. Thank you for the opportunity to present our written testimony before the Sub- committee. [This statement was submitted by Christian Stohler, D.D.S., DrMedDent, Presi- dent, Friends of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the Subcommittee in support of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Friends of the National Institute on Drug Abuse is a coali-tion of over 150 scientific and professional societies, patient groups, and other orga-nizations committed to preventing and treating substance use disorders as well as understanding their causes through the research agenda of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). We are pleased to provide testimony in support of the work carried out by schol- ars around the country whose work is supported by NIDA. Recognizing that so many health research issues are inter-related, we request that the subcommittee provide at least $32 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and within that amount a proportionate increase for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in your Fiscal 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agen- cies Appropriations bill. We also respectfully request the inclusion of the following NIDA specific report language. Marijuana Research. Efforts to legalize or ''medicalize'' marijuana continue across the United States. The Committee understands that research from different areas of science is converging on the fact that regular marijuana use by young people can have a long-lasting negative impact on the structure and function of their brains, resulting in lower educational achievement, reduced IQ, etc. Research clearly dem-onstrates that marijuana has the potential to cause problems in daily life or make a person's existing problems worse. NIDA is encouraged to continue to fund re-search on preventing and treating marijuana abuse and addiction, and the possible health and policy implications of proposals to implement ''medical marijuana'' or marijuana legalization programs across the U.S. Opiate Abuse and Addiction. The Committee is concerned about the continued cri- sis of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. In particular, the June 2011 IOM report on pain indicates that abuse and misuse of prescription opioid drugs resulted in an annual estimated cost to the nation of $72,500,000,000. Further, the Committee is very concerned with the potential rise in heroin abuse and addiction as a result of successful efforts to combat the prescription drug side of this issue. The Committee 478 urges NIDA to 1) continue funding research on medications to alleviate pain, includ- ing the development of pain medications with reduced abuse liability; 2) as appro-priate, work with private companies to fund innovative research into such medica-tions; and 3) report on what we know regarding the transition from opiate analge-sics to heroin abuse and addiction within affected populations. Medications Development. The Committee recognizes that next-generation phar- maceuticals will surely take advantage of new technologies. In the context of NIDA funding, chief among these are NIDA's current approaches to develop viable immunotherapeutic or biologic (e.g., bioengineered enzymes) approaches for treating addiction. The goal of this active area of research is the development of safe and effective vaccines or antibodies that target specific drugs, like nicotine, cocaine, and heroin, or drug combinations. The Committee is excited by this approach\u2014if suc-cessful, immunotherapies, alone or in combination with other medications, behav-ioral treatments, or enzymatic approaches, stand to revolutionize how we treat, and, maybe even someday, prevent addiction. The Committee looks forward to hearing more about work in this area. Nurturing Talent and Innovation in Research. The Committee commends NIDA for its continued support of innovative research on drug addiction and related health problems such as pain and HIV/AIDS, and the Institute's effort to be at the fore-front of training the next generation of innovative researchers. The 6 year-old Avant-Garde award is a good example of a program that stimulates high-impact research that could lead to groundbreaking opportunities for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS in drug abusers. The Committee understands that NIDA is now crafting a new kind of award, which would blend NIH's Pioneer and New Inno-vator award mechanisms. This new opportunity, called ''AVENIR'' awards, is de-signed to attract creative young investigators into HIV/drug abuse public health re-search. The Committee strongly supports this effort, and asks the Institute to report on its progress in future appropriations and related requests. Research to Assist Military Personnel, Veterans, and Their Families. The Com- mittee recognizes the significant health challenges, including substance abuse and addiction, faced by military personnel, veterans, and their families. Many of these individuals need help confronting war-related problems including traumatic brain injury, PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and substance abuse and ad-diction. The Committee commends NIDA for its successful efforts to coordinate and support research with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and other NIH Institutes focusing on these populations, and strongly urges NIDA to continue work in this area. Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in Drug Abuse and Ad- diction Prevention and Treatment. The Committee is very pleased with NIDAMed, an initiative designed to reach out to physicians, physicians in training, and other healthcare professionals. The Committee urges the Institute to continue its focus on activities to provide physicians and other medical professionals with the tools and skills needed to incorporate drug abuse screening and treatment into their clinical practices. Drug abuse is costly to Americans; it ruins lives, while tearing at the fabric of our society and taking a huge financial toll on our resources. Beyond the unaccept-ably high rates of morbidity and mortality, drug abuse is often implicated in family disintegration, loss of employment, failure in school, domestic violence, child abuse, and other crimes. Placing dollar figures on the problem; smoking, alcohol and illegal drug use results in an exorbitant economic cost on our nation, estimated at over $600 billion annually. We know that many of these problems can be prevented en-tirely, and that the longer we can delay initiation of any use, the more successfully we mitigate future morbidity, mortality and economic burdens. Over the past three decades, NIDA-supported research has revolutionized our un- derstanding of addiction as a chronic, often-relapsing brain disease \u2014this new knowledge has helped to correctly situate drug addiction as a serious public health issue that demands strategic solutions. By supporting research that reveals how drugs affect the brain and behavior and how multiple factors influence drug abuse and its consequences, scholars supported by NIDA continue to advance effective strategies to prevent people from ever using drugs and to treat them when they can-not stop. NIDA supports a comprehensive research portfolio that spans the continuum of basic neuroscience, behavior and genetics research through medications develop-ment and applied health services research and epidemiology. While supporting re-search on the positive effects of evidence-based prevention and treatment ap-proaches, NIDA also recognizes the need to keep pace with emerging problems. We have seen encouraging trends\u2014significant declines in a wide array of youth drug use\u2014over the past several years that we think are due, at least in part, to NIDA's 479 1Flanigan KM, et al.

However, areas of significant concern in- clude the recent increase in lethalities due to heroine, as well as the continued abuse of prescription opioids and the recent increase in designer drugs availability and their deleterious effects. The need to increase our knowledge about the effects of marijuana is most important now that decisions are being made about its ap-proval for medical use and/or its legalization. We support NIDA in its efforts to find successful approaches to these difficult problems. The Nation's previous investment in scientific research to further understand the effects of abused drugs on the body has increased our ability to prevent and treat addiction. As with other diseases, much more needs be done to improve prevention and treatment of these dangerous and costly diseases. Our knowledge of how drugs work in the brain, their health consequences, how to treat people already addicted, and what constitutes effective prevention strategies has increased dramatically due to support of this research. However, since the number of individuals continuing to be affected is still rising, we need to continue the work until this disease is both prevented and eliminated from society. We understand that the fiscal year 2015 budget cycle will involve setting prior- ities and accepting compromise, however, in the current climate we believe a focus on substance abuse and addiction, which according to the World Health Organiza-tion account for nearly 20 percent of disabilities among 15-44 year olds, deserves to be prioritized accordingly. We look forward to working with you to make this a reality. Thank you for your support for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FSH S OCIETY , INC. Honorable Chairwoman Mikulski and Ranking Member Harkin, thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), is one of the most common adult muscular dystrophies with a prevalence of 1:15,000\u20141:20,000. 1,2For a half-million men, women, and children worldwide the major consequence of inheriting this genetic form of muscular dystrophy is a lifelong progressive loss of all skeletal muscles. FSHD is a crippling and life short-ening disease. No one is immune. It is both genetically and spontaneously trans-mitted to children. It can affect multiple generations and entire families. With FSHD there is a loss of muscle strength that ranges between one and 4 per- cent a year during a lifetime. In terms of functional impairment, 20 percent of FSHD-affected individuals over age fifty will require the use of a wheelchair. FSHD also has very specific non-muscular manifestations; hearing-loss, restrictive lung disease, supraventricular arrhythmias (rare), and retinal vasculopathy. 95 percent of individuals with FSHD have the FSHD1 (FSHD1A OMIM: 158900) genetic vari-ation\u2014caused by the contraction of DNA macrosatellite repeat units, termed D4Z4 repeats, on chromosome 4, leading to the release of transcriptional repression of a retrogene (DUX4) believed to be associated with the cause of disease. Of the 5 per-cent of FSHD individuals remaining, 80 percent of those are the FSHD2 (FSHD1B OMIM: 158901) genetic variation\u2014caused by mutations in the SMCHD1 gene on chromosome 18 that helps to maintain the structure of the D4Z4 repeats on the long arm of chromosome 4. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the principal source of funding of re- search on FSHD currently at the $5 million level. For nearly two decades, this Com-mittee has supported the incremental growth in funding for FSHD research. I am pleased to report that this modest investment has produced huge scientific returns. 1. Congress has made a major difference in muscular dystrophy. I have testified many times before Congress, nearly fifty. When I first testified, we did not know the mechanism of this disease. Now we do. When I first testified, we assumed that FSHD was a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Now we understand it to be one of the most prevalent forms of muscle disease, if not the most prevalent muscle disease based on new ways of evaluating the disease clinically within families. Congress is responsible for this success, through its sustaining support of the NIH and the en-actment of the Muscular Dystrophy CARE Act. We are aware that MD Care Act does not set the amount of spending on FSHD or the other dystrophies at the NIH and we recognize that funding levels are determined in the appropriations process and the numbers of grant applications received and funded by the NIH on FSHD. Even though it is a technically separate legislative process, the reauthorization of 480 3Lemmers, RJ, et al, A Unifying Genetic Model for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Science 24 September 2010: pp. 1650-1653. 4Kolata, G., Reanimated 'Junk' DNA Is Found to Cause Disease.

Further, we recognize and feel at this time in FSHD research that there are additional efforts and pathways that Congress can request and the NIH can enact to increase the amount of research funding on FSHD in the NIH portfolio that neither increases the NIH budget required nor takes money from another area of research. 2. Quantum leaps in our understanding of FSHD have occurred in past three and a half years. The past three and a half years have seen remarkable contributions made by researchers funded by NIH. \u2014On August 19, 2010, American and Dutch researchers published a paper which dramatically expanded our understanding of the mechanism of FSHD. 3A front page story in the New York Times quoted the NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins saying, ''If we were thinking of a collection of the genome's greatest hits, this would go on the list.'' 4 \u2014Two months later, another paper was published that made a second critical ad- vance in determining the cause of FSHD.5The research shows that FSHD is caused by the inefficient suppression of a gene that may be normally expressed only in early development. \u2014On January 17, 2012, an international team of researchers based out of Seattle discovered a stabilized form of a normally suppressed gene called DUX4 re-quired to develop chromosome 4 linked FSHD. 6 \u2014Six months later, another high profile paper produced by a Senator Paul A. Wellstone Cooperative Research Center of the NIH, used sufficiently ''powered'' large collections of genetically matched FSHD cell lines generated by the NIH center that are both unique in scope and shared with all researchers worldwide, to improve on the Seattle group's finding by postulating that DUX4-fl expres-sion is necessary but not sufficient by itself for FSHD muscle pathology. 7This work was also supported by a NIH cooperative research center grant mandated by MD CARE Act. \u2014On July 13, 2012, a team of researchers from the, United States, Netherlands and France identified mutations in a gene causing 80 percent of another form of FSHD. This paper furthers our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of FSHD. This work too was supported in part by a program project grant from NIH. 8 \u2014In 2013 and continuing into 2014, papers have been published clearly docu- menting functional impairment in FSHD, clinical and genetic features of hear-ing loss FSHD, restrictive lung disease and respiratory insufficiency, Coats syn-drome and vision loss in FSHD, high-throughput screening that identify inhibi-tors of DUX4-induced myoblast toxicity, better definition of epigenetic features FSHD, and FSHD, MRI/MRS studies, biomarkers for FSHD, the dem-onstration that although the transcription of the toxic protein DUX4 occurs in only a limited number of nuclei, the resulting protein diffuses into nearby nuclei within the myotubes, thus spreading aberrant gene expression throughout a muscle, to name a few. Many of these researchers have started their efforts in FSHD with seed funding from the FSH Society and have received continued support from the FSH Society, the NIH, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association and other partners. 3. Remarkable progress in FSHD research and the need to keep moving forward. Last October, nearly 100 researchers from around the world gathered under the di-rection of Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, David Housman, PhD, Chair of the FSH Society's Scientific Advisory Board, at the David H. Koch Center 481 92013 FSH Society FSHD International Research Consortium, held October 22-23, 2013 co- sponsored by DHHS NIH NICHD University of Massachusetts School of Medicine Senator Paul D. Wellstone MD CRC for FSHD. To read the expanded summary and recommendations of the group see: http://www.fshsociety.org/pages/sciConsortium.html. for Integrative Cancer Research on the campus of M.I.T. for the annual FSH Society International Research Consortium meeting; there was a palpable feeling of FSHD research having ''arrived'' in the big time. The general discussion of day two covered four major areas. With respect to the first area, called DUX4, the unanimous conclu-sion of the general discussion was that over-expression of the toxic transcription fac-tor DUX4 is at the root of FSHD1 and FSHD2 and that DUX4 expression is nec-essary but not always sufficient to cause FSHD. Research should focus on upstream and downstream molecular pathways and mechanisms as they form the most plau-sible intervention targets. The group also discussed needs and priorities in three ad-ditional areas: disease models, intervention, clinical studies and trial readiness. The priorities stated for 2014, at the October 21-22, 2013, FSH Society FSHD \u2014Disease models reliable endpoints; modulating mecha- nisms/genes \u2014Increasing data depth of patient databases with extensive (follow-up) clinical data \u2014Prepare for clinical trials: reliable and meaningful outcome measures; with ac- cess to discreet patient populations and disease mechanism of action classes. \u2014Therapy; proof-of-principle experiments \u2014Focus on translational research; from clinic to back \u2014Understanding pathophysiology of FSHD: connection to DUX4, heterogeneity, asymmetry, role of inflammation; infiltrates and etiology Given the recent developments, there is a need to ramp up the preclinical enter- prise and build/organize infrastructure needed to conduct clinical trials. Our imme-diate priorities should be to confirm the new hypotheses and targets. We need to be prepared for this new era in the science of FSHD. Many leading experts are now turning to work on FSHD not only because it is one of the most complicated and challenging problems seen in science, but because it represents the potential for great discoveries, insights into stem cells, transcriptional processes, new ways of thinking about disease of epigenetic etiology, and for treating diseases. 4. NIH Funding for Muscular Dystrophy. Mr. Chairman, these major advances in scientific understanding and epidemiological surveillance are not free. They come at a cost. Since Congress passed the MD CARE Act, research funding at NIH for mus-cular dystrophy has increased 4-fold. While FSHD research funding has increased 12-fold during this period, the level of funding is still anemic and, for FSHD, has been astonishingly flat for the past 6 years. 482 [Dollars in millions] Fiscal Year 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 e 2015 e All MD ...................................................................................... 39 .1 38 .7 39 .5 39 .9 47 .2 56 83 86 75 75 76 78 78 FSHD ........................................................................................ 1 .5 2 .2 2 .0 1 .7 3 3 5 6 6 5 5 6 6 FSHD (percent total MD) ......................................................... 4 6 5 4 5 5 6 7 8 7 7 8 8 FSHD Research Dollars (in millions) and FSHD as a Percentage of Total NIH Muscular Dystrophy Funding. Sources: NIH/OD Budget Office and NIH OCPL and NIH RCDC RePORT (e = estimate). 483 Despite the great success of the past three and a half years in the science of FSHD brought about by Congress we are concerned that under the current funding environment that new research projects will not be funded or existing programs will not be renewed. We have conveyed to the NIH leadership at the Office of the Direc-tor, NIAMS, NINDS, NICHD, NHLBI and the Executive Secretary of the MDCC our grave concern that FSHD research is way too under-represented in the NIH port-folio and needs a proactive effort on the part of NIH. Alan E. Guttmacher, MD., Director, NICHD and chair of the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee (MDCC) recently wrote to me in response to a letter I sent to NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins asking for a significant improvement in the overall level of funding for FSHD, that though ''it is notable that NIH funding for all forms of muscular dystrophy has nearly doubled since the 2006 NIH Action Plan on Muscular Dystrophy was released. [and] Since this has been a period of relatively flat funding for NIH, increased funding for anyone area speaks to the excellent qual-ity of the research applications received during that time, and this is true of FSHD research applications where funding has almost tripled. We believe that the 2006 Action Plan was instrumental in improving coordination among the Institutes and Centers at NIH that support research on the muscular dystrophies, so that scarce resources are well-spent. We plan to revise the Action Plan this year, with a meet-ing in July to discuss what research opportunities have emerged; the goal is to ask the MDCC to approve the revised plan at its Fall 2014 meeting.'' While we whole- heartedly agree with these statements and we are instrumental and involved in the MD CARE Act and most appreciative of all of NIH's efforts and Congress' work in this area\u2014we do not however agree on the plus one order of magnitude (x10) of dif-ference between muscular dystrophy funding and FSHD funding. While all dystrophy increased $39.9 million $78 million; FSHD increased from $1.7 million to $6 million. The economy of scale is so different in particular for FSHD, being equally devastating and burdensome as the disease receiving the most funding in this category, and though it functions in the exact same U.S. Federal re-search infrastructure. NIH needs to redress the imbalance of funding in the mus-cular dystrophy portfolio by fostering opportunities for multidisciplinary research on FSHD, a common and complex form of dystrophy, commensurate with its prevalence and disease burden. The future action plan should address this issue head-on. We request for fiscal year 2015, a tripling of the NIH FSHD research portfolio to $18 million or a level of approximately 20 percent of the total muscular dystrophy funding at NIH. This will allow an expansion of basic research awards, expansion of post-doctoral and clinical training fellowships, dedicated centers to design and conduct clinical trials on FSHD and more U.S. DHHS NIH Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Centers. Agency: National Institutes of Health (NIH) Account: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National, Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fiscal year 2015 Report Language: The Committee encourages the NIH to foster opportunities for multidisciplinary research on facioscapulohumeral muscular dys-trophy (FSHD), a common and complex form of muscular dystrophy, commensurate with its prevalence and disease burden. The Committee hopes such advances will be utilized to help advance treatments and access to therapies for this grave dis-ease. We are aware of the great pressures on the Federal budget, but NIH can easily help increase its portfolio on FSHD given the breakneck speed of discovery in FSHD. These are easy ways for NIH to convey to researchers that it has a revised plan and an interest in funding research in FSHD. There are no quotas on peer- reviewed research above pay line at the NIH, and NIH can help by issuing written announcements that efforts invested in writing FSHD grant applications will be met with interest. This is the time to fully and expeditiously exploit the advances for which the American taxpayer has paid. Thank you for this opportunity to testify be-fore your committee. [This statement was submitted by Daniel Paul Perez, President & CEO, FSH So- ciety.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE GBS/CIDP F OUNDATION INTERNATIONAL Chairman Harkin and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for your time and your consideration of the priorities of the community of individuals impacted by Guillain-Barre \u00b4Syndrome (GBS), Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating 484 Polyneuropathy (CIDP), and related conditions as you work to craft the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill. ABOUT GBS AND CIDP Guillain-Barre \u00b4Syndrome GBS is an inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It's also known as Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy and Landry's Ascending Paralysis. The cause of GBS is unknown. We do know that about 50 percent of cases occur shortly after a microbial infection (viral or bacterial), some as simple and common as the flu or food poisoning. Some theories suggest an autoimmune trigger, in which the patient's defense system of antibodies and white blood cells are called into ac-tion against the body, damaging myelin (nerve covering or insulation), leading to numbness and weakness. GBS in its early stages is unpredictable, so except in very mild cases, most newly diagnosed patients are hospitalized. Usually, a new case of GBS is admitted to ICU (Intensive Care) to monitor breathing and other body functions until the disease is stabilized. Plasma exchange (a blood ''cleansing'' procedure) and high dose intra-venous immune globulins are often helpful to shorten the course of GBS. The acute phase of GBS typically varies in length from a few days to months, with over 90 percent of patients moving into the rehabilitative phase within four weeks. Patient care involves the coordinated efforts of a team such as a neurologist, physiatrist (re-habilitation physician), internist, family physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, social worker, nurse, and psychologist or psychiatrist. Some patients re-quire speech therapy if speech muscles have been affected. Recovery may occur over 6 months to 2 years or longer. A particularly frustrating consequence of GBS is long-term recurrences of fatigue and/or exhaustion as well as abnormal sensations including pain and muscle aches. These can be aggravated by 'normal' activity and can be alleviated by pacing activity and rest. Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy CIDP is a rare disorder of the peripheral nerves characterized by gradually in- creasing weakness of the legs and, to a lesser extent, the arms. It is the gradual onset as well as the chronic nature of CIDP that differentiates it from GBS. Fortunately, CIDP is even rarer than GBS. The incidence of new cases is estimated to be between 1.5 and 3.6 in a million people (compare to GBS: 1-2 in 100,000). Like GBS, CIDP is caused by damage to the covering of the nerves, called myelin. It can start at any age and in both genders. Weakness occurs over two or more months. Unlike GBS, CIDP is not self-limiting (with an end to the acute phase). Left un- treated, 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence. Early recognition and treatment can avoid a significant amount of disability. Post-treatment life depends on whether the disease was caught early enough to benefit from treatment options. Patients respond in various ways. The gradual onset of CIDP can delay diagnosis by several months or even years, resulting in signifi-cant nerve damage that may take several courses of treatment before benefits are seen. The chronic nature of CIDP differentiates long-term care from GBS patients. Adjustments inside the home may need to be made to facilitate a return to normal life. ABOUT THE FOUNDATION The Foundation's vision is that every person afflicted with GBS, CIDP, or variants has convenient access to early and accurate diagnosis, appropriate and affordable treatments, and dependable support services. The Foundation's mission is to improve the quality of life for individuals and fami- lies across America affected by GBS, CIDP, and their variants by: \u2014Providing a network for all patients, their caregivers and families so that GBS or CIDP patients can depend on the Foundation for support, and reliable up- to-date information. \u2014Providing public and professional educational programs worldwide designed to heighten awareness and improve the understanding and treatment of GBS, CIDP and variants. \u2014Expanding the Foundation's role in sponsoring research and engaging in patient advocacy. 485 SEQUESTRATION We have heard from the medical research community that sequestration and def- icit reduction activities have created serious issues for Federal funding opportunities and the career development pipeline. In order to ensure that research into GBS, CIDP, and related disorders can continue to move forward, and, more importantly, to ensure that our country is adequately preparing the next generation of young in-vestigators, we urge you to avert, mitigate, or otherwise eliminate the specter of se-questration. While the Foundation has anecdotal accounts of the harms of seques-tration, the Federated American Societies for Experimental Biology has reported: \u2014In constant dollars (adjusted for inflation), the NIH budget in fiscal year 2013 was $6 billion (22.4 percent) less than it was in fiscal year 2003. \u2014The number of competing research project grants (RPGs) awarded by NIH has also fallen sharply since fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2013, NIH made 8,283 RPG awards, which is 2,110 (20.3 percent) fewer than in fiscal year 2003. \u2014Awards for R01-equivalent grants, the primary mechanism for supporting inves- tigator-initiated research, suffered even greater losses. The number awarded fell by 2,528 (34 percent) between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2013. The pay line for some NIH funding mechanisms has fallen from 18 percent to 10 percent while the average age for a researcher to receive their first NIH-funded grant has climbed to 42. These are strong disincentives to choosing a career as a medical researcher. Our scaling-back is occurring at a time when many foreign countries are investing heavily in their biotechnology sectors. China alone plans to dedicate $300 million to medical research over the next 5 years; this amount is dou-ble the current NIH budget over the same period of time. Scientific breakthroughs will continue, but America may not benefit from the return-on-investment of a ro-bust biotechnology sector. For the purposes of economic and national security, as well as public health, the Foundation asks that you work with your colleagues to eliminate sequestration and recommit to supporting this Nation's biomedical re-search enterprise. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION CIDP is a progressive condition with serious health impacts. Patients can end up almost completely paralyzed and on a ventilator. The key to limiting serious health impacts is an early and accurate diagnosis. The time it takes for a CIDP patient to begin therapy is linked to the length of therapy and the seriousness of the health impacts. An early diagnosis can mean the difference between a 3 month or 18 month hospital stay, or no hospitalization at all. For the Federal healthcare system, there is an economic incentive to ensure early and accurate diagnosis as longer hos- pitalizations equate to higher costs. CDC and NCCDPHP have resources that could be brought to bear to improve public awareness and recognition of CIDP and related conditions. In order to initiate new, potentially cost-saving programs, CDC requires meaningful funding increases to support crucial activities. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH NIH hosts a modest research portfolio focused on GBS, CIDP, and related condi- tions. This research has led to important scientific breakthroughs and is well posi-tioned to vastly improve our understanding of the mechanism behind these condi-tions. In fact, NINDS, NIAID, and the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) housed within NCATS have expressed interest in hosting a State-of-the-Science Conference on autoimmune peripheral neuropathies. This conference would allow in-tramural and extramural researchers to develop a roadmap that would lead re-search into these conditions into the next decade. While such a conference would not require additional appropriations, the Foundation urges you to provide NIH with meaningful funding increases to facilitate growth in the GBS, CIDP, and re-lated conditions research portfolio. Thank you for your time and your consideration of the community's requests. PREPARED STATEMENT OF GIRLSCOUTS OF THE USA As the preeminent leadership development organization for girls, Girl Scouts of the USA (Girl Scouts) serves over two million girls each year, ages 5 to 17, from every corner of the United States and its territories, with value placed on diversity and inclusiveness. We also serve nearly 17,000 American girls living outside of the United States in over 90 countries. Through our 112 councils and USA Girl Scouts Overseas, and more than 800,000 dedicated volunteers, we continue to deliver the 486 Girl Scout Leadership Experience (GSLE)\u2014the world's most comprehensive and best program for girls' leadership development. BUILDING GIRLS LEADERSHIP Girl Scout experiences through GSLE are, as much as possible, girl-led and en- courage hands-on and cooperative learning. Our framework specifies 15 outcomes\u2014 behaviors, attitudes, skills and values\u2014that develop girls of courage, confidence and character. We provide significant financial assistance to vulnerable girls who cannot afford to pay to belong to Girl Scouts. In many communities, Girl Scouts is the sin-gle most visible and viable positive choice for these girls as opposed to negative be-havior. Girl Scouts plays a major role in helping girls find their voice in a positive and productive way. Women today are well educated but still underrepresented in high-paying posi- tions and positions of leadership, facing societal barriers to leading and achieving success in everything from technology and science to business and industry. With this in mind, we need a bold policy shift so that girls are able to achieve their full leadership potential now and later in life, as women. Girl Scouts is eager to work with policymakers to create opportunities and environments that foster girls' leader-ship development. PENSION RELIEF Under Department of Labor, General Provisions, Girl Scouts respectfully requests the insertion of the following language as our highest priority request: SEC.\u2014E LECTION NOTTOBETREATED AS AN ELIGIBLE CHARITY PLAN.\u2014A plan sponsor of an eligible charity plan (as defined in subsection (d) of section 104 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006) may elect, effective for the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2013, to have section 104 of such Act not apply to such plan. In the case of such an election, solely for plan years beginning after December 31, 2013, section 430(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and section 303(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall apply as if such sections had applied to the first two plan years beginning after December 31, 2009, and as if the plan sponsor had elected to apply section 430(c)(2)(D)(iii) of such Code and section 303(c)(2)(D)(iii) of such Act with respect to those two plan years. The proposed language, which would only affected eligible charities and thus should not have an associated cost, would modify the rule established by section 202(b) of the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, Public Law 111-192. The effect of the proposed language is simi-lar in effect to section 2 of H.R. 4915, as passed by the Senate in December of 2010, which also allowed a plan sponsor of an eligible charity plan not to have section 104 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 apply. Girl Scouts organization, on behalf of the millions of girls we serve, respectfully requests this technical fix. The language simply says that as of 2014, we, and all similarly structured charities, be permitted to elect in to the Pension Protection Act funding rules, which are the Federal pension rules applicable to corporate America. In addition to our request pertaining to pension relief, the following are the key pol- icy priority areas where we can offer research and programmatic success stories: STEM EDUCATION As the preeminent organization for girls and a leader on informal STEM edu- cation, Girl Scouts is committed to ensuring that every girl has the opportunity to explore and build an interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The strength of our Nation depends on increasing girls' involvement in STEM, to develop critical thinking, problem solving and collaboration skills that are important throughout life. In 2012, the Girl Scout Research Institute released Generation STEM: What Girls Say about Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, which found girls are inter-ested in STEM and aspire to STEM careers, but need further exposure and edu-cation about what STEM careers can offer and how STEM can help girls make a difference in the world. Among some of Generation STEM's other findings: \u201474 percent of teen girls are interested in the field of STEM and STEM subjects. Girls like the process of learning, asking questions, and problem solving. \u2014Girls who are interested in STEM are significantly better students, have higher confidence in their abilities, and higher academic goals. \u2014But while 81 percent say they are interested in pursuing STEM careers, only 13 percent say it's their first choice. About half of all girls feel that STEM isn't 487 1Back to School Survey Shows Americans Want Personal Finance Taught in the Classroom, Visa, July 20, 2010. a typical career path for girls. 57 percent of girls say that if they went into a STEM career, they'd have to work harder than a man just to be taken seriously. \u2014African American and Hispanic girls have high interest in STEM, high con- fidence and work ethic, but say they have fewer supports and less STEM expo-sure than Caucasian girls. Research shows that girl-only settings not only provide a sense of belonging, but are more effective environments for personal development, including learning new skills and building self-confidence. In emotionally and physically safe environments, like those provided by Girl Scouts, girls partner with positive role models in a range of activities not limited by gender stereotypes. Girl Scout programs also emphasize partnerships, public education campaigns, mentorship programs, career exploration, traditional badges, and innovative new programming. \u2014As Congress considers consolidations and a redesign of existing Federal STEM programs, we urge you to invest more of a focus on engaging and motivating girls in STEM, in particular girls in underrepresented minorities and at young-er ages before their interest wanes in middle school. Strategies include intro-ducing girls to diverse role models and mentors; promoting proven techniques for engaging girls in STEM including, single-gender learning; and, hands-on and experiential learning opportunities in after-school or out-of-school environ-ments. FINANCIAL LITERACY The world's current economic challenges have made financial literacy skills mat- ter now more than ever. Girl Scouts offers a financial literacy program at every grade level from K-12. Through our Girl Scout financial education programming, girls learn to handle money and the basics of budgeting, banking, saving, using credit and planning for retirement and even practicing philanthropy. Additionally, the Girl Scout Cookie Program is often girls' first introduction to business planning and entrepreneurship. The $790 million Girl Scout Cookie Pro-gram is the largest girl-led business in the country. While lack of financial literacy is a growing concern, relatively little research has been conducted on how girls think about and experience money and finances. To ad-dress this gap, the Girl Scout Research Institute recently conducted a study, Having It All: Girls and Financial Literacy, with girls and their parents. It found girls need and want financial literacy skills to help them achieve their dreams, with 90 percent saying it is important for them to learn how to manage money; however, just 12 percent of girls surveyed feel very confident about making financial decisions. \u2014To be successful and sustainable, financial education must begin early, continue throughout elementary and secondary education, and be relevant. And although 93 percent of the public believes all high school students should be required to take a class in financial education, only four States have made a semester-long course in financial literacy a graduation requirement. 1In addition to providing teachers with training and materials, we believe policy support for after-school and community-based programs is critical if girls are to learn money-manage-ment skills and have real-world financial literacy experiences that will serve them throughout their lives. HEALTHY LIVING \u2014BULLYING AND RELATIONAL AGGRESSION As exemplified through our program experience and research, Girl Scouts under- stands the complex issue of healthy living and what motivates youth\u2014especially girls\u2014to adopt healthy lifestyles. Improving youths' physical health and emotional well-being are not mutually exclusive. Youth, especially girls, experience them in an interrelated fashion. Girls place the same or even greater emphasis on social and emotional health as physical health. The Girl Scout Research Institute's original research report, Feeling Safe: What Girls Say, found that nearly half (46 percent) of girls define safety as not having their feelings hurt, and approximately one-third of all girls worry about being teased, bullied, threatened, or having their feelings hurt when spending time with peers, participating in groups, and trying new things. Our report, The New Normal? What Girls Say About Healthy Living, tells us that a girl's relationships with her peers are critical components of her health and safety. Our BFF (Be a Friend First) curriculum is focused on middle-school girls and de- signed to easily integrates into existing health or character education classes, or can even serve as an after-school program in the community. 488 \u2014As the Department of Education has proposed a safe schools initiative that in- cludes a positive school climate focus, Girl Scouts supports this kind of effort that embraces a holistic definition of health that addresses both the physical health and emotional wellness of youth. National youth serving organizations such as Girl Scouts, should be seen as vital partners for schools in developing relevant solutions such as policies to address relational aggression and evalu-ating and implementing programs that prevent relational aggression and build healthy relationships. CLOSING We look forward to being a partner with Congress as you make difficult funding decisions in the areas of supporting healthy living, improving financial education of our youth, and building a pipeline of girls and underrepresented minorities in STEM careers. Thank you, and please consider us a resource in these areas.

We appreciate your leadership in promoting the importance of international development, in particular global health. We hope that your support will continue. I am submitting this testimony on behalf of the Global Health Technologies Coalition (GHTC), a group of nearly 30 nonprofit organi-zations working together to promote policies that advance research and development (R&D) of new global health innovations\u2014including new vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, microbicides, and other tools\u2014to combat global health diseases. The GHTC's mem-bers strongly believe that to meet the global health needs of tomorrow, it is critical to invest in research today so that the most effective health solutions are available when we need them. My testimony reflects the needs expressed by our member or-ganizations which work with a wide variety of partners to develop new and more effective life-saving technologies for the world's most pressing health issues. We strongly urge the Committee to continue its established support for global health R&D by 1) sustaining and supporting U.S. investment in global health research and product development and fully funding the NIH at a level of at least $32 billion, and providing robust funding for the CDC, with $464 million for the CDC Center for Global Health and $445 million for the CDC Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), 2) requiring leaders at the NIH, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Secretariat of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to join leaders of other U.S. agencies to develop a cross-U.S. government global health R&D strategy to ensure that U.S. investments in global health research are efficient, coordinated, and streamlined, and 3) removing the clinical trial phase restriction from the legal language dictating the activities of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). Critical need for new global health tools Our Nation's investments have made historic strides in promoting better health around the world: nearly ten million people living with HIV/AIDS now have access to life-saving medicines; new, cost-effective tools help us diagnose diseases quicker and more efficiently than ever before; and innovative new vaccines are making sig-nificant dents in childhood mortality. While we must increase access to these and other proven, existing health tools to tackle global health problems, it is just as crit-ical that we continue to invest in developing the next generation of tools to stamp out disease and address current and emerging threats. For instance, newer, more robust, and easier to use antiretroviral drugs\u2014particularly for infants and young children\u2014are needed to treat and prevent HIV, and even an AIDS vaccine that is 50 percent effective has the potential to prevent one million HIV infections every year. Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is on the rise globally, including in the United States, however the only vaccine on the market is insufficient at 90 years old, and most therapies available today are more than 50 years old, extremely toxic, and too expensive. New tools are also urgently needed to address fatal neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as sleeping sickness, for which diagnostic tools are inadequate and the few drugs available are toxic or difficult to use. There are many very prom-ising technology candidates in the R&D pipeline to address these and other health issues; however, these tools will never be available if the support needed to continue R&D is not supported and sustained. 489 Research and U.S. global health efforts The United States is at the forefront of innovation in global health technologies. The U.S. government is involved in 200 of the 365 global health products currently in the pipeline, with the NIH and CDC involved in much of this research. NIH The NIH has helped make the United States a leader in research globally. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, has named global health as one of the agency's five top priorities, and recent NIH global health research activities helped lead to the development of the first-ever microbicide gel effective in preventing HIV/AIDS and the development of new tools to combat neglected diseases, including vaccines for dengue fever and trachoma, as well as new drugs to treat malaria and TB. Under the purview of the NIH, NCATS was established to accelerate new treat- ments and cures for diseases. NCATS has the potential to play a much needed role in global health research, but we remain concerned about the legislative mandate limiting NCATS in their clinical trial work. NCATS is the only NIH center to be limited by a legislative mandate in its clinical trial work. There is no risk of NCATS duplicating the global health activities of private industry as this sector does not typically target neglected diseases due to small commercial markets. We hope you will consider removing this statutory barrier. We must not lose traction on the in-vestments made in global health at NIH. Robust investment is needed to ensure that new global health tools are available to address current and future health chal-lenges. CDC The CDC also plays a critical role in global health and contributes to valuable surveillance and health research systems\u2014strengthening programs that ensure the sustainability of global health R&D. The work of its scientists has led to major ad-vancements against devastating diseases, including the eradication of smallpox and early identification of the disease that became known as AIDS. Within the CDC, the efforts of the Center for Global Health and NCEZID are critical to protecting lives and must be continued. Ongoing investments in the development of new vaccines, drugs, microbicides and other tools have the potential to greatly accelerate efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, diarrheal disease, pneumonia, and other less well known diseases such as leishmaniasis, dengue fever, schistomiasis, hookworm, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease, as well as help prevent maternal and repro-ductive health challenges. Leveraging the private sector for innovation The NIH, CDC, and other U.S. agencies involved in global health R&D regularly collaborate with the private sector in developing, manufacturing, and introducing important technologies such as those described above through public-private part-nerships, including product development partnerships. These partnerships leverage public-sector expertise in developing new tools, partnering with academia, large pharmaceutical companies, the biotechnology industry, and governments in devel-oping countries to drive greater development of products for neglected diseases in which private industries have not historically invested. This unique model has gen-erated 42 new global health products and has enormous potential for continued suc-cess if robustly supported. NIH Director Francis Collins has stated that such part-nership is key to the development of therapies and health tools based on NIH-fund-ed research. Innovation as a smart economic choice Global health R&D brings life-saving tools to those who need them most. How- ever, the benefits these efforts bring are much broader than preventing and treating disease. Global health R&D is also a smart economic investment in the United States, where it drives job creation, spurs business activity, and benefits academic institutions. Biomedical research, including global health, is a $100 billion enter-prise in the United States. Sixty-four cents out of every U.S. dollar invested in glob-al health R&D goes directly to U.S.-based researchers. In a time of global financial uncertainty, it is important that the United States support industries, such as glob-al health R&D, which build the economy at home and abroad. An investment made today can help save significant money in the future. The re- cently released meningitis A vaccine, MenAfriVac, is on course to save nearly $570 million in healthcare costs over the next decade. In addition, new therapies to treat drug-resistant TB have the potential to reduce the price of TB treatment by 90 per-cent and cut health system costs significantly. The United States has made smart investments in research in the past that have resulted in lifesaving breakthroughs for global health diseases, as well as important advances in diseases endemic to the 490 United States. We must now build on those investments to turn those discoveries into new vaccines, drugs, tests, and other tools. Recommendations In this time of fiscal constraint, support for global health research that improves the lives of people around the world\u2014while at the same time creating jobs and spur-ring economic growth at home\u2014should unquestionably be among the Nation's high-est priorities. In keeping with this value, the GHTC respectfully requests that the Committee do the following: 1) sustain and support U.S. investments in global health research and product development and fully fund the NIH at a level of at least $32 billion, and provide robust funding for the CDC, with $464 million for the CDC Center for Global Health and $445 million for the NCEZID, 2) require leaders at the NIH, CDC, the FDA and the Office of Global Affairs to collaborate with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the State Department, the Department of Defense, and Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator to develop a cross-U.S. government global health R&D strategy to ensure that U.S. investments in global health research are efficient, coordinated, and streamlined, and 3) remove current statutory and legislative barriers limiting NCATS' clinical trial mandate and require NCATS to develop and report on a plan to include initiatives targeted at neglected diseases and global health conditions. As a leader in science and technology, the United States has the ability to capitalize upon our strengths to help reduce illness and death and ultimately eliminate disabling and fatal diseases for people world-wide, contributing to a healthier world and a more stable global economy. Sustained investments in global health research to develop new drugs, vaccines, tests, and other health tools\u2014combined with better access to existing methods to prevent and treat disease\u2014present the United States with an opportunity to dramatically alter the course of global health while building political and economic security across the globe. On behalf of the members of the GHTC, I would like to extend my gratitude to the Committee for the opportunity to submit written testimony for the record. [This statement was submitted by Kaitlin Christenson, Coalition Director, Global Health Technologies Coalition.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS EASTER SEALS , INC. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Easter Seals about our Federal funding priorities for fiscal year 2015. Easter Seals is a national nonprofit organization that provides essential community-based services to individuals with disabilities, older adults, veterans and other underserved populations to help them live, learn, work and contribute to their communities. Easter Seals' top priorities are in the people we serve like Arlena, Ben, Elijah and Donald whose lives have been impacted or could be through Federal investments made by this subcommittee. Easter Seals respectfully asks that you consider these stories and the critical programs these individuals as the sub-committee develops its fiscal year 2015 bill. Specifically Easter Seals requests that the Senior Community Service Employment Program be funded at $434,371,000 for fiscal year 2015, the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program be funded at $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2015, the Early Intervention Grants for Infants and Fam-ilies be funded at $458,498,000 for fiscal year 2015, and the Department of Edu-cation Transition Model System be funded at $15,000,000 for 2015. Meet Arlena: Arlena is an older worker who is contributing to her New Jersey community as a full-time security supervisor at a major airport. Her success may have seemed out-of-reach less than 2 years earlier when the 55-year-old single mother faced dual challenges. Arlena had lost her temporary job and was out of work for about a year when Hurricane Sandy hit and further complicated matters. She lost her home and all of her belonging in the 2012 storm, which left her home-less. She was forced to move in with her daughter's family. Eventually her daughter moved and gave her the apartment. However, with no job she fell behind in her rent and utilities. She turned to Easter Seals for help after hearing about the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) through a friend. The Depart-ment of Labor program supports employment of older workers by providing part- time, paid community service positions and work-based training for unemployed, low-income individuals, age 55 and older. Through the Federal program, Easter Seals connected Arlena to supportive services to help her maintain an apartment, boosted her computer skills and matched her with on-the-job training at three dif-ferent community locations. After 9 months in the program, she applied for and se-cured an entry level security position. Based on her previous work history, Arlena was promoted to a supervisory position. SCSEP helped to provide Arlena the tools 491 and opportunities she needed to prove she could bounce back from adversity and contribute again to her community. Easter Seals asks that the subcommittee sup-ports a fiscal year 2015 funding level of $434,371,000 for SCSEP, the same level the program received in fiscal year 2014. Meet Ben: Ben was almost among the one million children under age 5 with dis- abilities who go undiagnosed every year. Ben's mom felt uneasy about her son's lan-guage progress when he was 18 months. But her doctor attributed the speech delays to being raised in a bilingual household. After the birth of Ben's brother 6 months later, Ben's mom became more concerned about Ben's development, this time related to his behavior. ''I knew that Ben needed help.'' So she reached out to her State's Birth to Three program\u2014which is funded through Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\u2014and soon Ben was receiving needed speech and occupa-tional services from Easter Seals and was diagnosed with a form of autism called PDD-NOS. Within 6 months of receiving early invention services, Ben was able to communicate in sentences. Now 4 years old, he continues to work hard and is mak-ing enormous progress. As a result of these early intervention investments, Ben con-tinues to reach major milestones which will fundamentally change his life and allow him to fully participate in his community. Easter Seals asks that you increase fund-ing by $20 million for the Part C Early Intervention grants to $458,498,000 in fiscal year 2015 so more children like Ben can access the services and supports they need when they need them to succeed. Meet Elijah: Elijah achieved academic success most parents dream for their chil- dren. He was high school class valedictorian and a college honors student with a Master's Degree. However, his transition into the workplace has been challenging. He can't find a job. Elijah lives with Asperger's syndrome and, in fact, benefited from early intervention services through Easter Seals when he was a child. How-ever, Elijah has struggled during this adult transition, particularly in job interviews where the repetitive nature of Asperger's syndrome makes it challenging for him to stay succinct and on track. Elijah is not alone. The Government Accountability Of-fice (GAO-12-594) found that students with disabilities face ''several longstanding challenges'' during their transition from high school into postsecondary education or the workforce. Among the challenges the GAO cited was accessing services, such as transportation education and travel instruction. The U.S. Department of Education has proposed in its fiscal year 2015 budget to test a coordinated model of transition planning, services, and supports through a new Transition Model System (TMS). The goal of TMS is to help address the many challenges faced by youth with disabil-ities like Elijah. Easter Seals asks that the subcommittee to fully support the Ad-ministration's fiscal year 2015 funding request of $15,000,000 for the Transition Model System and asks that you include report language to strengthen the connec-tion and importance of transportation education and travel instruction within TMS to increase and improve postsecondary outcomes for students with disabilities. Meet Donald: Donald was a proud veteran of the Air National Guard but\u2014at age 48\u2014he found himself unemployed for more than 5 years and living on the street. Despite the national push to end homelessness among veterans, far too many men and women who served our Nation like Donald did are among the ranks of Amer-ica's homeless. Donald was connected to Easter Seals, who utilized the holistic, sup-portive services care coordination model used in the Department of Labor's Home-less Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) to help get Donald back on his feet. Easter Seals connected Donald to transitional housing, provided him with a monthly bus pass so he could easily attend required meetings and trainings, and linked him to the local U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical center for other services. Donald also received individualized training and assistance in creating a resume and cover letter and in updating his job search, networking and interview skills. Based on his strengths and employment background, Easter Seals assisted Donald in a series of temporary jobs through staffing agencies, one of which turned into a full time permanent job, with benefits, at a local manufacturing company. Donald cited ''networking skills, online job search assistance, resume update, housing sta-bilization, reliable transportation, and encouragement'' as key Easter Seals HVRP services that helped him get employed again. HVRP is the only Federal nationwide program focusing exclusively on the employment of veterans who are homeless. The program works, in large part, due to the holistic, person-centered care coordination model that Easter Seals has used for several decades in helping individuals with disabilities achieve their dreams. Easter Seals asks that the subcommittee supports the authorized level of $50,000,000 for HVRP in fiscal year 2015. Thank you for the opportunity to share with you Easter Seals' appropriations pri- orities for the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. We hope that you consider these programs and the thousands of people with disabilities, veterans and older adults who are fully 492 participating and contributing to their communities as a result of these early Fed- eral investments that continue to pay dividends. Thank you again for your time and consideration. [This statement was submitted by Katy Beh Neas, Senior Vice President, Govern- ment Relations Easter Seals, Inc.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE HARM REDUCTION COALITION We are requesting $5 million for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, and $5 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the office of Unintentional Injury Prevention, to address the opioid overdose epidemic. The opioid overdose epidemic has reached crisis proportions in recent years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in 2010, opioids\u2014including both prescription painkillers and heroin\u2014were responsible for nearly 20,000 over-dose deaths. While prescription painkillers continue to account for the majority of opioid overdoses, deaths from heroin overdose increased by 45 percent between 2006 and 2010, fueling concerns in several parts of the country that progress in reducing prescription painkiller misuse is being offset by a dramatic rise in heroin use and its attendant social and health consequences, including addiction, hepatitis C, and overdose. For example, in Kentucky, a State on the forefront of comprehensive ap-proaches to the prescription drug overdose epidemic, the Kentucky Injury Preven-tion and Research Center recently reported that while overall drug overdose deaths have leveled off from 2011 to 2012 after a decade of dramatic increases, promising declines in the number of prescription painkiller deaths have been accompanied by a 207 percent increase in heroin-related overdose deaths from 2011 to 2012. For these reasons, Harm Reduction Coalition believes that as efforts continue to mount a comprehensive response to prescription painkiller overdoses, it is necessary to incorporate the intertwined rise in heroin misuse and adopt a broader strategic framework to address all opioids. An opioid epidemic framework would maintain and intensify the array of activities such as those aimed at opioid prescribing prac-tices and monitoring programs, safe disposal, patient and public education, regu-latory and enforcement actions, and expansion of effective addiction treatment and recovery services. At the same time, the broader opioid epidemic framework recog-nizes the vital need for additional public health interventions and opportunities, in-cluding the role of expanded access to naloxone, alongside heightened attention to the risks of hepatitis C and other blood-borne viruses transmissible through injec-tion drug use. Naloxone is a generic medication which acts as an opioid antagonist, blocking the effects of opioids such as painkillers or heroin and capable of reviving individuals from opioid overdoses. A substantial body of research and practice has demonstrated that naloxone is safe and effective in the hands of laypersons; in the words of Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, ''several experi-mental overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) programs have issued naloxone directly to opioid users and their friends or loved ones, or other potential bystanders, along with brief training in how to use these emergency kits. Such pro-grams have been shown to be an effective, as well as cost-effective, way of saving lives.'' Dr. Volkow cites data published by CDC showing that through 2010, overdose education and naloxone distribution programs reported preventing over 10,000 opioid overdose deaths across the country. As of this month, eighteen States have passed legislation to facilitate broader access and utilization of naloxone, ranging from Kentucky to Connecticut, Ohio to California; Georgia passed naloxone legisla-tion on March 18th , which now awaits the governor's signature. These overdose education and naloxone distribution programs vary in setting and scope. In North Carolina, Project Lazarus trains physicians to co-prescribe naloxone to pain patients receiving opioids. In Massachusetts, support groups for parents with children strug-gling with opioid dependence are trained and provided with naloxone. In Rhode Is-land, naloxone is provided through pharmacies. In Kentucky, some of the strongest advocates for naloxone have been the addiction recovery community. In New York, my organization has provided naloxone training to dozens of drug treatment pro-grams, syringe exchange programs, shelters, and law enforcement agencies. In other parts of the country, overdose education and naloxone distribution programs are launching in emergency departments, jails, and Veterans Administration Medical Centers. These programs are gaining increased Federal attention; in the last month, the Attorney General echoed the Office of National Drug Control Policy in calling upon 493 first responders and law enforcement officers to be trained and equipped with naloxone. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality highlighted the Massa-chusetts overdose education and naloxone distribution program and featured accom-panying quality tools, including an overdose and naloxone program manual from the Harm Reduction Coalition. Last year, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-ices Administration (SAMHSA) released an opioid overdose toolkit featuring naloxone. NIDA and FDA have worked to support and facilitate the development of new, consumer-friendly formulations of naloxone. The Ohio Department of Health's Violence and Injury Prevention Program has used a portion of its CDC injury pre-vention funding to expand Project DAWN, an overdose education and naloxone dis-tribution program, to additional counties. The President's fiscal year 2015 budget requests $26 million to prevent prescrip- tion drug overdose, of which $16 million would expand CDC's Core Violence and In-jury Prevention Program grants to States, with an expected $10 million directed to prescription drug overdose activities, and $10 million to SAMHSA would fund State planning grants to develop prevention strategies for prescription drug abuse. The Harm Reduction Coalition supports these proposals, and believes that these re-sources would be valuable in establishing a foundation to reverse the prescription drug overdose epidemic. We also believe that additional emergency funding is nec-essary to stem the tide of opioid overdose from both prescription opioids and, in-creasingly, heroin. Within the context of a comprehensive approach to the opioid epi-demic, including expanding access to addiction treatment and recovery, the Harm Reduction Coalition views the rapid expansion and scale up of overdose education and naloxone distribution programs as an urgent and underfunded priority to save lives. To that end, we request that $5 million be provided to CDC Injury Prevention and Control to support opioid overdose fatality prevention efforts within State and local health departments and community-based organizations to strengthen their ability to deliver overdose recognition and intervention training and education, and expand access to rescue medications and other evidence-based strategies. We also request that $5 million be provided to SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to support community-based opioid overdose fatality prevention efforts, with a focus on those initiatives that provide overdose recognition and intervention training and education, access to rescue medications, and facilitate linkage to treatment and re-covery services. Across the country, emerging overdose education and naloxone distribution pro- grams rely on limited funding to meet a growing need. The availability of targeted Federal funds through both the public health and addiction treatment and recovery communities would hasten the expansion of these programs to meet growing need and demand. In the battle against opioid overdose, there is much to be done, and no time to lose. We need a twofold approach of long-range efforts to address the underlying causes and factors which led to the initial rise in prescription opioid misuse, coupled with immediate actions to avert additional deaths and tragedies in the short-term. As a person who has lost friends and loved ones to opioid overdose, and listened to the stories of grieving parents who only wish someone had told them about naloxone before it was too late for their children, I respectfully ask for your consid-eration of our requests. If you have any questions, or would like more information or data on naloxone, please feel free to contact: Daniel Raymond, Harm Reduction Coalition. Thank you for your attention and consideration. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND NURSING EDUCATION COALITION The members of the Health Professions and Nursing Education Coalition (HPNEC) are pleased to submit this statement for the record recommending $520 million in fiscal year 2015 for the health professions education programs authorized under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act and administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). HPNEC is an alliance of national organizations dedicated to ensuring the healthcare workforce is trained to meet the needs of the country's growing, aging, and diverse population. Titles VII and VIII are the only federally-funded programs that seek to improve the supply, distribution, and diversity of the health professions workforce, with a focus on primary care and interdisciplinary training. By providing educational and training opportunities to aspiring and practicing health profes-494 sionals, the programs also play a critical role in helping the workforce adapt to meet the Nation's changing healthcare needs. Titles VII and VIII are structured to allow grantees to test educational innova- tions, respond to changing delivery systems and models of care, and address timely topics in their communities. By assessing the needs of the communities they serve, Titles VII and VIII are well positioned to fill gaps in the workforce and increase access to care for all populations. Further, the programs emphasize interprofessional education and training, bringing together knowledge and skills across disciplines to provide effective, efficient and coordinated care. While HPNEC recognizes the Subcommittee faces difficult decisions in a con- strained budget environment, a continued commitment to programs supporting healthcare workforce development should remain a high priority. The Nation faces a shortage of health professionals, which will be exacerbated by the addition of mil-lions of Americans to the healthcare system. Failure to fully fund the Title VII and Title VIII programs would jeopardize activities to fill these vacancies and to prepare the next generation of health professionals. The Title VII and Title VIII programs can be considered in seven general cat- egories: \u2014The Primary Care Medicine and Oral Health Training programs support edu- cation and training of primary care professionals to improve access and quality of healthcare in underserved areas. Two-thirds of Americans interact with a pri-mary care provider every year. Over one-third of primary care providers trained through these programs work in underserved areas, compared to 10 percent of those trained in other traditional programs. The General Pediatrics, General In-ternal Medicine, and Family Medicine programs provide critical funding for pri-mary care physician training in community-based settings and support a range of initiatives, including medical student and residency training, faculty develop-ment, and the development of academic administrative units. The Rural Physi-cian Training Grants focus on increasing the number of medical school grad-uates practicing in rural communities. The primary care cluster also provides grants for Physician Assistant programs to encourage and prepare students for primary care practice in rural and urban Health Professional Shortage Areas. The General Dentistry, Pediatric Dentistry, Dental Public Health, and Dental Hygiene programs provide grants to dental schools, dental hygiene schools, and hospitals to create or expand primary care dental training. \u2014Because much of the Nation's healthcare is delivered in remote areas, the Inter- disciplinary, Community-Based Linkages cluster supports community-based training of health professionals. These programs are designed to encourage health professionals to return to such settings after completing their training and to encourage collaboration between two or more disciplines. The Clinical Training in Interprofessional Practice program supports interdisciplinary train- ing opportunities that prepare providers to deliver coordinated, efficient, and high-quality care. The Area Health Education Centers (AHECs) offer clinical training opportunities to health professions and nursing students in rural and other underserved communities by extending the resources of academic health centers to these areas. AHECs improve health by leading the Nation in the re-cruitment, training, and retention of a diverse health workforce for underserved communities. By leveraging State and local matching funds to form networks of health-related institutions, AHECs also provide education services to stu-dents, faculty, and practitioners. The Geriatric Health Professions programs, in-cluding the Geriatric Academic Career Award program and Geriatric Education Centers, are all designed to bolster the number and quality of healthcare pro-viders caring for the rapidly growing number of older adults and to expand geri-atrics training to all healthcare professionals. For example, the programs pro-vide interprofessional education and training on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) program is the Nation's only Federal program dedicated solely to the education and training of doctoral- level psychologists. GPE supports the interprofessional training of doctoral-level psychology students in providing supervised mental and behavioral health serv-ices to underserved populations (i.e. older adults, children, chronically ill, and victims of abuse and trauma, including returning military personnel and their families) in rural and urban communities. The Mental and Behavioral Health Education and Training Grant Program supports the training of psychologists, social workers, and child and adolescent professionals. These programs together work to close the gap in access to quality mental and behavioral healthcare services by increasing the number of qualified mental health clinicians. \u2014The Minority and Disadvantaged Health Professionals Training cluster helps improve healthcare access in underserved areas and the representation of mi-495 nority and disadvantaged individuals in the health professions. Diversifying the healthcare workforce is a central focus of the programs, making them a key player in mitigating racial, ethnic, and socio-economic health disparities. Fur-ther, the programs emphasize cultural competency for all health professionals, an important role as the Nation's population is growing and becoming increas-ingly diverse. Minority Centers of Excellence support increased research on mi-nority health, establish educational pipelines, and provide clinical experiences in community-based health facilities. The Health Careers Opportunity Program helps to improve the development of a competitive applicant pool through part-nerships with local educational and community organizations and extends the healthcareers pipeline to the K-12 level. The Faculty Loan Repayment and Fac-ulty Fellowship programs provide incentives for schools to recruit underrep-resented minority faculty. The Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students sup-ports students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are eligible and enrolled as full-time health professions students. \u2014The Health Professions Workforce Information and Analysis program provides grants to institutions to collect and analyze data to advise future decision-making on the health professions and nursing programs. The Health Profes-sions Research and Health Professions Data programs have developed valuable, policy-relevant studies on the distribution and training of health professionals. The National Center for Workforce Analysis performs research and analysis on health workforce issues, including supply and demand, to help inform both pub-lic and private decisionmaking. \u2014The Public Health Workforce Development programs help increase the number of individuals trained in public health, identify the causes of health problems, and respond to such issues as managed care, new disease strains, food supply, and bioterrorism. The Public Health Traineeships and Public Health Training Centers seek to alleviate the critical shortage of public health professionals by providing up-to-date training for current and future public health workers, par-ticularly in underserved areas. Preventive Medicine Residencies, which do not receive funding through Medicare GME, provide training in the only medical specialty that teaches both clinical and population medicine to improve commu-nity health. This cluster also includes a focus on loan repayment as an incentive for health professionals to practice in disciplines and settings experiencing shortages. The Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program offers loan re-payment for pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists, and child and adolescent mental and behavioral health specialists, in exchange for service in underserved areas. \u2014The Nursing Workforce Development programs under Title VIII provide support for nursing students across the entire education spectrum improve the access to, and quality of, healthcare in underserved areas. These programs provide the largest source of Federal funding for nursing education, providing loans, schol-arships, traineeships, and programmatic support that, between fiscal year 2006 and 2012, supported over 450,000 nurses and nursing students as well as nu-merous academic nursing institutions and healthcare facilities. Each year, nurs-ing schools turn away tens of thousands of qualified applications at all degree levels due to an insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, clinical preceptors, and budget constraints. At the same time, the need for nurs-ing services and licensed, registered nurses is expected to increase significantly over the next 20 years. The Advanced Education Nursing program awards grants to train a variety of nurses with advanced education, including clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, certified nurse-midwives, nurse anes-thetists, public health nurses, nurse educators, and nurse administrators. Work-force Diversity grants support opportunities for nursing education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds through scholarships, stipends, and retention activities. Nurse Education, Practice, and Retention grants help schools of nurs-ing, academic health centers, nurse-managed health centers, State and local governments, and other healthcare facilities to develop programs that provide nursing education, promote best practices, and enhance nurse retention. The Loan Repayment and Scholarship Program repays up to 85 percent of nursing student loans and offers full-time and part-time nursing students the oppor-tunity to apply for scholarship funds in exchange for 2 years of practice in a designated nursing shortage area. The Comprehensive Geriatric Education grants are used to train nursing professionals who will provide direct care to older Americans, develop and disseminate geriatric curricula, train faculty members, and provide continuing education. The Nurse Faculty Loan program provides a student loan fund administered by schools of nursing to increase the number of qualified nurse faculty. 496 1Kitahata, Gange, Abraham, et al.

The NURSE Corps supports under-graduate and graduate nursing students with a preference for those with the greatest financial need. The Primary Care Loan (PCL) program provides loans in return for dedicated service in primary care. The Health Professional Student Loan (HPSL) program provides loans for financially needy health professions students based on institutional determination. These programs are funded out of each institution's revolving fund and do not receive Federal appropriations. The Loans for Disadvantaged Students program provides grants to institutions to make loans to disadvantaged students. Title VII and Title VIII programs guide individuals to high-demand health profes- sions jobs, helping individuals reach their goals and communities fill their health needs. Further, numerous studies demonstrate that the Title VII and Title VIII pro-grams graduate more minority and disadvantaged students and prepare providers that are more likely to serve in Community Health Centers (CHC) and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). The multi-year nature of health professions education and training, coupled with provider shortages across many disciplines and in many communities, necessitate a strong, continued, and reliable commitment to the Title VII and Title VIII programs. While HPNEC members understand the budget limitations facing the Sub- committee, we respectfully urge support for $520 million for the Title VII and VIII programs. We look forward to working with the Subcommittee to prioritize the health professions programs in fiscal year 2015 and into the future. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE HIV M EDICINE ASSOCIATION The HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) represents more than 5,000 physicians, scientists and other healthcare professionals who practice on the frontline of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Our members provide medical care and treatment to people with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. and globally, lead HIV prevention programs and conduct research that has led to the development of effective HIV prevention and treatment options. We urge you to invest in the medical research supported by the National Institutes of Health and sustain and grow funding for the Ryan White Program at the Health Resources and Services and Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) HIV and STD prevention programs. Early access to effective HIV treatment helps patients with HIV live healthy and productive lives and is cost effective. 1Treatment not only saves the lives of individ- uals with HIV but has critical benefits to public health in that it reduces risk of transmitting HIV to near zero. 2However, despite our remarkable progress in HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment, HIV/AIDS remains a serious epidemic in the United States with a record 1.1 million people living with HIV and an estimated 50,000 new infections occurring annually. In our country, HIV infection dispropor-tionately impacts racial and ethnic minority communities and low income people who depend on public services for their life-saving healthcare and treatment. The rate of new HIV infection in African Americans is 8 times that of whites based on population size. 3Globally there are more than 35.3 million people living with HIV, the great majority of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. We are beginning to see improve-ments thanks in large part to U.S. investments in programs like PEPFAR: HIV prevalence has leveled to about 0.8 percent, the number of deaths have declined by 30 percent since 2005 and new infections have declined by 33 percent since 2001. Still there are 2.3 million new infections each year\u2014more than 6,300 each day. The funding requests in our testimony largely reflect the consensus of the Federal AIDS Policy Partnership (FAPP), a coalition of HIV organizations from across the country, and are estimated to be the amounts necessary to mount an effective re-sponse to the domestic HIV epidemic and meet the need in communities across the country. National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u2014Office of AIDS Research (OAR): HIVMA strongly supports an fiscal year 2015 funding level of at least $32 billion for the NIH, including at least $3.2 billion for the NIH Office of AIDS Research. This level 497 4Based on data from Gilman BH, Green, JC. Understanding the variation in costs among HIV primary care providers. AIDS Care.2008:20;1050-6. of funding is vital to sustain the pace of research that will improve the health and quality of life for millions of men, women and children in the U.S. and in the devel-oping world. Years of flat funding for biomedical research has eroded our capacity to sustain our Nation's historic worldwide leadership in HIV/AIDS research and in-novation, and is discouraging cultivation of the next generation of scientists. Our past investment in comprehensive HIV/AIDS research paid off enormously in dramatic gains that resulted in reductions in mortality from AIDS of nearly 80 per-cent in the U.S. and in other countries where treatment is available. This research also helped reduce the mother to child HIV transmission rate from 25 percent to less than 1 percent in the U.S. and to very low levels in other countries where treat-ment is available. Strong, sustained NIH funding is a critical national priority that will foster better health, economic revitalization and help realize the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Sustained increases in funding are also essential to train the next genera-tion of scientists and prepare them to make tomorrow's HIV discoveries. Congress should ensure the Nation does not delay vital HIV/AIDS research progress. HIV/AIDS Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration: We strongly urge you to increase funding for the Ryan White Program by $123.2 million in fiscal year 2015. For Ryan White Part C programs in fiscal year 2015, we urge an allocation of at least $225.1 million, or a $24 million increase over the fiscal year 2014 level for Part C. The comprehensive HIV care model or ''medical home'' that is supported by the Ryan White Program has been highly successful at achieving positive clinical outcomes with a complex patient population. The annual healthcare costs for HIV patients who are not able to achieve viral suppression (often due to delayed diagnosis and care) are nearly 2.5 times that of healthier HIV patients. 4 The HIV medical clinics funded through Part C have been struggling to meet the increased demand for patients making an increase in funding critical to prevent ad-ditional staffing, laboratory and service cuts. At a bare minimum, we strongly urge you to support an increase of $24 million over fiscal year 2014 appropriated funding for Ryan White Part C. While HIVMA welcomes the $4 million increase for Part C programs proposed in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget, we are concerned about the proposal to con-solidate Ryan White Part D funding into Part C. Our specific concerns include: \u2014Part D funding supports effective HIV care and treatment services for vulner- able populations, including women and adolescents. With adolescents account-ing for 39 percent of new HIV infections in the U.S., it is critical to target re-sources effectively. \u2014A loss of a Part D program could reduce the community's access to HIV care and treatment as programs are forced to compete or consolidate with Part C clinics. \u2014Since most Ryan White medical clinics receive funding from multiple parts of the Ryan White Program, reduction of funding to one part can have damaging and unintended consequences to the overall services provided. While the ACA provides important new healthcare coverage options for many pa- tients, most health insurers fail to support the comprehensive care and treatment necessary for many patients to manage HIV infection. High cost sharing, benefit gaps and limited state uptake of the Medicaid expansion necessitate a vital and on-going role for the Ryan White Program. Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP): HIVMA strongly urges total fiscal year 2015 funding of $1.319 billion for the CDC's NCHHSTP, an increase of $198.2 million over the fiscal year 2014 level, including increases of: $55.1 million for HIV prevention and surveillance, $16.4 million for viral hepatitis and $57.4 mil-lion for tuberculosis prevention. We also support a funding level of at least $464.3 million for CDC's global health programs, which includes resources for the agency's essential role in implementing PEPFAR programs in developing Nations. We are es-pecially concerned about flat funding of CDC's global HIV programs, and request an increase of at least $3.3 million to that line item for a total of $132 million. Policy Riders\u2014Remove the Harmful Ban on Federal Funding for Syringe Ex- change Programs: HIVMA strongly urges re-instatement in fiscal year 2015 report language of policy previously enacted into law in fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011 allowing Federal funding to be used for syringe exchange programs. Such ac-tion will support local control by letting local communities make their own decisions about how best to prevent new HIV and viral hepatitis infections. We cannot afford 498 to forego any of the scientifically proven tools in the HIV prevention tool box if we are going to end AIDS in the U.S. and around the globe. Conclusion: Historically, our Nation has made significant strides in responding to the HIV pandemic here at home and around the world, but years of flat funding is now causing us to lose ground, as funding priorities have shifted away from pub-lic health and research programs. We must seize the opportunity to limit the toll of this deadly infectious disease on our planet, to save the lives of millions who are infected or at risk of infection here in the U.S. and around the globe, and to realize the vision of an AIDS-free generation.

CAPACITY AT THE NATIONAL CHIMPANZEE SANCTUARY FOR FEDERALLY OWNED CHIMPANZEES RETIRED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH The HSUS and HSLF request NIH be given authority to use $5 million of funds appropriated in this and subsequent appropriations bills for extramural construction and renovation within the National Chimpanzee Sanctuary System. In 2013, NIH announced their plan to retire hundreds of government owned chimpanzees to sanc-tuary. This decision followed years of scientific review which determined chim-panzees are not necessary for research. Additional sanctuary construction is needed to enable NIH to move forward with their plan to retire the vast majority of govern-ment owned chimpanzees to sanctuary. Even with upfront construction expendi-tures, transferring government owned chimpanzees from laboratories to sanctuaries will save significant taxpayer funds over the lifetimes of the chimpanzees due to the lower cost of sanctuary care. Further basis of our request can be found below. Background information In June of 2013, the National Institutes of Health announced their plan to retire all but 50 government-owned chimpanzees to sanctuary, significantly curtail the use of chimpanzees in NIH funded studies and not to revitalize breeding of chimpanzees for research. These decisions resulted from an Institute of Medicine study in 2011 which found that chimpanzees are not necessary for the vast majority of research. Immediately following the announcement of the IOM study results, NIH accepted the findings and assembled a panel of experts to advise them on the best way to implement the IOM findings. NIH ultimately accepted nearly all of the expert pan-el's recommendations in their final decision. Prior to announcing their plan, NIH had already begun the transfer of the 110 government owned chimpanzees at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana to Chimp Haven (the National Chimpanzee Sanctuary), also located in Louisiana. The transfer is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2014. At that point, approximately 350 government-owned chimpanzees will remain in laboratories\u2014300 of whom will be slated for retirement to sanctuary per NIH's plan. In late November of 2013, the President signed into law amendments to the Chimpanzee Health Improvement Maintenance and Protection (CHIMP Act) which provided continued funding for the care, maintenance and transportation of feder-ally owned chimpanzees over the next 5 years. These amendments have enabled NIH to use their funding judiciously by continuing to support chimpanzees in sanc-tuary and also set the stage for NIH to move forward with their plan to retire hun-dreds more chimpanzees. Costs in laboratories vs. sanctuary Accredited sanctuaries provide the highest welfare standards for chimps at a lower cost to taxpayers than housing chimpanzees in barren labs (see chart below). It is estimated that transferring the 300 government-owned chimpanzees who are slated for retirement from the laboratories where they are currently housed to the national sanctuary would save taxpayers anywhere from $1.7 million to $2.7 million per year in care and maintenance costs. 499 Construction to house more chimpanzees in sanctuary will require an upfront ex- penditure. However, due to the lower per diem cost in sanctuary, retiring chim-panzees to sanctuary will still yield a significant savings to taxpayers over the long term. The sooner the construction is completed and the chimpanzees are moved to sanctuary, the more the government will save over the lifetimes of the chim-panzees\u2014which can be up to 60 years.

We appreciate the opportunity to share our views for the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2015. We hope the Committee will be able to accommodate this request. Thank you for your consideration. HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING , TOXICITY PATHWAY PROFILING , AND BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH \u2014OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR In 2008, NIH, NIEHS and EPA signed a memorandum of understanding to col- laborate with each other to identify and/or develop high throughput screening as-says that investigate ''toxicity pathways'' that contribute to a variety of adverse health outcomes (e.g., from acute oral toxicity to long-term effects like cancer). In addition, the MOU recognized the necessity for these Federal research organizations to work with ''acknowledged experts in different disciplines in the international sci-entific community.'' Much progress has been made, including FDA joining the MOU, but there is still a significant amount of research, development and translational science needed to bring this vision forward to where it can be used with confidence for safety determinations by regulatory programs in the government and product stewardship programs in the private sector. In particular, there is a growing need to support research to develop the key science-based interpretation tools which will accelerate using 21st century approaches for predictive risk analysis. We believe the Office of the Director at NIH can play a leadership role for the entire US govern-ment by funding both extramural and intramural research. We respectfully request the following committee report language as a placeholder, which is supported by The HSUS, HSLF, and the American Chemistry Council. 500 NIH Director The Committee supports NIH's leadership role in modernizing the approach for evaluating the safety of pharmaceuticals and chemicals based on the incorporation of advanced molecular biological and computational methods that envisions a move away from animal tests. NIH has indicated that development of this science is crit-ical to several of its priorities, from personalized medicine to tackling specific dis-eases such as cancer and diabetes and including critical initiatives such as BRAIN and the National Center for Advancing Translational Science. The Committee en-courages NIH to continue to expand both its intramural and extramural support for the use of human biology-based experimental and computational approaches in health research to further define human biology, disease pathways, and toxicity and to develop tools for their integration into clinical strategies and safety determination paradigms. Extramural and intramural funding should be made available for the development and evaluation of the relevance and reliability of human biology-based and pathway approaches and prediction tools to assure readiness and utility for reg-ulatory and clinical applications, including pilot studies of pathway-based risk as-sessments. The Committee requests an update on current activities, a plan for fu-ture activities, and the fiscal year 2015 funding level for this area of research in the fiscal year 2016 congressional budget justification. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA 'S On behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), I am pleased to provide testimony in support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) components that work to prevent, detect and treat infectious diseases (ID). IDSA represents more than 10,000 ID physicians and scientists devoted to patient care, prevention, public health, education, and research. As communicated to the full Senate Appropriations Committee through testimony for the record in advance of its April 29th hearing ''Driving Innovation through Federal Investments,'' IDSA recommends increased fiscal year 2015 Federal investments in public health and biomedical research to save lives, contain healthcare costs, and promote economic growth. More specifically, IDSA encourages the Subcommittee to provide a program level of $7.8 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as $32 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). IDSA is particularly supportive of the proposed CDC Detect and Protect Against Antibiotic Resistance Initiative and requests that it be fully funded at $30 million. We ask that the Sub-committee also advance fiscal year 2015 appropriations that reflect the national se-curity and public health significance of the Biomedical Advanced Research and De-velopment Authority (BARDA). All of these investments are a necessary part of a Federal strategy to decrease the incidence and fatality of infectious diseases in our population. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION The ID community's partnership with the CDC has never been more necessary, as we work to address the public health crisis of rising antibiotic resistance while continuing efforts in other important areas such as increasing immunization rates and slowing the spread of HIV. Last fall, CDC issued a report, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 that for the first time ranked and detailed the threats posed by antibiotic re-sistant microbes. Conservative estimates reveal that more than two million Ameri-cans suffer antibiotic resistant infections each year, which result in approximately 23,000 deaths. The actual numbers are likely far higher, as our surveillance and data collection capabilities cannot yet capture the full disease burden. These infec-tions due to antibiotic resistant microbes cost tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. healthcare system annually, and the problem is worsening. The CDC recommended actions in four core areas to address the problem, including prevention, tracking, an-tibiotic stewardship, and development of new antibiotics and rapid diagnostics. The CDC has proposed fiscal year 2015 activities in each of these areas. National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) The NCEZID plays a leading role in CDC efforts to address antibiotic resistance. As such, we ask that it be provided at least the $445 million requested by the Ad-ministration, including at least $30 million for the Detect and Protect Against Anti-biotic Resistance Initiative. This initiative, which is supported by many stakeholders in the health community, would establish regional prevention collaboratives to im-plement best practices for antibiotic use and infection prevention, create a detection network of five regional labs to speed up identification of the most concerning 501 threats, improve antibiotic stewardship, and develop an isolate library that will help facilitate the development of desperately needed new antibiotics and diagnostics. The initiative directly addresses the recommended actions from the CDC 2013 re-port. The CDC projects that over 5 years the initiative will lead to a 50 percent re-duction in health-care associated Clostridium difficile (C. diff), 50 percent decline in health-care associated carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), 30 percent decline in invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 30 percent decline in health-care associated drug-resistant Pseudomonas sp., and 25 percent re-duction in drug-resistant Salmonella infections. These bacteria claim thousands of lives annually. CRE, for one, have become resistant to all or nearly all currently available antibiotics. Further, nearly 50 percent of those who develop bloodstream infections from CRE die. IDSA and numerous other stakeholders support the proposed $14 million increase for the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), which would increase the number of healthcare facilities reporting antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance data and would develop and evaluate new infection prevention strategies. IDSA thanks Congress for funding the Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) ini- tiative in fiscal year 2014 and recommends that at least $30 million be allocated for it in fiscal year 2015. AMD strengthens CDC's molecular sequencing tools and bioinformatics capacity to more rapidly and accurately detect infectious diseases and resistance. A recent World Health Organization report on antimicrobial resistance reiterates that we are in the midst of a public health crisis that is impacting all regions of the world and requires immediate action on the part of governments and society. IDSA applauds the Administration for launching a Global Health Security Agenda, which would strengthen the capacity of nations to prevent, detect and slow the spread of infectious diseases across borders, simultaneously reducing threats to the United States. We ask that you provide the initiative with funding allocated in the fiscal year 2015 PBR. National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) We know that vaccines are among the most cost-effective clinical preventative services. However, according to the February 2014 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), adult immunization rates remain low for most routinely recommended vaccines and considerably short of Healthy People 2020 targets. Each year in the United States, more than 40,000 adults die from illnesses that are pre-ventable through vaccination. IDSA opposes the $51 million program level reduction to the CDC Immunization Grant Program (Section 317) contained in the PBR. Although the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover immunizations, this alone will not guarantee access or utilization. The Section 317 funds are critical to help providers obtain and store vaccines; establish and maintain vaccine registries; as well as to educate providers and the public about vaccine recommendations, effectiveness and safety; and pro-mote universal vaccination of healthcare workers. CDC plays a critical role in seasonal and pandemic influenza preparedness and response, including conducting important surveillance activities that better inform response efforts and providing public communications regarding influenza preven-tion and treatment. Lack of sufficient funding for these efforts could lead to an in-creased incidence and severity of influenza, as well as increased hospitalization costs and mortality. In the long term, continuously funded efforts will be more cost- effective than the periodic emergency supplemental funding approach that histori-cally has been used to fund such efforts. IDSA supports the proposed fiscal year 2015 increase of $15 million for these efforts. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Within NIH, we believe that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis- eases (NIAID) should be funded at least at the $4.58 billion requested by the Ad-ministration in the fiscal year 2014 PBR. Nearly flat-funding NIAID limits invest-ment in new research and serves as a disincentive for young people to pursue ID research careers so critical to the discovery of new therapies, new diagnostic ap-proaches, and new preventive strategies. The NIAID recently began funding a new clinical trials network focused on anti- biotic-resistant bacterial infections. With sufficient funding, the new research net-work/infrastructure will conduct critical studies to address antibiotic resistance as well as begin to answer questions that will help fill the nearly empty antibiotic R&D pipeline. Severe economic disincentives have caused a mass exodus of private com-502 panies from the antibiotics market, making federally funded research in this area more critical than ever. An IDSA report issued in April 2013 identified only seven new drugs in development for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-re-sistant Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). The Transatlantic Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR) also recently issued a report, which identified the broken pipeline of new antibacterial drugs as a key obstacle in dealing with resistance. The TATFAR report highlighted NIAID support of clinical research aimed at filling gaps in drug R&D and lowering the associated economic risk to industry. We applaud NIAID's initiative in launching the new network. However, IDSA recommends in-creased investment in this area. A recent IDSA report, Better Tests, Better Care: Improved Diagnostics for Infec- tious Diseases, highlighted the need for advancements in diagnostic tools to address bacterial, viral and fungal infections and recommends strengthened NIAID funding for this priority. Faster, more accurate diagnostics lead to better treatments and im-proved patient outcomes. In addition, new diagnostics are needed to identify pa-tients with highly contagious illnesses so that containment and prevention measures can be undertaken. Diagnostics can improve physicians' ability to discern which in-fections need antibiotics, and thereby help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics that drives the development of antibiotic resistance. ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE (ASPR) Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) ASPR plays a key leadership role in coordinating Federal efforts to sufficiently protect the Nation from biothreats, pandemics and emerging infections. IDSA rec-ommends increased funding for BARDA, which has been flat-funded for several years. Additional investment in medical countermeasure development is critical to prepare for both intentional attacks and naturally emerging infections. BARDA is a critical source of funding for public-private collaborations for antibiotic, diagnostic and vaccine R&D. We ask that the Subcommittee move forward with a sense of urgency to bolster Federal initiatives aimed at dealing with issues such as antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics and rapid diagnostics R&D, adult immunizations, and biodefense. The appropriation of sufficient fiscal year 2015 resources to address ID issues is a nec-essary complement to efforts that are currently underway within the Senate and House authorizing committees. Thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement on behalf of the Nation's ID physicians and scientists. Please forward any questions to Jonathan Nurse. [This statement was submitted by Jonathan Nurse, Director, Government Rela- tions, Public Policy and Government Relations, Infectious Diseases Society of Amer-ica.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS \u2014$32 Billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at an increase of $1 bil- lion over fiscal year 2012. Increase funding for the National Cancer Institute (NCI), The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) by 12 percent. \u2014Continue focus on Digestive Disease Research and Education at NIH, Includ- ing), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Fecal Incontinence Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (Gerd) Gastroparesis, and Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS). Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the International Founda- tion for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) regarding the importance of functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMD) research. Established in 1991, IFFGD is a patient-driven nonprofit organization dedicated to assisting indi-viduals affected by FGMIDs, and providing education and support for patients, healthcare providers, and the public. IFFGD also works to advance critical research on FGIMDs in order to develop better treatment options and to eventually find cures. IFFGD has worked closely with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on many priorities, and I served on the National Commission on Digestive Diseases (NCDD), which released a long-range plan in 2009, entitled Opportunities and Chal-lenges in Digestive Diseases Research: Recommendations of the National Commis-sion on Digestive Diseases. 503 The need for increased research, more effective and efficient treatments, and the hope for discovering a cure for FGIMDs are close to my heart. My own experiences of suffering from FGIMDs motivated me to establish IFFGD, and I was shocked to discover that despite the high prevalence of FGIMDs among all demographic groups, such a lack of research existed. This translates into a dearth of diagnostic tools, treatments, and patient supports. Even more shocking is the lack of awareness among the medical community and the public, leading to significant delays in diag-nosis, frequent misdiagnosis, and inappropriate treatments including unnecessary surgery. Most FGIMDs have no cure and limited treatment options, so patients face a lifetime of chronic disease management. The costs associated with these diseases range from $25-$30 billion annually; economic costs are also reflected in work ab- senteeism and lost productivity. IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME IBS affects 30 to 45 million Americans, conservatively at least 1 out of every 10 people. It is a chronic disease that causes abdominal pain and discomfort associated with a change in bowel pattern, such as diarrhea and/or constipation. As a ''func-tional disorder,'' IBS affects the way the muscles and nerves work, but the bowel does not appear to be damaged on medical tests. Without a diagnostic test, IBS often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years. Even after IBS is identified, treatment options are limited and vary from patient to patient. Due to persistent pain and bowel unpredictability, individuals may distance themselves from social events and work. Stigma surrounding bowel habits may act as barrier to treatment, as patients are not comfortable discussing their symptoms with doctors. Many peo-ple also dismiss their symptoms or attempt to self-medicate with over-the-counter medications. Outreach to physicians and the general public remain critical to over-come these barriers to treatment and assist patients. FECAL INCONTINENCE At least 12 million Americans suffer from fecal incontinence. Incontinence crosses all age groups, but is more common among women and the elderly of both sexes. Often it is associated with neurological diseases, cancer treatments, spinal cord inju-ries, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and uterine cancer. Causes of fecal incontinence include: damage to the anal sphincter muscles, damage to the nerves of the anal sphincter muscles or the rectum, loss of storage capacity in the rectum, diarrhea, or pelvic floor dysfunction. People may feel ashamed or hu-miliated, and most attempt to hide the problem for as long as possible. Some don't want to leave the house in fear they might have an accident in public; they with-draw from friends and family, and often limit work or education efforts. Inconti-nence in the elderly is the primary reason for nursing home admissions, an already significant social and economic burden in our aging population. In 2002, IFFGD sponsored a consensus conference entitled, Advancing the Treatment of Fecal and Urinary Incontinence Through Research: Trial Design, Outcome Measures, and Re-search Priorities. IFFGD also collaborated with NIH on the NIH State-of-the- Science Conference on the Prevention of Fecal and Urinary Incontinence in Adults in 2007. NIDDK recently launched a Bowel Control Awareness Campaign (BCAC) that provides resources for healthcare providers, information about clinical trials, and ad-vice for individuals suffering from bowel control issues. The BCAC is an important step in reaching out to patients, and we encourage continued support for this cam-paign. Further research on fecal incontinence is critical to improve patient quality of life and implement the research goals of the NCDD. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE GERD is a common disorder which results from the back-flow of stomach contents into the esophagus. GERD is often accompanied by chronic heartburn and acid re-gurgitation, but sometimes the presence of GERD is only revealed when dangerous complications become evident. There are treatment options available, but they are not always effective and may lead to serious side effects. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) affects as many as one-third of all full term infants born in America each year and even more premature infants. GER results from immature upper gastro-intestinal motor development. Up to 8 percent of children and adolescents will have GER or GERD due to lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction and may require long- term treatment. 504 GASTROPARESIS Gastroparesis, or delayed gastric emptying, refers to a stomach that empties slow- ly. Gastroparesis is characterized by symptoms from the delayed emptying of food, namely: bloating, nausea, vomiting, or feeling full after eating only a small amount of food. Gastroparesis can occur as a result of several conditions, and is present in 30 percent to 50 percent of patients with diabetes mellitus. A person with diabetic gastroparesis may have episodes of high and low blood sugar levels due to the un-predictable emptying of food from the stomach, leading to diabetic complications. Other causes of gastroparesis include Parkinson's disease and some medications. In many patients the cause cannot be found and the disorder is termed idiopathic gastroparesis. CYCLIC VOMITING SYNDROME CVS is a disorder with recurrent episodes of severe nausea and vomiting inter- spersed with symptom free periods. The periods of intense, persistent nausea and vomiting, accompanied by abdominal pain, prostration, and lethargy, last hours to days. Previously thought to occur primarily in pediatric populations, it is increas-ingly understood that this crippling syndrome can occur in many age groups, includ-ing adults. CVS patients often go for years without correct diagnosis. CVS leads to significant time lost from school and from work, as well as substantial medical mor-bidity. The cause of CVS is not known. Research is needed to help identify at-risk individuals and develop more effective treatment strategies. SUPPORT FOR CRITICAL RESEARCH IFFGD urges Congress to fund the NIH at level of $32 billion for fiscal year 2015. Strengthening and preserving our Nation's biomedical research enterprise fosters economic growth and supports innovations that enhance the health and well-being of the Nation. Concurrent with overall NIH funding, IFFGD supports the growth of research activities on FGIMDs to strengthen the medical knowledge base and im-prove treatment, particularly through the National Institute of Diabetes and Diges-tive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Such support would expedite the implementa-tion of recommendations from the NCDD. It is also vital for NIDDK to work with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to expand its research on the impact FGIMDs have on pediatric populations. Following years of near level-funding, research has been negatively impacted across all NIH Insti-tutes and Centers. Without additional funding, medical researchers run the risk of losing promising research opportunities that could benefit patients. We applaud the recent establishment of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at NIH. Initiatives like the Cures Acceleration Net-work are critical to overhauling the translational research process and overcoming the challenges that plague treatment development. In addition, new efforts like tak-ing the lead on drug repurposement hold the potential to speed new treatment to patients. We ask that you support NCATS and provide adequate resources for the Center in fiscal year 2015. Thank you for the opportunity to present these views on behalf of the FGIMD community. [This statement was submitted by Nancy J. Norton, President and Co-Founder, International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE INTERSTATE MINING COMPACT COMMISSION We are writing in opposition to the fiscal year 2015 Budget Request for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Labor. In particular, we urge the Subcommittee to reject MSHA's proposed de- funding of the Assistance to States grant program pursuant to Section 503(a) of the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Until fiscal year 2013, MSHA's budget request for state grants was approximately $9 million, which approached the statutorily au-thorized level of $10 million, but still did not fully consider inflationary and pro-grammatic increases being experienced by the states. In fiscal year 2015, based on a realignment of priorities, MSHA has once again chosen to zero out funding for state assistance grants as it did in fiscal year 2014. We urge the Subcommittee to restore funding to the statutorily authorized level of $10 million for state grants so that states are able to fully and effectively carry out their responsibilities under Sec-tions 502 and 503 of the Act, including the training of our Nation's miners. 505 The Interstate Mining Compact Commission is a multi-state governmental organi- zation that represents the natural resource, environmental protection and mine safety and health interests of its 26 member states. The states are represented by their Governors who serve as Commissioners. IMCC is greatly appreciative of actions by Congress in January of this year as part of the Omnibus Appropriation bill for fiscal year 2014 to reject MSHA's pro-posed elimination of funding for the state grants program and to restore funding at the fiscal year 2012 level of $8.4 million. Given that action and the clear message it sent about the importance of state mine safety programs, we had hoped the Ad-ministration would respond accordingly and include funding for these programs in its fiscal year 2015 proposed budget. Clearly, this did not happen and as such we appeal to your Subcommittee to once again restore funding for these vital miner health and safety programs. It should be kept in mind that, whereas MSHA over the years has narrowly inter- preted Assistance to States grants as meaning ''training grants'' only, Section 503 was structured to be much broader in scope and to stand as a separate and distinct part of the overall mine safety and health program. In the Conference Report that accompanied passage of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, the conference committee noted that both the House and Senate bills provided for ''Fed-eral assistance to coal-producing States in developing and enforcing effective health and safety laws and regulations applicable to mines in the States and to promote Federal-State coordination and cooperation in improving health and safety condi-tions in the Nation's coal mines.'' (H.Conf. Report 91-761). The 1977 Amendments to the Mine Safety and Health Act expanded these assistance grants to both coal and metal/non-metal mines and increased the authorization for annual appropria-tions to $10 million. The training of miners was only one part of the obligation envi-sioned by Congress. With respect to the training component of our mine safety programs, IMCC's member states are concerned that without full, stable funding of the State Grants Program, the federally required training for miners employed throughout the U.S. will greatly suffer. States have struggled to maintain efficient and effective miner training programs in spite of increased numbers of trainees and the incremental costs associated therewith. The situation has been further complicated by new statu-tory, regulatory and policy requirements that have grown out of the various reports and recommendations attending the Upper Big Branch investigation. In spite of all this, MSHA has chosen to eliminate funding completely for this critical component of its statutory obligations. In addition to state training programs, these assistance grants also support state mine rescue training programs, mine rescue competitions, EMT training, miner certifications, accident investigations and reporting, review and approval of company safety plans, and, for those states that operate more com-prehensive mine safety and health programs (such as PA, WV, VA, OH, IL, AL, KY and OK), program administrative costs such as supplies, staff training, and travel. We can provide a breakdown of these costs at the Committee's request. In MSHA's budget justification document (at page 70), the agency states that: ''Training plays a critical role in preventing deaths, injuries, and illnesses on the job. By providing effective training, miners are able to recognize possible hazards and understand which procedures are safe to follow. MSHA will continue to increase visibility and emphasize on [sic] training, recognizing its critical role in reducing the number of injuries and fatalities in the mining community.'' We are mystified about how MSHA intends to accomplish these stated objectives without the training and other programs that are provided by the states pursuant to the grants they receive from MSHA\u2014as has been the case since the enactment of the Mine Safety and Health Act in 1969. By way of an explanation for the drastic cut to state grants, MSHA states on page 72 of its budget justification document: ''To meet the demand of the agency's higher priority enforcement activities, MSHA will defund the program and shift the respon-sibility for training back to mine operators. Mine operators will be required to de-velop their own programs or contract these services. MSHA is transitioning to an updated training model, and will develop more of its own training curricula, exer-cises, and materials to assist mine operators with providing a complete training pro-gram to their employees. Consistent with existing statutory requirements, mine op-erators are required to ensure that employees have access to complete training pro-grams.'' While this idea of shifting training responsibilities and costs entirely to mine op- erators may have merit in limited cases, we are uncertain about the ability of the mining industry (especially small operators and contractors) to accommodate these new costs and suspect that any realignment of training responsibilities from the states to the industry will take considerable time and planning. Furthermore, our 506 experience over the past 35 years has demonstrated that the states are often in the best position to design and offer this training in a way that insures that the goals and objectives of Sections 502 and 503 of the Mine Safety and Health Act are ade-quately met. There is clear and tangible evidence of training programs offered by mine operators (or contractors on their behalf) falling well below what would be con-sidered a minimum standard for these types of programs. Furthermore, there have never been any suggestions or allegations that the states are not already providing the necessary ''training curricula, exercises and materials to assist mine operators with providing a complete training program''. MSHA appears to be playing the ''training card'' in its budget justification to duplicate the excellent work that has already been undertaken by the states in this area solely to increase funding for MSHA staff. There have been limited, and not particularly productive, discussions between MSHA and the states about the impacts this proposal will have on state training programs and other components of state mine safety and health programs, including any sort of transition away from how we are currently doing business. To propose such a dramatic shift without first working out the details with the states is inap-propriate and a denigration of the role the states have played in protecting our Na-tion's miners. Furthermore, to expect such a drastic change to occur within a single fiscal year is unrealistic and will only result in confusion and potential negative im-pacts to the availability and quality of miner training and the overall health and safety of miners. MSHA notes in its budget justification document that the State Grants Program trained 132,000 miners in 48 states and the Navajo Nation in fiscal year 2013, a year in which state grants were cut by 66 percent. While MSHA does not admit to what the elimination of this funding will mean for miner training, we believe the consequences could be debilitating. Examples of the direct impacts being reported by just some of the IMCC member states as a result of MSHA's decision follow. More expanded information from each state is appended to this statement and we request that it be included in the record. The most recent accounting of the number of miners trained by the states (and whose training could be jeopardized by funding cuts) based on fiscal year 2012 reporting for coal and metal/nonmetal is as follows: \u2014Kentucky: Trained or tested over 25,000 people. \u2014Louisiana: 1,000 miners trained. \u2014Alaska: 2,343 miners trained. \u2014New Mexico: 2,265 miners trained. miners trained. \u2014Pennsylvania: 7,000 miners trained. \u2014Ohio: 8,443 miners trained (including for mine rescue). \u2014Colorado: 4,229 miners trained. \u2014Arkansas: 2,000 miners trained. \u2014Nevada: 2,700 miners trained. \u2014North Carolina: 6,000\u20148,000 miners trained. \u2014Maryland: 776 miners and contractors trained. \u2014Arizona: 3,056 miners trained. \u2014Virginia: 5,455 miners trained. Interestingly, while MSHA is proposing to eliminate funding for state training grants, it is proposing to increase funding by $2,800,000 and 18 FTEs for its Edu-cational and Policy Development budget activity. This money will allegedly be used to transition from state grants to a ''new training model'' which will include new training curricula, materials and online courses, as well as monitoring operator training plans and instructors. From our perspective, this reflects an acknowledge-ment on MSHA's part that the transition to a totally industry-lead training initia-tive will likely be fraught with difficulties. However, heavy-handed Federal over-sight is not the solution to an effective training program. We have seen this type of approach fail in the past and assert that the training programs operated by the states have resulted in a higher level of success, as indicated by the significantly reduced rates of injuries and fatalities over the past several years. Congress has clearly understood this dynamic as well, appropriating the necessary moneys needed to preserve and enhance state training programs. It should also be kept in mind that effective training programs operated by the states, especially for small opera-tors, are the first and best method to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities in mines. On the other hand, enforcement often comes too late to be effective, and by its very nature is not preventative. We are hopeful that Congress will once again recognize these operational realities in fiscal year 2015 and turn back MSHA's ef-forts to undercut these valuable programs. While we can appreciate MSHA's desire to realign its resources to focus on inspec- tion and enforcement, one of the most effective ways to insure miner health and 507 safety in the first place is through comprehensive and excellent training. The states have been in the forefront of providing this training for over 35 years and are best positioned to continue that work into the future. Furthermore, the Federal govern-ment's relatively modest investment of money in supporting the states to handle this training has paid huge dividends in protecting lives and preventing injuries. The states are also able to provide these services more effectively and at a cost well below what it would cost MSHA to do so. As you consider our request to reject MSHA's proposed cut and instead to increase MSHA's budget for state assistance grants, please keep in mind that the states play a particularly critical role in providing special assistance to small mine operators (those coal mine operators who employ 50 or fewer miners or 20 or fewer miners in the metal/nonmetal area) in meeting their required training needs. This has been a particular focus in those states where metal/non-metal mining operations predomi-nate. These are often small business operators who cannot afford to offer the com-prehensive training that is required under Section 502 of the Mine Safety and Health Act. The states also provide specialized training to the Spanish-speaking communities in the western United States. The ''yo-yo'' effect of inconsistent funding for state assistance grants is having a debilitating effect on the way we do business. To run effective, meaningful pro-grams, states need continuous, stable, reliable and sustainable funding from year to year. We greatly appreciate your efforts to make that happen. We also appreciate the opportunity to submit our views on MSHA's fiscal year 2015 budget request. Please contact us for additional information or to answer any questions you may have. State Reports re Impacts from De-Funding of Assistance to States Grants Pro- gram In preparation for IMCC's presentation of this statement to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, IMCC asked the states three questions, noted below. Responses from each of the reporting states are indicated. What do you anticipate the impacts to your state will be from the elimination of grant funding, including the number of miners who may not be trained? \u2014Kentucky: These cuts will have a devastating effect on our program. Kentucky trains over 20,000 miners yearly. The money we get from MSHA pays our in-structors' salaries. \u2014Louisiana: In Louisiana, the state training is performed through the Louisiana Technical Community College system. If the grant is eliminated, their mine safety training program would be completely eliminated, closing its doors on Sept 30, 2013, and laying off both of its employees. The program trains at least 1,000 miners each year (886 miners from Oct 1, 2012 to present). \u2014Alaska: Eliminating MSHA training funding potentially impacts each of the 16,400 employees and thousands of owner/operators and contractors working in Alaska's mining industry as of January 2013. Up to 2,600 students are MSHA trained and certified each year by the University of Alaska Mine and Petroleum Training Service (''MAPTS''). MAPTS is the MSHA training grant recipient in Alaska. MAPTS staff have pointed out that a loss of MSHA training grant funds will have a disparate impact on small mines located in more remote areas of Alaska. \u2014New Mexico: In prior years the State of New Mexico, through New Mexico Insti- tute of Mining and Technology, received $147,000 from MSHA that was used to train miners in NM to meet the regulatory requirements of 30 CFR Parts 46 and 48 which are mandated training requirements for miners. We train over 2,000 miners in NM yearly. Most of these miners are employed at small busi-ness operations in our state that cannot afford trainers at their small oper-ations. In addition we provide Spanish language training to 200-300 miners yearly and are the only service available to Spanish-speaking miners in the State. \u2014Oklahoma: The Oklahoma Miner Training Institute (OMTI) is funded in part with the state grant. Utilizing the funding provided, OMTI trains 5,000 miners annually in a variety of courses, such as New Miner and Annual Refresher, in accordance with 30 CFR Parts 46 and 48. Without the fully funded support that the state grant provides, the mining community in Oklahoma will be impacted. \u2014Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania trains approximately 7,000 miners and contractors in the Anthracite, Bituminous and Industrial Minerals mines and facilities of the Commonwealth. This training is provided at no cost to the mining commu-nity by in-house staff, Pennsylvania State University and Schuylkill Vo-Tech. We also provide a mine rescue program for small coal and industrial minerals mines to comply with Federal mine rescue requirements and required EMT 508 training through Indiana University of PA at no cost to mine operators. Al- though a majority of large operators provide training for their employees to meet Federal requirements, small mine and facility operators and contractors rely on the MSHA grant for their training needs. Pennsylvania also relies on the MSHA grant to fund other aspects of our mine safety program. These in-clude staff training, health and safety conferences, mine rescue contests, safety equipment, mine rescue supplies, and travel related to these functions. \u2014Ohio: After reviewing our total surface training numbers for the year 2012, it would appear that 1,369 trainees would not have been trained if not for receiv- ing funding from the States Grant program. \u2014Colorado: The impact of the elimination of the MSHA training grant to the min- ers of Colorado and our training program will be acute. We trained 5,742 in fis-cal year 11 and 4,316 in fiscal year 12. This includes, coal, metal, non-metal and contractors who serve the industry. The reduction would be 2,800\u20143,700 miners not trained, including many that receive training in Spanish. The reduc-tion would be salaries and operating costs for two trainers. (The program has 5 FTE total). \u2014Arkansas: While it is difficult for a service provider to estimate the total impact on our state from the elimination of grant funding, we can address how it will impact our ability to provide the mandatory training to the miners and contrac-tors who have utilized our services for years. While the Arkansas MSHA State Training Program has been proactive in trying to maintain the program and continuing to provide effective training to those requesting our service, it has become increasingly difficult to recover the cost for salaries, state match and travel for the sufficient number of staff needed to meet the demand, as well as the costs for maintaining training equipment and supplies. We have already eliminated one part-time position and raised our training fees, but feel confident that if we have to raise them again to generate the revenue needed to sustain the program, it will become a financial hardship on the small mining operations and contractors who are our primary clients. At the current rate, without rais-ing fees, it is likely we would have to eliminate another part-time position, therefore decreasing our ability to provide the mandatory training to our clients requesting the service. Also, grant funds have been used for our staff to attend national and state MSHA conferences and training events. This would have to be completely eliminated. The Arkansas MSHA State Training Program trains an average of 2,000 individual miners and contractors each year. We have been providing new miner, annual refresher, and first aid training. \u2014North Carolina: If State Grant funding is eliminated, we would be reducing our staff of 6 to a staff of 2 based on our state appropriations and the fact we would not be awarded any additional appropriations. I would estimate there would be 6,000 miners we would not be able to provide training for based on previous number of miners and contractors trained. We average training at around 8,000 miners per year. This would be a devastating burden on the small operators who rely on us to assist them with their safety and health programs. Not only will they have to pay a significant amount of money for future training but the quality of training will certainly be a concern. There are many private instruc-tors who do not provide effective, quality training. The mining industry is expe-riencing the lowest incident rates ever, lowest amount of accidents, and a record low number of fatalities and we feel quality, effective training plays a major role with accident prevention. \u2014Maryland: The elimination of the MSHA training grant will be the elimination of the training program in Maryland. Small operators and contractors will have no training. While the national and international companies have their own training programs they still rely on the state to provide training to contractors and often attend statewide forums sponsored by the State Program. \u2014Virginia: Eliminating the MSHA state training funds would negatively affect the quality of mine safety training in Virginia and the quantity of assistance the DM and the DMM provide to small operators and their work force. In par-ticular, the DM's Small Mine Safety Service (which is dedicated to assisting the small mine operators) would be adversely impacted. Small operators and contractors would be immediately affected through any re- duction in the state's ability to provide mine safety training. Loss of funding would also impact ongoing training opportunities for our training staff, and the develop-ment of site-specific training materials, as well as purchase of supplemental train-ing materials, now being offered to mine operators. 509 To what extent will the mining in your state be able to ''develop their own programs or contract these services''? How long do you anticipate this would take? \u2014Kentucky: The majority of our mines involve small mines and have no trainers. The small mines send their employees to our Office of Mine Safety and Licens-ing to receive quality training free of charge. These miners will have to pay a private instructor and in turn receive inadequate training and in some cases will receive no training at all. We've seen many problems in the past with some private instructors not conducting adequate training and they have been re-ported to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission for sanctions. \u2014Louisiana: In the absence of our state training program, the mining industry would have to return to ''fending for themselves'' to train its miners, resulting in an increased cost to industry and possibly lower quality of training for indi-vidual miners. \u2014Alaska: The majority of mines in Alaska are small operations with less than 10 employees that do not have the resources or capabilities to develop and maintain their own training and certification systems. It is uncertain how long it may take to develop programs or contract MSHA training services. At this point, there are no MSHA training providers other than MAPTS consistently available for small mines in Alaska. \u2014Oklahoma: The training OMTI provides serves all of the mining industry, in particular the smaller mining operations. Without the training courses offered, the smaller mine sites are most susceptible to see increased costs and lack of fully trained miners as required in 30 CFR Parts 46 and 48. \u2014Pennsylvania: Without the MSHA funding, small operators will have to either conduct their own training or use training contractors. Penn State University and Schuylkill Vo-Tech have established a reputation and trust with the opera-tors with a no fee option. If the operators wish to continue this arrangement, a significant cost per student must be absorbed by the operators. The quality of training provided by the PA Bureau of Mine Safety, Pennsylvania State Uni-versity, Schuylkill Vo-Tech and Indiana University of PA is very high and loss of this program will have a negative impact on miner safety. It will also impact Pennsylvania's ability to maintain its world class mine safety program and abil-ity to support program functions identified above. One example: Federal law re-quires all mine rescue teams to attend at least two competitions each year, with the states supporting this requirement by holding and supporting these con-tests. With state budgets shrinking, the ability to support these contests with-out Federal funding is in jeopardy. \u2014Ohio: From past experience, the larger mining companies could deal with devel- oping their own programs and could contract out these services if needed. The smaller companies and contract miners would be the ones who either would be left out, or would struggle with maintaining their training programs. As far as the time it would take for these companies and contractors to assume total re-sponsibility for complying with MSHA's training law standards, it would take a considerable amount of time. \u2014Colorado: The reduction in support of mine training particularly affects the me- dium and small operators who make up 95 percent of the mining operations in Colorado. This severely reduces the affect we can all have on preventing acci-dents and injuries BEFORE they become a major incident. Unfortunately, this will leave many operators with few resources for safety and health and result in an increase in MSHA enforcement inspection time, citations, and most unfor-tunately, a likely increase in injury and accident rates in our state. \u2014Arkansas: Since the Arkansas MSHA State Training Program places emphasis on assisting small mining operations and contractors, we are aware that most of these companies are neither staffed nor equipped to provide effective train-ing; whereas, the State Grant staff has multiple years of combined training ex-perience. Small companies are at a distinct disadvantage in the area of pro-viding their own training. \u2014North Carolina: Many small operators will not have the resources to develop their own programs adequately. Many of them would not know how to develop lesson plans, outlines, and have the time or resources to prepare a training pro-gram. They would have to contract their training out to consultants. Mine safe- ty training was geared to be site-specific and company-specific which is how we prepare for our classes for mining operations. Consultants will use a ''canned program'' and there are quality control concerns with a canned program. We know of operators who also rely on on-line training and the miners do not like it because there is no interaction or discussion taking place with on-line train-ing. In terms of how long it will take for an operator to implement its own safe-ty and health training program\u2014probably at least a year or longer. 510 \u2014Maryland: There is no ability for the small operators, many of whom don't even know they need the training until the state advises them, or contractors to pro-vide safety training. Our most frequent calls are from contractors looking to bid work but who have limited safety training and generally do not know where to go to obtain it. \u2014Virginia: Many larger mining companies already have the infrastructure to meet these obligations and do. The true impact of MSHA's decision to eliminate this program will again, fall on the small operators, who have for years de-pended on the Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy (DMME) to assist them in meeting their training obligations required by state and Federal regula-tions. Most small operators will rely on contractors to provide the required training. As a consequence the quality of training may suffer. \u2014New Mexico: If the New Mexico grants program is not available to our small businesses in our Part 46 (sand and gravel or aggregate) industries, the quality of annual refresher and new miner training would suffer. I believe the alter-native will be that a crusher foreman or pit foreman will be assigned to provide the training. This individual will likely have little training experience and even less interest in providing the training. What other unanticipated consequences from the elimination of state grant funding might there be, particularly with respect to miner safety and health? \u2014Kentucky: In our opinion the miners will be the ones to suffer most. They will have to pay for the classes, they will not get adequate training, and the end result will be an increase in mine fatalities. \u2014Louisiana: It strikes us as particularly unfortunate that MSHA would choose this route of cost savings given that many fatalities are found to have insuffi-cient training as a root cause. \u2014Alaska: Eliminating training funding is expected to lead to an increase in min- ing accidents and creates an artificial need for increased enforcement on mine sites. Reduced MSHA-supported training will damage the evolution of safety culture improvements in the mining industry. Focusing solely on enforcement is likely to further deteriorate individual attitudes toward MSHA and voluntary compliance with MSHA requirements. \u2014New Mexico: The Mine Act of 1977 was very specific in Sections 502 and 503 regarding the requirement to train miners and to fund state programs to meet the requirements of the Act. We are a small organization that uses our funding wisely to provide low cost training services to small business and non-English speaking miners in our state. We believe this to be an efficient use of these funds to educate our miners, thereby providing good paying jobs in a safer envi-ronment. \u2014Pennsylvania: There is no question that cutting the State Grant Program goes against the intent of Congress, but more important it will have a negative im-pact on the health and safety of our Nation's miners. Every MSHA accident in-vestigation report highlights the need for quality training to eliminate and re-duce accidents. Not funding the State Grant Program at the maximum amount ($10,000,000) is misguided and wrong and will impact our ability to see that all workers go home to their families at the end of each work shift. \u2014Ohio: For smaller mines and with the contract miners, their safety training would suffer, thus causing a potential increase in mining accidents and serious injuries. \u2014Colorado: Like other states, we maintain a unique and trusting relationship with our mine operators and contractors through regular contact, assistance (such as safety audits, etc.) and education and training. We can quickly access and update our mining community regarding the wide range of regulatory re-quirements, technological improvements in mine safety and sharing of mine health and safety resources. The state program is the gold standard for pro-viding effective and innovative mine health and safety training and training mine employees and contractors to effectively train their own employees. \u2014Arkansas: We believe we will see accidents trend upward. The training provided by the Arkansas MSHA State Training Program has proven to have an impact on reduction in accidents; the statistics reveal that the companies who utilize the State services for their training needs have fewer accidents than the compa-nies who have chosen to go another route to obtain their training. Also, com-pany training might not be comprehensive in certain areas, such as miners' statutory rights, including the right to be provided a safe working environment and the right to refuse to perform unsafe tasks. The State Training program provides comprehensive training that supports accident prevention by focusing on eliminating unsafe practices and conditions that contribute to accidents. 511 State training reinforces miner knowledge of safe work behavior and encourages safe work practices, as well as increasing their knowledge in identifying an un-safe work environment as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations. In addi-tion to training, the State Training staff receives constant e-mails and phone calls regarding safety and health issues. Many of the companies and/or individ-uals the State Grants staff have worked with over the years are not comfortable going directly to Federal MSHA with questions or concerns; whereas, the State has developed a cooperative relationship that has proven mutually beneficial. \u2014North Carolina: Impacts would include not being available to provide special emphasis projects such as mock drills, mine safety and health law seminars, an-nual mine safety and health state conferences, explosives safety courses, and not being able to properly prepare training programs geared to site-specific needs of mining operations. Training plan assistance will not be provided. Fa-talities, accidents, and incident rates will be on the rise because of ineffective training. \u2014Maryland: Impacts would be to lessen the awareness and importance of safety in day to day work situations. Small operators often perform multiple tasks and may not take time to think through a situation such as electrical disconnects on conveyors or repair of faulty wiring. In addition, the state program goes be-yond MSHA and provides CPR training and warning signs of heat stroke, fa-tigue and other health related issues. Also, individual contractors may not get other safety training as required at a small operation. \u2014Virginia: Our most valuable resource, the miner, will be affected the most due to the lack of effective training. Statistics show that, without the proper train-ing, the potential for mining accidents and serious injury does increase signifi-cantly. An increase in unsafe acts and conditions, especially at smaller mining operations and with independent contractors, could certainly result in more ac-cidents and injuries to miners and workers. The increase in unsafe acts and conditions could also increase enforcement action by MSHA and the resulting financial burden could potentially drive many small op-erators out of business. \u2014New Mexico: Our number one priority will be to try to continue the training of our states miners using our State funds. This means that we will be unable to fulfill certain functions that we have addressed in the past. These include helping with mine rescue competitions, completing all of our regulatory respon-sibilities and ensuring interaction with operators on issues such as compliance assistance. A DDENDUM FROM VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF MINES, MINERALS AND ENERGY Our State (Virginia) supports the statement submitted today by the Interstate Mining Compact Commission, of which we are a member, concerning the fiscal year 2015 proposed budget for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) which urges Congress to appropriate $10 million for State assistance grants pursu-ant to Section 503 of the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. This addendum was submitted by Bradley C. (Butch) Lambert, Deputy Director, Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy. [This statement was submitted by Gregory E. Conrad, Executive Director, Inter- state Mining Compact Commission.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS ASSOCIATION SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 \u2014$660,00 for the IC education and Awareness Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u2014$7.8 billion for CDC. \u2014$32 billion for the National institutes of Health (NIH) and Proportional In- creases Across All Institutes and Centers. \u2014Support for NIH Research on IC, including the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Interstitial Cystitis As- sociation (ICA) regarding interstitial cystitis (IC) public awareness and research. ICA was founded in 1984 and is the only nonprofit organization dedicated to im-512 proving the lives of those affected by IC. The Association provides an important ave- nue for advocacy, research, and education. Since its founding, ICA has acted as a voice for those living with IC, enabling support groups and empowering patients. ICA advocates for the expansion of the IC knowledge-base and the development of new treatments. ICA also works to educate patients, healthcare providers, and the public at large about IC. IC is a condition that consists of recurring pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort in the bladder and pelvic region. It is often associated with urinary frequency and ur-gency. This condition may also be referred to as painful bladder syndrome (PBS), bladder pain syndrome (BPS), and chronic pelvic pain (CPP). It is estimated that as many as 12 million Americans have IC symptoms. Approximately two-thirds of these patients are women, though this condition does severely impact the lives of as many as 4 million men. IC has been seen in children and many adults with IC report having experienced urinary problems during childhood. However, little is known about IC in children, and information on statistics, diagnostic tools and treatments specific to children with IC are limited. The exact cause of IC is unknown and there are few treatment options available. There is no diagnostic test for IC and diagnosis is made only after excluding other urinary/bladder conditions. It is not uncommon for patients to experience one or more years delay between the onset of symptoms and a diagnosis of IC. This is exac-erbated when healthcare providers are not properly educated about IC. The effects of IC are pervasive and insidious, damaging work life, psychological well-being, personal relationships, and general health. The impact of IC on quality of life is equally as severe as rheumatoid arthritis and end-stage renal disease. Health-related quality of life in women with IC is worse than in women with endo-metriosis, vulvodynia, and overactive bladder. IC patients have significantly more sleep dysfunction, and higher rates of depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction. Some studies suggest that certain conditions occur more commonly in people with IC than in the general population. These conditions include allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, endometriosis, vulvodynia, fibromyalgia, and migraine headaches. Chron-ic fatigue syndrome, pelvic floor dysfunction, and Sjogren's syndrome have also been reported. IC PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION THROUGH CDC The IC Education and Awareness Program at CDC is critical to improving public and provider awareness of this devastating disease, reducing the time to diagnosis for patients, and disseminating information on pain management and IC treatment options. The IC program has utilized opportunities with charitable organizations to lever- age funds and maximize public outreach. Such outreach includes public service an-nouncements in major markets and the Internet, as well as a billboard campaign along major highways across the country. The IC program has also made informa-tion on IC available to patients and the public though videos, booklets, publications, presentations, educational kits, websites, self-management tools, webinars, blogs, and social media communities such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. For healthcare providers, this program has included the development of a continuing medical education module, targeted mailings, and exhibits at national medical con-ferences. The CDC IC Education and Awareness Program also provides patient support that empowers patients to self-advocate for their care. Many physicians are hesitant to treat IC patients because of the time it takes to treat the condition and the lack of answers available. Further, IC patients may try numerous potential therapies, in-cluding alternative and complementary medicine, before finding an approach that works for them. For this reason, it is especially critical for the IC program to pro-vide patients with information about what they can do to manage this painful condi-tion and lead a normal life. ICA recommends a specific appropriation of $660,000 in fiscal year 2015 for the CDC IC Education and Awareness Program. ICA also recommends an appropriation of $7.8 billion for CDC, as well as continued support for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion which administers the IC pro-gram. IC RESEARCH THROUGH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH The National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains a robust research portfolio on IC with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) serving as the primary Institute for IC research. Research currently un-derway holds great promise to improving our understanding of IC and developing 513 better treatments and a cure. The NIDDK Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network studies the underlying causes of chronic urological pain syndromes. The MAPP Study is now in its second phase and researchers hope to utilize gathered data on patient experiences with IC to identify different phenotypes of the disease. Phenotype information will ultimately allow physicians to prescribe treatments with more specificity. Research on chronic pain that is significant to the community is also supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) as well as the National Center for Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). Additionally, the NIH investigator- initiated research portfolio continues to be an important mechanism for IC research-ers to create new avenues for interdisciplinary research. ICA also supports the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), including the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN). Initiatives like CAN are critical to overhauling the translational research process and overcoming the re-search ''valley of death'' that currently plagues treatment development. In addition, drug repurposement and other efforts led by NCATS hold the potential to speed ac-cess to new treatment for patients. ICA encourages support for NCATS and the pro-vision of adequate resources for the Center in fiscal year 2015. ICA recommends a funding level of $32 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2015. ICA also recommends continued support the MAPP Study administered by NIDDK. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the interstitial cystitis com- munity.

The Federal budget for Tribal health programs and services should reflect the U.S. Government's commitment to honor and uphold its Treaty and Trust obligations to American Indians and Alaska Natives. When Tribal Governments are empowered through Self-Governance with the flexibility and resources to provide quality healthcare to their citizens, these in-vestments hold tremendous promise for not only Tribal communities but for the communities that surround them. The Jamestown Family Health and Dental Clinics have demonstrated a real re- turn on the Federal investment and reflect the tremendous potential Tribes have to not only reduce healthcare costs but to increase prevention and treatment serv-ices for their Tribal citizens. TRIBAL SPECIFIC HEALTH APPROPRIATION PRIORITIES \u2014Restore Sequestered Amounts/Exempt Indian Programs from Budget Reduc- tions \u2014Fully Fund Contract Support Costs\u2014Separate Mandatory Appropriation \u2014Budget Equity for Tribal Governments/Programs Accessible to Small Tribes \u2014Medicare/Medicaid Reimbursement \u2014Provide $30 Million for Part A Grants for Native Americans in the Older Ameri- cans Act\u2014Title VI \u2014Fund SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Tribal Prevention Grant Program at $50 million\u2014make sure programs are accessible to small Tribes NATIONAL HEALTH APPROPRIATION PRIORITIES \u2014Definition of Indian \u2014Fully Fund the Implementation of ACA Inclusive of the IHCIA \u2014Self-Governance Promotes Efficiency and the Effective Use of Federal Funds (Title VI of the ISDEAA REGIONAL /NATIONAL HEALTH APPROPRIATION PRIORITIES Our Budget Request endorses the requests of The Northwest Portland Area In- dian Health Board, Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, the Indian Health Serv-ice Tribal Self-Governance Advisory Committee and the National Congress of Amer-ican Indians and the National Indian Health Board. 514 TRIBAL SPECIFIC PRIORITIES Restore Sequestered Amounts/Exempt Indian Programs from Budget Reductions Despite the Federal trust obligation and the well documented and profound needs of Indian country, Tribal programs were subjected to sequestration and forced spending reductions. These budgetary reductions were devastating to our commu-nity and will drastically impede primary healthcare and disease prevention services for our Tribal citizens for years to come. Tribes should be afforded the same exemp-tion from funding reductions that are in place for programs serving our Nations pop-ulations with the highest need, such as, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Veteran's Administration. Fully Fund Contract Support Costs (CSC) as Required by Law Adequate Contract Support Cost (CSC) funding assures that Tribes, under the au- thority of their Self-Governance compacts, have the resources necessary to admin-ister and deliver the highest quality healthcare services to their members without sacrificing program services and funding. We urge you to consider turning CSC into a separate mandatory appropriation so that legally enforceable contractual obliga-tions are not being funded at the expense of programmatic needs. Budget Equity for Tribal Governments/Programs Accessible to Small Tribes Budget inequity compromises our ability to adequately manage our health pro- grams and services that we are providing on behalf of the Federal Government. When Tribes receive an equitable level of resources, we can address the physical, spiritual and mental well-being of our Tribal communities in a culturally appro-priate manner. There are often inconsistencies in how formulas are calculated and funding is distributed for Tribal health programs. In addition, Grant opportunities often contain criteria and processes that give States and other interest groups pref-erential opportunities for awards. Small Tribes, such as ours, are often further dis-advantaged when it comes to securing these opportunities. It is critical that Tribes receive equitable resources and equitable access to funding opportunities that allow Tribes to continue to address Tribally-determined levels of health and wellness for our communities. Grants provided through the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra- tion (SAMHSA) are critically important to our Tribe and we urge you to provide both equitable funding and opportunities for all Tribes within the confines of these programs. Medicare/Medicaid Reimbursement Federal funding for Medicaid/Medicare expansion is intended to reduce health dis- parities in our Tribal communities. Historic and persistent underfunding of the In-dian healthcare system has limited the ability of Tribes to provide adequate health services that could prevent or reduce chronic health conditions in Native people. As a result, American Indians/Alaska Natives have a significantly worse health status compared to the rest of the Nation. Because we do not receive full Federal funding to address our unmet healthcare needs, Jamestown has been forced to use innovative approaches in order to provide better healthcare services to our Tribal citizens. Over 50 percent of our healthcare funding is Medicaid and Medicare and we use the revenue that is generated from these programs to provide essential health services to our Tribal citizens and their families. Any changes to the way we receive Medicare and Medicaid funding would negatively impact our ability to provide basic healthcare to our Tribal community and the surrounding non-Indian community. Our innovative approach to providing healthcare services is an effective and efficient use of the Federal investment. It al-lows us to leverage the Federal dollar to provide better health services to more of our Tribal citizens, reducing future healthcare costs by lessening the need for expen-sive chronic and emergency care. $30 Million\u2014Part A Grants to Native Americans under Title VI of the Older Ameri- cans Act Programs under Title VI of the Older Americans Act are the primary funding ve- hicle for the provision of nutrition and other ancillary services to our Tribal Elders. Reducing isolation through community and cultural activities and ensuring our El-ders receive proper nutrition and healthcare is a priority for our Tribe. Without the capacity to provide support services to our elders, our cultural traditions, and our language is at risk of being lost. The Jamestown S'Klallam Elders Meal Delivery Program has been around for more than 20 years. The Older Americans Act provides much needed funds to keep this program working for our community. Jamestown has used Federal funds to pre-515 pare and deliver well-balanced nutritional meals to our Elders that incorporate tra- ditional foods, such as, elk and fish and use vegetables grown in our community gar-den. All of our elders are also given fresh fruit. These services are provided to all elders of Native heritage, and their spouses, within our service area. $50 Million\u2014Behavioral Health Tribal Prevention Program American Indians and Alaska Natives have disproportionately higher rates of death related to alcohol and substance abuse and suicide. If funded, the Behavioral Health Tribal Prevention Grant will allow Tribes to provide behavioral health serv-ices that address substance abuse and suicide prevention and promote overall men-tal and emotional health. If funded, this would be the only grant program that is exclusively available for Tribes. NATIONAL HEALTH PRIORITIES Definition of Indian The Administrations current interpretation of ''Indian'' in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prevents certain IHS eligible persons from access to certain healthcare and services available to American Indians and Alaska Natives under the law. A tech-nical amendment that uses the Center for Medicare and Medicaid definition of In-dian will align the eligibility regulations and create consistency among all the Ad-ministrative agencies which will provide full access to healthcare for all American Indians and Alaska Natives. Fully Fund the Implementation of ACA Inclusive of the IHCIA The permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) within the ACA is the most significant advancement in Federal health pol-icy for Tribes in decades. The purpose of the IHCIA is to promote healthcare parity for Indian Tribes by addressing deficiencies in health status and resources within the Indian health system. Funding for the IHCIA is a top budget priority. Although the IHCIA provides the authority and, with it, the opportunity to provide essential healthcare to Tribal citizens, it did not provide the necessary funds to the IHS to carry out these new statutory obligations. There are twenty three unfunded provisions in the Indian Health Care Improve- ment Act (IHCIA). Many of the provisions that remain unfunded would strengthen the Tribal healthcare workforce, provide greater access to behavioral health and support innovative initiatives for healthcare delivery to Tribal citizens. Funding these provisions is a necessary precursor to increase Tribal capacity, infrastructure and most importantly access to healthcare services. Significant Federal investment is needed to achieve a fully funded Indian Health Service and now is the time to act on opportunities made possible in the newly expanded authorities granted under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Given the unique mission of the IHS as a direct healthcare provider fulfilling a Federal trust responsibility, fully funding and implementing the ACA and IHCIA will elevate the health status and decrease the health disparities experienced by American Indians and Alaska Natives. Self-Governance\u2014An Efficient and Effective Use of Federal Funds (Title VI of the ISDEAA) Self-Governance is the most successful policy in the history of Tribal\u2014Federal re- lations and it inspires efficient and effective government spending. Through Self- Governance, Tribes are empowered, as sovereign nations, to exercise self-determina-tion and to design facilities, manage programs and funds, and provide services that are responsive to the needs of our communities and Tribal citizens. Tribes partici-pating in Self-Governance have become successful in the business of healthcare and perform several key roles, serving as, governments, employers, healthcare providers and patients. Self-Governance Tribes have made every attempt to be innovative to operate suc- cessful health programs given the budget constraints and cuts Tribal programs have incurred the past two decades. For more than a decade we have made every effort to expand Self-Governance to other programs and our efforts to seek expansion of the program will continue until we achieve our goal. We request that this Com-mittee recognizes the success of Self-Governance and encourage HHS to work with Tribes to make the most efficient and effective use of Federal appropriations to fund Tribal programs. Conclusion Thank you for the opportunity to provide this important testimony. We respect- fully request that these Budget Priorities be included in the Appropriations for the fiscal year 2015 Tribal Health Programs Budget. 516 1In the interest of disclosure, please be aware that I am the New York State Coordinator for VOR, a national organization that advocates for high quality care and human rights for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I am submitting this statement solely on my own behalf, and not as a representative of VOR, to share my family's story and my personal views with you. 2As CMS notes, Federal law and regulations continue to use the term ''mentally retarded'' and therefore CMS uses it in this formal description of these kinds of facilities; CMS otherwise prefers the term ''individuals with intellectual disability.'' [This statement was submitted by Hon. W. Ron Allen, Tribal Chairman/CEO, Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL KLURFELD Members of the subcommittee, my name is Michael Klurfeld, and I am testifying to protect my twin sister, Jessica, and others like her who require active treatment in campus-based or other settings meeting the Federal standards for Intermediate Care Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (''ICF/MR''). 1 Jessica has autism, intellectual disability, and a rare genetic disorder called Cor- nelia de Lange Syndrome. Not long after our thirteenth birthday, Jessica began hav-ing severe behavioral challenges, including physical aggression. For lack of an ap-propriate residential school in New York State, our school district sent her to out- of-State nonpublic residential schools\u2014first in Pennsylvania and then in New Hampshire. Though her education funding ended, she remains at the New Hamp-shire program awaiting repatriation by the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities to an appropriate adult residential program in New York. In Jessica's case, an appropriate placement is a campus-based ICF/MR\u2014she is le- gally entitled to this as a Medicaid recipient. As explained by the Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid on the attached page from their website, ICF/MR is a benefit said to be offered by all States as an alternative to home and community-based services (''HCBS'') for individuals at the ICF/MR level of care\u2014individuals in need of and receiving ''active treatment.'' 2''Active treatment'' is the key concept here: defined as ''a continuous, aggressive and consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training, treatment, and health or related services, directed toward helping the enrollee function with as much self-determination and independence as possible.'' As CMS points out, ''many ICF/MR residents work in the community, with supports, or participate in vocational or other activities outside of the residence, and engage in community interests of their choice.'' ICF/MR services are provided only in licensed and certified residential facilities, providing quality control to protect the residents and financial controls over the expenditure of public funds\u2014''There are few resources similar to an ICF/MR under any payment source.'' Although ''States may not limit access to ICF/MR service, or make it subject to waiting lists, as they may for HCBS,'' in reality access is drastically limited and, as a practical matter, virtually unavailable in many States. The States' failure to provide these mandated services, in violation of the right of Medicaid recipients to choose ICF/MR over community-based waiver services, has been erroneously justi-fied with the notion that deinstitutionalization is required by the Supreme Court's 1999 Olmstead decision\u2014a gross misstatement of the holding in this important case. Far from requiring the closing of all institutions, or the denial of legally required ICF/MR services to those like Jessica who qualify for and require them, the Su-preme Court in Olmstead said that ''each disabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that person\u2014recognizing on a case-by- case basis, that setting may be an institution'' [emphasis added]. Ironically, HHS brandishes Olmstead as a tool to force people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) to live in what they call ''integrated settings,'' often disregarding both the peoples' needs and choices. In a Kafkaesque fashion, HHS often brings lawsuits against institutions that it funds\u2014beyond belittling the needs and choices of people with I/DD, these egregious lawsuits waste Federal funds because, essentially, HHS is suing itself. So for the reasons above and for reasons I will explain further, I ask the Senate to adopt the following language regarding HHS appropriations: No funds appropriated for any Department of Health and Human Services pro- gram shall be expended to promote any law or policy that limits the choices of indi-viduals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (or, if an individual has a legal representative, the legal representative), seeking living arrangements they be-lieve are most suitable to their needs and wishes. 517 First and foremost, HHS' fallaciously named ''Olmstead enforcement'' goes against much of what the Supreme Court said in its ruling while ignoring the circumstances of the case. The plaintiffs in Olmstead were two women who ''alleged that defend-ants-petitioners, Georgia healthcare officials, failed to afford them minimally ade-quate care and freedom from undue restraint, in violation of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.'' The Supreme Court found that the women's rights had in fact been violated, but not solely because they were in an institutional setting: We emphasize that nothing in the Americans with Disabilities Act or its imple- menting regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons un-able to handle or benefit from community settings . . . Nor is there any Federal requirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.'' HHS seems to have largely ignored this language, for if they hadn't, Olmstead en- forcement would be entirely different. Olmstead enforcement, properly implemented, would be limited to helping people like the plaintiffs in that case who were institu-tionalized against their wills without due process. But instead, HHS spends tax-payer money in attempts to shut down the facilities to which my sister and people like her are legally entitled under the law, which they have chosen (as is their right), and which HHS itself funds. Nothing in Olmstead requires\u2014or even author-izes\u2014HHS to deprive Medicaid recipients with I/DD from choosing to receive the ''active treatment'' to which they are entitled in the ''institutional'' setting of an ICF/ MR, and HHS should not be allowed to appropriate funds in its efforts to deny these recipients their choice. And that's really the crux of the issue: HHS appropriation of funds in support of deinstitutionalization activities belittles and disregards my sister's choice of living situation. My sister and people like her, whether by their own choice or through their legal guardians (in Jessica's case my mother), are entitled to live in the setting they choose and that best meets their needs. HHS would never try to prohibit a group of non-disabled people from living on a campus together. My sister's disability should not change this. If HHS is allowed to continue its campaign, it will continue to threaten both my sister's right to the treatment to which she is legally entitled, as well as her access to a living situation which she chooses and which meets her needs. In a world where HHS completes its ''Olmstead enforcement,'' there will be no more campus-based settings, and Jessica will have to live in a group home where she may nominally be ''in the community'' but not a part of it in any meaningful sense. Because she becomes anxious when in close proximity to others, she would isolate herself in her bedroom and rarely venture out. Because of her aggressive behaviors, any inter-actions with neighbors or others outside the group home setting would be rare to nonexistent. Her life would be that of Mrs. Rochester from Jane Eyre, which is no life at all. Thank you for your time and consideration in this manner. The below text comes from CMS' website: Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Mental Retardation (ICF/MR) Intermediate Care Facilities for individuals with Mental Retardation (ICF/MR) is an optional Medicaid benefit that enables States to provide comprehensive and indi-vidualized healthcare and rehabilitation services to individuals to promote their functional status and independence. Although it is an optional benefit, all States offer it, if only as an alternative to home and community-based services waivers for individuals at the ICF/MR level of care. IMPORTANT NOTE: Federal law and regulations use the term ''intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded''. CMS prefers to use the accepted term ''in-dividuals with intellectual disability'' (ID) instead of ''mental retardation.'' However, as ICF/MR is the abbreviation currently used in all Federal requirements, that acro-nym will be used here. Eligibility for ICF/MR Benefit ICF/MR is available only for individuals in need of, and receiving, active treat- ment (AT) services. AT refers to aggressive, consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training, treatment and health services. AT does not in-clude services to maintain generally independent clients who are able to function with little supervision and who do not require a continuous program of habilitation services. States may not limit access to ICF/MR service, or make it subject to wait-ing lists, as they may for HCBS. Therefore in some cases ICF/MR services may be more immediately available than other long term care options. Many individuals 518 who require this level of service have already established disability status and Med- icaid eligibility. State Variation Need for ICF/MR is specifically defined by States, all of whom have established ICF/MR level of care criteria. State level of care requirements must provide access to individuals who meet the coverage criteria defined in Federal law and regulation. In addition to level of care for AT, the need for AT must arise from ID or a related condition. The definition of related condition is primarily functional, rather than di-agnostic, but the underlying cause must have been manifested before age 22 and be likely to continue indefinitely. States vary in practical application of the concept of related condition. In some States individuals applying for ICF/MR residence may be eligible for Medicaid under higher eligibility limits used for residents of an insti-tution. Services Included in the ICF/MR Benefit ICFs/MR provides active treatment (AT), a continuous, aggressive, and consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training, treatment, and health or related services, directed toward helping the enrollee function with as much self-determination and independence as possible. ICF/MR is the most com-prehensive benefit in Medicaid. Federal rules provide for a wide scope of required services and facility require- ments for administering services. All services including healthcare services and nu-trition are part of the AT, which is based on an evaluation and individualized pro-gram plan (IPP) by an interdisciplinary team. Facility requirements include staffing, governing body and management, client protections, client behavior and physical en-vironment, which are specified in the survey and certification process. Day Programs Many ICF/MR residents work in the community, with supports, or participate in vocational or other activities outside of the residence, and engage in community in-terests of their choice. These activities are collectively often referred to as day pro-grams. The ICF/MR is responsible for all activities, including day programs, because the concept of AT is that all aspects of support and service to the individual are coordinated towards specific individualized goals in the IPP. Where ICF/MR Services are Provided Medicaid coverage of ICF/MR services is available only in a residential facility li- censed and certified by the State survey agency as an ICF/MR. Medicaid ICF/MR services are available only when other payment options are unavailable and the in-dividual is eligible for Medicaid. There are few resources similar to an ICF/MR, under any payment source. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE KNI P ARENT GUARDIAN GROUP Dear Senate Appropriations Sub-committee, thank you for the opportunity to pro- vide testimony. It is with a heavy heart that I submit outside witness testimony today, respectfully requesting your full consideration of the effects of pervasive In-termediate Care Facility (institutional\u2014ICF/ID) closure activities. Numerous federally funded agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are pursuing an idealistic agenda that puts the weakest members of our society into harm's way, while ignoring significant deficiencies in the home and community based service system (HCBS). I am calling on this Sub-committee to PROHIBIT the use of Federal HHS appro- priations supporting deinstitutionalization activities which evict without cause, and without regard to individual choice, people with the most profound intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) from HHS-licensed ICF homes. COMMUNITY DEFICIENCIES \u2014Stagnant Direct Support Staff wages, high turnover rates, staff rationing, and inadequate professional oversight of scattered homes are affecting quality of care for those served in HCBS waiver systems. The most helpless on the dis-ability spectrum are particularly affected by these systemic deficiencies. \u2014Diminishing incentive to retain quality staff is reflected in the pervasive, stag- nant wage crisis, while re-imbursement rates have not changed significantly for over a decade. As a result, the profoundly disabled often do not get to choose who cares for them, even if they somehow could indicate with whom they would 519 like to live. This reality flies in the face of idealism\u2014pushing ''community for all.'' \u2014There is no adequate system in place which represents persons adjudicated in- competent, who have no or extremely limited self-advocacy skills, particularly to express abusive acts committed against them in poorly supervised community homes with rationed staff and limited professional oversight. As the Guardian of a profoundly disabled young man, I have navigated and uti- lized a broad array of community services for over 15 years. My final recourse after exhausting every option, was to place my loved one at the Kansas Neurological In-stitute (KNI), because no one in the HCBS system was able to handle him. Since his placement at KNI our grandson has been very well cared for, being re- stored to a place of stability unparalleled in the community. We have tried without success, to reintegrate him into community as unfortunately, more than a a few community providers have refused to serve him. Facilities like KNI are the safety net for those whom the community is not suit- able or has failed to keep safe, yet these havens are under attack nation-wide. A number of HHS funded programs are displacing our most vulnerable without regard to clarifications in the Supreme Court Olmstead ruling, which highlights individual choice, need and safety. Groups including the ARC, National Council on Disabilities, State DD Councils, Universities for Excellence, and State Protection & Advocacy have ignored mounting evidence of abhorrent community outcomes for the most helpless within the dis-ability spectrum. These federally funded entities appear to collaborate and push the extreme agenda of forced closure of all State ''institutions''. This radical agenda fails to recognize community capacity issues and an increasing number of documented tragedies occurring within the community system. Why are these agencies pushing to close facilities where compassionate staff care for our weakest, forcing our most vulnerable into questionable environments? How is ''justice'' served when the most helpless are placed in community settings, suffering neglect and death after a few months time at the hands of poorly trained staff who have little or no professional oversight? ''Is it ever right to handcuff and over-medicate someone with disabilities, just so you can 'handle' them?'' This question was presented to the National Council on Dis-abilities in December by a guardian whose brother had been de-institutionalized, and subsequently bounced around to unsuccessful community placements. HCBS tragedies are happening to such a degree that your colleague, Senator Chris Murphy has called for a nation-wide investigation. Parents and guardians are speaking out for those who cannot speak for them- selves, many of whom had experienced failed community placements, yet these par-ents are vilified as obstacles to ''systems change.'' Do current HCBS deficiencies and tragic outcomes for the weakest reflect sound pol- icy? There is a compelling need for both community-based and congregate care set- tings. States need to operate a range of services to meet the diverse requirements of persons with disabilities as clarified within the Supreme Court Olmstead ruling: OLMSTEAD ''We emphasize that nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings...Nor is there any Federal requirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.'' Id. at 601-602. A plurality of Justices noted: ''[N]o placement outside the institution may ever be appropriate . . . 'Some indi- viduals, whether mentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times-perhaps in the short run, perhaps in the long run-for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings' for these persons, 'institu-tional settings are needed and must remain available''' (quoting Amicus Curiae Brief for the American Psychiatric Association, et al). Justice Kennedy noted in his concurring opinion, ''It would be unreasonable, it would be a tragic event, then, were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear of litigation to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.''

Komen \u00ae, I appreciate the opportunity to submit written testimony regarding the need for increased Federal funding for breast cancer early detection programs and cancer research. Specifically, we call on you to increase funding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to $275 million and for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to $32 billion in fis-cal year 2015, including $5.26 billion for the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Komen is the world's largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and advocates fighting to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all, and en-ergize science to find the cures. With our network of local Affiliates across the U.S. and the 2.9 million breast cancer survivors we represent, we have long considered ourselves key partners with the Federal Government in the fight against breast can-cer. Since 1983, we have invested more than $2.5 billion for breast cancer research and life-saving community programs across the country. While I recognize the difficult task in balancing competing budget priorities in the current fiscal climate, the only way to eradicate breast cancer is through a renewed investment and commitment to discovering and delivering the cures and improved access to affordable, quality and timely breast health screening and treatment serv-ices. National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program We call on Congress to increase funding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), funded through the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC), to $275 million in fiscal year 2015. NBCCEDP is a State-Federal partnership that provides lifesaving, free or low-cost breast and cervical cancer screenings, diagnostic services, and follow-up services to low-income, uninsured and underinsured women who do not qualify for Medicaid. Since its inception in 1991, NBCCEDP has provided over 11 million screening exams to more than 4.5 million women, detecting more than 62,000 breast cancers, 3,400 cervical cancers and 163,000 premalignant cervical lesions. 1Despite the crit- ical services this program provides, at current funding levels, NBCCEDP can still only serve less than one-fifth to one-third of those who are projected to be eligible after the implementation of health reform for the program. 2 While the Affordable Care Act increases access to mammography coverage for many women, it is estimated that, in 2014, 4.5 million women will remain unin-sured and eligible for the program. 3This assumes that all States will implement all the provisions of the ACA and expands Medicaid. For these women, NBCCEDP continues to fill a critical gap in the healthcare delivery system, providing access to annual breast and cervical cancer screenings that can lead to easy detection and effective treatment for breast cancer. 4Without NBCCEDP, many uninsured women could be forced to delay or forego screenings, leading to later stage diagnoses, which are deadlier and more costly to treat. In fact, breast cancer can be up to five times more expensive to treat when it has spread to other parts of the body. 5 521 6Levy AR, Bruen BK, Ku L.

Prev Chronic Dis 2012;9:120069. 7Research!America (www.researchamerica.org). 8National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/cancer-advances-in-focus/ breast). Many women with health insurance still face substantial barriers to obtaining health services, including of lack of health literacy, geographic isolation and limited language proficiency. Among these harder to reach populations, NBCCEDP fills a critical gap by providing outreach and navigation services, which can improve healthcare access and increase breast cancer screening rates. 6 It is clear that there will still be unmet need; millions of low-income and unin- sured women will still lack access to services. We believe the CDC can build on the 20 year investments made through the NBCCEDP and leverage the extensive ca- pacity and infrastructure the program has built with the clinical care system to in-crease screening on a population level. CDC can also work with various healthcare systems (FQHCs, Medicaid, provider networks, etc.), to increase widespread participation in screening by expanding key public health roles such as public education and outreach; provision of screening services and care coordination; quality assurance, surveillance and monitoring; and strategies to enable more organized systems of care. In 2014, CDC would like to begin transitioning the program by enabling grantees to expand public health roles that can increase population level screening rates, while still being able to provide limited screening services to the most vulnerable. Increasing current funding levels is critical to ensure that the CDC can raise awareness, provide lifesaving cancer screenings to women, and continue to reach those who will remain vulnerable and without access. National Institutes of Health We urge you to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to $32 billion in fiscal year 2015, including $5.26 billion for the National Cancer Insti-tute (NCI), in order to restore funding to inflation-adjusted, pre-sequestration levels. Cancer is an expensive disease\u2014the most costly to our Nation in terms of direct medical costs and lost productivity due to premature deaths and disability\u2014making research which will accelerate cures and improve treatment a sound investment. Federal funding must keep pace with biomedical inflation as we stand on the threshold of life-saving discoveries in the biomedical sciences. This investment in research will not only protect Americans against disease and illness, but will serve as one of our Nation's primary paths to innovation, global competitiveness, and economic growth. As other nations aggressively invest in re-search and development, the U.S. is losing ground. We stand to lose the young sci-entists, high quality jobs, industries and private-sector capital that have made America a global leader. 7Studies show each dollar in NIH funding generates more than twice as much in new business activity, and NIH grants and contracts created and supported more than 400,000 jobs across the country in 2013. Our Nation's investment in biomedical research has helped drive progress against cancer, furthered our understanding of disease mechanisms and spurred the trans-lation of scientific discoveries into new and better ways to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat cancer. It is important to highlight some of the important advances, which have revolutionized the way in which breast cancer patients are screened, diagnosed and treated. These investments have also positively impacted survival rates beyond 5 years. It is now established that routine mammographic screening is an accepted stand- ard for the early detection of breast cancer. The results of eight randomized trials, the NIH-ACS Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Projects, and other research studies showed that mammographic screening can reduce the mortality from breast cancer. In the treatment of breast cancer, lumpectomy followed by local radiation has replaced mastectomy as the preferred surgical approach for treating early-stage breast cancer. The approaches to treatment, by learning critical differences among the types of breast cancer, with chemotherapy and hormonal therapies have allowed patients different options and more personalized treatment plans. Tamoxifen and another SERM, raloxifene, have been approved by the FDA as treatments to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women who have an increased risk of developing the disease. 8 Finally, several breast cancer susceptibility genes have now been identified, in- cluding BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PTEN/MMAC1. Approximately 60 percent of women with an inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 will develop breast cancer sometime during their lives, compared with about 12 percent of women in the gen-522 9National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/cancer-advances-in-focus/ breast). 10AACR lFINAL.pdf). 11One Voice Against population. Women with inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations also have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.9This knowledge can help patients make more informed decisions about their risks and potential treatment options. We are poised to apply this new knowledge to make significant strides in saving lives. As a Nation, we are facing a crisis in cancer care. As the population ages, the number of new cancer cases in the United States is projected to increase by as much as 42 percent, 2.3 million new cases annually, by 2025. 10 Despite these staggering statistics, cancer research funding at the NCI as a share of the NIH budget has declined. In the late 1990s, NCI's budget made up nearly 19 percent of the NIH budget. Today, NCI accounts for approximately 16 percent. In real dollars, this decline means that NCI's funding has been reduced by $680 mil-lion below what it would have received in fiscal year 2014 if its share of NIH's total budget had been maintained. 11It is imperative that our Nation's investment in can- cer research remains a priority, and that funding for NIH increases. On behalf of the many Americans who are suffering with cancer, I ask that you consider our requests for increased support for the NBCCEDP and the NIH in fiscal year 2015. Susan G. Komen stands ready to serve as a national resource for Con-gress and for all Americans on breast health issues. [This statement was submitted by Judith A. Salerno, MD, MS, President and Chief Executive Officer, Susan G. Komen.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE LENDERS COALITION FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS The Lenders Coalition for Community Health Centers (LCCHC) is pleased to pro- vide the following written testimony related to proposed fiscal year 2015 HRSA funding for federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) funded under Section 330 of the Public Health Services Act. This testimony includes recommendations to as-sist the Administration and Congress in developing policies that will help meet a near universal goal\u2014expanding community health centers in an affordable and sus-tainable manner to meet the healthcare needs of millions of families in underserved communities throughout the United States. LCCHC is a coalition of community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and related entities whose main goal is to advocate for resources and policies that will strengthen health centers' access to capital and CDFIs' ability to finance health center growth. The CDFIs that form the LCCHC are all currently undertaking health center lending. They have made loans totaling more than $1.4 billion to de-velop primary care capacity that gives more than 3 million patients access to pri-mary care every year. The LCCHC has been on record in support of increased\u2014and continued\u2014oper- ational funding support for health centers. Our institutions sent a letter to the President advocating the full operational increase in mandatory funds from the Health Centers Fund in fiscal year 2015, and underscored the need to sustain and grow that investment over the next 5 years to ensure the financial stability of our client FQHCs moving forward. We note that the President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes utilizing $800 mil- lion in health center funding for one-time capital grants. We believe that to the ex-tent any new funding for capital projects is included in this year's final appropria-tion, HHS should encourage awardees to use these scarce dollars to leverage other sources of capital\u2014both grants and loans from the public and private sector\u2014to maximize their impact on health center growth. Given that $800 million represents less than 10 percent of the estimated $10 billion of capital funding that will be need-ed in order to meet the goal of serving 35 million patients in FQHCs by the end of 2018, developing policies that promote the availability of multiple public and pri-vate sources of capital will be critical to health centers' successful growth. By incor-porating incentives to encourage leveraging into the HHS review process of any po-tential capital grant funding for those FQHCs that can raise other sources of capital and/or afford to take on some reasonable amount of debt, HHS will be able to sup-port a much larger number of FQHCs around the country. We also recognize that capital from the Health Centers Fund\u2014even if it is lever- aged\u2014is not a complete solution to address the capital needs of FQHCs. We strongly 523 encourage the consideration of robust Federal credit enhancement programs tar- geting FQHCs expansion, which would leverage much greater levels of private sec-tor financing for FQHCs.. Programs such as these are available and have been used to considerable success for a number of vital sectors, including small businesses (SBA), rural and agricultural enterprises (USDA), charter schools (ED) housing and hospitals (HUD). We wish to be clear that we reject policies encouraging FQHCs to pursue leverage irresponsibly. Over-leverage is a real risk in any sector; where it involves the devel-opment of critical health infrastructure and the use of public funds, it simply must be prevented. Indeed, as community lenders, our mission is aligned with our bor-rowers, and we have a stake in their sustainability and success. Attached, please find a brief that highlights the benefits of leveraging HHS cap- ital dollars. The arguments in this brief assume that FQHCs work with responsible lenders, develop financially and operationally sustainable expansion projects, and assume a level of debt that supports their expansion without negatively impacting their current operations or financial stability. Based on our collective experience in the FQHC sector itself, as well as across a broad range of other capital needs within low income communities (e.g., affordable housing, healthy food financing, and school financing), we are confident that the Administration and Congress can maintain policies that enable these conditions. WHY LEVERAGING OF HRSA CAPITAL GRANTS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUTURE OF FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS) HRSA has set, and the health center field has embraced, the goal of expanding health centers to meet the stated goal of serving 35 million patients by the end of 2018 (from approximately 22 million today). Based on an estimate from Capital Link, more than $10 billion in additional capital will need to flow into FQHC facility development and expansion to meet this target. If public funding alone will not suffice to meet the FQHC field's collective expan- sion goal, the only feasible alternative is instead to ensure that limited public funds be deployed strategically to bring private sector capital to bear. Such an approach can stretch scarce Federal resources, attract more lenders into the market, lower borrowing costs, and incentivize FQHCs to develop projects with greater impact on patients than would be possible otherwise. The Lack of a Clear, Unambiguous Signal that Leverage is Integral to HRSA's Fu- ture Plans for FQHCs Causes Inefficiencies in FQHC Financing to Persist Capital Grant Funding Rounds that Fail to Incentivize Leverage Disrupt the Exist- ing FQHC Pipeline and Distort Project Sizing .\u2014Today, FQHCs often work with CDFIs and other lenders across the country to generate a pipeline with hundreds of viable FQHC expansion projects in varying stages of development. When HRSA announces a capital grant round (or even the possibility of a capital grant round) that holds out the promise of a one-stop, debt-free financing strategy, that pipeline largely freezes, as FQHCs understandably put development plans on hold in the hope of avoiding the need to borrow money at all. Unfortunately, that hope is often in vain, given the reality that demand far out- strips the funding available, leading to lengthy grant application and review proc-esses and many unfunded projects. Additionally, FQHCs size their projects to the HRSA grant maximum rather than to the size that best serves the healthcare needs of the community and that CDFIs or other responsible lenders will underwrite. The result is delays or cancellation of FQHC expansion projects that could have served hundreds of thousands of patients. Thoughtful Incentives to Promote Leverage would Enable HRSA to Magnify the Im- pact of its Capital Grants and Supplement its Own Oversight of FQHCs with Private Sector Underwriting Leverage is a 'Force Multiplier' for Limited HRSA Capital Grants .\u2014Simply put, a given level of Federal operating and capital funding can yield dramatically in-creased FQHC expansion if it unlocks access to private sector capital. When FQHCs are required to supplement Federal grant funding with outside capital, they are more likely to develop projects that are scaled to the needs of the community rather than to the size of the grant award, offering the opportunity for greater impact on the community's health. To offer an instructive experience in another sector, in fiscal year 2014, Congress enacted the Administration's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), providing public housing authorities new flexibilities to leverage their annual public housing operating and capital grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-ment (HUD) to rehab or redevelop up to 60,000 units of public housing. Notably, 524 no 'new' money was appropriated\u2014i.e., the operating and capital fund allocations that the local agencies received remained the same (well below their annual oper-ating costs and accumulated capital backlog). To date, applications submitted to HUD under this 'no cost' leveraging strategy have proposed to bring to bear in ex-cess of $6 billion in private and other public sector capital to the rehab and redevel-opment of public housing units previously assisted exclusively by Federal funds. If Congress appropriates capital funding for health centers in fiscal year 2015, HRSA should draw from the experience of the affordable housing field, and other sectors, in the effort to deploy leverage strategically in service of health center cap-ital expansion goals. Health centers have, for the moment, the further good fortune of being 'ahead of the curve,' relative to the field's funding levels and capital needs (the public housing field, for example, embraced policy reforms like RAD only after years of underfunding and a capital backlog in excess of $27 billion). Leverage Leads to Superior 'Front End' Underwriting and Faster Project Develop- ment .\u2014When an FQHC uses debt financing for a project, the project goes through a rigorous review by the lender (or lenders) as part of the underwriting process, cre-ating a higher likelihood for successful development of the project. Scrutiny of the experience and capacity of the project's development team ensures that the right pieces are in place for construction that is on time and within budget. Furthermore, the lenders' scrutiny of underlying financials and staffing plans and testing of rev-enue projections can lead to an FQHC making constructive modifications to its plans. To be clear, this is not a substitute for the conscientious and diligent over-sight conducted by HRSA staff on behalf of the taxpayer, but rather a useful supple-ment to their efforts by project development experts whose livelihood depends on having their loans paid back. Leverage Builds in 'Early Warning' Systems that Prevent FQHC Project Failure .\u2014 Experience across capital financing sectors, including affordable housing (e.g., three decades of experience with the Low Income Housing Tax Credit), has demonstrated that private sector oversight of project operations is a useful supplement to the scru-tiny of dedicated, competent but often overextended public servants, Lenders, as part of their loan servicing and monitoring, keep a monthly watch on every bor-rower, enabling them to see financial problems early on, before they have grown more expensive and difficult to fix. When lenders provide financing to FQHCs, they are responsible for ensuring regular loan repayments. Borrowers are required to submit regular financial statements showing cash flow, accounts payables and re-ceivables, and other indicators of financial health. If the borrower misses loan pay-ments or shows other signs of financial distress, a CDFI can work with borrowers to develop solutions that will bring a health center back to financial stability. When necessary, this assistance may involve working with other stakeholders, including foundations, State Medicaid agencies, or HRSA to make sure a community is not deprived of vital primary care capacity. Leverage Creates Financial, Community and Political Partners in Ensuring Health Center Sustainability .\u2014Critically, the involvement of other stakeholders in FQHC health\u2014from philanthropy to CDFIs to banks and private sector investors\u2014is not limited to the all-hands-on-deck project workouts described above. When FQHCs are required to assemble matching or contributing funds for a project, they seek funding assistance from a range of other public and private sources, including grants and loans. The act of assembling these funds generates community ''buy-in'' and support for a proposed project, which ultimately contributes to its success by aligning com-munity priorities and resources toward a common end. Indeed, the broadening of the constituency of stakeholders with 'skin in the game' when it comes to both individual FQHCs and the field more broadly, is essential to FQHCs' long-term sustainability: it creates a bulwark against appropriations risk while simultaneously helping to ensure that FQHCs remain viable and competitive in the rapidly evolving field of primary care provision to low income neighborhoods and populations.

The Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) views this hearing as a positive step toward understanding the importance of early childhood development and securing critically needed investments to ensure that all children, especially low-income chil-525 1Jack P.

As you con- sider ways that Congress can help children get an early start on the pathway to success, we encourage you to recognize the critical role that early childhood facilities play in preparing young children for achievement in school and in life, and urge you to ensure that Federal policies adequately finance the acquisition, construction, and improvement of these spaces. ABOUT LISC Established in 1979, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) is a na- tional nonprofit with Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) des-ignation, dedicated to helping community residents transform distressed neighbor-hoods into healthy places of choice and opportunity\u2014good places to work, do busi-ness and raise children. LISC mobilizes corporate, government and philanthropic support to provide local community development organizations with loans, grants and equity investments; local, statewide and national policy support; and technical and management assistance. LISC has local offices in 30 cities and partners with more than 50 organizations serving rural communities throughout the country. We focus our activities across five strategic community revitalization goals: \u2014Expanding Investment in Housing and Other Real Estate \u2014Increasing Family Income and Wealth \u2014Stimulating Economic Development \u2014Improving Access to Quality Education, and \u2014Supporting Healthy Environments and Lifestyles. For more than three decades, LISC has developed programs and raised invest- ment capital to help local groups revive their neighborhoods. Because we recognize the link between human opportunity and social and economic vitality, we have spent the last 17 years working to bring high quality early care and education set-tings to low-income neighborhoods where children enter the world at high risk for negative outcomes. Through our signature early childhood program, the Community Investment Collaborative for Kids (CICK), LISC has invested $48 million in plan-ning and developing 184 new facilities serving 20,000 children in more than 65 low- income urban and rural neighborhoods across the country. OVERVIEW Early childhood is a critical development period. Research shows that a complex interplay between genetics and environment profoundly influences how children grow physically, socially, and emotionally. Investments in high quality early child-hood programs can help promote healthy development and strong communities. Those active in community revitalization believe without question, that early care and education programs are essential parts of every neighborhood\u2014they prepare young children for success in school and life, support working parents, and improve family well-being. Regrettably, many families\u2014particularly those who are low-income or in rural areas\u2014lack access to the stable, high-quality early childhood centers that parents need to maintain gainful employment and children need to grow and thrive. Addi-tionally, while there is appropriate focus on the need for high quality curriculum and qualified teachers, the physical environment is an essential feature that is often forgotten. In this testimony, we highlight the important role that physical environments play in supporting the quality of early learning programs and healthy early child-hood development and encourage Congress to address the need for comprehensive early childhood facility policies. BACKGROUND Early Childhood is a Critical Development Period Decades of research has shown that early life experiences are extremely important to the social, emotional, and academic development of children.1Positive experiences promote healthy brain development and behavior, while negative experiences under-mine development\u2014and, in severe circumstances, permanently impair a child's 526 2National Scientific Council on the Developing Child.

The Quality of Early Childhood Facilities Matters While many factors contribute to program quality, the physical environment is an essential feature that is often overlooked. The link between the quality of buildings and the quality of programs tends to be only vaguely understood and largely un-documented among child care providers. Despite this inclination, evidence about the connection between space and effectiveness has been found even when physical space is not the focal point of the research undertaken. A study conducted at the School for Young Children (SYC), a distinguished preschool program housed at St. Joseph College in West Hartford, Connecticut, provides a compelling example. 4 Every State has a minimum adult-child ratio for licensed centers, in large part because attention from nurturing adults is a prime indicator of quality in child care programs. SYC is a highly regarded preschool program with a more than ample staffing ratio; the program is largely viewed as meeting if not exceeding minimum quality standards. Yet, when a research team set out to monitor enrolled children's contact with adults during free play time they found shocking results: Only 3 per-cent of the children's time was spent engaged in meaningful interactions with a teacher. While the SYC executive director was digesting the researchers' negative findings in order to develop a workable solution, her organization moved to new accommoda-tions. A routine follow-up test in the new space immediately showed a strikingly higher result. Teacher-child interactions increased to 22 percent. There had been no change in the management, staff, or program, only the physical space. The new space, which Bye had taken pains to design, was considerably roomier and there were bathrooms, telephones, storage space, and other logistical necessities in each classroom. Adults no longer had to leave the room to escort children to the bath-room, retrieve or store supplies, or take a phone call. Fewer distractions and inter-ruptions for adults naturally meant more time for children. Both children and staff benefited from the new space configuration. The more gen- erous square footage allowed staff to configure each classroom into well-defined areas for different activities. Children were no longer crowded together into inad-equate space and distracted by one another, so they ran into conflicts less often, and had better play experiences\u2014making their interactions with adults and other chil-dren more constructive. Teachers were able to use their time in a more effective and rewarding way, resulting in higher morale and lower staff turnover for. Overall, the effect of the new space on the content of the program was considerable and measur-able\u2014even when not a single change had been made in the program itself. Space matters: a facility's layout, size, materials and design features can improve program quality and contribute positively to child development while a poorly adapt-ed and overcrowded environment undermines it. 5Bathrooms adjacent to classrooms, accessible cubbies, and child-sized sinks, counters, furnishings and fixtures increase children's autonomy and competence while decreasing the demands on teachers. Early learning centers with ample classrooms divided into well-configured activity areas support uninterrupted self-directed pay and exploration. The physical configu-ration of early care and education spaces directly affect adult/child interaction and influence how children grow and learn. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) acknowl- edges the importance of a quality environment in the following statement: ''The physical environment sets the stage and creates the context for everything that hap-527 6http://www.naeyc.org/store/node/402 pens in any setting\u2014a classroom, a play yard, a multipurpose room. A high-quality environment welcomes children; engages children in a variety of activities; provides space for individual, small-group, and large-group activities; and generally supports the program's philosophy and goals. Ultimately, the physical environment must con-vey values and messages about who is welcomed, what is important, and what the beliefs are about how children learn.'' 6 What Facilities Experts Know Although physical spaces play an important role in promoting program quality and healthy development, it is rare to find high quality facilities designed to meet the unique needs of very young children, especially in low-income communities. Early childhood specialists have long maintained that the physical environments where learning takes place\u2014and where young children spend the majority of their waking hours\u2014significantly influence the quality of early care and education pro-grams. Facilities experts and those proficient in financing the design, acquisition, con- struction, and improvement of early care and education spaces concur and largely agree that: \u2014Well-designed facilities enhance child development and program quality; \u2014An adequate supply of facilities is needed to support rapidly increasing pre- school education programs; \u2014The quality and location of the facilities can encourage enrollment and parent involvement; \u2014Facilities can help promote a positive workplace in an industry challenged to retain experienced teachers; \u2014Child care program income, especially in low-income communities, is typically not sufficient to cover the full cost of delivering quality early education services and doesn't allow for the added cost of constructing or improving appropriate facilities; and \u2014Few centers have the experience or personnel to handle the complexities of real estate development tasks and require specialized technical assistance to address their facilities needs. Early Childhood Facilities Financing Challenges Despite what is known about the importance of the spaces where learning takes place, there is no dedicated source of capital to help early care and education pro-grams develop well-designed facilities suitable for our youngest learners. Programs serving low-income communities are highly dependent on public operating revenues that don't cover the cost of purchasing or renovating an appropriate facility. Without a consistent and effective financing system or capital subsidies, providers are left to pursue piecemeal approaches, cobbling together small donations and grants from a variety of sources. This prevents the early childhood field from addressing its physical facility needs and creating the kind of environments that support high quality programs. Historically, private financial institutions have not made significant infrastructure investments in early care and education\u2014particularly in economically distressed areas. Few mainstream banks, credit unions, and lending institutions are willing to finance early childhood facility projects, which tend to require relatively small, com-plex loans often characterized by uncertain future funding for repayment through government operating subsidies. The projects generally have little to no equity, and limited collateral value. In addition, private banks typically don't employ staff with specialized knowledge of the child care sector, consequently they are unable to un-derstand the needs of child care or preschool centers and assist program directors lacking experience with real estate development and financing. Certified Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) working in mar- ket niches that are underserved by traditional financial entities are among the small number of organizations who have made investments in early childhood phys-ical spaces. They have a proven track record in economically challenged regions and are experienced with providing a unique range of financial products and services that spur private investment in their target markets. Unfortunately, given the lim-ited funding available to CDFIs to carry out their comprehensive mission, demand for early childhood facilities capital far outstrips supply. RECOMMENDATIONS As Congress considers ways to help children get an early start on the pathway to success, we urge you to: 528 1. Recognize the critical role that early childhood facilities play in preparing young children for achievement in school and in life. Congress has the power to influence and support State and local early child- hood priorities. We believe that conversations about early care and education should always acknowledge the significant impact of early childhood physical settings on early learning. 2. Ensure that Federal policies adequately finance the acquisition, construc- tion, and improvement of early care and education spaces. Currently, there is no dedicated source of funding for the acquisition, con- struction, and improvement of early care and education spaces. Additionally, the economic instability of the past 5 years has resulted in very little invest-ment in early childhood physical infrastructure. Capital must be available in order for early care and education providers to create high quality physical spaces that promote early learning. We are encouraged by the national dialogue on the importance of investments in early childhood development, and request that you create the supportive policy, regulatory, and funding environment that is needed to enable the early care and education field to meet its physical cap-ital needs. CONCLUSION As investments are made to increase access to preschool and child care, attention must be paid to the physical environment where many young children spend the majority of their waking hours. Without support for facilities, programs will locate in the least expensive and most readily available spaces\u2014makeshift, donated, or surplus space such as basements and storefronts or outdated classrooms for older students that have not been adapted for our youngest children and fall far short of standards to support high quality programs. We look forward to continuing conversations with you and your staff. Our organi- zation serves on the Executive Committee of the National Children's Facilities Net-work (NCFN), a coalition of like-minded nonprofit financial and technical assistance intermediaries involved in planning, developing, and financing facilities for low-in-come child care and early education programs. Both LISC and NCFN would wel-come an opportunity to serve as a resource. Thank you again for your leadership.

The March of Dimes is a unique partnership of scientists, clini-cians, parents, members of the business community and other volunteers affiliated with chapters in every State, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The March of Dimes recommends the following funding levels for programs and initiatives that are essential investments in maternal and child health. PRETERM BIRTH Preterm birth is a serious health problem that costs the United States more than $26 billion annually. Employers, private insurers and individuals bear approxi-mately half of the cost of healthcare for these infants, and another 40 percent is paid by Medicaid. One in nine infants in the U.S. is born preterm. Prematurity is the leading cause of newborn mortality and the second leading cause of infant mor-tality. Among those who survive, one in five faces health problems that persist for life such as cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, chronic lung disease, and deaf-ness. For the past 6 years preterm birth rates have declined, resulting in 176,000 fewer babies being born preterm and saving more than $9 billion. The March of Dimes believes a key factor behind this continued decline was Congress' passage of the 2006 PREEMIE Act (Public Law 109-450), which brought the first-ever national focus to prematurity prevention and generated a public-private agenda to spur inno-vative research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and advanced evidence-based interventions to pre-vent preterm birth. In 2013 Congress passed the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (Public Law 113-55), which renews our Nation's commitment to giving every baby a healthy start. The March of Dimes' fiscal year 2015 funding requests regarding preterm birth are based on continuing to enhance public and private investment into understanding the causes of preterm birth and promoting known interventions. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) The March of Dimes recommends at least $32 billion for the National Institutes of Health and $1,370 billion for the NICHD in fiscal year 2015. This funding will allow NICHD to sustain its preterm birth-related research through extramural grants, Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units, the Neonatal Research Network and the in-tramural research program. This funding would also allow for NICHD to continue investments in transdisciplinary research to identify the causes of preterm birth, as recommended in the Director's 2012 Scientific Vision for the next decade, the Insti-tute of Medicine 2006 report on preterm birth, and the 2008 Surgeon General's Con-ference on the Prevention of Preterm Birth. The March of Dimes fully supports NICHD's pursuit of transdisiplinary science, which facilitates the exchange of sci-entific ideas and leads to novel approaches to understanding complex health issues and their prevention. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014Preterm Birth The mission of the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's Safe Motherhood Initiative is to promote optimal reproductive and infant health. The March of Dimes recommends funding of $46 million for the Safe Motherhood program and re-instatement of the preterm birth sub-line at $2 million, as reauthorized in the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act, to reflect current preterm birth research within the CDC. The CDC funds state-based Perinatal Quality Collaboratives, networks of hos- pitals, healthcare providers, State health departments, consumer groups, and others that advance evidence-based clinical practices and processes. These networks collect data in real time on healthcare practices and outcomes and provide immediate feed-back for quality improvement. For example, the New York State Obstetrical and Neonatal Quality Collaborative reduced deliveries without indication from 25 per-cent in 2010 to 7-8 percent in 2012. Reducing elective deliveries before 39 weeks gestation is a proven way to lower preterm birth and improve infant outcomes. 530 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)\u2014Preterm Birth The March of Dimes recommends the Subcommittee specify $3 million within the Title V Special Projects of Regional and National Significance account be used to support current preterm birth and infant mortality initiatives, as authorized in the PREEMIE Act, and to support the expansion of its initiatives nationwide. The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act renewed preterm birth-related demonstration projects, which are aimed at improving education, treatment and outcomes for ba-bies born preterm. This funding will support HRSA's Collaborative Improvement & Innovation Network (COIIN) to Reduce Infant Mortality, which assists State agen-cies focusing on a range of interventions proven to reduce preterm birth and im-prove maternal and child health. BIRTH DEFECTS According to the CDC, an estimated 120,000 infants in the U.S. are born with major structural birth defects each year. Birth defects are the leading cause of in-fant mortality and the causes of more than 70 percent are unknown. Federal invest-ments are sorely needed to support research to discover the causes of all birth de-fects and for the development of effective interventions to prevent them or reduce their prevalence. CDC\u2014National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) For fiscal year 2015, the March of Dimes recommends funding of $139 million for NCBDDD. We also request the Subcommittee provide at least $22.3 million to sup-port birth defects research and surveillance and $2.8 million to support folic acid education. Birth defects research and surveillance activities have been severely cur-tailed due to funding reductions which means a slowed pace to research identifying causes of birth defects and decreased ability to track birth defects and connect fami- lies to services. Specifically, two Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention have been eliminated. Specific expertise from the previously funded Centers in Texas and Utah (medications used during pregnancy, environmental exposures of concern, maternal infections, and birth defects risk among Hispanics) is no longer contributing to the study and 25 percent fewer families are participating in CDC birth defects research. Birth defects surveillance programs funded by NCBDDD have gone from 28 in 2004 to 14 in 2013, with a 40 percent (800,000) reduction in the number of live births monitored by States. NEWBORN SCREENING Newborn screening is a vital public health activity designed to identify genetic, metabolic, hormonal and functional disorders in newborns. Screening detects condi-tions in newborns that, if left untreated, can cause disability, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, serious illnesses or even death. If diagnosed early, many of these disorders can be managed successfully. The March of Dimes urges the Sub-committee to provide $18 million for HRSA's heritable disorders program, which plays a critical role in assisting States in the adoption of additional screenings, en-hancing provider and consumer education, and ensuring coordinated follow-up care. Also funded by this program is the work of the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children, which provides States with a Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) to ensure that every infant is screened for condi-tions having a known treatment. The RUSP has helped bring about comprehensive newborn screening in every State. In 2007, only 10 States and DC required infants to be screened for the recommended disorders; today, 42 States and DC require screening of at least 29 of the 31 treatable conditions. CLOSING The Foundation's volunteers and staff in every State, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico look forward to working with Members of this Subcommittee to secure the resources needed to improve the health of the Nation's mothers, infants and children. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THEMARFAN FOUNDATION Chairman Harkin and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for your time and your consideration of the priorities of the heritable connective tissue disorders community as you work to craft the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill. 531 ABOUT MARFAN SYNDROME AND HERITABLE CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. Connective tissue holds all the body's cells, organs and tissue together. It also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Connective tissue is made up of proteins. The protein that plays a role in Marfan syndrome is called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect (or mutation) in the gene that tells the body how to make fibrillin-1. This mutation results in an increase in a protein called transforming growth factor beta, or TGF- . The increase in TGF- causes problems in connective tissues throughout the body, which in turn creates the features and medical problems associated with Marfan syndrome and some related disorders. Because connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome can af- fect many different parts of the body, as well. Features of the disorder are most often found in the heart, blood vessels, bones, joints, and eyes. Some Marfan fea-tures\u2014for example, aortic enlargement (expansion of the main blood vessel that car-ries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body)\u2014can be life-threatening. The lungs, skin and nervous system may also be affected. Marfan syndrome does not af-fect intelligence. Related Conditions There are disorders related to Marfan syndrome that can cause people to struggle with some of the same or similar physical problems. Some examples are Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection. Disorders related to Marfan syndrome can also cut lives short, particularly when they go unchecked, and they can deeply affect the quality of life of the individuals and families who must cope with them. Just like people with Marfan syndrome, those affected by related disorders need early and accurate diagnosis to ensure they receive proper care and treatment. Many of these disorders are genetic conditions that, like Marfan syndrome, cause the aorta (the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body) to enlarge, a problem that requires medicine and regular monitoring to deter-mine appropriate treatment. Other features that may overlap with Marfan syn-drome include those involving the heart, bones, joints and eyes. Related connective tissue disorders include: \u2014Loeys-Dietz \u2014Shprintzen-Goldberg Syndrome ABOUT THE FOUNDATION The Marfan Foundation creates a brighter future for everyone affected by Marfan syndrome and related disorders. \u2014We pursue the most innovative research and make sure that it receives proper funding. \u2014We create an informed public and educated patient community to increase early diagnosis and ensure life-saving treatment. \u2014We provide relentless support to families, caregivers, and healthcare providers. We will not rest until we've achieved victory\u2014a world in which everyone with Marfan syndrome or a related disorder receives a proper diagnosis, gets the nec-essary treatment, and lives a long and full life. ONE FAMILY 'S STORY Hector Roman was 36 years old when he died on June 25, 2012, of an aortic dis- section caused by Marfan syndrome. He was never diagnosed with Marfan syn-drome\u2014despite being treated by several medical specialists for myriad health issues\u2014and he did not know he was a risk of a sudden early death. He was in pain for days and didn't rush to the hospital because he was frustrated with the lack of help he was getting with his health concerns. He had no idea this delay would be 532 deadly. After a few days in pain, he went into shock and a friend call 911. He died 3 days later during his third surgery. Now, his partner, Teresita Mompeller, of Phoenix, AZ, is raising their three boys\u2014Jovan,5, Joel, 3, and Justus, 2\u2014alone. After Hector died, Teresita learned about Marfan syndrome. Most alarming to her was that affected people have a 50 percent chance of passing it to their offspring. She had her sons checked imme-diately. Joel and Justus have been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and already have aortic enlargement. While their condition is the same as their dad; their prog-nosis is better. The boys can live a normal life span because they have the diagnosis and are being monitored. They can avoid a fatal situation because they know. Teresita, who has a Facebook page called ''Do You Know Marfan?'' (and a parallel page in Spanish) recently wrote: ''Thanks to the work of The Marfan Foundation, I know that my boys have a greater chance of living a long life. I know first-hand what it is to be a mother with many questions and concerns about a rare disorder that nobody seemed to know anything about. The Marfan Foundation has guided me through all of my concerns. They have given me all the support and information needed to advocate for my children [so they receive] proper treatment. The Founda-tion has given me and thousands of other people, the peace of mind that they are working hard to better the lives of those affected.'' SEQUESTRATION We have heard from the medical research community that sequestration and def- icit reduction activities have created serious issues for Federal funding opportunities and the career development pipeline. In order to ensure that research into heritable connective tissue disorders can continue to move forward, and, more importantly, to ensure that our country is adequately preparing the next generation of young in-vestigators, we urge you to avert, mitigate, or otherwise eliminate the specter of se-questration. While the Foundation has anecdotal accounts of the harms of seques-tration, the Federated American Societies for Experimental Biology has reported: \u2014In constant dollars (adjusted for inflation), the NIH budget in fiscal year 2013 was $6 billion (22.4 percent) less than it was in fiscal year 2003. \u2014The number of competing research project grants (RPGs) awarded by NIH has also fallen sharply since fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2013, NIH made 8,283 RPG awards, which is 2,110 (20.3 percent) fewer than in fiscal year 2003. \u2014Awards for R01-equivalent grants, the primary mechanism for supporting inves- tigator-initiated research, suffered even greater losses. The number awarded fell by 2,528 (34 percent) between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2013. The pay line for some NIH funding mechanisms has fallen from 18 percent to 10 percent while the average age for a researcher to receive their first NIH-funded grant has climbed to 42. These are strong disincentives to choosing a career as a medical researcher. Our scaling-back is occurring at a time when many foreign countries are investing heavily in their biotechnology sectors. China alone plans to dedicate $300 million to medical research over the next 5 years; this amount is dou-ble the current NIH budget over the same period of time. Scientific breakthroughs will continue, but America may not benefit from the return-on-investment of a ro-bust biotechnology sector. For the purposes of economic and national security, as well as public health, the Foundation asks that you work with your colleagues to eliminate sequestration and recommit to supporting this Nation's biomedical re-search enterprise. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION People with Marfan syndrome are born with it, but features of the disorder are not always present right away. Some people have a lot of Marfan features at birth or as young children\u2014including serious conditions like aortic enlargement. Others have fewer features when they are young and don't develop aortic enlargement or other signs of Marfan syndrome until they are adults. Some features of Marfan syn-drome, like those affecting the heart and blood vessels, bones or joints, can get worse over time. This makes it very important for people with Marfan syndrome and related dis- orders to receive accurate, early diagnosis and treatment. Without it, they can be at risk for potentially life-threatening complications. The earlier some treatments are started, the better the outcomes are likely to be. Knowing the signs of Marfan syndrome can save lives. Our community of experts estimates that nearly half the people who have Marfan syndrome don't know it. CDC and NCBDDD have critical programs that can help improve awareness and recognition of warning signs, which can save lives. Some of these programs includ-ing CDC's Million Hearts Campaign and NCBDDD's newborn screening activities. 533 Meaningful funding increases will allow CDC and NCBDDD to expand their suc- cessful awareness efforts to include additional conditions. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH NIH has worked closely with the Foundation to investigate the mechanisms of these conditions. In recent decades, this research has yielded significant scientific breakthroughs that have the potential to improve the lives of affected individuals. In order to ensure that the heritable connective tissue disorders research portfolios can continue to expand and advance, NIH requires meaningful funding increases to invest in emerging and promising activities. NHLBI The Marfan Foundation anxiously await the results of this first-ever multicenter clinical trial for our patient population conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Pediatric Heart Network (PHN). After 4 years of recruitment and 3 years of follow-up evaluations, the results are expected to be released in November 2014 at the American Heart Association Meeting. 604 Marfan syndrome patients (age 6 months to 25 years) are enrolled in the study. Patients are randomized onto either losartan or atenolol (a beta blocker that is the current standard of care for Marfan patients with an enlarged aortic root). The Marfan Foundation thanks both NHLBI and NIAMS for their dedicated support and careful execution of this trial. NEI Ectopia lentis, dislocation of the lens, occurs in up to 60 percent of patients with Marfan syndrome. The central positioning of the lens depends on the zonule of Zinn, a fibrous structure which has fibrillin-1 as a major component. NEI-supported inves-tigators are studying the protein interactions of fibrillin-1 in health and disease in the zonule of Zinn to understand the disease mechanisms that cause ectopia lentis. It is hoped that this research will provide therapeutic insights to better treat this complication of Marfan syndrome. NIAMS NIAMS continues to support the Consortium for Translational Research in Marfan Syndrome, which is investigating the disease process in MFS. These studies, building on previous advances, are aimed at identifying new biological targets for therapy, as well as predictive biomarkers of vascular and skeletal manifestations, which are the major causes of mortality and morbidity in MFS. ORDR The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences houses ORDR and leads other important activities. In addition to the Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortia, translational treatment development programs hold promise for the heri- table connective tissue disorders community. PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARYA. V ITALE , GUARDIAN /SIBLING /ADVOCATE Dear Committee Members: The opportunity to submit personal testimony to this committee is much appreciated. As 2015 appropriation requests are being consid-ered, this submission of testimony is a request for a review of the misuse of Federal funds by the Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies that promote forced dein-stitutionalization of persons with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. I have been an active guardian for 35 years for my 61 year old brother who has severe intellectual disabilities, behavior challenges, and ongoing medical concerns. He has never been able to walk or talk. He has only partial use of one of his arms. He needs maximum assistance for all his needs. Despite his many disabilities, he is a happy man. His care at his intermediate care facility for individuals with intel-lectual disabilities (ICF/IID) home is successful, stable, sustainable, consistent, com-prehensive, and cost-effective. HHS agencies, such as State Planning Councils and State Protection and Advo- cacy Services, are misusing Federal funds to promote the closing of ICF/IID homes like where my brother lives, despite the objections of legal guardians. The Supreme Court 1999 Olmstead ruling states: ''It would be unreasonable, it would be a tragic event, then, were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear of litigation to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.'' To the great dismay of families, this ''tragic event'' is exactly what is happening across the United States by the misuse of HHS funding. 534 12011 Older Americans Act State Program Reports. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Aging. March 2013. http://www.agid.acl.gov/. Appropriate, cost-effective care for those with the severest disabilities is available in ICF/IID homes, and yet they are aggressively targeted for closure, flagrantly ig-noring the educated choice of guardians. Many community settings have too little assistance and too little supervision to be appropriate for those with severe multiple intellectual and physical impairments. Tragically, the result is an increase in neglect and abuse. I ask each member of this committee to seriously question HHS about misusing Federal funds to promote forced total deinstitutionalization for persons with intellec-tual disabilities. Help us keep our beloved family members safe and healthy. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE MEALS ONWHEELS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran: Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony to your Subcommittee concerning fiscal year 2015 funding for Older Americans Act (OAA) Nutrition Programs administered by the Administration for Community Living/Administration on Aging within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We are sincerely grateful for your longstanding sup-port, as well as your leadership in ensuring that these programs received a restora-tion of funding in fiscal year 2014 over the devastating fiscal year 2013 sequestra-tion cuts. Last month, we sent a joint letter with the National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Program (NANASP) to you, Chairman Mikulski and Ranking Mem-ber Shelby urging increased investments in OAA Nutrition Programs, including the Congregate Nutrition Program, Home-Delivered Nutrition Program (commonly re-ferred to as Meals on Wheels), and the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Spe-cifically, we requested funding these programs at their fiscal year 2010 levels\u2014total-ing $819 million. During the fiscal year 2015 appropriations process, we implore you to give this modest request your utmost consideration due to the significant moral and economic benefits these programs offer. This week, a new report released by the National Foundation to End Senior Hun- ger shows that nearly 9.3 million Americans over the age of 60 struggled with hun-ger in 2012, up from 8.8 million in 2011\u2014and a 28% increase since the start of the recession in 2007. Because OAA funding has not kept pace with needs, the chasm continues to widen. Through OAA Nutrition Programs, we are only able to provide nutritious meals to 2.5 million of them, 1leaving a staggering gap of nearly 7 million seniors still in need. The infrastructure and network exists to serve more of our sen-iors in need, but the financial resources fall substantially short. That is why we are asking for a critical boost in funding levels. Senior hunger is a growing epidemic that has serious implications for our current and future Mandatory spending. Without proper nutrition and the critical social connection that comes along with it, one's health deteriorates and inevitably fails. It is extremely costly not only in personal terms for the individuals who struggle with hunger, but also for our Nation in terms of increased healthcare costs. As such, we hope that you recognize the need to invest in Discretionary programs, like OAA Nutrition Programs, that help prevent and mitigate the effects of chronic diseases, improve quality of life, expedite recovery after an illness or injury, and reduce un-necessary Medicare and Medicaid expenses both today and in the future. These pro-grams are part of the solution to our Nation's fiscal challenges. For over 40 years, OAA Nutrition Programs in communities large and small, urban and rural have been effectively serving our country's most vulnerable, frail and isolated seniors. What started as a demonstration project has grown into a highly effective community-based, nationwide network of more than 5,000 local pro-grams. While not all programs receive OAA funds, the majority rely, in part, on the Federal dollars authorized under Title III of the Act as a foundation on which to leverage other funding. This enables a very successful public-private partnership to help raise the remaining resources needed to provide daily nutritious meals and so-cial contact to seniors 60 years of age and older who are at significant risk of hunger and losing their ability to remain independent and able to live in their homes. The evidence demonstrates that these programs are not only saving lives and tax- payer dollars every day, but they are doing precisely what they were designed to do by effectively reaching our Nation's most at-risk seniors. Data from the 2012 National Survey of OAA Participants shows that the seniors receiving Meals on Wheels and congregate meals are primarily over age 75, impov-erished, live alone, are in poor health and functionally impaired. For the majority 535 2Lloyd, Jean & Greuling, Holly. The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program Sets a New Table. Aging Today Online. American Society on Aging.

Of the seniors receiving Meals on Wheels: \u201460 percent have six to 14 chronic health conditions \u201451 percent take from six to at least 23 medications daily \u201429 percent have three or more limitations in everyday activities, such as bath- ing, getting dressed and toileting Of the seniors receiving congregate meals: \u201440 percent have six to 14 chronic health conditions \u201429 percent take from six to at least 23 medications daily \u201450 percent have at least one limitation in everyday activities, such as preparing meals or grocery shopping Each day, Meals on Wheels programs in Iowa, Kansas and in every State across the Nation are serving far more than just meals to seniors in need. They are deliv-ering a caring and efficient service\u2014nutritious meals, friendly visits, and safety checks\u2014enabling more than 2.5 million seniors to continue to live independently in their own homes and without the worry of hunger and isolation. In short, these pro-grams are a lifeline. The following comments from individuals served illustrate the degree to which these OAA Nutrition Programs are delivering far more than just a meal. \u2014''The companionship and fellowship as well as the nutritious meals keep me get- ting up in the morning, getting dressed and to the site to eat.'' \u2014''My husband needs lots and lots of hel p... I f i t wasn't for meals, I wouldn't be able to continue taking care of him in our home.'' \u2014''If it wasn't for Meals on Wheels, I would starve.'' \u2014''Once a day a knock at my door means I eat for that day.'' \u2014''I am so grateful for the volunteer driver s... sometimes it is the only human contact I have for days.'' \u2014''I had major surgery. I feel these meals are big step toward keeping me from going to a nursing home.'' \u2014''I do not get much social security so at least I have food to eat; this is my only meal; I am 89 and need Meals on Wheels or I can't stay in my home; the friend-ly volunteers are the only people I see most days.'' 2,3 Beyond the real people and lives these programs impact on a daily basis, there is increasing and irrefutable evidence that improving and bolstering funding for OAA Nutrition Programs will substantially reduce healthcare costs\u2014both in the short- and long-term. A recent report from the Center for Effective Government found that for every $1 invested in Meals on Wheels, up to $50 could be saved in Medicaid alone. 4Brown University conducted a recent study which found that by investing more in Meals on Wheels, more seniors can be kept out of nursing homes. Specifically, the research found that for every additional $25 a State spends on home-delivered meals each year, per person over 65, the low-care nursing home pop-ulation\u2014seniors who are nursing home eligible but could remain in their homes with only a little outside support\u2014decreases by a percentage point. 5One percentage point can translate to billions of dollars in savings annually. On top of the social and economic cases for investing in OAA Nutrition Programs, the public overwhelmingly supports them. In fact, an October 2013 survey found that 7 in 10 Americans agree that the government should pay for Meals on Wheels. 6 The growing problem of senior hunger in America requires the continued public-pri-vate partnerships that have been a pivotal foundation; however, the Federal Gov-ernment must serve as the strongest and most reliable fiscal partner by elevating its support to higher levels that keep pace with a rapidly aging population, in-creased need and ever-rising costs. We understand the difficult decisions you and your colleagues are tasked with in fiscal year 2015 and beyond. However, the evidence demonstrates that these pro-grams are not only saving lives and taxpayer dollars every day, but they are effec-tively reaching our Nation's most vulnerable seniors and have the capacity to serve 536 more if properly resourced. In short, these proven and effective programs are a part of the solution to our Nation's fiscal challenges and should be looked to as such. As your Subcommittee crafts and considers the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS-Edu- cation appropriations bill, we ask that you provide fiscal year 2010 appropriations levels for all three nutrition programs authorized under the OAA\u2014Congregate Nu-trition Program, Home-Delivered Nutrition Program, and the Nutrition Services In-centive Program. You have the ability to shorten waiting lists and increase the number of nutritious meals we can serve to seniors today. At the same time you will be investing in a stronger fiscal path for our country by reducing future healthcare costs. Again, we thank you for the opportunity to present this testimony to you, and for your continued support. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND ASSOCIATION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR 2015 RECOMMENDATIONS \u2014Continue the commitment to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) by sup- porting the President's budget proposal which requests $372.85 million, and an additional $8.2 million from amounts under Section 241 of the Public Health Service Act, for the National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology. \u2014Continue to support the medical library community's role in NLM's outreach, telemedicine, disaster preparedness, health information technology initiatives, and healthcare reform implementation. INTRODUCTION The Medical Library Association (MLA) and Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding fiscal year 2015 appropriations for the National Library of Medicine (NLM), an agency of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Working in partnership with the NIH and other Federal agencies, NLM is the key link in the chain that translates biomedical research into practice, making the results of re-search readily available to all who need it. NLM Leverages NIH Investments in Biomedical Research In today's challenging budget environment, we recognize the difficult decisions Congress faces as it seeks to improve our Nation's fiscal stability. We thank the Subcommittee for its long-standing commitment to strengthening NLM's budget. While extramural funding comprises the largest portion of funding for institutes within the NIH, some eighty percent of NLM's budget supports intramural services and programs that sustain the Nation's biomedical research enterprise and more\u2014 it builds, sustains, and augments NLM's suite of more than 200 databases which provide information access to health professionals, researchers, educators, and the public. Intramural funding also supports all aspects of library operations and pro-grams, including the acquisition, organization, preservation, and dissemination of the world's biomedical literature, no matter the medium. In fiscal year 2015 and beyond, it is critical to continue augmenting NLM's base- line budget to support expansion of its information resources, services, and pro-grams which collect, organize, and make readily accessible rapidly expanding bio-medical knowledge resources and data. NLM maximizes the return on the invest-ment in research conducted by the NIH and other organizations. The Library makes the results of biomedical information more accessible to researchers, clinicians, busi-ness innovators, and the public, enabling such data and information to be used more efficiently and effectively to drive innovation and improve health. NLM is a leader in Big Data and plays a critical role in accelerating nationwide deployment of health information technology, including electronic health records (EHRs), by leading the development, maintenance and dissemination of key standards for health data inter-change that are now required of certified EHRs. NLM also contributes to Congres-sional priorities related to drug safety through its efforts to expand its clinical trial registry and results database (ClinicalTrials.gov) in response to legislative require- ments, and to the Nation's ability to prepare for and respond to disasters. Growing Demand for NLM's Basic Services NLM delivers more than a trillion bytes of data to millions of users daily that helps researchers advance scientific discovery and accelerate its translation into new therapies; provides health practitioners with information that improves medical care 537 and lowers its costs; and gives the public access to resources and tools that promote wellness and disease prevention. Every day, medical librarians across the Nation use NLM services to assist clinicians, students, researchers, and the public in ac-cessing information they need to save lives and improve health. Without NLM, our Nation's medical libraries would be unable to provide the quality information serv-ices that our Nation's health professionals, educators, researchers and patients in-creasingly need. NLM's data repositories and online integrated services such as GenBank, PubMed, and PubMed Central are revolutionizing medicine and ushering in an era of personalized medicine in which care is based on an individual's unique genetic profile. GenBank is the definitive source of gene sequence information. PubMed, with more than 23 million citations to the biomedical literature, is the world's most heavily used source of bibliographic information. Approximately 760,000 new cita-tions were added in fiscal year 2013, and the database provided high quality med-ical information to about 2.3 million users each day. PubMed Central is NLM's dig-ital archive which provides public access to the full-text versions of more than 3 mil-lion biomedical journal articles, including those produced by NIH-funded research-ers. On a typical weekday more than one million users download 1.65 million full- text articles, including those submitted in compliance with the NIH Public Access Policy. As the world's largest and most comprehensive medical library, NLM's traditional print and electronic collections continue to steadily increase each year, standing at more than 21 million items\u2014books, journals, technical reports, manuscripts, micro-films, photographs and images. By selecting, organizing and ensuring permanent ac-cess to health sciences information in all formats, NLM ensures the availability of this information for future generations, making it accessible to all Americans, irre-spective of geography or ability to pay, and guaranteeing that citizens can make the best, most informed decisions about their healthcare. Encourage NLM Partnerships NLM's outreach programs are essential to MLA and AAHSL membership and to the profession. Through the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM), with over 6,000 members in communities nationwide, these activities educate med-ical librarians, health professionals and the general public about NLM's services and train them in the most effective use of these services. The NN/LM promotes educational outreach for public libraries, secondary schools, senior centers and other consumer-based settings, and its emphasis on outreach to underserved populations helps reduce health disparities among large sections of the American public. NLM's ''Partners in Information Access'' program improves access by local public health of-ficials to information which prevents, identifies and responds to public health threats and ensures every public worker has electronic health information services that protect the public's health. NLM's MedlinePlus provides consumers with trusted, reliable health information on more than 900 topics in English and Spanish. It has become a top destination for those seeking information on the Internet, attracting more than 1.2 million visi-tors daily. NLM has continued to make enhancements to MedlinePlus, with selected materials now available in forty other languages. Other products and services that benefit public health and wellness include the NIH MedlinePlus Magazine and NIH MedlinePlus Salud, available in doctors' offices nationwide, and NLM's MedlinePlus Connect\u2014a utility which enables clinical care organizations to implement links from their electronic health records systems to relevant patient education materials in MedlinePlus. MLA and AAHSL applaud the success of NLM's outreach initiatives, and we look forward to continuing to work with NLM on these programs. Emergency Preparedness and Response Through its Disaster Information Management Research Center, NLM collects and organizes disaster-related health information, ensures effective use of libraries and librarians in disaster planning and response, and develops information services to assist responders. NLM responds to specific disasters worldwide with specialized information resources appropriate to the need, including information on bioter-rorism, chemical emergencies, fires and wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and pan-demic disease outbreaks. MLA and NLM continue to develop the Disaster Informa-tion Specialization (DIS) program to build the capacity of librarians and other inter-ested professionals to provide disaster-related health information outreach. Working with libraries and publishers, NLM's Emergency Access Initiative makes available free full-text articles from hundreds of biomedical journals and reference books for use by medical teams responding to disasters. MLA and AAHSL ask the Sub-538 committee to support NLM's role in this crucial area which ensures continuous ac- cess to health information and use of libraries and librarians when disasters occur. Health Information Technology and Bioinformatics For more than 40 years, NLM has supported informatics research, training and the application of advanced computing and informatics to biomedical research and healthcare delivery including telemedicine projects. Many of today's biomedical informatics leaders are graduates of NLM-funded informatics research programs at universities nationwide. A number of the country's exemplary electronic and per-sonal health record systems benefit from findings developed with NLM grant sup-port. The importance of NLM's work in health information technology continues to grow as the Nation moves toward more interoperable health information technology systems. A leader in supporting the development, maintenance, and dissemination of standard clinical terminologies for free nationwide use (e.g., SNOMED), NLM works closely with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to promote the adoption of interoperable electronic records, and has de-veloped tools to make it easier for EHR developers and users to implement accepted health data standards in their systems. Organizational Bios The Medical Library Association (MLA) is a nonprofit, educational organization with 4,000 health sciences information individual and institutional members. Founded in 1898, MLA provides lifelong educational opportunities, supports a knowledge base of health information research, and works with a network of part-ners to promote the importance of quality information for improved health to the healthcare community and the public. The Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) supports aca- demic health sciences libraries and directors in advancing the patient care, research, education and community service missions of academic health centers through vi-sionary executive leadership and expertise in health information, scholarly commu-nication, and knowledge management. Thank you again for the opportunity to present our views. We look forward to con- tinuing this dialogue and supporting the Subcommittee's efforts to secure the high-est possible funding level for NLM in fiscal year 2015 and the years beyond to sup-port the Library's mission and growing responsibilities. Information about NLM and its programs can be found at http://www.nlm.nih.gov. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE MESOTHELIOMA APPLIED RESEARCH FOUNDATION Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony on behalf of the meso-thelioma community. My name is Mary Hesdorffer and I am the Executive Director of the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation. I am testifying on behalf of the mesothelioma community composed of patients, physicians, caregivers and family members. I am a Nurse Practitioner with over sixteen years' experience working with mesothelioma patients in the clinical setting. I would like to use this oppor-tunity to emphasize the great need for increased funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both of which play a critical role in improving treatment for mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer known to be caused by exposure to asbestos. Doctors say it is among the most painful of cancers, and the prognosis is poor even with the best available treatment. The harsh reality for patients with malignant mesothelioma is that it is a ter- minal illness; the five-year survival rate is five to ten percent, making it one of the most deadly cancers. Left untreated, survival ranges from six to 9 months, and if treated with the sole Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapy, me-dian survival is only 12.3 months. With only one FDA approved treatment available, mesothelioma patients must take a trial and error approach to treatment, making agonizing decisions each step of the way. Most patients must make the tough decision to go into a clinical trial, use off label treatments, or undergo drastic surgeries knowing they may see no ben-efit whatsoever. They choose to do this with a powerful hope they can help doctors learn how to treat mesothelioma, possibly live a while longer and prevent future mesothelioma patients from enduring the same difficult experience. Fortunately, there are brilliant researchers dedicated to mesothelioma. The Meso- thelioma Applied Research Foundation has made a significant investment, funding a total of $8.7 million to support research in hopes of giving researchers the first 539 seed grant they need to get started. We need the continued partnership with the Federal Government to develop the promising findings into effective treatments. In research, innovative and personalized therapies from the mapping of the human genome or those that utilize the body's own immune system are becoming a reality for mesothelioma. These developments have the potential to reduce the human toll of mesothelioma, but need continued research funding to bring the ad-vances from the bench to the bedside. Recent research findings have linked mesothelioma to a germline mutation in the BAP1 gene and a somatic mutation in the NF2 gene. Currently, the research goal of the BAP1 and NF2 genes is for prevention and early detection of mesothelioma. For example, individuals known to be exposed to asbestos who carry this gene can be studied to determine if a cancer signal can be picked up before the development of mesothelioma. The idea is that if you have a germ line mutation, you and your immediate family will be screened for cancers associated with this gene in the hope of picking up an early malignancy. Also, researchers will study ways to turn off this gene, if defective. There is great potential in these findings. Immunotherapy is another exciting area of research. An immunotherapy is a treatment that uses certain parts of a person's immune system to target cancer, and is one of the most exciting areas in cancer research. Dr. Raffit Hassan at the NCI and his collaborators have shown that mesothelin, a tumor antigen which was dis-covered at the NCI, is a useful target for tumor-specific therapy of malignant meso-thelioma. His group is presently conducting clinical trials of three different agents targeting mesothelin. Namely, SS1P which is an anti-mesothelin immunotoxin, a anti-mesothelin monoclonal antibody and CRS-207 which is a mesothelin tumor vaccine. They have seen some success, and it has given patients a reason to be optimistic. It is efforts like these that give mesothelioma patients hope. I am grateful for the Federal Government's investment in mesothelioma research and I want to see it continued and increased. Unless researchers have the funds to continue, these dis-coveries will not yield improved treatments, patients will run out of options and con-tinue to die from this disease. Cancer research funding as a share of the NIH budget has declined while the sci- entific and public health need has gone up. In the late 1990s, NCI's budget made up 18.7 percent of the NIH budget. Today, it is 16.4 percent of the NIH budget . That decline has reduced NCI's funding by $680 million below what it would have received in fiscal year 2014 if its share of NIH's total budget had been maintained. The mesothelioma community asks that the Subcommittee recognize the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a critical national priority by providing at least $32 billion, including $5.26 Billion for the National Cancer Institute in funding in the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill. This funding rec-ommendation represents the minimum investment necessary to avoid further loss of promising research and at the same time allows the NIH's budget to keep pace with biomedical inflation. I look to the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee to provide continued leadership and hope to the peo-ple who develop this fatal cancer. Thank you for the opportunity to submit testi-mony and for funding the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute at the highest possible level. About the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation: The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation is the nonprofit collaboration of patients and families, physicians, advocates, and researchers dedicated to eradi-cating the life-ending and vicious effects of mesothelioma. We believe in a cure for mesothelioma. Given the human toll of suffering the disease causes, the compassion and energy of the mesothelioma community, the moral, legal and economic aspects of asbestos, and the benefits of mesothelioma research to cancer research generally, we believe that the resources to accomplish this cure are available and must be mo- bilized. We seek to marshal and utilize these resources responsibly, as effectively as possible, with financial transparency and by adhering to health policy guidelines that foster ethical clinical and administrative practices, and ethical decisionmaking to: \u2014Offer hope and support to patients and families by educating them on the dis- ease, helping them to obtain the most up-to-date information on treatment op-tions and to connect with mesothelioma treatment specialists, and providing them assistance, emotional support and community with others; \u2014Fund the highest quality and most promising mesothelioma research projects from around the world through rigorous peer-review; and 540 \u2014Raise awareness of mesothelioma, and advocate that the public and private sec- tors partner in the effort to cure it by directing the resources needed to stop this global tragedy PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL AHEC O RGANIZATION The members of the National AHEC Organization (NAO) are pleased to submit this statement for the record recommending $75 million in fiscal year 2015 for the Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program authorized under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act and administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) at the Department of Health and Human Services. The NAO is the professional organization representing AHECs. The AHEC Pro- gram is an established and effective national primary care training network built on committed partnerships of 53 medical schools and academic centers. Additionally, 253 AHEC centers within 48 States and tens of thousands of community practi-tioners are affiliated with the AHEC's national clinical training network. AHEC is one of the Title VII Health Professions Training programs, originally au- thorized at the same time as the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) to create a complete mechanism to provide primary care providers for Community Health Centers (CHCs) and other direct providers of healthcare services for underserved areas and populations. The plan envisioned by creators of the legislation was that the CHCs would provide direct service. The NHSC would be the mechanism to fund the education of providers and supply providers for underserved areas through scholarship and loan repayment commitments. The AHEC program would be the mechanism to recruit providers into primary healthcareers, diversify the workforce, and develop a passion for service to the un-derserved in these future providers, i.e. Area Health Education Centers are the workforce development, training and education machine for the Nation's healthcare safety-net programs. The AHEC program is focused on improving the quality, geo-graphic distribution and diversity of the primary care healthcare workforce and eliminating the disparities in our Nation's healthcare system. AHECs develop and support the community based training of health professions students, particularly in rural and underserved areas. They recruit a diverse and broad range of students into healthcareers, and provide continuing education, li-brary and other learning resources that improve the quality of community-based healthcare for underserved populations and areas. The Area Health Education Center program is effective and provides vital services and national infrastructure. Nationwide, over 379,000 students have been intro-duced to healthcareer opportunities, and over 33,000 mostly minority and disadvan-taged high school students received more than 20 hours each of healthcareer expo-sure. Over 44,000 health professions students received training at 17,530 commu-nity-based sites, and furthermore; over 482,000 health professionals received con-tinuing education through AHECs. AHECs perform these education and training services through collaborative partnerships with Community Health Centers (CHCs) and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), in addition to Rural Health Clinics (RHCs), Critical Access Hospitals, (CAHs), Tribal clinics and Public Health Depart-ments. Justification for Recommendations The AHEC network is an economic engine that fuels the recruitment, training, distribution, and retention of a national health workforce. AHEC stands for JOBS. \u2014AHECs are critical in the recruitment, training, and retention of the primary care workforce. \u2014Research has demonstrated that the community-training network is the most effective recruitment tool for the health professions and those who teach remain longer in underserved areas and communities. \u2014AHECs are in almost every county in the United States. \u2014With the aging and growing population, the demand for primary care workforce is far outpacing the supply. \u2014AHECs continue to educate and train current workforce, as well as recruiting and preparing future workforce \u2014In 2012, AHEC's trained 476,585 Health Professionals in 48 States in 13,842 Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSAs)\u201426.4 percent of those trained were physicians (125,818). \u2014In 2012, the AHEC's introduced nearly 403,000 students to the healthcareers professions and workforce from grades K-College. 541 \u2014The AHEC network's outcomes are the backbone of the Nation's community- based health professions training, with a focus on training primary care work-force. \u2014Continued funding for the AHEC program is necessary as demonstrated by 1) a growing unmet need for primary care doctors in rural areas, and 2) the use of the national network of AHEC programs to carry out administrative prior-ities. 1. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC), has been mentioned as a pro- gram that addresses the priority of increasing diversity in the health profes-sions workforce in underserved and rural areas and addresses the end of the pipeline. The AHEC program engages in pre-pipeline, pipeline, and post-pipeline activities that works to move individuals through a healthcareers pathway and beyond, with a special focus on primary care doctors. 2. The national network of the AHEC program has been tasked with: \u2014Training 13,000 providers nationwide in OIF/OEF/OND Veteran's behav- ioral and mental health, substance abuse, traumatic brain injury and post- traumatic stress, for those not utilizing the VA system \u2014Working with the Food and Drug Administration to educate healthcare pro- fessionals nationwide on proper opioid prescribing habits to address the epi-demic of prescription drug abuse \u2014HRSA has encouraged functional linkage between Bureau of Primary Care and Bureau of Health Professions Programs. AHECs have partnerships with over 1,000 Community Health Centers nationally to recruit, train, and retain health professionals who have the cultural and linguistic skills to serve in HRSA designated underserved areas \u2014Affordable Care Act activities such as increasing the enrollment of individ- uals, training community health workers, and educating providers nation-wide on health insurance exchanges [This statement was submitted by Rob Trachtenberg, Executive Director, National AHEC Organization.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR EYE AND VISION RESEARCH EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research (NAEVR) requests fiscal year 2015 NIH funding of $32 billion, which would fully restore the $1.7 billion fiscal year 2013 sequester cut partially restored in fiscal year 2014 and enable an infla-tionary increase-the NIH has lost 22 percent of its purchasing power since fiscal year 2003, in terms of constant dollars-and provide for modest growth. This request improves on the President's proposal to increase NIH funding by only $200 million over fiscal year 2014 and which also increases the Program Evaluation Transfer to 3 percent, effectively reducing NIH's increase by $150 million. fiscal year 2015 NIH funding of $32 billion is an important step toward consistent and sustained funding increases which are necessary to build upon past investment that has created an unprecedented scientific opportunity in biomedical research. \u2014$32 billion NIH funding is critical for supporting Research Project Grants, as the number of RPGs awarded in fiscal year 2013 was 20 percent less than in fiscal year 2003. R01s, or investigator-initiated grants, have been affected even more dramatically, as the number awarded fell by 24 percent between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2013. \u2014NIH-funded basic and clinical research has helped to understand the basis of disease, thereby resulting in innovations in healthcare to save and improve lives. Its research serves an irreplaceable role the private sector could not dupli-cate. \u2014As an economic driver, in fiscal year 2011NIH-funded research supported 432,000 jobs across the United States and generated more than $62 billion in new economic activity. Every $1 of NIH funding generates $2.21 in local eco-nomic growth. NAEVR requests National Eye Institute (NEI) funding at $730 million, concomi- tant with $32 billion NIH funding. The President's budget proposes a minimal NEI increase of $0.9 million or 0.15 percent, based on its fiscal year 2014 operational net of $675 million-not its $682 million appropriation. This is unacceptable since NEI has lost 25 percent of its purchasing power since fiscal year 2003, and the fiscal year 2013 sequester has already resulted in NEI awarding 30 fewer grants-any one of which may have held the promise to save sight and restore vision. 542 As NEI's Budget Decreases, the Incidence of Eye Disease and Vision Impairment In- creases, As Does the Associated Cost, Estimated at $139 Billion Annually in the United States Although the fiscal year 2013 sequester cut reduced NEI's budget by $36 million to $662 million, $20 million of that was restored in fiscal year 2014 through an ap-propriation of $682 million. In each year, however, NEI's appropriation was reduced even further by $5.6 million and $6.9 million to operational nets of $657 million and $674 million, respectively, due to the transfer back to the NIH Office of AIDS Re-search (OAR) for funding of the dissolved NEI-sponsored Ocular Complications of AIDS studies. Although OAR's funding to NEI was not committed into perpetuity, its return to NIH Central effectively reflects a cut in NEI funding and results in a new baseline upon which future funding will be based. For example, the Presi-dent's fiscal year 2015 budget request bases its 0.15 percent NEI increase on the fiscal year 2014 operational net of $674 million, which results in just a $0.9 million increase in NEI funding to $675 million. The funding nets described above are well below NEI's highest appropriation-that of $707 million in fiscal year 2010 (prior to addition of American Recovery and Rein-vestment Act (ARRA) funding. Unfortunately, as NEI funding has decreased, the challenges it faces have grown, due to dramatic increases in the incidence and cost of vision impairment and eye disease. The NEI estimates that more than 38 million Americans age 40 and older experi- ence blindness, low vision, or an age-related eye disease such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or cataracts. This is expected to grow to more than 50 million Americans by year 2020. Much of this is being driv-en by the aging of the population, for example, the ''Silver Tsunami'' of the 78 mil-lion baby boomers who will turn age 65 this decade and experience the greatest risk for eye disease. Other demographic changes are also contributing to NEI's chal-lenges, for example, African Americans and Hispanics which increasingly account for a larger share of the U.S. population and who experience a disproportionately greater prevalence of eye disease. Vision loss can also be a co-morbid condition of chronic disease, such as diabetes, which is at epidemic levels due to the increased incidence of obesity. In June 2013, Prevent Blindness America, in conjunction with the National Opin- ion Research Center at the University of Chicago, released updated estimates of the cost of vision disorders. NORC estimates the annual costs of vision disorders at $139 billion annually, inclusive of direct and indirect costs. Most importantly, the direct medical costs associated with vision disorders are the fifth highest-only less than heart disease, cancers, emotional disorders, and pulmonary conditions. NEI's fiscal year 2014 operational net funding of $674 million, as well as the President's fiscal year 2015 proposed funding of $675 million, are each less than 0.5 percent of this $139 billion annual vision disorder cost burden. The U.S. is spending only $2.10 per-person, per-year for vision research at the NEI, while NORC esti-mates that the cost of treating low vision and blindness is $6,690 per-person, per- year. In 2009, Congress spoke volumes in passing S. Res 209 and H. Res. 366, which designated 2010-2020 as The Decade of Vision and recognized NEI's 40th anniver-sary as the lead institute in funding research to save sight and restore vision. With the fiscal year 2015 LHHS spending bill, Congress can act upon its past resolutions regarding vision and ensure that NEI is adequately funded to meet these chal-lenges. $730 MILLION FISCAL YEAR 2015 FUNDING ENABLES NEI TO PURSUE ITS PRIMARY ''AUDACIOUS GOAL '' OF RESTORING VISION NEI has lost 25 percent of its purchasing power since fiscal year 2003. The fiscal year 2013 sequester cut resulted in NEI awarding 30 fewer grants, and the Presi-dent's fiscal year 2015 proposal would result in 23 fewer awards. Any one of those missed funding opportunities could have held the promise to save sight and restore vision-goals that would have seemed unattainable just a few short years ago. The NEI has long been a leader in biomedical research. As NIH Director Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D. stated in February 2013: ''It's often, it seems to me, that vision research is a couple of steps in front of things that are happening in biomedical research. It's clear that vision research has played a disproportionately large share in scientific breakthroughs.'' Dr. Collins made his comments at NEI's Audacious Goals Development meeting, where more than 200 attendees reflecting every sector of the vision community, in-cluding government scientists and regulators from various disciplines, discussed top-543 ics built around the ten winning submissions from a pool of nearly 500 entries se- lected through NEI's Audacious Goals in Vision Research and Blindness Rehabilita-tion Challenge. This initiative, conducted by NEI with its National Advisory Eye Council (NAEC) and through The America Competes Act, yielded such ideas as re-storing light sensitivity to the blind through gene-based therapies and visual pros-thetics, pinpoint correction of defective genes, and growing healthy tissue from stem cells for ocular tissue transplants. In consultation with the NAEC, the NEI converged on its primary Audacious Goal for vision research: To Regenerate Neurons and Neuronal Connections in the Eye and Visual System.'' As NEI Director Paul Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. stated in February 2014: ''The goals are bold but achievable. They are beyond what medicine currently can do. We are planning for a 10-12-15 year effort to reach these endpoints. Success would transform life for millions of people with eye and vision diseases. It would have major implications for medicine of the future, for vision diseases, and even be-yond this, for neurological diseases.'' As NEI works to achieve this goal, it will build upon its breakthrough research funded through past Federal investment. For example, NEI has been a leader in de-termining the genetic basis of disease-the research it has funded has identified more than 500 genes associated with both common and rare eye diseases, which is 7.5 percent of all disease-causing genes discovered to-date. Understanding the genetic basis of the disease and underlying mechanisms will lead to better diagnostics and therapies. Since last year's testimony, NEI has announced that: \u2014The AMD Gene Consortium, a network of international investigators rep- resenting 18 research groups, has discovered seven new regions of the human genome-called loci-that are associated with increased risk of AMD. They also confirmed 12 loci already identified in previous studies. These loci implicate a variety of biological functions, including regulation of the immune system, maintenance of cellular structure, growth and permeability of blood vessels, lipid metabolism, and atherosclerosis. AMD is the leading cause of vision loss overall, as well as the leading cause in individuals are 60-plus. \u2014The NEI Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration (NEIGHBOR) Consortium, which involves clinicians and geneticists at multiple institutions throughout the U.S. who are studying genetic variants associated with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma-the most common form of the disease-has identified the first common genetic risk factors for normal pressure glaucoma. NEIGHBOR, unique because it is the largest Genome-Wide Association Study to-date, will generate new in- sights into the molecular pathogenesis, effective screening and prevention strat-egies, and more rational treatment approaches for this disease. Glaucoma is three-to-four times more prevalent in African Americans than non-Hispanic Whites and is the leading cause of blindness in the Latino population. These are ambitious goals that require increased-not decreased-funding. Our Na- tion's investment in vision health is an investment in its overall health. NEI's breakthrough research is a cost-effective investment, since it is leading to treat-ments and therapies that can ultimately delay, save, and prevent health expendi-tures, especially those associated with the Medicare and Medicaid programs. It can also increase productivity, help individuals to maintain their independence, and generally improve the quality of life, especially since vision loss is associated with increased depression and accelerated mortality. The very health of the vision research community is also at stake with the de- crease in NEI funding. Not only will funding for new investigators be at risk, but also that of seasoned investigators, which threatens the continuity of research and the retention of trained staff, while making institutions more reliant on bridge and philanthropic funding. .

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS Chairman Harkin and members of the Subcommittee, I am Mary Giliberti, Execu- tive Director of NAMI (the National Alliance on Mental Illness). I am pleased today to offer NAMI's views on the Subcommittee's upcoming fiscal year 2015 bill. The Na-544 tional Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is the Nation's largest grassroots advocacy organization representing persons living with serious mental illness and their fami-lies. Through our 1,100 affiliates in all 50 States, we support education, outreach, advocacy and research on behalf of persons with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, major depression, severe anxiety disorders and mental health conditions affecting children. An estimated 11.5 million American adults live with a mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. Based on estimates for 2010, mental disorders accounted for 21.3percent of all years lived with disability in the United States. Among the top 20 causes of years lived with disability, five were mental disorders: major depressive disorder (8.3 percent of the total), anxiety dis-orders (5.1 percent), schizophrenia (2.2 percent), bipolar disorder (1.6 percent) and dysthymia (1.5 percent). Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., ac-counting for the loss of more than 38,000 American lives each year, more than dou-ble the number of lives lost to homicide. The social and economic costs associated with these disorders are tremendous. A cautious estimate places the direct and indi-rect financial costs associated with mental illness in the U.S. at well over $300 bil-lion annually, and it ranks as the third most costly medical condition in terms of overall healthcare expenditure, behind only heart conditions and traumatic injury. These costs are not only financial, but also human in terms of lost productivity, broken families and lives lost to suicide. Investment in mental illness research and services are\u2014in NAMI's view\u2014the highest priority for our Nation and this Sub-committee. National Institute of Mental Health Research Funding As a member of the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research Funding, NAMI supports a $32 billion overall allocation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This in-crease is needed to avoid having our country continue to fall behind China, India and other emerging Nations in terms of our public investment in scientific research. As you know, the President is requesting a $23 million increase for the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for fiscal year 2015, boosting funding for the agency to $1.44 billion. NAMI would urge the Subcommittee to fund investments beyond this amount with an overall higher allocation for the entire NIH. NAMI also supports the President's BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) and the request for a $40 million boost, up to $100 million. The BRAIN Initiative is multi-agency collaborative with a num-ber of foundations designed to unleash new technologies and undertake basic map-ping of circuits and neurons in the most complex organ in the human body. Accelerating the Pace of Psychiatric Drug Discovery In NAMI's view, there is an urgent need for new medications to treat serious mental illness. Existing medications can be helpful, but they often have significant limitations; in some cases requiring weeks to take effect; failing to relieve symptoms in a significant proportion of patients; or, resulting in debilitating side effects. How-ever, developing new medications is a lengthy and expensive process. Many prom-ising compounds fail to prove effective in clinical testing after years of preliminary research. To address this urgent issue, NAMI is encouraging NIMH to accelerate the pace of drug discovery through an 'experimental medicine' approach to evaluate novel interventions for mental illnesses. This ''fast-fail'' strategy is designed not only to quickly identify candidates that merit more extensive testing, but also to identify targets in the brain for the development of additional candidate compounds. Through small trials focused on proof-of-concept experimental medicine paradigms, we can make progress to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy. Advancing Services and Intervention Research NAMI enthusiastically supports the NIMH Recovery After an Initial Schizo- phrenia Episode (RAISE) Project, aimed at preventing the long-term disability asso-ciated with schizophrenia by intervening at the earliest stages of illness. The RAISE Early Treatment Program (RAISE ETP) will conclude this year. The RAISE Connec-tion Program has successfully integrated a comprehensive early intervention pro-gram for schizophrenia and related disorders into an existing medical care system. This implementation study is now evaluating strategies for reducing duration of un-treated psychosis among persons with early-stage psychotic illness. When individ- uals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder progress to later stages of their illness, they become more likely to develop\u2014and die prematurely\u2014from medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and pulmonary disease than mem-bers of the general population. NIMH funded research is demonstrating progress ad-vancing the health of people with serious mental illness. NIMH needs to advance 545 this research to large-scale clinical trials aimed at reducing premature mortality for people living with serious mental illness. Investing in Early Psychosis Prediction and Prevention (EP3) As many as 100,000 young Americans experience a first episode of psychosis (FEP) each year. The early phase of psychotic illness is a critical opportunity to alter the downward trajectory and social, academic, and vocational challenges asso-ciated with serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. The timing of treatment is critical; short- and long-term outcomes are better when individuals begin treat-ment close to the onset of psychosis. Unfortunately, the majority of people with mental illness experience significant delays to seeking care\u2014up to 9 years in some cases. Such delays result in periods of increased risk for poor outcomes, especially suicide. NIMH-funded research has focused on the prodrome, the high-risk period pre- ceding the onset of the first psychotic episode of schizophrenia. Through North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and other studies focused on early prediction and prevention of psychosis, NIMH has launched Early Psychosis Pre-diction and Prevention (EP3) initiative. EP3 is showing promise in detecting risk States for psychotic disorders and reducing the duration of untreated psychosis in adolescents that have experienced FEP. Advancing Precision Medicine NAMI supports efforts at NIMH to translate basic research findings on brain function into more person-centered and multifaceted diagnoses and treatments for mental disorders. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) is showing promise toward efforts to build a classification system based more on underlying biological and basic behavioral mechanisms than on symptoms, RDoC should begin to give us the preci-sion currently lacking with traditional diagnostic approaches to mental disorders. Funding for Programs at SAMHSA's Center for Mental Health Services As noted above, the costs of untreated mental illness to our Nation are enor- mous\u2014as high as $300 billion when taking into account lost wages and productivity and other indirect costs. These costs are compounded by the fact that across the Na-tion States and localities devote enormous resources addressing the human and fi-nancial costs untreated mental illness through law enforcement, corrections, home-less shelters and emergency medical services. This phenomenon of ''spending money in all the wrong places'' is tragic given that we have a vast array of proven evi-dence-based interventions that we know work\u2014assertive community treatment, supported employment, family psycho-education and supportive housing. NAMI supports programs at the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) at SAMHSA that are focused on replication and expansion of these evidence-based practices that serve children and adults living with serious mental illness. The most important of these programs is the Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG). NAMI is extremely grateful for the increases in funding for the MHBG that this Sub-committee has made in recent years, boosting funding from $420 million in fiscal year 2010, up to its current level of $484 million in fiscal year 2014. This increase has been important to helping States fills gaps in services that have occurred as States cut more than $4 billion from State mental health budgets since the reces-sion began in 2008. NAMI also supports the 5 percent set aside in the in the MHBG that this Sub- committee enacted in fiscal year 2014 for early intervention in psychosis. As noted above, the NIMH RAISE study validated the most effective approaches for providing coordinated care for adolescents experiencing FEP. Among these is Coordinated Spe-cialty Care (CSC), a collaborative, recovery-oriented approach that emulates the as-sertive community treatment combining evidence-based services into an effective package. CSC emphasizes shared decisionmaking\u2014which NAMI strongly supports\u2014 with the recipient of services taking an active role in determining treatment pref-erences and recovery goals. In April, CMHS issued guidance to the States specifying that funding as part of the 5 percent set aside must be used for those who have developed the symptoms of early serious mental illness, not for ''preventive intervention for those at high risk of serious mental illness.'' NAMI supports this guidance and we recommend that the Subcommittee continue this 5 percent set aside for FEP in fiscal year 2015 and be-yond. NAMI would also recommend the following priorities for CMHS for fiscal year 2015: \u2014Continuation of the Children's Mental Health program at $117 million, and 546 \u2014Support the President's proposal for a $6 million increase for suicide prevention activities at CMHS (up to $54.2 million), including funding for the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. Addressing Early Mortality and Serious Mental Illness, Integrating Primary and Be- havioral Health Care The CMHS Primary Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI) program sup- ports community behavioral health and primary care organizations that partner to provide essential primary care services to adults with serious mental illnesses. Be-cause of this program, more than 33,000 people with serious mental illness and sub-stance use disorders are screened and treated at 100 grantee sites for diabetes, heart disease, and other common and deadly illnesses in an effort to stem the alarming early mortality rate from these health conditions in this population. NAMI urges the Subcommittee to fund the PBHCI for fiscal year 2015 at $50 million. Addressing the Needs of Homeless Individuals Living with Serious Mental Illness On any given night, according to 2013 data, 610,042 people are homeless, and 15 percent of these individuals are defined as long-term or chronically homeless. Years of reliable data and research demonstrate that, for single individuals with serious mental illness who live with complex needs, the most successful intervention for ending and preventing homelessness is linking housing to appropriate support serv-ices. Although there is a need for more affordable housing, funding the supportive services is even more difficult. SAMHSA homeless programs fill a gap created by a preference of HUD to fund housing rental assistance and capital needs. HHS must take responsibility to fund the critically important services that are necessary for programs to be effective. In 2013, SAMHSA was not able to award any new community-based services grants. For the first time, eleven States (AZ, GA, HI, WA, LA, IL, NV, PA, MA, MI and CO) did receive funding to improve statewide alignment of resources but every State could use SAMHSA assistance in their efforts to end homelessness. Over the years, hundreds of government entities and local providers have been unable to move forward with important work due to inadequate funding levels. The current fiscal year 2014 funding level of SAMHSA homeless programs is $74 million, divided between CMHS and CSAT. NAMI supports an increase for this joint program up to $100 million, equally divided between CMHS and CSAT. NAMI also supports funding for the PATH program (Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness) that allocates funds by formula to States to serve homeless people with serious mental illness. Eligible services include outreach, screening and diagnosis, habilitation and rehabilitation, community mental health services, substance abuse treatment, case management, residential supervision, and housing. PATH supported programs reached over 191,839 people in fiscal year 2013. Of these, 65 percent were unsheltered at the time of engagement, 42 percent were not engaged in mental illness treatment and 53 percent had co-occurring substance use disorders. NAMI recommends at least $75 million for the PATH program for fis-cal year 2015 (the authorized amount). In fiscal year 2014, the PATH program is funded at $65 million. Conclusion Chairman Harkin, thank you for the opportunity to share NAMI's views on the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee's fiscal year 2015 bill. NAMI's consumer and family membership thanks you for your leadership on these important national pri-orities.

Specifically, NAESV is requesting $50.6 million, $45 million for the program and $5.6 million in PHS evaluation tap funds, for the Rape Prevention & Education Program (RPE) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control budget. In addition, NAESV is requesting level funding of $160 million for the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant, which includes a $7 million set-aside for rape preven-547 tion services, in CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion budget. Together, we must make our communities safer. One in five women has been the victim of rape or attempted rape. Nearly one in two women has experienced some form of sexual violence and one in five men has experienced a form of sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime. The CDC National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey study confirmed that the im-pacts of sexual violence on society are enormous. Over 80 percent of women who were victimized experienced significant short and long-term impacts related to the violence such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), injury (42 percent) and missed time at work or school (28 percent). The CDC report also shows that most rape and partner violence is experienced before the age of 24, highlighting the im-portance of preventing this violence before it occurs. The 2013 Rape Crisis Center Survey, distributed by NAESV, demonstrated that over 75 percent of these programs lost funding in the last year, causing programs to have to reduce services, lay off staff or even close. Over one third of rape crisis centers reported having a waiting list for services, with victims waiting most often for counseling services and support groups. Three out of four programs cannot meet current requests for community prevention programs. As you begin the fiscal year 2015 appropriations process, please fund the following priorities. Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) .\u2014The National Alliance to End Sexual Vio- lence urges Congress to provide $45 million for the program and an additional $5.6 million in PHS evaluation tap funds for RPE program evaluation, with the goal of creating a more extensive evidence base for sexual violence prevention. Funding for RPE through CDC's Injury Center provides formula funding to every State and ter-ritory to raise awareness of the problem of sexual assault, support efforts to prevent first-time perpetration and victimization, and bring together diverse partners to de-velop, implement and evaluate statewide sexual assault prevention plans. The RPE program engages boys and men as partners, supports interdisciplinary research col-laborations, fosters cross-cultural approaches to prevention, promotes healthy rela-tionships, and funds the critically important National Sexual Violence Resource Center. High profile cases have increased the demand for prevention and education beyond the current capacity of State sexual assault coalitions and local rape crisis centers. The expansive media attention also points to the need for comprehensive community responses to sexual violence like those funded by RPE. With fiscal year 2013 funding, the program educated more than 1.8 million students, answered 340,000 hotline calls, and conducted over 105,000 trainings nationwide. Formula Shortfall .\u2014Beginning in fiscal year 2014, a new RPE funding formula is being implemented based on VAWA 2013. While the formula provides a base funding of $150,000 for all 50 States, Washington, DC and Puerto Rico, and $50,000 for territories, it reduces the funding provided to large States. In addition, CDC is altering the fiscal year of the program which results in reduced funding stretched over a span of 15 months, further penalizing State coalitions and local rape crisis centers at the same time demand for rape prevention and education is increasing due to high profile cases causing alarm in local communities. Increased funding is required to avoid critical shortfalls. Program Evaluation .\u2014There is a need to increase the evidence base for sexual vi- olence prevention. However, those efforts should be funded by additional funding\u2014 not from program funds to States and local rape crisis centers. Most recently, CDC decided to make ''State level evaluation'' mandatory despite many States starting local, regional or targeted evaluation efforts. It is the CDC's stated perspective that this would be ''less labor intensive.'' However, this strategy forces everyone down one path, without a recognition of the work and progress that is currently underway in many States, nor of each State's individual goals, projects or bandwidth to accom-plish the work. To date, CDC has not demonstrated that they have developed any significant sexual violence specific research and evaluation over the years. Rather, all indicators suggest that they are relying on proxy measures that have been devel-oped for other issues such as alcohol use, which are not suited to measure sexual violence. We support the CDC proposal to use PHS evaluation tap funding for this purpose. We do not want program funds diverted from the communities at a time when demand for prevention and education, as well as services, is increasing at such a rapid rate. Preventive Health & Health Services Block Grant (PHHSBG) .\u2014We are very grate- ful for the fiscal year 2014 funding of $160 million enacted by Congress and dis-appointed with the Administration's efforts to eliminate the program which provides much needed resources to communities. The Public Health Service Act of 2010 au-thorizes the block grant (CDC, Chronic Disease) and provides a rape set-aside provi-sion which guarantees at least $7 million for rape services and prevention. Please retain the block grant funding that supports local rape crisis centers providing serv-548 ices, statewide training and technical assistance to increase capacity to assist rape victims and prevent future victimization. Maximum funding is requested. We must have the resources to meet the education and prevention needs in the community. Victims deserve support, our young people deserve to grow up safely, and research tells us that appropriate and early intervention and prevention can mitigate the costs and consequences of sexual violence and prevent that violence from occurring in the first place. The best way to prevent victimization is to prevent first time perpetration. The best way to convict a rapist is to support and advocate for the victim, obtain evidence and provide assistance and training to law enforce-ment. Thank you for the opportunity for the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence to present testimony for the record as the Senate Committee on Appropriations Sub-committee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies begins the process to prepare the fiscal year 2015 Appropriations Bill.

ABOUT ALOPECIA AREATA Alopecia areata is a prevalent autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. It usually starts with one or more small, round, smooth patches on the scalp and can progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis) or complete body hair loss (alopecia universalis). Alopecia areata affects approximately 2.1 percent of the population, including more than 6.5 million people in the United States alone. The disease disproportion-ately strikes children and onset often occurs at an early age. This common skin dis-ease is highly unpredictable and cyclical. Hair can grow back in or fall out again at any time, and the disease course is different for each person. In recent years, sci-entific advancements have been made, but there remains no cure or indicated treat-ment options. The true impact of alopecia areata is more easily understood anecdotally than em- pirically. Affected individuals often experience significant psychological and social challenges in addition to the biological impact of the disease. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation are health issues that can accompany alopecia areata. The knowledge that medical interventions are extremely limited and of minor effective-ness in this area further exacerbates the emotional stresses patients typically expe-rience. ABOUT THE FOUNDATION NAAF, headquartered in San Rafael, California, supports research to find a cure or acceptable treatment for alopecia areata, supports those with the disease, and educates the public about alopecia areata. NAAF is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors and a prestigious Scientific Advisory Council. Founded in 1981, NAAF is widely regarded as the largest, most influential, and most representative founda-tion associated with alopecia areata. NAAF is connected to patients through local support groups and also holds an important, well-attended annual conference that reaches many children and families. Recently, NAAF initiated the Alopecia Areata Treatment Development Program (TDP) dedicated to advancing research and identifying innovative treatment options. TDP builds on advances in immunological and genetic research and is making use of the Alopecia Areata Clinical Trials Registry which was established in 2000 with funding support from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; NAAF took over responsibility financial and administrative responsi-bility for the Registry in 2012 and continues to add patients to it. NAAF is engaging scientists in active review of both basic and applied science in a variety of ways, including the November 2012 Alopecia Areata Research Summit featuring presen-tations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and NIAMS. 549 DEIDRE 'S STORY It has been 15 years since I first found the bald patch on my head that would completely change the course of my life. As a student at Florida State University during my junior year I found a perfectly round bald patch while blow-drying my very thick long hair\u2014my pride and joy! Little did I know then the significant effect alopecia areata would have on my life. I followed the typical patient profile for this disease. I started with one patch the size of a 50 cent piece, which later evolved into patches of varying sizes all over my head, and then to total loss of all scalp hair, which progressed to the most severe form of the disease: total loss of all body hair including my scalp, eyebrows, eye-lashes, etc. Recently, my hair has inexplicably started to grow back in a very patchy and strange fashion on my head, while most of my body still remains hairless; a perfect example of the completely unpredictable course of this disease, which can cause significant emotional turmoil and distress for the sufferer. As a professional woman, this disease has had a severe impact on my life. I have to present a confident image to the outside world. Living in constant fear of being discovered as a bald woman, being thought to be sick, bizarre, or worse has always been on the forefront of my mind. The exorbitant cost for treatments such as cortisone injections, extremely painful with questionable efficacy, has been an issue for me along with the expensive cra-nial prosthetics. Over the course of the years these have cost me thousands of dol-lars. If a lawyer like myself has financial difficulty when it comes to paying for treatments and prosthetics (which are not covered by insurance due to lack of CMS coverage benefits for those with Alopecia Areata), can you imagine the plight facing those patients that live on limited or fixed income? The fact that there is so little known about the causes or possible treatments/cure for this disease only adds to the pain and suffering. This is a disease that alters the way you see yourself and the way the outside world treats you, and also causes significant and often debilitating emotional distress. The fact that there is little that can currently be done adds to that pain and suffering. Patients face a bleak outlook. For me, it has been a constant battle. I have not lived a single moment in the 5,475 days since that I have not looked in the mirror and wanted to scream or cry, not a single day that I haven't thought that I am damaged, abnormal, or ugly because of my hair loss, not a single day that I haven't worried about how a client, colleague, friend, or love-interest might see and judge me. Many will say to me that ''it is only hair'' or ''at least it's not cancer.'' These comments only frustrate and upset me more. The feelings of being ostracized as an outcast can become deafening, even for a confident, intelligent professional. I shudder to think how others who don't possess my strength of character handle the stresses of this disease. It is only with additional funding for research that we might hope to improve the lives of the millions in the U.S. living with alopecia areata. Few have even heard of the disease. That fact alone creates additional stresses and difficulties for those of us with the disease, constantly having to explain what is ''wrong'' with us. In-creased research into viable treatment options and a potential cure could signifi-cantly impact millions of lives, from small children to adults, facing the constant battle that comes from a total loss of self image and confidence. I thank you on behalf of myself and of the entire alopecia areata community for consideration of NAAF's requests. SEQUESTRATION We have heard from the medical research community that sequestration and def- icit reduction activities have created serious issues for Federal funding opportunities and the career development pipeline. In order to ensure that research into alopecia areata, skin, and autoimmune disorders can continue to move forward, and, more importantly, to ensure that our country is adequately preparing the next generation of young investigators, we urge you to avert, mitigate, or otherwise eliminate the specter of sequestration. While the Foundation has anecdotal accounts of the harms of sequestration, the Federated American Societies for Experimental Biology has re-ported: \u2014In constant dollars (adjusted for inflation), the NIH budget in fiscal year 2013 was $6 billion (22.4 percent) less than it was in fiscal year 2003. \u2014The number of competing research project grants (RPGs) awarded by NIH has also fallen sharply since fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2013, NIH made 8,283 RPG awards, which is 2,110 (20.3 percent) fewer than in fiscal year 2003. \u2014Awards for R01-equivalent grants, the primary mechanism for supporting inves- tigator-initiated research, suffered even greater losses. The number awarded fell by 2,528 (34 percent) between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2013. 550 The pay line for some NIH funding mechanisms has fallen from 18 percent to 10 percent while the average age for a researcher to receive their first NIH-funded grant has climbed to 42. These are strong disincentives to choosing a career as a medical researcher. Our scaling-back is occurring at a time when many foreign countries are investing heavily in their biotechnology sectors. China alone plans to dedicate $300 million to medical research over the next 5 years; this amount is dou-ble the current NIH budget over the same period of time. Scientific breakthroughs will continue, but America may not benefit from the return-on-investment of a ro-bust biotechnology sector. For the purposes of economic and national security, as well as public health, the Foundation asks that you work with your colleagues to eliminate sequestration and recommit to supporting this Nation's biomedical re-search enterprise. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION CDC and NCCDPHP are well-positioned to improve our understanding of alopecia areata through surveillance and surveys. There are many opportunities in this area due to the fact that alopecia areata is the most easily observable autoimmune dis-ease. Robust epidemiology could yield important information for all autoimmune dis- eases, not just alopecia areata. CDC requires a meaningful investment in fiscal year 2015 so that it can expand its crucial public health activities beyond winnable bat-tles. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH NIH hosts a modest alopecia areata research portfolio, and the Foundation works closely with NIH to advance critical activities. NIH projects, in coordination with the Foundation's TDP, have the potential to identify biomarkers and develop thera-peutic targets. In fact, alopecia areata research has a strong value proposition as scientific advancements may have applications for other autoimmune and skin dis-eases. Please provide NIH with meaningful funding increases to facilitate growth in the alopecia areata research portfolio. One exciting emerging opportunity is the new Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) that was recently announced by NIH. This effort is outcomes-oriented and based on a public private-partnership model. Industry, patient organizations, and researchers work together to conduct research with the goals of improving treat-ments and diagnostic tools. Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the diseases being exam-ined in the first round of study, which should generate opportunities for alopecia areata due to the similarities between the conditions. Please support AMP and en-courage NIH to expand activities in this area, particularly when there is research overlap between conditions ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES FDA nominated alopecia areata as a potential condition for specific review through the Patient-Focused Drug Development Initiative (PFDDI). This is because many of the impacts of alopecia areata have to be reported by patients and cannot be measured biologically. While we appreciate that FDA falls under the guise of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, we ask that you work with your col-leagues on the Appropriations Committee to support this important program. Fur-ther, FDA should be encouraged to review all originally-nominated conditions in a timely manner so the PFDDI can continue to move forward. Thank you for your time and your consideration of the community's requests. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR GERIATRIC EDUCATION The National Association for Geriatric Education (NAGE) is pleased to submit this statement for the record recommending $41.997 million in fiscal year 2015 to support geriatrics programs under the Health Resources and Services Administra-tion (HRSA), Title VII, Section 753 of the Public Health Service Act. NAGE respect-fully requests that the Subcommittee return to its approved level for fiscal year 2010, which was also included that year in the Administration's request, but was not included in the final bill. Unfortunately, only $34 million was funded in the final bill, and that has been cut to under $34 million in subsequent years. NAGE is a non-profit membership organization representing Geriatric Education Centers (GECs) and other programs that provide education and training to health professionals in the areas of geriatrics and gerontology. Our mission is to help America's health workforce be better prepared to render age-appropriate care to to-day's older Americans and those of tomorrow. 551 NAGE recognizes the Subcommittee faces difficult decisions in a constrained budget environment, a continued commitment to programs supporting the growing need for geriatric education programs that help the Nation's health professions bet-ter serve the older and disabled population should remain a top priority. The Nation faces a shortage of geriatric health professionals. Every day in America 10,000 more persons reach the age of 65 years. There simply are not enough geriatricians, geron-tological nurse practitioners and the myriad other health professions needed to pro-vide interprofessional care to this burgeoning older population. Three geriatric health professions programs are financed under Title VII, Section 753 of the Public Health Service Act and are included in the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Geriatric Education Centers (GECs) and their re-lated programs, the Geriatric Academic Career Awards and the Geriatric Faculty Fellowships, provide much needed interdisciplinary geriatric and gerontology train-ing to a broad range of health professionals who serve our rapidly growing aging population. GECs train healthcare professional faculty, students, and practitioners in the interprofessional diagnosis, management and prevention of disease, disability, and other health problems of the elderly. This program also provides interprofessional continuing education for healthcare practitioners related to prominent issues in the field of geriatrics, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and advances in palliative care, among others. The GEC program currently funds 45 GECs in 34 States, in-cluding statewide and multi-state programs. About half of GECs provide education for areas that are more than 50 percent rural and one-fourth of GECs focuses on training in areas that are 25-49 percent rural. In the 2012-2013 Academic Year, GEC programs provided over 1,650 different continuing education courses to over 94,000 trainees. GEC grantees exceeded the program's performance goal by 58.5 percent. Geriatrics Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral/Mental Health Pro- fessionals (GTPD) support faculty fellowships that help physicians, dentists, and be-havioral and mental health professionals who plan to teach geriatrics in their se-lected fields. The aim of the program is increase the number of quality, culturally competent geriatric faculty and to retain mid-career faculty in geriatrics. GTPD pro-vided funding for 64 fellows in the academia field of geriatric medicine, dentistry, and psychiatry. The GTPD fellows received clinical training in over 200 different healthcare locations across the Nation. The majority were trained in Veteran's Af-fairs hospitals, private hospitals and academic centers with nearly half of the sites located in medically underserved communities. Notably, each fellow dedicated at least 25 percent of their time for teaching health students about geriatric-related topics. In Academic Year 2012-2013, it is estimated that over 275 courses, work-shops and other activities were delivered by GTPD fellows. Geriatrics Academic Career Awards (GACAs) provide a financial incentive for jun- ior faculty to pursue an academic career in geriatrics. GACA currently supports 62 newly trained geriatric physicians. Award recipients delivered over 1,110 different health courses, workshops and other types of training activities to over 53,000 train-ees across the health profession spectrum. The most common health professions in-clude medical school students, residents in internal medicine and residents in geri-atrics. These successful programs improve the education, supply, distribution, diversity, and quality of healthcare professionals who care for our Nation's growing older adult population, including the underserved and minorities. Thus, we need your con-tinued support for geriatric programs to adequately prepare the next generation of health professionals for the rapidly changing and emerging needs of the growing and aging population. On behalf of NAGE, thank you for this opportunity to share our requests for sup- port for these important programs. We ask that you thoughtfully consider our re-quest for funding in fiscal year 2015. [This statement was submitted by Thomas Caprio, MD, MPH, CMD, FACP, Uni- versity of Rochester, Division of Geriatrics & Aging; Co-Director, Finger Lakes Geri-atric Education Center, President, National Association for Geriatric Education.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR STATE COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAMS Mr. Chairman and Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony on behalf of the National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP), a membership association for the administrators of the federally-funded Community Services Block Grant which serves millions of 552 American families in communities across the country. As the Executive Director of NASCSP, I submit this testimony on behalf of the States in their work to improve the lives of low-income families and strengthen local economies. We are requesting that the Committee approve $710 million in fiscal year 2015 to adequately fund the CSBG network. This level of funding is the same as the fiscal year 2014 enacted funding for CSBG. We strongly believe that CSBG is a wise strategic investment not only in America's ongoing economic recovery, but in our Nation's long-term eco-nomic stability as well. Maintaining funding is necessary not only to continue CSBG's well-documented role in strengthening our economy, but also for the ongo-ing reforms to the block grant which adapt it to new realities and strengthen it for the next generation. We strongly oppose the reduction in funding for CSBG as pro-posed by the Administration, and I welcome this opportunity to explain exactly why. First, however, I'd like to thank Congress for its past support of CSBG. The serv- ices provided by this network are crucial to the millions of Americans facing poverty and economic insecurity at a time when the impact of the slow economy is affecting every Congressional District in America. Right now, more than 46 million Ameri-cans are living below the Federal poverty level (defined as $23,050 a year for a fam-ily of four). CSBG directly addresses the need to help hard-working Americans who are struggling in the present economy and to prevent people from slipping further into poverty. The strength and productivity of our Nation depends on the economic well-being of all of its citizens, and CSBG is a proven strategy to support millions of low-income Americans on the path to economic security. The CSBG network uses grassroots, innovative strategies to alleviate poverty and provides a significant re-turn on taxpayers' investment. In fiscal year 2012, the CSBG network leveraged $22.75 for every Federal dollar invested in CSBG. By acting as a conduit between the Federal administration and local community action agencies (CAA's), States build public-private partnerships, support innova-tion, and advance best practices to ensure the most effective use of taxpayers' money. Local agencies utilize CSBG funds to leverage additional funds to eliminate poverty through a variety of programs and services. While CAAs across the Nation address similar issues, local needs determine unique approaches to addressing them. Poverty is a national problem, but can only be effectively addressed at the grass- roots level. The CSBG network strives to find local solutions to these community issues by conducting community needs assessments to keep in touch with the needs, challenges, and resources in their community. The community needs assessments enable CAAs to provide the most effective and efficient strategies and services. These efforts fall into nine service categories outlined in the CSBG Act; employ-ment, education, income management, housing, emergency services, nutrition, link-ages, self-sufficiency, and health. National data compiled by NASCSP shows that CSBG serves a broad segment of low-income individuals and families. Data from fiscal year 2012 shows: \u2014There are 1,045 CAAs across the country, serving 99 percent of U.S. counties; \u2014CSBG serves 1 out of every 5 people in America below the poverty line; \u2014The majority of clients are female (58 percent), white (59 percent), renters (60 percent) and between the ages of 24\u201444 years old (24 percent)\u2014the second largest group was children ages 0-5 years old (14 percent); \u2014The majority of clients are receiving incomes from employment-related sources (50 percent); \u2014Many of the families served (33 percent) were in ''severe poverty,'' with incomes below 50 percent of the Federal Poverty Guideline. The successes of the CSBG network are well documented: \u2014CSBG served 16 million Americans including 76.9 million families in fiscal year 2012. \u2014Over the past 5 years, the CSBG network helped over 630,000 people obtain employment. \u2014Over the past 5 years, the CSBG network addressed 21.2 million barriers to em- ployment through helping people to either acquire jobs, obtain employment sup-ports, or to receive job training. \u2014Over the past 5 years, the CSBG network expanded 19.8 million community op- portunities or resources to stimulate community and economic development. \u2014Over the past 5 years, the CSBG network facilitated 18.5 million opportunities for infants, children, youth, parents and other adults through developmental or enrichment programs. States provide administrative oversight to ensure that eligible entities are meet- ing State and Federal requirements as well as their locally driven Community Ac-tion Plans. This includes monitoring eligible entities, providing training and tech-nical assistance, investing in innovation, and maintaining effective performance 553 measurement and management systems. Adequate funding is needed to maintain a high level of accountability and performance in the following areas: Support High Achievement and Innovation Adequate funding, sufficient to meet national standards and incentives must be provided to States, local agencies, and national partners for high achievement and innovation. CSBG appropriations should include sufficient resources for local agen-cies, States, and national partners to engage in the work necessary to achieve the goals of the CSBG Act and the Promise of Community Action, which includes ad-dressing the needs of vulnerable people and building strong communities. It should create the opportunity to provide a consistent resource to the people, families and communities that benefit from the activities conducted under the Act. It should also provide funds to extend the work to create and test innovative approaches as well as include and engage an ever wider circle of partners. Support Coordination of Services NASCSP believes that a $710 million funding level for CSBG is essential for con- tinued innovation and stronger coordination. It will also maintain the stature of the CSBG in both State and Federal administrations. Further, adequate funds in the CSBG will create additional opportunities and development for low-income pro-grams and will allow for further coordination with agencies outside our Network that share a similar mission. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request the Committee to fund CSBG at the level of $710 million in fiscal year 2015 to support America's ongoing economic recovery and future economic stability. Maintaining CSBG funding is an investment in both strengthening our economy and in adapting our efforts to new realities for future generations of hard-working Americans. Thank you.

NACDS and the chain phar-macy industry are committed to partnering with Congress, HHS, patients, and other healthcare providers to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare services. NACDS represents traditional drug stores and supermarkets and mass merchants with pharmacies. Chains operate more than 40,000 pharmacies, and NACDS' 125 chain member companies include regional chains, with a minimum of four stores, and national companies. Chains employ more than 3.8 million individuals, including 175,000 pharmacists. They fill over 2.7 billion prescriptions yearly, and help pa-tients use medicines correctly and safely, while offering innovative services that im-prove patient health and healthcare affordability. NACDS members also include more than 800 supplier partners and nearly 40 international members representing 13 countries. For more information, visit www.NACDS.org. As the face of neighborhood healthcare, community pharmacies and pharmacists provide access to prescription medications and over-the-counter products, as well as cost-effective health services such as immunizations and disease screenings. Through personal interactions with patients, face-to-face consultations and conven-ient access to preventive care services, local pharmacists are helping to shape the healthcare delivery system of tomorrow\u2014in partnership with doctors, nurses and others. In recent years, retail community pharmacies have played an increasingly impor- tant role in providing patient care, including medication therapy management (MTM) and expanded immunization services. Moreover, policymakers have begun to recognize the vital role that local pharmacists can play in improving medication ad-herence. The role of appropriate medication use in lowering healthcare costs has been acknowledged by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO revised its methodology for scoring proposals related to Medicare Part D and found that for each 1 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries there is a corresponding decrease in overall Medicare spending. When projected to the en-tire population, this translates into a savings of $1.7 billion in overall healthcare costs, or a savings of $5.76 for every person in the U.S. for every 1 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled. 554 Congress has recognized the importance of pharmacist-provided services such as MTM by including it as a required offering in the Medicare Part D program. The experiences of Part D beneficiaries, as well as public and private studies, have con-firmed the effectiveness of pharmacist-provided MTM. A 2013 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report found that Part D MTM programs consistently and substantially improved medication adherence and quality of prescribing for evi-dence-based medications for beneficiaries with congestive heart failure, COPD, and diabetes. The study also found significant reductions in hospital costs, particularly when a comprehensive medication review (CMR) was utilized. This included savings of nearly $400 to $525 in overall hospitalization costs for beneficiaries with diabetes and congestive heart failure. The report also found that MTM can lead to reduced costs in the Part D program as well; showing that the best performing plan reduced Part D costs for diabetes patients by an average of $45 per patient. How and where MTM services are provided also impact its effectiveness. A study published in the January 2012 edition of Health Affairs identified the key role of retail pharmacies in providing MTM services. The study found that a pharmacy- based intervention program increased adherence for patients with diabetes and that the benefits were greater for those who received counseling in a retail, face-to-face setting as opposed to a phone call from a mail-order pharmacist. The study sug-gested that interventions such as in-person, face-to-face interaction between the re-tail pharmacist and the patient contributed to improved adherence behavior with a return on investment of 3 to 1. Since pharmacists have the proven ability to provide services that lead to better clinical outcomes and lower healthcare costs, we urge the implementation of budget proposals that allow all healthcare providers, including retail pharmacists, to prac-tice to their maximum capabilities, working in partnership to provide accessible, high quality care to patients. NACDS appreciates HHS's proposed goals to reduce healthcare costs and produce a more efficient healthcare system; however, we have concerns with some proposals contained in the fiscal year 2015 HHS Budget. HHS has proposed excluding brand and authorized generic drugs from the calculation of average manufacture price (AMP), thereby calculating Medicaid Federal Upper Limits (FULs) based only on ge-neric drug prices. While the goal of this provision may be to decrease Medicaid costs, we believe it may in fact reduce access to prescription drugs and pharmacy services for Medicaid patients, resulting in increased overall healthcare expendi-tures. Given that AMP has never been used as a basis for pharmacy reimbursement, and that AMP-based FULs remain in draft form, we believe the fiscal year 2015 budget provisions changing the calculation of FULs are premature. In fact, based on NACDS' most recent analysis, approximately 35 percent of the draft FULs are below National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC). This analysis confirms that additional efforts by CMS are necessary to ensure that pharmacies are not re-imbursed below their costs using the reimbursement formula created by the Afford-able Care Act. We urge CMS to utilize the rulemaking process to implement the Medicaid pharmacy provisions in a manner consistent with Congressional intent, rather than pursuing policies that would further cut pharmacy reimbursement. The fiscal year 2015 HHS Budget includes a proposal to limit Medicaid reimburse- ment of durable medical equipment (DME) to the rates paid by Medicare. Imple-menting a blanket proposal to reduce payment for Medicaid DME has the potential to disrupt access to DME and produce poorer health outcomes. This is particularly true in the case of diabetes testing supplies (DTS). Last year, CMS established a new Medicare single payment of $10.41 for DTS. This amount drastically decreased Medicare reimbursement by an average of 72 percent for retail pharmacies. The cur-rent reimbursement amount barely covers a pharmacy's costs-of-goods plus dis-pensing and counseling for these products and services. Reducing Medicaid reim-bursement for DTS to match the Medicare rate could similarly produce hardships for Medicaid beneficiaries in terms of reducing access to needed supplies and threat-ening the health of an already fragile population. NACDS urges CMS to refrain from making any changes to Medicaid reimbursement for DTS. The fiscal year 2015 budget also includes several provisions to increase the utili- zation of generic drugs. NACDS applauds the inclusion of these important provi-sions, which would encourage the use of generic medications by Medicare Low In-come Subsidy (LIS) beneficiaries, and promote generic competition for biologics. In-creasing generic utilization is one of the most effective ways of controlling prescrip-tion drug costs, and the generic dispensing rate of retail pharmacies\u201480 percent\u2014 is higher than any other practice setting. Finally, the fiscal year 2015 HHS Budget includes a number of proposals to cut waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including the abil-555 ity to suspend coverage and payment for questionable Part D prescriptions. NACDS applauds HHS for working to ensure that such activity does not exist in these Fed-eral programs. However, NACDS urges HHS to move forward in a cautious manner which does not disrupt beneficiary access or jeopardize beneficiary health. This can be done by ensuring that overly-burdensome requirements are not placed on pro-viders to the point that it interferes with the ability to treat and care for patients. NACDS thanks the Subcommittee for consideration of our comments. We look for- ward to working with policymakers and stakeholders on these important issues. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS Introduction Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and Distinguished Members of the Subcommittee: on behalf of health centers across the Nation, we wish to thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony for the committee to review as you craft the fiscal year 2015 Labor-Health and Human Services-Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. Health Centers- General Background Health Centers are community-owned and operated non-profit entities providing primary medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare as well as pharmacy and a vari-ety of enabling and support services. Today, there are over 1,200 health centers op-erating at more than 9,000 urban and rural communities nationwide. We are the ''healthcare home'' for more than 22 million patients in all 50 States and nearly every Congressional district. By statute and mission, health centers are located in medically underserved areas or serve a medically underserved population. Health centers are directed by patient- majority boards, a model which helps to ensure they are responsive to the needs of each individual community they serve. Health centers offer comprehensive care to all residents of the community who seek their care, regardless of ability to pay or insurance status and offer services on a sliding fee scale. Our unique model of care has enabled us to save the entire health system approximately $24 billion an-nually. Health Centers reduce preventable hospitalizations and Emergency Depart-ment use, as well as the need for more expensive specialty care. The services pro-vided at health centers save $1,263 per patient per year compared to expenditures for non-health center users. In addition to reducing costs, health centers also serve as small businesses and economic drivers in their communities. In 2012, health centers employed 153,000 in-dividuals and in 2009 generated $20 billion in total economic benefits in poor urban and rural communities. Fiscal year 2014 Funding Background In fiscal year 2014, health centers received a total of $3.7 billion in total Federal funding. This includes $1.49 billion in discretionary funding provided by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and $2.2 billion in mandatory fund-ing for health centers through the Health Center Fund. We want to thank the mem-bers of this Subcommittee for their support of health centers within the Consoli-dated Appropriations Act of 2014 to ensure health center funding continues to reach communities in need. Access to a Health Center Reduces Barriers to Primary Care NACHC's recently released a report entitled: Access is the Answer finds 62 mil- lion Americans lack regular access to primary care and the vast majority of these medically disenfranchised Americans actually have insurance coverage. Many indi-viduals still face barriers such as availability, affordability, and accessibility to pri-mary and preventive care. Even among people who have an insurance card, access may be out of reach because of who they are and where they live. As health reform changes the healthcare landscape, we know that demand for health centers will con-tinue to climb among the uninsured, underinsured and underserved due to the lack of other healthcare providers willing to see our patients. True ''access'' means having a regular, reliable source of quality preventive and primary healthcare and simply having an insurance card does not guarantee ready access to primary care. With our unique model of care, Health Centers can help ad-dress these primary care demands in a cost effective manner. However, Health Cen-ters cannot continue to deliver results without a sound financial base. 556 Fiscal year 2015 Funding Request and Health Center Funding Cliff In fiscal year 2015, Health Centers are respectfully requesting level discretionary funding of $1.49 billion for the Health Center program. Together with the $3.6 bil-lion in funding available in fiscal year 2015 through the mandatory Health Center Fund, health centers are requesting a total of $5.1 billion in total program funding. This funding for the Health Center program, which requires no new appropriation from this Subcommittee, should be fully utilized during fiscal year 2015 to increase access to primary care in medically underserved communities. With access to all available funding for the program in fiscal year 2015, Health Centers could build the capacity to serve up to 11 million new patients, both in new communities and through expanded services and capacity at existing health centers. In addition, ex-isting Health Centers could ensure they are keeping up with current patient de-mand. The President's proposed fiscal year 2015 Health Resources and Services Adminis- tration (HRSA) budget provides $1 billion in discretionary funding for the Health Centers program. Together with the $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2015 mandatory fund-ing available for health centers, under the President's proposal, health centers would receive a net increase of $960 million in total programmatic funding for fiscal year 2015 equaling total funding of $4.6 billion. Within this proposal, the President will allocate $860 million for one-time quality improvement and capital development awards and $100 million to fund new health center sites. We strongly oppose the President's proposed $500 million discretionary funding reduction for health centers as it further reduces the discretionary allocation for the program beyond the levels in place prior to the inception of the Health Center Fund. Health centers simply cannot survive further decreases to their base discretionary funding which undermines the long-term sustainability of the program, and may well threaten access for existing patients. We do appreciate the President's acknowledgement and recognition of the looming funding crisis for health centers upon the expiration of the Health Center Fund after fiscal year 2015. Under current law the Health Center Fund will end after fis-cal year 2015, resulting in as much as a 70 percent reduction in health center grant funding in fiscal year 2016. Averting the health center cliff is critical to ensuring that health centers remain financially viable and able to serve the diverse needs of their communities. However, the President only proposes a temporary (3 year) solu-tion reducing program funding down to fiscal year 2014 levels after a one-time in-crease in fiscal year 2015. Given the number of communities and individuals in need of access to healthcare, longer-term solutions must encompass both stability and ex-pansion of access to care. Conclusion We understand this Subcommittee must make difficult budgetary decisions as you work within the funding limits set for the subcommittee's bill. As the fiscal year 2015 appropriations process moves forward, we urge you to keep in mind that with-out their local health center, many individuals located in medically underserved communities will seek care in emergency departments and hospitals, often waiting until they are sicker get treatment. This will mean poorer health for these patients and much higher costs to the system. Health centers have continually proven to be a worthwhile investment by delivering high quality, affordable healthcare while generating savings to the entire health system in these communities. We are ex-tremely grateful for your past support and ask for the Subcommittee's continued support for the Health Center program. We look forward to working with you and thank you for your consideration. [This statement was submitted by Daniel R. Hawkins, Jr., Senior Vice President, Public Policy and Research.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY AND CITYHEALTH OFFICIALS The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) is the voice of the 2,800 local health departments across the country that work every day to ensure the safety of the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. On behalf of local health departments, NACCHO submits the following requests: Prevention and Public Health Fund In fiscal year 2015, NACCHO requests $1 billion for the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), a dedicated Federal investment in programs that prevent dis-ease at the community level. NACCHO wishes to thank Congress for allocating the 557 PPHF in fiscal year 2014 and setting specific funding levels to support the preven- tion of disease and promotion of health in communities across the Nation. CDC Public Health Emergency Preparedness NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to provide $675 million for the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) grant program in fiscal year 2015. PHEP protects communities by strengthening local and State public health department capacity to effectively respond to public health emergencies including terrorist threats, infec-tious disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and biological, chemical, nuclear, and ra-diological emergencies. These grants have been cut more than 30 percent since fiscal year 2007 with more than 55 percent of local health departments relying solely on Federal funds for emergency preparedness activities. NACCHO urges inclusion of language asking CDC to provide information on how much of the State PHEP grants are being allocated to local health departments and on what basis or formula each State is determining such allocations, including the method through which States reach statutorily-required concurrence with local health departments. Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to fund the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) at $300 million in fiscal year 2015 and restore some of the $104 million (35 percent) cut from the program in fiscal year 2014.. HPP supports health department preparedness coordinators to organize coalitions of public health and healthcare pro-viders to plan and prepare for public health emergencies, including medical surge following terrorist attacks, mass casualty incidents, an influenza pandemic or other infectious disease outbreak. NACCHO is concerned that the 35 percent cut to HPP in fiscal year 2014 will erode medical system preparedness, making communities across the country more vulnerable. NACCHO urges Congress to request informa-tion from Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) on how State HPP funding is distributed at the local level, including how much is being allocated to local health departments and on what basis or formula each State making such allocations. This information should be publicly available. CDC Section 317 Immunization Program NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to provide $650 million for the Section 317 Im- munization Program in fiscal year 2015. The Section 317 Immunization Program funds 50 States, six large cities and eight territories for vaccine purchase for at-need populations and immunization program operations, including support for imple-menting immunization billing systems at public health clinics to sustain high levels of vaccine coverage. NACCHO supports directing $8 million of the funding, as pro-posed in the President's Budget, to continue projects to facilitate billing by health departments of public and private insurance for covered immunization services. CDC Chronic Disease Prevention Partnerships to Improve Community Health (Community Prevention Grants) .\u2014 NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to provide $100 million to support continuation of the Partnerships to Improve Community Health program in fiscal year 2015, which supports implementation of evidence-based strategies to address heart at-tacks, strokes, cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases which contribute to the soaring cost of healthcare. Local health departments lead efforts to reduce tobacco use, increase physical activity and expand access to nutrition in order to reduce costly chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. NACCHO urges Congress to encourage CDC to conduct a comprehensive national evaluation of the program in-cluding recommendations for national qualitative and quantitative standards for quality preventive services and a report of how much of the funding was granted to the local level and to which eligible entities. Heart Disease and Stroke .\u2014NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to continue to sup- port Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention at $130 million in fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year 2014, Congress provided a $76 million increase for heart disease and stroke prevention and urged CDC to ensure that some portion of the increase in funding is sub-granted to the local level. The risk factors of obesity and smoking must be addressed at the community level to combat disease. Local health depart-ments who are experts on community needs and prevention interventions in the area of heart disease and stroke. Diabetes Prevention and Control .\u2014NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to continue to support Diabetes Prevention at $150 million in fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year 2014, Congress provided a $76 million increase for diabetes prevention and urged CDC to ensure that some portion of the increase in funding is sub-granted to the local level. Because evidence-based disease self-management programs are effective 558 at improving health, greater emphasis must be placed on enhancing the reach of these community level interventions. CDC Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant In fiscal year 2015, NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to continue to support the Preventive Health and Health Services (PHHS) Block Grant at $160 million. This unique funding gives States the flexibility to address State problems and provide similar support to local communities, while demonstrating the local, State, and na-tional impact of this investment. NACCHO urges Congress to encourage CDC to en-hance reporting and accountability for the PHHS Block Grant including providing capacity building to States for core public health capacities that may not be sup-ported through other CDC categorical funding streams. In order to make sure that funding supports the needs of local communities, local health departments should be full partners in developing State plans. CDC should also require States to report the funding allocation used to subgrant funds to local health departments and to encourage they include locals in their statewide planning efforts. CDC Food Safety NACCHO urges the Subcommittee to support CDC's Food Safety Program at $54 million in fiscal year 2015. Local and State health departments are an essential part of the process that ensures that food is safe to eat at home, at community events, in restaurants, and in schools. As the Subcommittee drafts the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS-Education Appropria- tions bill, NACCHO urges consideration of these recommendations for programs that protect the public's health and safety. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE DIRECTORS OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION CONSORTIUM Dear Chairman Mikulski, Ranking Member Shelby, Chairman Harkin and Rank- ing Member Moran: On behalf of the National Association of State Directors of Ca-reer and Technical Education Consortium (NASDCTEc), I am writing to urge the committee to support Career Technical Education (CTE) through a strong Federal investment in the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins). The passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 has helped to alleviate most of the harmful sequester cuts which have negatively impacted important Fed-eral investments in CTE programs through this legislation. However, our organiza-tion recognizes that there are still difficult decisions to be made regarding indi-vidual program funding levels in fiscal year 2015. To that end, NASDCTEc is re-questing that the committee restore funding for the Perkins Basic State Grant to at least $1.264 billion, equivalent to the pre-sequestration level of 2010, and make investing in Perkins a top priority in the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. Perkins is the principal source of Federal support for CTE programs at secondary and postsecondary institutions across the county. This Federal investment is crucial to ensuring that students have the academic, technical and employability skills that are needed for expanding fields like engineering, information technology, advanced manufacturing and healthcare. Perkins-funded CTE programs are working with business and industry partners to help fill positions that are available today, while preparing a qualified workforce for the careers of tomorrow. In a rapidly changing job market, CTE provides students with transferable skills that ensure they are col- lege-and career-ready, while offering retraining opportunities to many adult or dis-located workers. CTE produces a strong return on the Federal investment and has an unmistak- ably positive societal and economic impact. Students enrolled in CTE programs are more engaged, perform better academically and graduate at higher rates. CTE sup-ports the development of an educated and highly skilled workforce that provides a direct benefit to employers, while strengthening the economy through increased pro-ductivity and innovation. However, funding for CTE has not been immune to significant budget cuts over the past several years. The Perkins Act basic State grant program still remains ap-proximately $5 million below pre-sequestration levels. In addition to sequestration, funding for Perkins was reduced by over $140 million between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2012, dramatically reducing the capacity of CTE programs to offer aca-demically rigorous instruction and career training that is aligned to the needs of business and industry. Dozens of States are currently receiving funding allocations close to the levels they received in 1998. When taking into account inflation over this period, the relative investment in CTE through the Perkins Act has declined 559 considerably more. This erosion has hurt high schools, CTE centers, community and technical colleges, employers and millions of CTE students nationwide. This path-way of disinvestment in our Nation's CTE system is unsustainable\u2014 we cannot cut our way to a 21st century workforce! Instead, Perkins funding must be restored to meet the needs of CTE programs around the country and ensure students are fully prepared for their future academic and career goals. Thank you for your continued leadership in this difficult fiscal environment and for your thoughtful consideration during the appropriations process. NASDCTEc looks forward to working with the committee in a bipartisan fashion to restore fund-ing for CTE and support the millions of CTE students across the Nation.

The TBI Act programs are the only pro-grams providing Federal assistance to help States with developing an array of reha-bilitation, home and community-based services and other short-term and long-term supports specific to the cognitive and behavioral needs of individuals with TBI and their families. These programs are designed to restore and improve functioning and assist individuals to return to school, engage in employment and to live as inde-pendently as possible. To assist States in improving and expanding service delivery, NASHIA recommends the following: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Injury Center The CDC National Injury Center supports State TBI registries, surveillance, data collection and analysis; State and local prevention interventions to address falls re-lated, motor vehicle related, and sports-related injuries, including concussions (mild TBI); as well as educates primary clinicians and other professionals to be able to identify, diagnose and manage TBIs appropriately and effectively. NASHIA recommends an increase in funding for the CDC TBI Program in the amount of $10 million to address the expanding population of TBI. CDC's National Injury Center is the primary Federal agency responsible for trans- lating science into effective programs and policies to prevent and minimize the con-sequences of TBI when they occur. Through its funded programs and activities, the Injury Center works with national organizations, Federal agencies, State health agencies, and other key groups to develop, implement, and promote effective injury and violence prevention and control practices. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Federal TBI Program NASHIA recommends $12 million total for the HRSA TBI Federal Program, which is split by HRSA between two programs: HRSA Federal TBI State Grant Program and the HRSA Federal TBI Protection & Advocacy (P&A) Systems Grant Program. HRSA Federal TBI State Grant Program Since 1997, HRSA has awarded grants to 48 States, District of Columbia and one Territory, although not concurrently, to develop and improve services and systems to address the short-term and long-term needs. These grants have been time limited and are relatively small. Five years ago, HRSA increased the amount of the award from approximately $100,000 to $250,000 to make it more feasible for States to carry out their grant goals and the legislative intent. While this increased amount is more attractive to States, this change reduced the number of grantees to 21\u2014 less than half of the States and Territories receive funding. As a result, States that do not have Federal grant funding are finding it increasingly difficult to sustain their previous efforts, let alone expand and improve service delivery, due to other budget constraints within their States. Therefore, NASHIA recommends: $8 million in total for the HRSA Federal TBI State Grant Program to increase the number of State grant awards. Over the course of the grant program, States have developed State plans and im- plemented initiatives for improving service delivery; information & referral systems; service coordination systems; outreach and screening among unidentified popu-560 lations such as children, victims of domestic violence, and veterans; and training programs for direct care workers and other staff. States have conducted public awareness and educational activities that have helped States to leverage and coordi-nate funding in order to maximize resources within States to the benefit of individ-uals with TBI. While NASHIA is well aware that Federal funds are becoming increasingly dif- ficult to obtain, NASHIA is recommending increased funding for the Federal TBI Act programs because: \u2014The number of Americans who sustain a TBI is increasing, especially among older adults and young children, and among our men and women in uniform as a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u2014All States have enacted legislation to develop return to play guidelines with re- gard to sports-related concussions among our youth. Two States have recently expanded their laws to include ''return to learn'' guidelines to help with the identification of TBI and appropriate accommodations and related educational assistance that may be needed after a mild TBI (concussion) in order to be suc-cessful academically. Through these efforts, children and youth are now being identified and screened for potential assistance. \u2014State budgets have not been able to keep up with the demand for services. HRSA Federal TBI Protection & Advocacy (P&A) Systems Grant Program HRSA also administers the Federal TBI P&A Systems Grant Program which is a formula-based program that allows 57 States, Territories, and the Native Amer-ican Protection and Advocacy Project to assess their State P&A Systems' responsive-ness to TBI issues and provide advocacy support to individuals with TBI and their families. Together, P&As comprise the Nation's largest provider of legally based ad-vocacy services for people with disabilities. To further the work of the P&As, NASHIA recommends: $4 million in total be appropriated to increase the amount of grant awards adminis- tered by HRSA Federal TBI P&A Systems Grant Program. The TBI Act, which was last reauthorized in 2008, is due for reauthorization. TBI stakeholders are working with key Congressional leaders to extend authorization of appropriations for these critical programs. In addition: NASHIA recommends transferring the HRSA TBI State Grant and P&A programs to the Administration for Community Living to maximize resources to support the array of services and supports needed following a brain injury. Transferring the TBI State Grant and P&A Grant programs within ACL would: \u2014Integrate TBI into the HHS long-term services initiatives, which also rely on Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) as the entry point into these systems; \u2014Promote collaboration with the Administration on Aging (AoA) on falls related TBIs among older adults; \u2014Include TBI in the veterans initiatives between HHS and Department of Vet- erans Affairs to support Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) for vet-erans and returning servicemembers coordinated by the ACL's Office of Dis-ability and Aging Policy's Office of Integrated Programs; \u2014Coordinate and enhance services for individuals with TBI who could benefit from the ACL's Administration on Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (AIDD) initiatives to improve education, transition services, employment out-comes and self-advocacy for children and youth; and \u2014Include TBI in the Office of Disability and Aging Policy's Office of Integrated Policy initiatives (i.e. Lifespan Respite Care Program, Participant Direction Pro-gram, Evidenced-Based Care Transitions, and Transportation Research and Demonstration Program). In keeping with the Olmstead decision, States are taking advantage of Federal initiatives and opportunities to expand community long-term services options. Un-fortunately, most States focus on the traditional populations of I/DD, physical dis-abilities, aging and mental health and are omitting TBI in their long-term care ini-tiatives. This leaves individuals with TBI with little options, other than nursing fa-cilities or other segregated living programs, for assistance with activities of daily liv-ing and residential or housing needs. We believe that aligning the Federal TBI State Grant Program with these other programs will help address these concerns. About the National Association of State Head Injury Administrators (NASHIA) NASHIA is a non-profit organization representing and assisting State govern- mental officials who administer an array of short-term and long-term rehabilitation and community services and supports for individuals with TBI and their families. 561 Since 1990, NASHIA has held an annual State-of-the-States conference, and has served as a resource to State TBI program managers and others seeking public pro-grams and services. Membership also includes associate members who are profes-sionals, provider agencies, State affiliates of the Brain Injury Association of America (BIAA) or U.S. Brain Injury Alliance, family members and individuals with TBI. Over the past 30 years, States have initiated efforts to develop capacity for offer- ing information and referral services, service coordination, rehabilitation, in-home support, personal care, counseling, transportation, housing, vocational and other support services for persons with TBI and their families. These services vary in size and scope across the country and even within a State. Twenty-four States have en-acted legislation to assess fines or surcharges to traffic related offenses or other criminal offenses and/or assessed additional fees to motor vehicle registration or drivers license to generate funding for TBI programs and services, generally re-ferred to as trust fund programs. About the same number of States have imple-mented TBI Home and Community-Based Medicaid Waiver Programs with twelve States having the advantage of administering both a trust fund and waiver pro-gram. These programs are administered by State public health, Vocational Rehabili-tation, mental health, Medicaid, intellectual disabilities, education or social services agencies within the States. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE LONG-TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS I am pleased to present this testimony on behalf of residents and tenants residing in Iowa's long-term care facilities in collaboration with the National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs (NASOP). This statement and the fol-lowing funding recommendations for fiscal year 2015 for the Long-Term Care Om-budsman Programs administered through the Administration for Community Living (ACL) is submitted for the record. \u2014$5 million authorized under the Elder Justice Act for Long-Term Care Ombuds- man Program (LTCOP) services and training to fight elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation; \u2014$16.83 million authorized under Title VII of the Older Americans Act for LTCOPs to restore funding back to the fiscal year 2011 level; \u2014$20 million for LTCOP services in assisted living facilities; and \u2014$1 million authorized under Title II of the Older Americans Act for the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center (NORC). NASOP, formed in 1985 as a non-profit organization, is composed of state long- term care ombudsmen representing their State programs created by the Older Americans Act (OAA). The primary function of the LTCOP in the Federal OAA is to identify, investigate, and resolve complaints that relate to action, inaction or deci-sions that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of residents of long-term care facilities. Ombudsman representatives work with the consent and at the direction of residents in the resolution of their problems. They visit residents living in nursing homes and residential care homes. Ombudsman representatives ask them about problems or concerns they have and if they need or want our help to resolve these issues. Ombudsman representatives act as their advocates. We strongly believe that our work not only improves the quality of life for millions of long-term care facility residents, but also saves Medicare and Medicaid resources by avoiding unnecessary costs associated with poor quality care. Nationally, n Federal fiscal year 2012, over 11,000 volunteers, including 8,712 in- dividuals certified to investigate complaints, and 1,180 staff served in 573 local LTCOPs. Ombudsmen investigated and worked to resolve 193,650 complaints made by 126,398 individuals. Ombudsmen were able to resolve or partially resolve 73 per-cent, or almost three out of every four complaints investigated. In addition, ombuds-men provided information on rights, care and related services 405,589 times. Iowa's LTCOP is responsible for advocating for 53,287 residents and tenants re- siding within 844 long-term care facilities. The Iowa Office of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman consists of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman; 8 Local Long-Term Care Ombudsman; 2 Volunteer Coordinators; numerous volunteers, and an Adminis-trative Assistant. Currently, the Federal funding for our program only fully funds two (2) of the twelve (12) paid positions. In Federal fiscal year 2013, Iowa's LTCOP received 1,174 complaints by or on be- half of residents and tenants; directly served 3,226 residents and tenants; provided 4,445 hours of advocacy services beyond complaint handling; and provided 5,360 consultations, education sessions, visits, and other activities. Our office advocates 562 for 53, 287 residents/tenants in 844 facilities and we do this with just a few staff. We are grateful for the staffing that we do have, but feel that our efforts are just a drop in the bucket. According to two national studies from the Institute of Medi-cine and the Bader Report, the national recommendation for States to follow is 1 long-term care ombudsman for 2,000 beds or people. With the current number of long-term care ombudsman staff in Iowa, our ombudsmen are serving 6,661 beds or people. Iowa would need a total of 27 local long-term care ombudsmen to fully meet this Federal recommendation. This would ensure that all individuals residing in long-term care would have immediate access to an advocate who can represent their interests. We understand that this Subcommittee faces a strained financial situation, but a continued commitment to Ombudsman programs advocating for the healthcare needs and safety of millions of older adults living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the Nation should remain a high priority. Since 1978, the LTCOP has been a core program of the OAA. It is the only program in the OAA that specifically serves residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities. We all appreciate and value the importance of living in one's own home. The OAA pro-vides critically needed home and community based services that often delay institu-tionalization. However, some elders can no longer live safely in their own homes and must move at some point in their lives to either an assisted living facility or a nurs-ing home. These residents are usually frail and extremely vulnerable and rely on the advocacy services of the LTCOP. Demand for our services and advocacy is growing. The number of complex and very troubling cases that long-term care ombudsmen investigate has been steadily increasing. In addition, there continues to be a disturbing increase in the frequency and severity of citations for egregious regulatory violations by long-term care pro-viders. These violations put facility residents in immediate jeopardy of harm. This trend suggests a frightening decline in the quality of long-term care services. Om-budsmen are needed now more than ever in nursing homes, board and care facili-ties, and in assisted living communities. As well, the demand placed on the program by the need to assist residents who are relocating from long-term care facilities that are downsizing or closing their doors continues to complicate ombudsman programs' daily operations. Administrators in many long-term care facilities have recognized the value and benefit of having ombudsmen assist with staff training and consultation and this form of outreach has also placed an increasing strain on available advocacy re-sources. In order to improve advocacy and services available to residents of long- term care facilities, NASOP recommends, and the Iowa Office of the State Long- Term Care Ombudsman supports, several augmentations to appropriations that support the work of LTCOP. NASOP requests $5 million to support the work of the LTCOP under the Elder Justice Act. This appropriation would allow States to hire additional staff and lever-age that staff to recruit additional volunteers to help support the investigation of complaints of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of residents of nursing home and as-sisted living facilities. NASOP request $16.83 million authorized under Title VII of the Older Americans Act for LTCOPs to restore funding back to the fiscal year 2011 level. Programs in every district and State are suffering from recent cuts. These funds would help in a partial way to restore our reduced ability to visit residents in nursing homes. NASOP requests $20 million to support 333 additional Ombudsman salaried staff at an estimated $60,000 average annual salary/fringe benefits and necessary staff training. The requests adds new ombudsman positions specifically dedicated to pro-viding Ombudsman services to residents of assisted living facilities and other com-munity-based long- term care delivery systems, which currently suffer from a sig-nificant lack of personnel resources around the country. Finally, NASOP wants to acknowledge the importance and value of the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center (NORC). The NORC provides valu-able and reliable technical assistance, training, and support to State and local LTCOPs. NASOP requests an appropriation of $1 million to support the work of the NORC in providing training and technical assistance to State and local LTCOPs. Congress funds the NORC at $550,000 per year; the very same level of funding it has received since 1993. This request adds $450,000 to the line item for the NORC, which is such a critical component of the ombudsman program. The NORC plays an integral role in assuring the overall effectiveness of LTCOPs across the country through its train-ing, educational materials, data analysis, and best practices efforts. Overall, Ombudsmen offer valuable consumer protections to residents and provide a voice for those unable to speak for themselves. Every day in America, 10,000 more 563 persons reach the age of 65 years. With a rapidly growing older population, LTCOPs can continue to enhance the quality of life, improve the level of care, protect the individual's rights and promote the dignity of Americans across the Nation. On behalf of residents, tenants and State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen across this Nation, thank you for this opportunity to share these requests for support of this important program that protects the health, safety, welfare, and rights of vul-nerable older adults and persons with disabilities. We ask that you thoughtfully con-sider our detailed request for funding in fiscal year 2015. [This statement was submitted by Deanna Clingan-Fischer, JD, Iowa State Long- Term Care Ombudsman.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATES UNITED FOR AGING AND DISABILITIES Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran: Thank you to for the opportunity to submit this testimony. As you work to develop fiscal year 2015 funding priorities, the National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities (NASUAD) urges you to consider the Administration for Community Living's (ACL) fiscal year 2015 request for $25 million to address the all-too prevalent problem of elder abuse. This investment would support initial implementation of the Elder Justice Act's (EJA) Adult Protective Services (APS), research, and evaluation activities. NASUAD represents the 56 officially designated State and territorial agencies on aging and disabilities. Each of our members oversees the implementation of the Older Americans Act (OAA), and many also serve as the operating agency in their State for Medicaid waivers that serve older adults and individuals with disabilities. Together with our members, we work to design, improve, and sustain State systems delivering home and community based services and supports for people who are older or have a disability, and their caregivers. According to ACL, an estimated 2.1 million older Americans are victims of elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation each year. As the Nation's older population increases, so too does the incidence of elder abuse. While there is no single set of national elder abuse prevalence data, the number of reported cases is on the rise. A 2004 national survey of State APS programs showed a 16 percent increase in the number of elder abuse cases from an identical study conducted in 2000. Additionally, an overwhelming number of cases of abuse, neglect, and exploitation go undetected and untreated each year. Experts estimate that for every case of elder abuse or neglect reported, as many as five cases go unreported. Despite the clear and growing need, there is no dedicated Federal funding for, or corresponding Federal oversight of, elder abuse prevention services. Absent a na-tional framework, States have been left to address this issue independently from one another, and must rely on multiple funding streams to support their work, ulti-mately resulting in a fragmented system. Though each State has developed an APS program that responds to reports of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, these pro-grams vary greatly from State to State\u2014from the populations they serve, to the re-porting mechanisms they use, and the budget structures under which they operate. These discrepancies, which continue to be exacerbated by the absence of Federal APS funding, necessarily impede efforts to compare, evaluate, and improve State ap-proaches to reducing and preventing elder abuse. To address the systemic inadequacies in our Nation's approach to eradicating elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, we urge you to support ACL's request of $25 million in discretionary funding to implement the EJA in fiscal year 2015. This crit-ical funding would be used to develop much-needed program standards and data col-lection efforts, as well as to support the implementation of a nationwide APS data system; these dollars would also fund research activities, including efforts to trans-late promising interventions from other violence prevention areas to elder abuse, and evaluations of the effectiveness of these interventions. NASUAD believes that efforts to improve the response to, awareness of, and inter- vention in elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation could be more effectively coordi-nated through the establishment of a national APS program. Accordingly, we urge you to fully fund the Elder Justice Initiative in fiscal year 2015. Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on this critical issue, and for your leadership. NASUAD looks forward to working with all of you to preserve the dig-nity, independence, and health of older adults, and to protect those who may no longer be able to protect themselves. 564 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL BLOOD CLOTALLIANCE The National Blood Clot Alliance (NBCA) is pleased to submit this statement in support of increased appropriations for fiscal year 2015 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Division of Blood Disorders, a component of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. NBCA's state-ment addresses the programs specific to blood clots, known scientifically as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE), a major public health prob-lem facing this Nation. Combined, these disorders are known as venous thrombo-embolism (VTE). Preventing death and disability from VTE is an important public health priority, and the Division is responsible for all CDC activities related to blood clots and other bleeding disorders. NBCA asks the Subcommittee to restore funding for the Division to its fiscal year 2010 level, $19.9 million. The fiscal year 2014 funding has dropped precipitously to $13 million. Of this, support for blood clot prevention has been cut in half, to a mere $560,000, hardly enough to make a dent in a major public health problem that an-nually kills more Americans than AIDS, breast cancer and motor vehicle accidents combined. NBCA further requests that the Subcommittee establish a budget line item specific to blood clots and clotting disorders and that $4 million be appro-priated for this line each year for the next 5 years. Funding this program at the requested level will be a major step in advancing the Surgeon General's 2008 ''Call to Action to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE)'' and the Nation's ''Healthy People 2020 Objectives.'' The urgency of this request is underscored by the fact that the great majority of blood clots could be prevented. We have the tools to do that, but the resources to deploy them are woefully inadequate. Blood clots are the leading cause of unnecessary hospital readmissions in the U.S., costing our Nation an estimated $10 billion dollars in avoidable healthcare expenses annually. According to the American Public Health Association, DVT deaths are the most common preventable cause of hospital death. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine recently reported that as many as 70 percent of healthcare associated VTE could be eliminated with the application of improved pre-vention protocols. Other targeted population-based prevention tools can be applied to avert disability and death from blood clots due to aging, lengthy travel, immo-bility, obesity and other risk factors. The National Blood Clot Alliance Founded in 2003, NBCA is a patient led non-profit, voluntary health organization dedicated to advancing the prevention, early diagnosis and successful treatment of life-threatening blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and clot-provoked stroke. We work on behalf of people who have or could be susceptible to blood clots, including, but not limited to, people with clotting disorders, atrial fi-brillation, cancer, traumatic injury, and risks related to surgery, lengthy immobility, child birth and birth control. NBCA accomplishes its mission through programs that build public awareness, educate patients and healthcare professionals and promote supportive public and private sector policy. Our content is reviewed by an inter-nationally recognized Medical and Scientific Advisory Board. We invite the Members of the Subcommittee to visit our website at www.stoptheclot.org to learn more about blood clots and the programs of NBCA. Who Has Blood Clots and What Are They? No American is immune from life-threatening blood clots, regardless of age, gen- der, race, ethnicity or health status. Normal blood clots play an important role in protecting our health because they stop bleeding from a cut or wound. However, blood clots can also form abnormally, causing a heart attack, stroke, or other serious medical problems. Experts estimate that two million Americans suffer such venous and arterial blood clots every year. More than 200,000 Americans die from them an-nually. An often silent killer, death can be sudden with no forewarning. But in most instances, the damage can be averted or contained. Age, smoking, obesity can all contribute to clotting risk, but so can birth control or pregnancy or cancer. Even prominent athletes in peak physical condition have suffered career- ending, life -threatening clots. It can happen to any of us. In fact, the memories of former U.S. Reps. Walter Capps (D-CA) and Jennifer Dunn (R-WA), who died due to blood clots while serving in Congress, motivated the creation of National Blood Clot Awareness Month in March of 2009. Physicians estimate that as little as 20 percent of blood clots are actually recog- nized for what they are. Misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are all too common and all too often fatal. The general public is even farther behind, with surveys showing that nearly three quarters of the population has little or no knowledge about blood 565 clots, their risks, their signs and symptoms and their prevention. The Government must play a greater role in educating the general public, people who are at special risk and health professionals. This is the ''low hanging fruit'' of public health pre-vention that has yet to be adequately picked and the return on invest can be tens of thousands of lives saved and billions of dollars in unnecessary healthcare ex-penses avoided! The Federal Government Has a Vital Role in Meeting this Acknowledged Public Health Priority Many Federal agencies play important roles in the effort to reduce death and dis- ability from blood clots and clotting disorders. The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation support the work of basic scientists in their efforts to understand the causes and effects of blood clots and identify improved treat-ments. The VA also supports research in this field and strives to prevent blood clots in the special population of Americans it serves. The Agency for Healthcare Re-search and Quality in 2001 was among the first to recognize that blood clot preven-tion in hospitals was our best opportunity for patient safety improvement. The Part-nership for Patients makes made blood clot prevention a key component of improved hospital care. CMS includes surgery-related blood clot prevention as a key measure of hospital quality. DOD has examined how blood clots can be prevented in the mili-tary, affecting soldiers who must often live in cramped conditions, suffer dehydra-tion and experience bone fractures and more severe injuries that require surgery. Each of these agencies plays a special role in the effort to reduce clotting death and injury. However, the CDC, the Nation's leading prevention agency, is the one best suited to guide and coordinate Federal efforts targeted at populations more broadly. No other agency possesses its unique capabilities in public health outreach, education and promotion. Regrettably the agency best suited for leadership is the one with the fewest resources. NBCA believes it is imperative that Congress act now to provide adequate, sustained funding for this specific activity at CDC\u2014the reduc-tion of death and disability due to blood clots. The funding request presented at the beginning of this statement will provide CDC with the resources it needs to begin seriously to meet this public health chal-lenge. fiscal year 2014 funding for blood clot programs is only $560,000, half of what was available in the last fiscal year. The Administration's proposed fiscal year 2015 budget would make no change to this level. The current funding situation for the Blood Disorders Division has already forced CDC to cut or curtail the few programs it has been able to support. These include two pilot programs to improve commu-nity-based VTE surveillance and evaluation; one focused on healthcare provider edu-cation; one targeted at women's health (e.g., blood clots are the leading cause of ma-ternal mortality); and a collaboration with the VA and academia to develop new VTE surveillance tools. Staffing of the Division has also been cut nearly in half, de-creasing by 18 FTEs, including essential personnel with specialized laboratory, IT and analytic skills. At a time when this public health problem is growing, we have allowed even the small investment in CDC to address it become further negligible. This is neither thoughtful public policy nor wise economically. NBCA believes that our citizens deserve better and that Federal support for this acknowledged public health priority should be equal to the task. Tragically, it is not at present. NBCA urges the Subcommittee to take the lead in making the changes needed to provide CDC with the funds it needs to combat this major public health issue\u2014blood clots, clotting disorders and the ensuing disability that consumes far too many lives and dollars in the U.S. unnecessarily. [This statement was submitted by Joseph C. Isaacs, Chief Executive Officer, Na- tional Blood Clot Alliance.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES The National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCLD) works to ensure that the Nation's 60 million children, adolescents and adults with learning disabilities and attention issues have every opportunity to succeed in school, work and life. NCLD asks you to consider our request as you work on the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. As you begin work on the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill, we urge you to support continued funding for special education at the President's request level of $11.57 billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the President's $100 million for Results Driven Accountability Incentive Grants which would provide competitive grants to States to implement promising, evidence-based reforms that would improve service 566 1Cortiella, Candace and Horowitz, Sheldon H.

Publication forthcoming. 3Cortiella & and Horowitz (2014). delivery for children with disabilities while building State and local capacity to im- prove long\u2014term outcomes for those children We also urge you to support funding for the National Technical Assistance Center within the Higher Education Opportunity Act (Section 777(a)) at $2 million to pro-vide useful and comprehensive information to students with disabilities on the choices available to them in higher education and to provide much-needed training, technical assistance, and professional development to institutes of higher education. IDEA Part B Grants to States & Results Driven Accountability Incentive Grants Currently, there are over 6.5 million children eligible for special education serv- ices under the disability categories of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The comprehensive assessment and support services authorized by IDEA help to close the academic achievement gap and ensure a meaningful edu-cation for every student. We owe it to all students to provide a quality education that will help them graduate and enter successful careers. We support the Administration's request that would maintain funding for IDEA, Part B (Grants to States program) at $11.57 billion, which the Administration esti- mates would provide $1,758 per child for an estimated 6.6 million students with dis-abilities. Additionally we support the President's $100 million for Results Driven Ac-countability Incentive Grants, which would provide competitive grants to States to implement promising, evidence-based reforms that would improve service delivery for children with disabilities. We encourage innovation in the realm of service deliv-ery to students receiving special education and believe that these grants have the potential to spark innovative ideas and a renewed focused on improved outcomes for students. The National Technical Assistance Center In the HEA reauthorization of 2008, Congress authorized the establishment of National Center for Information and Technical Support for Postsecondary Students with Disabilities. This Center was intended to serve three primary purposes: (1) serve as a resource to parents and students with disabilities on the services avail-able at various IHEs; (2) serve as a technical assistance center to IHEs and provide training to faculty and staff on how to improve services for students with disabil-ities; and (3) serve as an online database for the collection and dissemination of a variety of disability-related information for students with disabilities who are inter-ested in higher education. Though the Center was authorized, it has never been funded. How Students with Disabilities are Faring in Higher Education In recent years, due to the services provided to students with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) or Section 504 of the Re-habilitation Act, students with learning and attention issues have graduated from high school at higher rates than ever before. In fact, a majority (54 percent) of stu-dents with learning disabilities have the goal to attend a 2- or 4-year college. 1Stu- dents with learning disabilities make up the largest population of students with dis-abilities who attend postsecondary schools, at 69 percent of all students with dis-abilities in postsecondary programs. 2 Unfortunately, students with disabilities are not attending postsecondary edu- cation programs at the same rate as students in the general population. In the gen-eral education population, within 4 years of graduating high school, 53 percent of students continue on to postsecondary education programs, compared to only 45 per-cent of youth with disabilities. Even worse, young adults with learning disabilities (LD) attend four-year colleges at half the rate of the general population. 3Students with disabilities would benefit from better outreach, recruitment, and assistance programs to bridge the gap between high school and postsecondary education pro-grams. Comprehensive information on higher education programs and services is needed now more than ever. With more students with disabilities setting goals of attending college but few actually enrolling and completing college programs, it is critical that they have access to the information and support services they need. 567 4For more information on the survey conducted by NCLD and the IHEs we surveyed to find this data, please contact us. 5Newman, L., Wagner, M., Knokey, A.-M., Marder, C., Nagle, K., et al.

Menlo Park, CA: SRI International. 6Cortiella & and Horowitz (2014). 7Newman, Wagner, Knokey, Marder, et al. (2011). The Lack of Comprehensive Information on Post-Secondary Education Programs The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has made efforts to improve parent and student access to timely and useful information regarding colleges and universities through the development of the College Navigator. The Department of Education collects data from IHEs through Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) surveys, including data on enrollment, program completion, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid. The data is made available to students and parents via College Navigator\u2014a public website that allows users to perform a search of colleges. The data and information provided through the College Navigator\u2014has the potential to support and improve rates of transition for all young adults from high school into the postsecondary set-ting. However, this information alone is not enough to ensure a smooth transition for students with disabilities into their postsecondary education programs. NCLD has conducted its own survey of the information provided by IHEs on Col- lege Navigator. College Navigator provides a place for every IHE to provide informa-tion on the disability services offered at the institution. We examined the responses that nearly 400 institutions submitted, including private, public, and for profit insti-tutions as well as community colleges. Only 6 of the institutions surveyed listed any information to students and the public regarding disability services. 4 The Need for a Smoother Transition to Post-Secondary Programs Research shows that students with disabilities are getting less support in college than in high school, despite wishing they had more assistance. Even though 87 per-cent of students with disabilities received some type of accommodation or support in high school, that number drops off sharply when students with disabilities enter college, decreasing to only 19 percent of students who receive accommodations or support. 5For students with learning disabilities, 17 percent of young adults receive accommodations and supports in postsecondary education compared with 94 percent in high school. 6Of the many students who did not receive any help at all, 43 per- cent felt that it would have been helpful to receive assistance.7We know that self- advocacy is one of the keys to student success, but it is clear that students are not aware of their rights and responsibilities, are not adequately prepared to advocate for themselves, and are not provided adequate transition assistance to be successful in postsecondary education programs. The Purpose of the National Technical Assistance Center We recognize that providing useful and comprehensive information to parents and students on the choices available is not an easy task. Therefore, we recommend funding the National Technical Assistance Center, found in the 2008 authorization of HEA, at $2 million. The Center would serve several key purposes: (1) providing information and resources to students and parents on disability services and pro-grams at IHEs; (2) providing training and technical assistance to IHEs; (3) pro-viding training and professional development to faculty and staff at IHEs; and (4) information collection and dissemination on best practices, documentation require-ments, financial aid, services available, policies, and accessible instructional mate-rials. We urge you to continue your investment in students with disabilities through funding of IDEA and the RDA grants and support funding in fiscal year 2015 for the National Technical Assistance Center. Thank you for your consideration of our request. [This statement was submitted by Lindsay E. Jones, Esq., Director, Public Policy & Advocacy, National Center for Learning Disabilities.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL CHILDREN 'SFACILITIES NETWORK Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and distinguished Members of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies: Thank you for the opportunity to offer written testimony on the Administration's fiscal year 2015 Budget Request for the Department of Health 568 and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families. I write on behalf of the National Children's Facilities Network (NCFN) to express support for the funding of Head Start, Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships and other pro-grams that provide access to high quality early care and education. These initiatives are critical to ensuring that all children, especially low-income children, are given a strong start and the tools necessary to succeed in life. As you make important funding decisions about programs that provide children with the opportunity to ob-tain an early start on the pathway to success, we encourage you to recognize the critical role that early childhood facilities play in preparing young children for achievement in school and in life, and support Federal policies that adequately fi-nance the acquisition, construction, and improvement of these spaces. NCFN is a national coalition of nonprofit organizations that provide financing, technical assistance and training on the design, development and financing of early care and education facilities in low-income communities throughout the country. We see the positive impact of high quality early learning on children's lives and on the future economic health and development of neighborhoods. Our coalition also recog-nizes the importance of the spaces where these programs take place. A growing body of research shows that a well-designed, well-equipped physical environment sup-ports learning and good outcomes for children, while a poorly adapted and over-crowded space undermines it. For example, bathrooms adjacent to classrooms, acces-sible cubbies, and child-sized sinks, counters, furnishings and fixtures increase chil-dren's autonomy and competence while decreasing the demands on teachers. Infants, toddlers, and young children should be educated and cared for in high quality physical spaces that meet their needs and complement high quality pro-grams. Federal programs focused on improving families' access to high quality early care and education options should include adequate funding for the acquisition, con-struction, and improvement of facilities. Thank you for your leadership on these issues. Please consider us as a resource as you advance early childhood policies. If you would like additional information about our work, please contact Karen O'Mansky, Center for Community Self-Help, Chair, National Children's Facilities Network. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF AMERICAN INDIANS On behalf of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), this testimony addresses programs in the Departments of Education and Labor and the Corpora-tion for Public Broadcasting. NCAI also supports the testimony of the National In-dian Child Welfare Association, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, and the National Indian Education Association. NCAI is the oldest and largest American Indian organization in the United States. Tribal leaders created NCAI in 1944 as a response to termination and assimilation policies that threatened the ex-istence of American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. Since then, NCAI has fought to preserve the treaty rights and sovereign status of tribal governments, while also ensuring that Native people may fully participate in the political system. As the most representative organization of American Indian tribes, NCAI serves the broad interests of tribal governments across the Nation. Department of Education Investing in the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students is not only one most of the most important cornerstones of the Federal trust responsibility to tribes, but is also critical strategy for creating jobs and securing the Nation's fu-ture prosperity in today's challenging economic climate. Education provides tribal economies with a more highly-skilled workforce while also directly spurring eco-nomic development and job creation. The profound value of education for Native Na-tions extends beyond just economics, however. Education drives personal advance-ment and wellness, which in turn improves social welfare and empowers commu-nities\u2014elements that are essential to maintaining tribes' cultural vitality and to protecting and advancing tribal sovereignty. Despite the enormous potential of education for transforming tribal communities, Native education is in a state of emergency. American Indian and Alaska Native students lag far behind their peers on every educational indicator, from academic achievement to high school and college graduation rates. For example, in 2011, only 18 percent of Native fourth graders and 22 percent of Native eighth graders scored proficient or advanced in reading, and only 22 percent of Native fourth graders and 569 1National Indian Education Study 2011, NCES 2012-466. National Center for Education Sta- tistics, Institute of Education Sciences, United States Department of Education. 2School Year 2010-2011 4-Year Regulatory Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates, Department of Education. 17 percent of Native eighth graders scored proficient or advanced in math.1The cri- sis of Indian education is perhaps most apparent in the Native high school dropout rate, which is not only one of the highest in the country, but is also above 50 per-cent in many of the States with high Native populations. 2 Title I, Part A Local Education Agency Grants\u2014Provide $25 billion for Title I, Part A .\u2014Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides critical financial assistance to local educational agencies and schools with high percentages of children from low-income families that ensure all children meet challenging State academic standards. Currently, there are over 600,000 Native students across the country with nearly 93 percent of those students attending non-Federal institutions, such as traditional public schools in rural and urban locations. A drastic increase in funding to counter annual inflation and sequestration is necessary to meet the needs of Native students and students from low-income families. Impact Aid\u2014Provide $2 billion for Impact Aid, Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) .\u2014Impact Aid provides direct payments to public school districts as reimbursements for the loss of traditional property taxes due to a Federal presence or activity, including the existence of an Indian reservation. With nearly 93 percent of Native students enrolled in public schools, Impact Aid provides essential funding for schools serving Native students. In fiscal year 2014, Impact Aid saw an increase of $64 million over fiscal year 2013 that restored most of the destructive sequestration cuts tribal communities faced in Indian Country. In order to ensure Native students have access to education, however, Impact Aid must be fully funded at $2 billion. Furthermore, Impact Aid should be converted to a for-ward-funded program to eliminate the need for cost transfers and other funding issues at a later date. Title VII (Indian Education Formula Grants)\u2014Provide $198 million for Title VII of the ESEA .\u2014This grant funding is designed to supplement the regular school pro- gram and assist Native students so they have the opportunity to achieve the same educational standards and attain equity with their non-Native peers. Title VII pro-vides funds to school divisions to support American Indian, Alaska Native, and Na-tive Hawaiian students in meeting State standards. Furthermore, Title VII funds support early-childhood and family programs, academic enrichment programs, cur-riculum development, professional development, and culturally-related activities. Currently, funding for Title VII only reaches 500,000 Native students leaving over 100,000 without supplementary academic and cultural programs in their schools. State-Tribal Education Partnership (STEP) Program\u2014Provide $5 million for the State-Tribal Education Partnership Program. .\u2014Congress appropriated roughly $2 million dollars for the STEP program to five participating tribes in fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013 under the Tribal Education Department appropriations' line that is administered by the Department of Education. In order for this program to continue to succeed and thrive, it must receive its own line of appropriations in fis-cal year 2015. Collaboration between tribal education agencies and State edu-cational agencies is crucial to developing the tribal capacity to assume the roles, re-sponsibilities, and accountability of Native education departments and increasing self-governance over Native education. Alaska Native Education Equity Assistance Program\u2014Provide $35 million for Title VII, Part C of the ESEA .\u2014This assistance program funds the development of curricula and education programs that address the unique educational needs of Alaska Native students, as well as the development and operation of student enrich-ment programs in science and mathematics. This funding is crucial to closing the gap between Alaska Native students and their non-Native peers. Other eligible ac-tivities include professional development for educators, activities carried out through Even Start programs and Head Start programs, family literacy services, and dropout prevention programs. Native Hawaiian Education Program\u2014Provide $35 million for Title VII, Part B of the ESEA .\u2014This program funds the development of curricula and education pro- grams that address the education needs of Native Hawaiian students to help bring equity to this Native population. Where Native Hawaiians once had a very high rate of literacy, today Native Hawaiian educational attainment lags behind the general population. 570 3U.S. Census Bureau.

Department of Labor Fund the Department of Labor's Indian and Native American Program (INAP) at a minimum of $60.5 million. Fund the Native American Employment and Training Council at $125,000 from non-INAP resources .\u2014In order to reduce the education and employment disparity between Native people and other groups, a concentrated effort is required that provides tailored and sufficient assistance to enhance edu-cation and employment opportunities, to create pathways to careers and skilled em-ployment, and to secure a place for Native people within the Nation's middle class. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Section 166 program (INAP) serves the train-ing and employment needs of over 38,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives via a network of 175 grantees through the Comprehensive Service Program (Adult) and Supplemental Youth Service Program (Youth), and the Indian Employment and Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992, Public Law 102-477. Furthermore, the number of American Indians and Alaska Natives served through WIA does not fully capture its impact in Indian Country, as many more are served by grantees that leverage WIA funding, along with other similar federally funded employment and training programs, through PL 102-477. There has been a trend of decreasing funds for INAP, and a failure to appropriate at the statutory minimum level of $55 million. These decreases in funding are detri-mental and hamper progress in Indian Country's labor situation. According to the Census, the average unemployment rate on reservations dropped more than 3 per-centage points since 2000, 3but more still needs to be done as American Indians and Alaska Natives still lag significantly behind. With the average unemployment rate in Indian Country cited up to 17 percent 4and an average rate of joblessness of ap- proximately 50 percent,5INAP is vital to helping reverse these trends. Further, because INAP is the only Federal employment and job training program that serves American Indians and Alaska Natives who reside both on and off res-ervations, it is imperative that its funding is preserved. For Native citizens living on remote reservations or in Alaska Native villages, it can be difficult to access the State and local workforce systems. In these areas, INAP can be the lone employ-ment and training provider. Since 2003, WIA has been up for reauthorization; and over this 11-year period, WIA has not accounted for the population growth of tribal communities, nor the economic environment that has drastically changed. WIA au-thorizes the INAP to be funded at ''not less than $55 million,'' but Section 166 is currently being funded at approximately $46 million. WIA also authorizes the Na-tive American Employment and Training Council to advise the Secretary on the op-eration and administration of INAP, but it uses funds that are intended for INAP grantees. Since the current INAP funding is already below $55 million, the Sec-retary should use other streams of funding to support its advisory council. Without an increase in funding, not enough tribes are able to benefit from the support and training activities for employment opportunities in Indian Country. Restore the YouthBuild Program funding to a minimum of $102.5 million, restore the rural and tribal set-aside in the YouthBuild program, and reinstate a dedicated 10 percent rural and tribal set-aside of at least $10.25 million .\u2014The YouthBuild pro- gram is a workforce development program that provides significant academic and occupational skills training and leadership development to youth ages 16-24, and engages approximately 10,000 youth annually. According to YouthBuild, in 2010, 4,252 youth participated in the program and had a completion rate of 78 percent, and 60 percent of those who completed the program were placed in jobs or further education. 6There are a number of tribal YouthBuild programs in several States, and Native Americans make up roughly 4 percent of YouthBuild participants. With the recent reduction in tribal YouthBuild programs, high unemployment rates, seri-ous housing challenges in Indian Country, and the growing Native youth population (42 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native population is under 25 years old), 7 it is critical that the 10 percent rural and tribal set- aside be restored. Corporation for Public Broadcasting In the CPB, NCAI supports an advanced fiscal year 2016 appropriation of $5 mil- lion for American Indian and Alaska Native radio stations. This $5 million appro-priation would come out of the fiscal year 2015 advanced appropriation of $445 mil-571 lion for the overall CPB budget. This is the same budget amount enacted for fiscal year 2014 and requested for fiscal year 2015. For more than 30 years, decisions on the amount of Federal support for public broadcasting have been made 2 years ahead of the fiscal year in which the funding is allocated. Since 1976, CPB's 2-year advance appropriation has served as a Con-gressional strategy to protect public media from any immediate political pressure. Community Service Grants (CSGs) account for approximately 70 percent of CPB's appropriation, which directly funds 1,300 local public television and radio stations including 35 Native radio stations. In Indian Country, Native radio stations are essential to the tribal communities they serve since they are often the first source of emergency reporting and informa-tion. Public broadcasters use datacast technology for homeland security, public alert and warning systems, and public safety purposes. In Oklahoma, KCNP Chickasaw radio provided real time weather reports that saved lives during the 2013 tornado season. In Arizona, KUYI Hopi radio provides ''House Calls,'' a health call-in show that connects listeners with a local doctor on questions about hanta virus, diabetes, HIV, and other local health issues. In Alaska, KNBA covers news from Alaska Na-tive villages about climate change refugees, language revitalization, and other hyper local stories important and relevant to Alaska Native communities. Often, the only place where Native stories and issues are heard is on Native radio stations. Local public media stations and their employees have experienced significant re- ductions through cuts to other Federal programs that benefit public media. The elimination of CPB's Digital appropriation and the Public Telecommunications Fa-cilities Program coupled with cuts to programs at the Departments of Education and Agriculture represent a $57.5 million, or 7.3 percent, funding cut between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2012. These cuts come at a time when stations are struggling to maintain service to their communities in the face of shrinking nonFederal reve-nues\u2014a $239 million, or 10.8 percent, drop between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2011. CPB also funds the essential system-wide station support services provided by Native Public Media, Inc., and content production and satellite programming dis-tribution by Koahnic Broadcast Corporation. Access to these funds allows Native Public Media, Inc., to ensure that Native radio stations stay on the air by maintain-ing compliance with FCC and other Federal rules and regulations, and by providing the training and support Native broadcasters need. Native public radio stations still exist as one of the primary sources of public information on tribal lands, and rep-resent cornerstones of tribal efforts for information dissemination. Much of Indian Country remains disconnected from vital telecommunications services, radio should not be counted among them. Radio has always existed as a key component of public information and 55 tribal radio stations among this country's 566 federally recog-nized tribes illustrates the need for these services in Indian Country. PREPARED STATEMENT OF NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATIONS On behalf of the National Council of Social Security Management Associations (NCSSMA), thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony regarding the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) fiscal year 2015 Appropriation. NCSSMA is a membership organization of nearly 3,300 SSA managers and super- visors who provide leadership in over 1,200 community-based field offices and tele-service centers throughout the country. We are the front-line service providers for SSA in communities all over the Nation. Since the founding of our organization over 44 years ago, NCSSMA has considered a stable SSA, which delivers quality and timely community-based service to the American public, our top priority. We also consider it a top priority to be good stewards of the taxpayers' monies and the Social Security programs we administer. We would like to express our appreciation for the fiscal year 2014 Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) account funding of $11.697 billion provided to SSA. Increased resources, especially in SSA's field offices and teleservice centers, will have a positive impact on delivering vital services to the American public and in fulfilling the agency's stewardship responsibilities. Since October 2010, SSA field of-fices had lost almost 4,100 permanent employees prior to the first wave of fiscal year 2014 hiring. The teleservice centers (TSCs) lost 1,159 employees during the same timeframe. For the first time in over 3 years, we are replacing some of these losses. Because of the fiscal year 2014 funding, authority was granted to field offices and teleservice centers to hire 2,350 and 850 permanent employees, respectively. In 572 addition, 550 permanent hires were approved for Workload Support Units (WSUs) that are expected to ease the burden placed on field offices. The dramatic growth in SSA workloads, along with the attrition in our offices over the last several years, has highlighted the need to receive necessary resources to maintain service levels vital to the nearly 65 million Social Security beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. Despite agency strategic plan-ning, expansion of online services, significant productivity gains, and the best efforts of management and employees, SSA still faces many challenges providing the serv-ice the American public has earned and deserves. Over the last several years, SSA has experienced a significant increase in Social Security claims. The additional claims receipts are driven in large part by the initial wave of the nearly 80 million baby boomers who will be filing for Social Security benefits by 2030, an average of 10,000 per day. \u2014In fiscal year 2013, SSA field offices assisted 43.3 million visitors, received 4.9 million retirement, survivor and Medicare applications, and 2.9 million initial disability claims. \u2014In fiscal year 2013, SSA completed 2,987,883 initial disability claims. Since fis- cal year 2007, initial disability claims receipts have increased by over 25 per-cent. \u2014In fiscal year 2013, SSA completed 5,006,855 retirement, survivor, and Medi- care claims (5,001,092 in fiscal year 2012)\u2014a record number and over a million more than completed in fiscal year 2007. \u2014In fiscal year 2013, retirement, survivor, and Medicare claims were 30 percent higher as compared to fiscal year 2007. \u2014Each day over 155,000 people visit SSA field offices and more than 436,000 call SSA for a variety of services. We fully support the President's budget request of $12.024 billion for SSA's LAE account in fiscal year 2015. While this would be a much-appreciated increase of $327 million over the fiscal year 2014 level of funding, it would only address fixed cost increases. The fiscal year 2015 Budget Request submitted by Acting Commis-sioner Carolyn Colvin to President Obama for SSA's administrative funding was $12.6 billion. This level of funding will allow SSA to continue improving and mod-ernizing customer service, enhance program integrity efforts, detect and deter fraud and errors, and continue to address high volumes of work. In November of 2013, NCSSMA co-authored a letter with 29 other organizations, which was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and recommended a funding level con-sistent with the Acting Commissioner's request for SSA's administrative funding. Specifically the letter stated: SSA teleservice centers, hearing offices, program service centers, disability de-termination services (DDS), and field offices are in critical need of adequate re-sources to address their growing workloads. The recommended fiscal year 2015 budget of no less than $12.6 billion would allow SSA to cover inflationary in-creases, resume efforts to reduce hearings and disability backlogs, complete def-icit-reducing program integrity work, and replace critical staffing losses in SSA's components, including field offices, teleservice centers, and DDSs. Adequate funding would also help to minimize the closure of additional field of- fices. Since fiscal year 2010, SSA consolidated 92 field offices into 46 field offices and closed 521 contact stations. The agency also cancelled plans to open eight new hearing offices and a new teleservice center due to limited resources. In many cases, applicants for benefits or those approaching retirement age who have questions about their eligibility or benefits have been forced to travel greater distances to visit a Social Security field office. The fiscal year 2014 appropriation for SSA provided $1.197 billion dedicated to program integrity activities to ensure that disability and other benefits are properly paid. SSA plans to process 2.6 million SSI redeterminations and 510,000 full med-ical continuing disability reviews (CDRs) in fiscal year 2014. Despite these efforts, the agency continues to have 1.3 million CDRs backlogged due to budgetary short-falls. The fiscal year 2015 budget request would provide $1.396 billion dedicated to program integrity. With these funds, the agency would be able to complete 880,000 full medical CDRs and 2.6 million SSI redeterminations. Completing more than 880,000 CDRs would more than double the CDRs completed in 2013, saving billions of taxpayer dollars. While it is critical SSA focus on cost-effective program integrity work to protect taxpayer dollars, there must be a balance between these efforts, preventing fraud and improper payments before they occur, and service to the American public. One way we can help stop fraud before it starts is through the work of Cooperative Dis-ability Investigation (CDI) units. With the increased fiscal year 2014 funding, SSA will be able to add 7 units to the existing 25. We recognize CDI unit expansion is 573 not enough and advocate for additional focus on program integrity initiatives includ- ing providing in-depth training for identifying and reporting fraud for our front-line employees. Field office employees are the first line of defense against fraud, and must have the training and resources necessary to identify and report questionable activities and claims. Additional training initiatives have begun in fiscal year 2014, but must continue. SSA is challenged by ever-increasing workloads, very complex programs to admin- ister, and increased program integrity work with diminished staffing and resources. With the current fiscal challenges confronting SSA, we encourage Congress to con-sider changes to the Social Security and SSI programs that have the potential to increase administrative efficiency and lower operational costs. It is critical SSA receives adequate, yet flexible funding for the LAE account to respond to requests for assistance from the American public, and to fulfill our stew-ardship responsibilities. SSA TSCs, hearing offices, program service centers (PSCs), DDS, and the over 1,200 field offices are in grave need of adequate resources to ad- dress their growing workloads. Many of SSA's field offices are currently experi-encing wait times in excess of 60 minutes. One out of every 8 visitors waits more than 1 hour to receive services, which is 177 percent more than in fiscal year 2012 and 224 percent more than fiscal year 2011. Without adequate funding, SSA will not be able to provide the high-quality customer service Americans deserve and will be unable to process program integrity workloads, which save taxpayer dollars and reduce the Federal budget and deficit. We realize the fiscal year 2015 funding level requested above is not insignificant, particularly in this difficult Federal budget environment. However, Social Security serves as the largest most vital component of the social safety net of America and is facing unprecedented challenges. The American public expects and deserves SSA's assistance. On behalf of NCSSMA members nationwide, thank you for the opportunity to sub- mit this written testimony. We respectfully ask that you consider our comments, and would appreciate any assistance you can provide in ensuring the American pub-lic receives the critical and necessary service they deserve from the Social Security Administration. [This statement was submitted by Scott Hale, President, National Council of So- cial Security Management Associations.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ENERGY ASSISTANCE DIRECTORS ' ASSOCIATION The members of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association (NEADA), representing the State directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Pro-gram (LIHEAP) would first like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Subcommittee for considering our funding request for fiscal year 2015 and ad-vance funding for fiscal year 2016. We would also like to thank the members of the Committee for increasing the funding for fiscal year 2014. These additional funds allowed States to increase grants for low income families to help them pay a portion of their higher home heat-ing costs during this year's bitterly cold winter. The additional funds will also allow States to maintain at least a minimal level of support for cooling programs this summer. Purchasing Power of LIHEAP Continues to Decline The increase in program funding in fiscal year 2014, however, was not sufficient to stem the continuing decline in the purchasing power of the average LIHEAP grant. Since fiscal year 2010, the purchasing power of the average grant has de-clined from 60.2 percent of the cost of home heating to 44.7 percent. In other words, in fiscal year 2010, the average grant could purchase approximately 72 days of home heating, whereas in fiscal year 2014, the average grant could only purchase 54 days of home heating. The program's purchasing power is declining for two reasons: \u2014First and foremost is the decline in the program's appropriation. Between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2013, LIHEAP's annual appropriation declined from $5.1 billion to $3.25 billion. As a result, during this time States were forced to reduce the average grant from $520 to $398 and the number of households served from 8.1 million to 6.7 million. The increase in funding in fiscal year 2014 to $3.4 billion allowed States to increase the average grant by $21 to $419, still almost $100 less than the average grant awarded in fiscal year 2010. 574 \u2014Second, average home heating costs increased from $796 during the winter heating season of 2011\u201412 (fiscal year 2012) to $936 during this recent winter heating season. During this period, the average increase for those using natural gas went from $567 to $663; for electricity, from $840 to $934; for heating oil, from $1,735 to $2,243; and for propane, from $1,563 to $2,269. LIHEAP is the primary source of heating and cooling assistance for some of the poorest families in the United States. In fiscal year 2014, the number of households receiving heating assistance is expected to remain at about 6.7 million households, or about 19 percent of those eligible to receive assistance. In addition, the program is expected to reach about 600,000 households for cooling assistance, the same level that received assistance in fiscal year 2013. President's Budget Would Severely Reduce the Number of Households Served The President's fiscal year 2015 Budget request for LIHEAP would result in even greater cuts to the program's effectiveness by reducing the amount available for pro-gram grants to $2.7 billion. In order to maintain the program's purchasing power, States would have no choice but to reduce the number of households served from about 6.7 million to 5.3 million, or about 15 percent of eligible households. Fiscal year 2015 Funding Request and fiscal year 2016 Advanced Funding Request For fiscal year 2015 we are requesting that the Subcommittee restore funding for LIHEAP to the authorized level of $5.1 billion. The additional funds would allow States to increase the number of households served to 8.1 million, raise the average grant to at least 50 percent of the cost of home heating, and expand the number of households served by home cooling. In addition, we are concerned that States will be hampered in their ability to ad- minister their programs efficiently due to the lack of advanced funding. The lack of a final program appropriation prior to the beginning of the fiscal year creates sig-nificant administrative problems for States in setting their program eligibility guidelines. To address this concern, we are requesting advance appropriations of $5.1 billion for fiscal year 2016. What Is the Impact of Declining Federal Funds? Surveys of families receiving Federal assistance have been consistent over the years. Poor families struggle to pay their home energy bills. When they fall behind, they risk shut-off of energy services or they are not able to afford the purchase of delivered fuels. In fiscal year 2011, NEADA conducted a survey of approximately 1,800 households that received LIHEAP benefits. The results show that LIHEAP households are among the most vulnerable in the country: \u201440 percent had someone age 60 or older. \u201472 percent had a family member with a serious medical condition. \u201426 percent used medical equipment that requires electricity. \u201437 percent went without medical or dental care. \u201434 percent did not fill a prescription or took less than their full dose of pre- scribed medication. \u201419 percent became sick because the home was too cold. \u201485 percent of people with a medical condition were seniors. Many LIHEAP recipients were unable to pay their energy bills: \u201449 percent skipped paying or paid less than their entire home energy bill. \u201437 percent received a notice or threat to disconnect or discontinue their elec- tricity or home heating fuel. \u201411 percent had their electric or natural gas service shut off in the past year due to nonpayment. \u201424 percent were unable to use their main source of heat in the past year be- cause their fuel was shut off, they could not pay for fuel delivery, or their heat-ing system was broken and they could not afford to fix it. \u201417 percent were unable to use their air conditioner in the past year because their electricity was shut off or their air conditioner was broken and they could not afford to fix it. LIHEAP's impact in many cases goes beyond providing bill payment assistance by playing a crucial role in maintaining family stability. It enables elderly citizens to live independently and ensures that young children have safe, warm homes to live in. Although the circumstances that lead each client to seek LIHEAP assistance are different, LIHEAP links these stories by enabling people to cope with difficult cir-cumstances with dignity. The Need for LIHEAP Households reported enormous challenges despite the fact that they received LIHEAP assistance. However, they reported that LIHEAP was extremely important. 575 About 64 percent reported that they would have kept their home at unsafe or unhealthy temperatures and/or had their electricity or home heating fuel discon-tinued if it had not been for LIHEAP. Almost 98 percent said that LIHEAP was very or somewhat important in helping them to meet their needs. In addition, 53 percent of those who did not have their electricity or home heating fuel discontinued said that they would have if it had not been for LIHEAP. The members of NEADA recognize the difficult budget decisions that you face as you consider funding levels for LIHEAP for fiscal year 2015 and advance funding for fiscal year 2016. We appreciate your interest and continued support for LIHEAP. Please feel free to call upon us if we can provide you with additional information.

My name is Clare Coleman; I'm the President & CEO of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), a membership organization representing the Nation's safety-net family planning providers\u2014nurse practitioners, nurses, physicians, administrators and other key healthcare professionals. Many of NFPRHA's members receive Federal funding from Medicaid and through Title X of the Federal Public Health Service Act, the only federally funded, dedicated, family planning program for the low income and uninsured. These critical components of the Nation's public health safety net are essential resources for those providing ac-cess to high-quality services in communities across the country. As the Committees work on the fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill, NFPRHA respectfully requests that you make a significant investment in Title X by including $337 million to restore the capacity of the program to serve those in need. NFPRHA was disappointed to see the president's fiscal year 2015 proposal only included $286.5 million for Title X. As more individuals gain access to healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act, the publicly funded family planning net-work will continue to play an essential role in our Nation's service delivery frame-work, setting the standard for and providing high-quality care to all patients\u2014the insured, uninsured, under-insured as well as patients seeking confidential services. If the Massachusetts health reform experience were to prove representative of what could be expected by nationwide health reform, there will be a strong increase in demand for services within the already-strained safety net. At present, six in ten women describe family planning centers as their usual source of medical care. Ac-cording to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as health reform in Massachusetts expanded coverage for most people living in the State, Title X family planning health centers continued to have high volumes of pa-tients, both insured and uninsured, and remained providers of choice for many. The failure of States to expand Medicaid eligibility for all adults up to 138 percent of the Federal poverty level (an income of $16,105 a year for an individual in 2014)\u2014along with new barriers to coverage being sought by some expansion States, such as premiums and other cost-sharing requirements\u2014compounds the demand being placed on the Title X safety net. Currently, 25 States have not expanded their Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. Twenty-one of these States have Medicaid eligi-bility equal to or less than 75 percent of FPL (an income of $8,753 a year); 14 have eligibility at or below 50 percent (an income of $5,835 a year). Five States have eli-gibility set at less than 25 percent of FPL\u2014that means individuals making more than $2,918 are too ''rich'' for Medicaid. Similar to other publicly funded health programs, Title X has unfortunately suf- fered budget cuts despite rising patient need. Between fiscal year 2010-fiscal year 2013, the Title X family planning program was cut $39.2 million (-12.3 percent). As a result, the total number of Title X users shrunk from 5.22 million users to 4.76 million during this time period, with no indication that patients went elsewhere for care. Congress made incremental progress in fiscal year 2014, funding Title X at $286.5 million, a restoration of $8.2 million over the fiscal year 2013 post-sequester level. As appropriators grapple with how best to distribute limited Federal re-sources, NFPRHA encourages the Committees continue to prioritize investments in programs, including Title X, that are proven to save critical taxpayer dollars. Every $1 invested in publicly funded family planning services saves $5.68 in Medicaid costs associated with unplanned births. Additionally, services provided in Title X- 576 supported centers alone yielded $5.3 billion of the $10.5 billion in total savings for publicly funded family planning in 2010. Lastly, Title X supports critical infrastructure and technology necessary for mod- ern service delivery that are not reimbursable under Medicaid and commercial in-surance. Resources for electronic health record implementation for safety-net pro-viders\u2014just as for others in the safety net\u2014are necessary to help achieve the ACA goal of having a nationwide health information technology infrastructure and more coordinated models of care. Increased Title X funding is essential to help address the gap caused by the oversight in Federal planning that led to most family plan-ning health providers' ineligibility for the electronic health records (EHR) incentives available under the HITECH Act. For these reasons, NFPRHA urges the Committees to make a significant invest- ment in the Nation's safety-net family planning health services and requests fund-ing for Title X at $337 million in fiscal year 2015. [This statement was submitted by Clare Coleman, President & CEO, National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL HEAD START ASSOCIATION Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for allowing the National Head Start Association (NHSA) to submit testi-mony on behalf of funding for Head Start and Early Head Start in fiscal year 2015 . For almost 50 years, Head Start centers have been creating opportunities for at- risk children and families to achieve success in life by providing critical early edu-cation, health, nutrition, parent engagement and family support services. NHSA re-spectfully urges the Subcommittee to continue its enduring bipartisan support by allocating $8,868,389,000 for Head Start and Early Head Start in fiscal year 2015, in line with the President's Budget. Head Start and Early Head Start directors remain appreciative of your leadership in ensuring that the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations legislation not only restored the damaging cuts from sequestration, but also prioritized high quality by including additional funds to retain qualified staff and cope with the increased costs of program operation. We also sincerely appreciate the new investment in one of our most underserved populations\u2014low-income infants and toddlers. Within the total amount of funding for fiscal year 2015, we urge the Sub- committee to continue and build on these investments. In particular, we propose a $150 million increase to support workforce quality improvements and to help offset the continued rise in energy, transportation, and other fixed costs related to oper-ating a Head Start program. It is well known that one of the hallmarks of excellence in any early learning program is the caliber of its teachers. Head Start teachers are required to possess Bachelor's degrees in early learning or related fields, which en-ables the program to have one of the best-trained workforces in the country. How-ever, the average salary for these degreed teachers is $30,086\u2014lower than what many schools pay teachers, and much lower than salaries for many other jobs with comparable education requirements. Examples of programs losing their best staff to higher paying schools or other pro- viders are plentiful across the country. In New York, one Head Start social/emo-tional education mentor-coach reported seeing several ''gifted teachers, assistants and aides leave our classrooms after short stays due to the pressure to provide for their own families.'' Many of the staff who choose to stay with Head Start struggle to make ends meet\u2014such as the Oregon teachers who have depended on a local food bank to help feed their own children. Others depend on other income supports. Fo-cusing increased investment toward workforce quality improvements will help en-able programs to hold on to dedicated teachers, and provide a solid foundation for the good of our students and families. Supporting a High-Quality Birth-to-Five Pipeline: NHSA also urges the Subcommittee to support the continued development of a birth-to-five pipeline of services through expanded access to Early Head Start, which today is only able to serve a scant 4 percent of eligible infants and toddlers. Contin-ued early brain research tells us that with the achievement gap present as early as 18 months, these first 2 years of life represent a critical window in development. Early Head Start centers are among the highest quality environments for children of this age. We propose that the Subcommittee continue to fund the new Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships at $500 million. These funds should, as in fiscal year 2014, support the straight expansion of Early Head Start as well as partnerships 577 with Child Care providers, ensuring programs designed by and solely based on the needs of individual communities. We are aware of many underserved areas with few options for partnerships\u2014 these communities should be given as much flexibility as possible to increase access to high-quality care. For example, Audubon Area Community Services, Inc. in Ken-tucky serves a 16 county area. However, even though there are an estimated 17,911 children in their service area that are eligible for Early Head Start, they are only funded to serve 301 Early Head Start slots. In two of those 16 counties, there are 600 eligible children but no licensed child care facilities with which possibly to part-ner. In yet a third county, there is licensed child care but none of it for infants and toddlers. With flexibility to invest in expansion, they could find a way to serve those areas. Further, NHSA also urges the Subcommittee to allocate $100 million to fund the expansion of the Birth-to-Five pilot programs that the Office of Head Start (OHS) began last year in Detroit, Baltimore, Jersey City, Washington, DC, and Mis-sissippi's Sunflower County as part of the first Designation Renewal System (DRS) recompetition. The grants are meant to encourage applicants to develop comprehen-sive, flexible, seamless Birth-to-Five programs which incorporate both Head Start and Early Head Start funding. We hope the Subcommittee will recognize the value of this approach and support expansion of these models outside of DRS. In par-ticular, we suggest that the Administration utilize a portion of the funds to create a process that enables current grantees that hold both types of grants to streamline the administrative burden and combine these two grants into one. These Birth-to-Five expansion funds should also be used to assist Head Start grantees to add Early Head Start slots and convert existing Head Start slots for 3- 4 year olds to Early Head Start slots; both actions support the goal of providing an Early Head Start slot to complement each Head Start slot. Across the country, as States and localities both expand and contract services for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, Head Start programs have the necessary skills to adapt their services to fit the changing needs of their community. But as resources shift, additional funding to help transition to new or different types of slots would be a welcome sup-port. For instance, many States have increased their investment in serving 4-year-olds in a variety of settings through their mixed delivery system, including through orga-nizations who receive Head Start grants. Head Start grantees are able to tap into this funding stream to support and expand their current services to 4-year-olds\u2014 however many of those communities are now under-investing in low-income infants and toddlers. If that same Head Start grantee were able to apply for funds to help transition some of its Head Start slots to Early Head Start slots, the community would then be served by a more comprehensive birth-to-five pipeline\u2014meeting a sig-nificant need for the working parents of very young children. Ongoing Quality Improvements: Robust funding for Head Start and Early Head Start will ensure that key quality improvement initiatives are able to continue at the Office of Head Start. In par-ticular, we are keen for the Office of Head Start to finalize an update to our rigorous performance standards as mandated in the 2007 Head Start Reauthorization Act. Serious and meaningful efforts are underway to ensure that the standards are mod-ernized to reflect the needs of today's children, families, teachers, staff, and commu-nities\u2014while allowing for innovation and local adaptability. These standards are the heart of Head Start's model, and critical to future success. Further, we are hopeful that the Office of Head Start is able to continue its im- provements to the Head Start Monitoring System\u2014the oversight mechanism that ensures Head Start and Early Head Start grantees are meeting all of their high standards. We are pleased that the Office has instituted new initiatives that aim to work with programs to prevent issues before they occur. We are also appreciative that they are enabling iterative feedback and data collection to better target assist-ance and intervention where programs require it most. These are welcome changes, and we are hopeful that the Office of Head Start is afforded the resources to con-tinue these improvements. One of the best-known provisions of the 2007 Head Start Act requires Head Start grantees designated as low-performing to compete for the continuation of their grant. Different from the Head Start grant termination process, this additional ac-countability measure, the Designation Renewal System (DRS) which is now in its third cycle, has been an enormous undertaking for the Office of Head Start and re-quires adequate resources to fully staff and execute. We support the Administration's request for $25 million to assist with grantee transition costs in the event that a grant turns over, though NHSA remains con-578 1Ludwig, J. and Phillips, D. (2007).

Currently, Head Start grantees are notified in Janu-ary of their recompetition status, but the results of those competitions are not deter-mined until late in the summer. With a school year beginning shortly thereafter, any new grantee taking over for a low-quality incumbent faces a steep climb to re-cruit teachers, enroll children, and find any necessary facilities and other resources to start up their program. This is an avoidable strain on communities. Considering the opportunity that DRS provides to improve program quality, we must ensure that the process is done right. We hope the Subcommittee considers additional assistance to the Office of Head Start to ensure that these competitions are run effectively and efficiently, and that the process is accurately capturing pro-grams that are of low quality. Head Start is a High Yield Investment: To take a step back, NHSA believes that the budget caps now in place limit the opportunities to make effective investments in our future. President Obama pro-posed an additional $800 million to support Head Start and Early Head Start ex-pansion. We support the President's focus on the need to reach the large population of underserved, at-risk infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, but understand that ap-propriations that exceed the fiscal year 15 budget caps are unlikely. Certainly, we respect the idea that our debt cannot be left for the very children we serve. We do hope that deficit reduction can still be achieved in a way that does not squander our highest-yield investments. Studies show that for every one dollar invested in a Head Start child, society earns at least $7 back through increased earnings, employment, and family stability; 1as well as decreased welfare depend- ency,2healthcare costs,3crime costs,4grade retention,5and special education.6 These are the very results taxpayers demand. Again, the Head Start community understands the pressure the Subcommittee faces and is grateful for the commitment shown by Congress and the President to keep early learning, and Head Start in particular, as a priority. We urge the Sub-committee to build on the investments made in Head Start and Early Head Start, to increase access, to improve accountability, and ensure the prosperity of our next generation. Thank you for your time and consideration.

NICWA has over 35 years of experience providing leadership in the development of public policy that supports tribal self-determination in child welfare and children's mental health systems. Child Welfare Overview Tribes have an important relationship with their children and families: they are experts in the needs of AI/AN children, best suited to effectively serve those needs, 579 and most able to improve child welfare outcomes for these children (NICWA & Pew Charitable Trust, 2007). In addition, statistics show that AI/AN children face ele-vated rates of child abuse and neglect (Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2012). The key to successful tribal child welfare is a budget that avoids unnecessary re-straint on tribal decisionmaking and accounts for the elevated need. For this reason we make the following recommendations: \u2014For programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families: Promoting Safe and Stable Families ($75 million discretionary; $345 million mandatory), Child Welfare Services ($280 million), Child Abuse Discretionary Activities ($35 million), Community Based Child Abuse Prevention Program ($60 million), and Demonstration to Ad-dress Over-Utilization of Psychotropic Medications for Children in Foster Care ($250 million). Children's Mental Health Overview To understand the mental health needs of AI/AN children, policymakers must con- sider the legacy of trauma that has been visited upon this population and left them with unresolved historical trauma (Yellow Horse Brave Heart and DeBruyn, 1998). Inadequate funding, uncoordinated health systems, cultural incompetence, and a shortage of mental health professionals are barriers to the development of successful mental health systems of care in AI/AN communities (Novins & Bess, 2011). Key to children's mental health programs in tribal communities is a budget that sup-ports and strengthens a system of tribally driven children's mental health preven-tion, intervention, and treatment. For this reason we make the following rec-ommendations: \u2014For programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration: Programs of Regional and National Significance, Children and Family Programs ($6.5 million), Chil-dren's Mental Health Services Program, Children's Mental Health Initiative ($117 million), Tribal Behavioral Health Grants ($40 million), GLS Youth Sui-cide Prevention Program ($35.5 million), and AI/AN Suicide Prevention ($2.94 million). CHILD WELFARE PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS Child Welfare Services Program recommendation: Restore funding to at least $280 million, to increase funding for tribal programs while still providing for an increase in state funding. This program provides funds to promote program flexibility and fill gaps in child welfare programming. Tribes receive an allocation based on a population-based for-mula identified within the regulations. This tribal allocation is then deducted from the state's allocation. Studies show that culturally competent programs, resources, and case management result in better outcomes for AI/AN children and families in-volved in the child welfare system (Red Horse, Martinez & Day, 2001). The funding of the Child Welfare Service Program is flexible enough for tribes to tailor their child welfare services to fit their communities' needs and culture. Without adequate funding AI/AN children and families in tribal communities can- not receive the care they need and remain at risk of further harm and trauma. Of the 566 federally recognized tribes 180 depend on this funding. The median tribal grant is about $13,300 an insufficient amount to support all the gaps in tribal serv-ices this program can fill. Because of the way the formula for tribal grants has been created, it is essential to increase the entire appropriation of this program to $280 million to increase tribal amounts. Promoting Safe and Stable Families recommendation: Increase discretionary fund- ing to $75 million to allow more tribes, who are currently ineligible, access to these funds. As recommended by the President's Budget fully fund the $345 million in mandatory funding cut due to sequestration. PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES (SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TITLE IV-B, SUBPART 2) Fiscal year 2012 enacted Fiscal year 2013 * enacted Fiscal year 2014 enacted Fiscal year 2015 president budget Fiscal year 2015 recommended Authorization Mandatory set aside 580 PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES (SOCIAL SECURITY ACT TITLE IV-B, SUBPART 2)\u2014 Continued Fiscal year 2012 enacted Fiscal year 2013 * enacted Fiscal year 2014 enacted Fiscal year 2015 president budget Fiscal year 2015 recommended Authorization Tribal Discretionary ........ 1,892,000 1,790,000 1,792,950 11,397,750 12,142,950 16,350,000 appropriation * Reflects sequestration effects. This program is designed to provide funds to operate a coordinated program of family preservation, family support, reunification, and adoption services. Promoting Safe and Stable Families is authorized with both a mandatory capped entitlement ($345 million) as well as a discretionary appropriation ($200 million). Tribes are eli-gible for funds based on a 3 percent set-aside of the total appropriation. All tribes whose plan receives approval are eligible for a portion equal to that tribe's relative share of children compared with all tribal entities with approved plans. Tribes who would qualify for less than 10 thousand dollars under the formula are not eligible to receive funding. Tribal child welfare programs work tirelessly to strengthen families and provide services that keep children safely in their homes. This program is an integral part of these efforts. It supports parenting classes, home-visiting services, respite care for caregivers of children, and other services that safely preserve families. One hundred and thirty tribes and tribal consortia depend on this funding. Yet because of the funding levels, many tribes are ineligible for these formula grant dol-lars as their portion of the tribal set-aside is less than $10,000. Increasing this pro-gram's discretionary funding to $75 million and fully funding the $345 million in mandatory funding would help dozens of new tribes access this funding and hun-dreds of families obtain tribal child welfare services. CHILD WELFARE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS Child Abuse Discretionary Activities, including Innovative Evidence-Based Com- munity Prevention Programs recommendation: Increase appropriations to $35 mil-lion to account for tribes' recent eligibility for these funds while holding state and other grantees harmless. The Community Based Child Abuse Prevention Program recommendation: In- crease funding to $60 million, so that more tribes can have access to these scarce child abuse prevention dollars. Demonstration to Address Over-Utilization of Psychotropic Medications for Chil- dren in Foster Care (Presidents fiscal year 2015 Initiative) recommendation: Fund this initiative at the proposed $250 million and ensure a tribal set-aside of 3 percent so that tribal communities can also participate in this important initiative to ensure children receive holistic mental healthcare. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RECOMMENDATIONS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION CHILDREN 'S MENTAL HEALTH PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS Programs of Regional and National Significance: Children and Family Programs (Circles of Care) recommendation: Fund Circles of Care Program at $6.5 million as recommended by the President to ensure current communities can continue their important work and new tribal communities can have access to this program. The Children and Family Programs line item represents funds allocated to the Circles of Care Program. The Circles of Care program is the cornerstone of chil-dren's mental health programming in tribal communities. The Circles of Care pro-gram is the only SAMHSA grant program that is focused specifically on AI/AN chil-dren's mental health needs. It is also the only SAHMSA program that allows tribes and tribal organizations to apply without competing for funding with other govern-mental entities such as States, counties, or cities. There are currently seven commu-nities receiving Circles of Care funding. The American Psychiatric Association has found that AI/AN children and youth face a disproportionate burden of mental health issues while simultaneously facing more barriers to quality mental healthcare (2010). Circles of Care provides commu-nities with funding to plan and build culturally competent services and design inte-grated supports that meet the specific needs of their youth with behavioral health challenges. It is essential to the well-being of AI/AN children. It is imperative that 581 funding that matches the President's Budget request of $6.5 million be reserved in this line item for the Circles of Care program. This will ensure that more tribal com-munities can access this grant and improve their children's mental healthcare sys-tems. Children's Mental Health Services Program: Children's Mental Health Initiative (Systems of Care) recommendation: Maintain funding at $117 million to continue support of Tribal children's mental health systems change efforts. The various Systems of Care grants funded under this line item support a commu- nity's efforts to plan and implement strategic approaches to mental health services and supports that are family driven; youth guided; strength based; culturally and linguistically competent; and meet the intellectual, emotional, cultural, and social needs of children and youth. The American Psychiatric Association (APA; 2010) has recognized family, culture, and traditional health practices as important protective factors for AI/ANs strug-gling with mental health challenges. The Systems of Care program, which foster those protective factors described by the APA, has been both well-received and par-ticularly effective in tribal communities. Currently, 17 tribal communities are fund-ed under the Children's Mental Health Initiative line item. The well-being of AI/AN children is dependent on the ability of more tribes to ac- cess these funds and create real systems change. Thus, funding must be maintained at $117 million as recommended by the President's Budget. This will ensure the cur-rent Systems of Care grantees can continue, and a new robust cohort of grantees can begin this important work. CHILDREN 'S MENTAL HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS Tribal Behavioral Health Grants recommendation: Implement President's Budget fiscal year 2013 recommendation to fund this new initiative at $40 million so that additional tribal communities can receive resources for children's mental health and substance abuse. The GLS State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention and Early Intervention Program recommendation: Keep funding at the fiscal year 2014 appropriated level of $35.5 million to ensure that current grantees can complete their projects, and a similar sized cohort of annual grantees will have access to this program. AI/AN Suicide Prevention program recommendation: Fund at the President's Budget recommended amount of $2.94 million, to ensure that the epidemic of AI/ AN suicide receives the attention it warrants.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INDIAN EDUCATION ASSOCIATION The National Indian Education Association (NIEA) was incorporated in 1970 and is the most representative Native education organization in the United States. NIEA's mission is to advance comprehensive and equal educational opportunities for American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students. NIEA supports tribal sovereignty over education as well as strengthening traditional Native cul-tures and values that enable Native learners to become contributing members of their communities. As the most inclusive Native education organization, NIEA membership consists of tribal leaders, educators, students, researchers, and edu-cation stakeholders from all 50 States. From communities in Hawaii, to tribal res-ervations across the continental U.S., to villages in Alaska and urban communities in major cities, NIEA has the most reach of any Native education organization in the country. Tribes and Native communities have a tremendous stake in an improved edu- cation system, because an improved system equates to better services for Native people and students. As tribes work to increase their footprint in education, there must be support for that increased participation. The Federal Government must up-hold its trust relationship with tribes. Established through treaties, Federal law, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions, this relationship includes a fiduciary obligation to provide parity in access and equal resources to all American Indian and Alaska Native students, regardless of where they attend school. National fiscal and policy concerns should not be addressed by decreasing funds and investment to Native stu-dents or the programs that serve them. Rather, Native education, including those programs and services under the Departments of Education (ED) and Health and Human Services (HHS), is one of the most effective and efficient investments the Federal Government can make. 582 As tribes and Native communities work with Congress for parity in access to in- crease their role and responsibility in administering education, Federal support for tribal governments and Native education institutions has continued to shrink as a percentage of the Federal budget. Historical funding trends illustrate that the Fed-eral Government is abandoning its trust responsibility by decreasing Federal funds to Native-serving programs by more than half in the last 30 years. Sequestration only exacerbated those shortfalls. While fiscal year 2014 funding increases over sequestration levels were welcome, several Native-serving programs remained flat with 2013 sequestration levels, such as Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title VII funding. These levels con-tinue to be insufficient for effectively and equally serving Native students. Partly as a result of this insufficient funding, Native students continue to lag behind their non-Native peers. Graduation rates often hover around 50 percent in many States, which can lead to increased substance abuse, criminal acts, and extended periods of unemployment. If the 25,000 Native students who dropped out of the Class of 2010 had graduated, an additional $295 million would likely have been added to total annual earnings, supplementing local and regional economies. To provide tribes and Native communities the educational institutions that sup- plement economic growth, the Federal Government should fund Native education programs at the levels requested below as they detail the minimum appropriations needed to maintain a system that is already struggling and underfunded. The fol-lowing funding requests illustrate continuing need for Native programs but do not comprise the full list of budget requests, which can be found in the fiscal year 2015 NIEA Budget Document. Further, NIEA supports the budget requests of the Na-tional Congress of American Indians and American Indian Higher Education Con-sortium. State-Tribal Education Partnership (STEP) Program (ED) \u2014Provide $5 million. An increase of $3 million. Congress appropriated roughly $2 million dollars for the STEP program to five participating tribes under the Tribal Education Department appropriations. In order for this program to successfully achieve the original intent of the appropriation, it must receive its own line and authorization of appropriations in fiscal year 2015. Collaboration between tribal education agencies and State education agencies is cru-cial to developing the tribal capacity to assume the roles, responsibilities, and ac-countability of tribal education departments that increase self-governance in Native education. Impact Aid (ED) \u2014Provide $2 billion for Impact Aid, under ESEA Title VIII. An increase of $711 million. Impact Aid provides direct payments to public school districts as reimbursement for the loss of traditional property taxes due to a Federal presence or activity, in-cluding the existence of an Indian reservation. With nearly 93 percent of Native stu-dents enrolled in public schools, Native students were disproportionately affected by the devastating reductions implemented under sequestration. Additional funds are required to cover previous Impact Aid shortfalls. Title VII (Indian Education Formula Grants in ED) \u2014Provide $198 million under ESEA Title VII, Part A. An increase of $74 million. This grant funding is designed to supplement the regular school program and as- sist Native students so they have the opportunity to achieve the same educational standards as their non-Native peers. Title VII funding, which was maintained at 2013 sequestration levels in fiscal year 2014, only reaches 500,000 Native students leaving over 100,000 without supplementary academic and cultural programs in their schools. As Native students continually lag behind their non-Native peers in educational achievement, increased funding is necessary to address this substantial gap. Native Hawaiian Education Program (ED) \u2014Provide $35 million under ESEA Title VII, Part B. An increase of $3 million. The Native Hawaiian Education program empowers innovative culturally-appro- priate programs to enhance the quality of education for Native Hawaiians. When establishing the Native Hawaiian Education Program, Congress acknowledged the trust relationship between the Native Hawaiian people and the United States. These programs strengthen Native Hawaiian culture and improve educational at-tainment, both of which are correlated with positive economic outcomes. 583 Alaska Native Education Equity Assistance Program (ED) \u2014Provide $35 million under ESEA Title VII, Part C. An increase of $5 million. This assistance program funds the development of curricula and education pro- grams that address the unique educational needs of Alaska Native students as well as the development and operation of student enrichment programs in science and mathematics. Other eligible activities include professional development for edu-cators, activities carried out through Even Start and Head Start programs, family literacy services, and dropout prevention programs. Vocational Rehabilitation Services Projects for American Indians with Disabilities (ED) \u2014Provide $67 million to Vocational Rehabilitation Services Projects. Create a line item of $5 million for providing outreach to tribal recipients. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 30 percent of Native adults have a disability\u2014the highest rate of any other population in the Nation. Of those, 51 percent reported having fair or poor health. A number of issues contribute to this troubling reality, including high incidences of diabetes, heart disease, and preventable accidents. As a result, tribes have an extraordinary need to support their disabled citizens in improving their health, attaining experien-tial learning courses, and becoming self-sufficient. Tribes have limited access to funding for vocational rehabilitation and job training as compared to States and $67 million would begin to put tribes on par to support their disabled citizens. Native Languages Preservation (Esther Martinez Program Grants in HHS) \u2014Provide $12 million for Native language preservation with $5 million designated to fund the Esther Martinez Native Language Programs. An increase of $3 mil-lion. Native language grant programs are essential to revitalizing Native languages and cultures, many of which are at risk of disappearing in the upcoming decades. In addition to protecting Native languages, these immersion programs promote higher academic success for participating students in comparison to their Native peers who do not participate. The Federal budget should include $12 million for Na-tive language preservation activities which would include $5 million designated to support Esther Martinez Native Language Programs' immersion initiatives.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is pleased to submit testimony for the written record in support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Chronic Kidney Disease Program, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kid-ney Disease, and the Health Resources and Services Administration Division of Transplantation. NKF is America's largest and oldest health organization dedicated to the awareness, prevention and treatment of kidney disease for hundreds of thou-sands of healthcare professionals, millions of patients and their families, and tens of millions of people at risk. In addition, we have provided universally recognized evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) since 1997 through the NKF Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI). We respectfully request fiscal year 2015 funding of $2.1 million for the CDC Chronic Kidney Disease Program, $2.066 billion for NIDDK, and $24 million for the HRSA Division of Transplantation. In 2011, almost 616,000 Americans had End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), includ- ing more than 430,000 dialysis patients and nearly 186,000 kidney transplant re-cipients, with members of many minority populations disproportionately affected. Complicating the cost and human toll is the fact that it is a disease multiplier, with patients very likely to be diagnosed with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or hyper-tension (40 percent of ESRD patients had a diagnosis of diabetes and two-thirds have diabetes or hypertension). ESRD is the only disease-specific coverage under Medicare regardless of age or other disability. In 2011, ESRD was present in 1.4 percent of Medicare beneficiaries but responsible for more than 7 percent of Medi-care expenditures. (1) NKF recently announced an initiative to help address awareness of CKD by in- creasing communication between practitioners and patients. There is a misconcep-584 tion that once someone is diagnosed with CKD, there must be a referral to a nephrologist. However, there are not enough nephrologists to care for the 15 percent of the U.S. population with chronic kidney disease. NKF's CKD Primary Care Initia-tive will disseminate CKD guidelines to primary care physicians through education programs, symposia and practical implementation tools so they can provide this care to the growing numbers of Americans with CKD. Our initiative will help build on CDC's program, outlined below. CDC Chronic Kidney Disease Program To address the social and economic impact of kidney disease, NKF worked with Congress to initiate a Chronic Kidney Disease Program at CDC in fiscal year 2006. Prior to this, no national public health program focusing on early detection and treatment existed. Cost-effective treatments exist to potentially slow progression of kidney disease and prevent its complications, but only if individuals are diagnosed before the latter stages of CKD. The CDC program is designed to identify members of populations at high risk for CKD, develop community-based approaches for improving detection and control, and educate health professionals about best practices for early detection and treatment. The National Kidney Foundation respectfully urges the Committee to maintain $2.1 million in line-item funding for the Chronic Kidney Disease Program for fiscal year 2015. Continued support will benefit kidney patients and Americans who are at risk for kidney disease, advance the objectives of Healthy People 2020 and the National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care, and fulfill the mandate created by Sec. 152 of the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act. It is estimated that CKD affects 26 million adult Americans (2) and 73 million more are at risk. Furthermore, a task force of the American Heart Association noted that decreased kidney function has consistently been found to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and all-cause mortality and that the increased risk is present with even mild reduction in kidney function. (3) Therefore addressing CKD is a way to achieve one of the priorities in the National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care: Promoting the Most Effective Prevention and Treatment of the Leading Causes of Mortality, Starting with Cardio-vascular Disease. CKD is often asymptomatic, especially in the early stages and therefore goes un- detected without laboratory testing. Some people remain undiagnosed until they have reached CKD Stage 5 and must begin dialysis immediately. However, early identification and treatment can slow the progression of kidney disease, delay com-plications, and prevent or delay kidney failure. Accordingly, Healthy People 2020 Objective CKD\u20142 is to ''increase the proportion of persons with chronic kidney dis-ease (CKD) who know they have impaired renal function.'' Screening and early detection provides the opportunity for interventions to foster awareness, foster adherence to medications and control risk factors. Additional data collection is required to precisely define the incremental benefits of early detection on kidney failure, cardiovascular events, hospitalization and mortality. Increasing the proportion of persons with CKD who know they are affected requires expanded public and professional education programs and screening initiatives targeted at populations who are at high risk. As a result of consistent congressional support, the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at CDC has instituted a series of projects that could assist in attaining the Healthy People 2020 objective. However, this forward momentum will be stifled and CDC's invest-ment in CKD to date jeopardized if line-item funding is not continued. As noted in CDC's Preventing Chronic Disease: April 2006, Chronic Kidney Dis- ease meets the criteria to be considered a public health issue: (1) the condition places a large burden on society; (2) the burden is distributed unfairly among the overall population; (3) evidence exists that preventive strategies that target eco-nomic, political, and environmental factors could reduce the burden; and (4) evi-dence shows such preventive strategies are not yet in place. The Chronic Kidney Disease program has consisted of three projects to promote kidney health by identifying and controlling risk factors, raising awareness, and promoting early diagnosis and improved outcomes and quality of life for those living with CKD. These projects include (1) demonstrating approaches for identifying indi-viduals at high risk for CKD through State-based screening; (2) conducting an eco- nomic analysis on the economic burden of CKD and the cost-effectiveness of inter-ventions; and (3) establishing a surveillance system for CKD by analyzing and inter-preting information to assist in prevention and health promotion efforts for kidney disease. The surveillance project includes a CDC website program containing infor-mation on risk factors, early diagnosis, and strategies to improve outcomes. 585 Undetected Chronic Kidney Disease can lead to costly and debilitating irreversible kidney failure. However, cost-effective interventions are available if patients are identified in the early stages of CKD. With the continued support of Congress, NKF is confident a feasible detection, surveillance and treatment program can be estab-lished to slow, and possibly prevent, the progression of kidney disease. NIDDK NKF joins multiple other kidney patient and professional organizations to request $2.066 billion for NIDDK in fiscal year 2015. Medicare spends $77 billion annually to care for patients with kidney disease, including nearly $35 billion for individuals with ESRD, yet NIH funding for kidney disease research is only about $600 million annually or less than $25 per patient for the 26 million adults with CKD. In March 2014, NKF hosted a Kidney Patient Summit that included participation from our advocates and those of five other kidney patient organizations. Increased Federal support for kidney disease research was one of the requests the advocates presented in meetings with their congressional delegations. We were honored to have NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin Rodgers address the Kidney Summit where we learned of exciting opportunities in CKD research. America's sci-entists are at the cusp of many potential breakthroughs in improving our under-standing of CKD and providing new therapies to delay and treat various kidney dis-eases. With the unique status of ESRD in the Medicare program, it can be argued that breakthroughs in CKD have the potential to provide cost savings to the Federal Government like that of no other chronic disease. We urge Congress to continue its strong bipartisan support for NIH in fiscal year 2015 and to fund NIDDK at this requested level that is widely supported by the kidney community. HRSA Organ Transplantation NKF also urges the Committee to support the President's Budget Request of $24 million for organ donation and transplantation programs run by the Health Re-sources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Division of Transplantation (DoT). This represents an increase of less than $500,000 over the fiscal year 2014 level and would restore funding to the fiscal year 2012 level. The national organ transplant wait list contains more than 122,000 listings, in- cluding 100,000 people waiting for a kidney. Transplantation remains the treatment of choice for most patients with kidney failure yet few of them will be given an op-portunity to receive a new kidney, especially if they do not have a potential living kidney donor. Kidney recipients often have an improved quality of life (and are more likely to stay in or return to the work force) and transplantation is tremendously cost effective. Medicare spends about $25,000 per year on a kidney recipient after the year of transplant, compared to more than $80,000 annually on a dialysis pa-tient (these figures reflect all Medicare expenses and are not limited to kidney re-lated care). The HRSA program supports the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net- work (OPTN) which allocates donor organs to individuals on wait lists. Additional activities supported by DoT include initiatives to increase the number of donor or-gans; a grant program to assist living donors with out-of-pocket expenses that are not reimbursed by insurance, a health benefit program, or any other State or Fed-eral program; State donor registry initiatives to enroll potential donors; and, activi-ties to build upon achievements of HRSA's Breakthrough Collaboratives of a decade ago.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR NURSING The National League for Nursing (NLN) is the premiere organization dedicated to promoting excellence in nursing education to build a strong and diverse nursing workforce to advance the Nation's health. With leaders in nursing education and nurse faculty across all types of nursing programs in the United States\u2014doctorate, master's, baccalaureate, associate degree, diploma, and licensed practical\u2014the NLN has more than 1,200 nursing school and healthcare agency members, 40,000 indi-vidual members, and 24 regional constituent leagues. 586 The NLN urges the subcommittee to fund the following HRSA nursing programs: \u2014The Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Programs at $251 million in fis- cal year 2015; and \u2014The Title III Nurse-Managed Health Clinics at $20 million in fiscal year 2015. Nursing Education Is a Jobs Program According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the registered nurse (RN) workforce will grow by 19.4 percent from 2012 to 2022, outpacing the 11 percent average for most occupations. BLS projects that this growth will result in 1,052,600 job openings in the economy, representing one of the largest numeric job increases for all occupations. BLS calculates the openings from an increase of 526,800 new RN jobs due to technological advancements fueling growth in treatments, preventive care being emphasized more, expanding demand from new health reform enroll-ments, and accelerating demand from the two million Baby Boomers aging into Medicare every year. A particularly disconcerting element of the probable RN job openings is a loss of nursing expertise owing to the replacement need of some 525,700 jobs vacated by RNs expected to leave the profession and/or retire from the labor force by 2022. The March 7, 2014, BLS Employment Situation Summary\u2014February 2014 like- wise reinforces the strength of the nursing workforce in creating job growth. While the Nation's overall unemployment rate was little changed at 6.7 percent for Feb-ruary 2014, the employment in healthcare increased with the addition of 10,000 jobs at ambulatory healthcare services, hospitals, and nursing and residential care facili-ties, amounting to an unemployment rate of only 4.0 percent in the industry. BLS notes that the healthcare sector is a critically important industrial complex for the Nation. It is at the center of the economic recovery with the number of jobs climbing steadily. Growing even when the recession began in December 2007, healthcare jobs are up nationwide. Almost five million workers are in hospital set-tings, which often are the largest employer in a State. Healthcare has been a stim-ulus program generating employment and income, and nursing is the predominant occupation in the healthcare industry with more than 4.031 million active, licensed RNs in the United States in 2014. The Nursing Workforce Development Programs provide training for entry-level and advanced degree nurses to improve the access to, and quality of, healthcare in underserved areas. The Title VIII nursing education programs are fundamental to the infrastructure delivering quality, cost-effective healthcare. The NLN applauds the subcommittee's bipartisan efforts to recognize that a strong nursing workforce is essential to a health policy that provides high-value care for every dollar invested in capacity building for a 21st century nurse workforce. The current Federal funding falls short of the healthcare inequities facing our Na- tion. Absent consistent support, slight boosts to Title VIII will not fulfill the expecta-tion of generating quality health outcomes, nor will episodic increases in funding fill the gap generated by a 15-year nurse and nurse faculty shortage felt throughout the U.S. health system. The Nurse Pipeline and Education Capacity Although the recession resulted in some stability in the short-term for the nurse workforce, policy makers must not lose sight of the long-term growing demand for nurses in their districts and States. The NLN's findings from its Annual Survey of Schools of Nursing\u2014Academic Year 2011-2012 cast a wide net on all types of nurs-ing programs, from diploma through doctoral, to determine rates of application, en-rollment, and graduation. This data can be found at http://www.nln.org/ researchgrants/slides/index.htm. Key findings include: \u2014Demand for spots in nursing education programs historically outstripped sup- ply. In 2012, 43 and 37 percent of master's and doctoral nursing programs, re-spectively, rejected qualified applicants. More dramatically, 72 percent of pro-grams offering practical nursing (PN) degrees and 84 percent offering associ-ate's degrees in [registered] nursing programs (ADN) were forced to turn away qualified candidates, as did almost two-thirds (64 percent) of baccalaureate in science of [registered] nursing (BSN) programs. The aggregate rate across all basic RN programs was 28 percent of qualified applications not accepted in the Fall 2012. \u2014Expansion of nursing education programs impeded by shortage of faculty. Deans and directors of schools providing programs that did not accept all eligible appli-cants were asked to identify the primary obstacle to expanding their program's capacity. Since 2010, the percentage of those directing ADN and PN programs that cited a shortage of clinical sites as the primary impediment to expansion has steadily increased. For PN programs in particular, the percentage jumped 587 to 51 percent in 2012. By contrast, graduate programs consistently cite a lack of faculty as the primary obstacle to expansion. A strong correlation exists be-tween the shortage of nurse faculty and the inability of nursing programs to keep pace with the demand for new nurse faculty and new RNs. Increasing the productivity of education programs is a high priority in most States, but faculty recruitment is a glaring problem. Without faculty to educate our future nurses, the shortage cannot be resolved. \u2014Age of associate degree students rises. A substantial increase in the percentage of ADN students who were over 30 years old occurred, rising in 2012 to 50 per-cent of the student nursing enrollments. Because ADN students comprise two- thirds of all pre-licensure RN enrollees, this uptick in enrollments among older students could reignite concerns over an aging nursing workforce and the poten-tial for future labor shortages. Equally Pressing Is Lack of Diversity Our Nation is enriched by cultural diversity\u201437 percent of our population identify as racial and ethnic minorities. Yet ethnic, cultural, and gender diversity eludes the nursing student and nurse educator populations. A survey of nurse educators con-ducted by the NLN and the Carnegie Foundation's Preparation for the Professions Program found that only 7 percent of nurse educators were minorities compared with 16 percent of all U.S. faculty. The lack of faculty diversity limits nursing schools' ability to deliver culturally appropriate health professions education. In ad-dition, the NLN survey for the 2011-2012 academic year reported that: \u2014African-American enrollment drops. The percentage of racial-ethnic minority students enrolled in pre-licensure RN programs has declined steadily over the past 2 years\u2014ultimately dropping from a high of 29 percent in 2009 to 24 per-cent in 2011 and up to 26 percent in 2012. The majority of that decline stems from a steep reduction in the percentage of African-American students enrolled in associate degree nursing programs, which dropped by almost 5 percent to 9 percent. BSN programs saw a small, but not significant drop, in African-Amer-ican enrollment, down from 13 to 12 percent. Inversely, diploma programs saw a sharp rise in African-American enrollments to 30 percent, but because they represent just 4 percent of all basic RN programs, the impact is not great. \u2014Hispanic representation, while still lagging, inches upward. Hispanics remain dramatically underrepresented among nursing students. Representing a mere 6 percent of associate degree and baccalaureate nursing students, Hispanics were enrolled in basic nursing programs at less than half the rate at which they were enrolled in undergraduate programs overall. However, the percentage of His-panics enrolled in post-licensure programs has nearly doubled at every level. \u2014Men's enrollment at historic high. While significantly less than the proportion in the U.S. population, at 15 percent, men enrolled in basic RN programs (i.e., 13 percent BSN, 16 percent diploma, and 16 percent ADN) remained at the his-toric high reached at the start of the recession. Approximately 11 percent of PN students, RN-to BSN students, master's, and doctoral students were male in 2012. Besides representing an untapped talent pool to remedy the nursing shortage, ethnic, cultural, and gender-diverse minorities in nursing are essential to developing a healthcare system that understands and addresses the needs of our rapidly diver-sifying population. Workforce diversity is needed where research indicates that fac-tors such as societal biases and stereotyping, communication barriers, limited cul-tural sensitivity and competence, and system and organizational determinants con-tribute to healthcare inequities. Title VIII Federal Funding Reality Today's undersupply of appropriately prepared nurses and nurse faculty, as well as the projected loss of experienced nurses over the next decade, does not bode well for our Nation. The Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Programs are a com-prehensive system of capacity-building strategies that provide students and schools of nursing with grants to strengthen education programs, including faculty recruit-ment and retention efforts, facility and equipment acquisition, clinical lab enhance-ments, and loans, scholarships, and services that enable students to overcome obsta-cles to completing their nursing education programs. A few examples of HRSA's Title VIII data below provide perspective on current Federal investments. Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP)\u2014BLS projects a need of 35 percent more faculty members to meet the expected increase in demand. In addition, with 10,200 current faculty members expected to retire, 34,200 new nursing instructors will be needed by 2022. NFLP supports the establishment and operation of a loan fund at participating schools of nursing to assist nurses in completing their graduate edu-588 cation to become qualified nurse faculty. Ongoing NFLP support for faculty produc- tion is critical to building the pipeline that assures the full capacity of the Nation's future nursing workforce. Targeting a portion of those funds for minority faculty preparation is fundamental to achieving that goal. In fiscal year 2012, NFLP grant-ees exceeded the program's performance target by 49.6 percent in providing loans to 2,259 students pursuing faculty preparation. About one out of every four students receiving the NFLP loans were considered underrepresented minorities. Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP)\u2014CGEP provides support to educate individuals in providing geriatric care for the elderly. This goal is accom-plished through curriculum development and dissemination, continuing education, and traineeships for individuals preparing for advanced nursing education degrees. In fiscal year 2012, CGEP grantees awarded traineeships to 74 students\u2014the major-ity of whom (81 percent) were pursuing a Master's Degree in Nursing. Nurse Education, Practice, Quality, and Retention Grants (NEPQR)\u2014NEPQR ad- dresses the critical nursing shortage via projects to expand the nursing pipeline, promote career mobility, provide continuing education, and support retention. Grants to support recruiting and retaining nursing assistants and personal and home care aides in occupational shortage and/or high demand areas trained 4,624 students during fiscal year 2012. NEPQR also supported expanding the size of BSN programs and supported nurse-managed health clinics. Nurse-Managed Health Clinics (NMHC) NMHCs are a nurse-practice arrangement, managed by advanced practice reg- istered nurses, that provides primary care or wellness services. NMHCs are associ-ated with a school, college, university, or department of nursing, federally qualified health center, or independent nonprofit health or social services agency. NMHCs deliver comprehensive primary healthcare services, disease prevention, and health promotion in medically underserved areas for vulnerable and specialized populations (e.g., veterans and/or families of active military). The complexity of care for these patients presents significant financial barriers, heavily affecting the sus-tainability of these clinics. While providing access points in areas where primary care providers are in short supply, expansion of NMHCs also increases the number of structured clinical teaching sites available to train nurses and other primary care providers. In fiscal year 2012, more than 1,600 health professions students were trained in NMHCs, where the majority of NMHCs and associated training sites were primarily located in medically underserved communities (97 percent) and served as a primary care setting for their local community (65 percent). Appro-priating $20 million in fiscal year 2015 to NMHCs would increase access to primary care for thousands of underserved people. The NLN can state with authority that the deepening health inequities, inflated costs, and poor quality of healthcare outcomes in this country will not be reversed until the concurrent shortages of nurses and qualified nurse educators are ad-dressed. Your support will help ensure that nurses exist in the future who are pre-pared and qualified to take care of you, your family, and all those who will need our care. Without national efforts of some magnitude to match the healthcare re-ality facing our Nation today, an under resourced nurse education and its adverse effect in healthcare generally will be difficult to avoid. The NLN urges the subcommittee to maintain the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Programs by funding them at a level of $251 million in fiscal year 2015. We also recommend that the Title III Nurse-Managed Health Clinics be fund-ed at $20 million in fiscal year 2015.

The Society submits this testimony to request insertion of language in the fiscal year 2015 Appropriations to direct the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fund MPS research. MPS diseases are rare genetic diseases that affect both children and adults. They cause progressive damage to cells in the body, resulting in severe disability and early death. There are currently few treatments and no cures. There are 11 types of MPS but only 4 FDA approved enzyme replacement therapy treatments to slow disease progression. The damage from MPS results in severe problems, including 589 profound intellectual disabilities, heart disease, vision loss, speech and hearing im- pairment, short stature, stiff joints, and pain, among others. MPS diseases are dev-astating for children and families, largely due to the progressive nature of the dis-eases. Babies are often born looking perfectly healthy. It is only later, as cell dam-age becomes worse, that parents receive the heartbreaking diagnosis. All MPS dis-eases are terminal with most affected individuals not surviving beyond teenage years. The National MPS Society is requesting the insertion of language specific to MPS and related diseases into the fiscal year 2015 Appropriations Bill. This language will help focus NIH research efforts related to MPS and related diseases. After several years of decreased funding, the NIH budget for MPS research increased between 2010 through 2013 but saw a significant decline in 2014 due to sequestration. Researchers focused on MPS diseases get almost all of their funding from the NIH. There is very little private funding for MPS and related diseases research. Al-though there are very few therapies for MPS diseases, the ones that are available are the result of NIH-funded research. Prominent researchers in the field believe that continued research holds the promise of effective treatments and cures for MPS diseases, including stem cell therapies, gene therapies, and small molecule thera-pies. Researchers are beginning to build momentum in their work on MPS diseases. Increased funding for MPS and related diseases research will ensure that this mo-mentum translates into progress toward new treatments and a cure. Reduced fund-ing stalls progress and prevents these critical gains. On behalf of the children and families impacted by MPS diseases, the National MPS Society respectfully requests the insertion of the following language into the fiscal year 2015 Appropriations Bill. Mucopolysaccharidoses: The Committee encourages the NINDS and NIDDK to ex- pand research efforts in the development of effective treatments for MPS diseases. The Committee commends the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and National In-stitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) for sponsoring sci-entific conferences like the Gordon Research Conference (April 2013) focusing on basic science of lysosomal biology and function but with strong emphasis on patho-genic mechanisms of lysosomal disease. The Committee further acknowledges and applauds the National Institutes of Health ORDR, NINDS and NIDDK for their work related to the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) over the next 5 years to fund research consortia including lysosomal diseases: mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), and MPS bone disease, helping to create additional opportunities for small research communities, such as the Lysosomal Disease Net-work, to address some of these clinical research needs. Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of genetic, progressive diseases that are caused by the absence or malfunctioning of certain enzymes needed to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans\u2014long chains of sugar carbohydrates in each of our cells. When mutations occur in the genes for the enzymes involved in the nor-mal turnover of Mucopolysaccharidoses, excess amounts of them are stored in the body, causing progressive damage to a number of different organs and tissues, and, in most cases, early death. There are no current cures for MPS, although stem cell transplants and enzyme replacement therapy show potential for reducing symptom severity. Treatment for the skeletal abnormalities remains a challenge due to the difficulty of introducing replacement enzymes or transplanted cells into skeletal tis-sues. Although the greatest benefit is likely to be discovered through MPS research supported by other NIH components, ongoing research at the NIAMS in other areas of skeletal research may help to inform the science base and potentially improve the quality of life of patients with the disease. Action taken or to be taken: The Committee encourages NINDS, ORDR and NIDDK to continue supporting scientific conferences in the Mucopolysaccharidoses and other Lysosomal Disease research community, such as the Lysosomal Disease Network's Annual WORLD Symposium. This international conference gives re-searchers an opportunity to share findings in basic, translational and clinical re-search and to establish collaborations that could enable multicenter studies in nat-ural history and other areas of clinical research. In addition, this Symposium pro-motes interaction among interested lay participants and medical and scientific ex-perts, in addition to representatives from pharmaceutical industry, involved in lysosomal diseases. The intent of the report language is to focus and encourage the National Insti- tutes of Health's efforts with respect to the direction of Mucopolysaccharidoses and other Lysosomal Disease related research. The language included annually in the LHHS report has consistently addressed some of the most pressing, scientific needs in this complex area of biomedical research. The outcome has been, and one would 590 hope continue to be, the Institutes examination of the issues raised by the Com- mittee so that it can make meaningful efforts to enhance NIH activity on these im-portant Mucopolysaccharidoses and Lysosomal Disease research issues. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony regarding funding of critically important Federal programs that impact those affected by multiple sclerosis. We urge the Subcommittee to pro-vide the following in fiscal year 2015: $2.5 million for the Lifespan Respite Care Program; at least $32 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH); robust sup-port for Medicare and Medicaid; and $12.6 billion for the Social Security Adminis-tration (SSA). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system that interrupts the flow of information within the brain, and be-tween the brain and body. Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blind-ness and paralysis. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted. Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with at least two to three times more women than men being diagnosed with the disease. The National MS Society sees itself as a partner to the Government in many crit- ical areas. As we advocate for NIH research, we do so as an organization that in 2013, funded approximately $48 million in MS research through funds generated through the Society's fundraising efforts. And as we advocate for Lifespan Respite funding, we do so as an organization that works to provide some level of respite re-lief for caregivers. So while we're here to advocate for Federal funding, we do it as an organization that commits tens of millions of dollars each year to similar or com-plementary efforts as those being funded by the Federal Government. Lifespan Respite Care Program Up to one quarter of individuals living with MS require long-term care services at some point during the course of the disease. Often, a family member steps into the role of primary caregiver. According to a 2011 AARP report, 61.6 million family caregivers provided care at some point during 2009 and the value of their uncom-pensated services was approximately $450 billion per year. Family caregivers allow the person living with MS to remain home for as long as possible and avoid pre-mature admission to costlier institutional facilities. Family caregiving, while essential, can be draining and stressful. A 2012 National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) survey of individuals providing care to people living with MS shows that on average, caregivers spend 24 hours a week providing care. Sixty 4 percent of caregivers were emotionally drained, 32 percent suffered from de-pression and 22 percent have lost a job due to caregiving responsibilities. The Lifespan Respite Care Program, enacted in 2006 under President Bush, pro- vides competitive grants to States to establish or enhance statewide lifespan respite programs that better coordinate and increase access to quality respite care. Respite offers professional short-term help to give caregivers a break from the stress of pro-viding care and has been shown to provide family caregivers with the relief nec-essary to maintain their own health and bolster family stability. Perhaps the most critical aspect of the program for people living with MS is that Lifespan Respite serves families regardless of special need or age\u2014literally across the lifespan. Much existing respite care has age eligibility requirements and since MS is typically diag-nosed between the ages of 20 and 50, Lifespan Respite programs are often the only open door to needed respite services. For these reasons, the National MS Society asks that Congress provide $2.5 mil- lion for the Lifespan Respite Care Program in fiscal year 2015. National Institutes of Health As mentioned previously, the National MS Society invested $48 million to MS re- search in 2013 and sees the NIH as an invaluable partner to stop MS in its tracks, restore function and end MS forever. Approximately $115 million of fiscal year 2013 was directed to MS-related research and over the years, NIH research projects have helped make significant progress in understanding MS. NIH scientists were among the first to report the value of MRI in detecting early signs of MS and have en-hanced knowledge about how the immune system works and its role in the develop-ment of MS lesions. Twenty years ago, there were no MS therapies or medications\u2014now there are ten. The NIH provided the basic research necessary so that these therapies could be de-veloped. Despite this progress, there are still no treatments approved for people liv-591 ing with progressive MS. Only with continued investment will the innovation mo- mentum continue, allowing us to find successful treatments for those with progres-sive MS and a cure for all. The NIH also directly supports jobs in all 50 States and 17 of the 30 fastest grow- ing occupations in the U.S. are related to medical research or healthcare. More than 83 percent of the NIH's funding is awarded through almost 50,000 competitive grants to more than 325,000 researchers at over 3,000 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every State. For these reasons, the Society urges Congress to provide at least $32 billion for the NIH in fiscal year 2015. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare: It is estimated that over 20 percent of the MS population relies on Medicare as its primary insurer. The majority of these individuals are under the age of 65 and receive the Medicare benefit as a result of their disability. Of particular importance to the MS community are: having appropriate reimbursement levels for Medicare physicians, maintaining access to diagnostics and durable medical equip-ment, protecting access to needed speech, physical and occupational therapy serv-ices, and discouraging overly burdensome cost-sharing for prescription drugs. Medicaid: Medicaid provides comprehensive health coverage to over eight million persons living with disabilities, plus six million persons with disabilities who rely on Medicaid to fill Medicare's gaps. The latest statistics (which are pre-recession) show that about 5-10 percent of people with MS have Medicaid coverage. The most recently available data (2007) reveals that the average annual direct and indirect (e.g. lost wages) cost for someone with MS in the U.S. is approximately $69,000. After years of paying to manage their disease, some people with MS have spent the vast majority of their earnings and savings, making their financial situation so dire that Medicaid becomes their only option for health coverage. The National MS Society urges Congress to maintain funding for Medicaid and reject proposals to cap or block grant the program. Any of these proposals would merely shift costs to States, forcing States to shoulder a seemingly insurmountable financial burden or cut services on which our most vulnerable rely. The Society also urges Congress to protect and promote access to home- and community-based care in line with the 1999 U.S. Supreme Court decision Olmstead. Social Security Administration Because of the unpredictable nature and sometimes serious impairment caused by the disease, SSA recognizes MS as a chronic illness or ''impairment'' that can cause disability severe enough to prevent an individual from working. During such peri-ods, people living with MS are entitled to and rely on Social Security Disability In-surance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits to survive. The Na-tional MS Society urges Congress to provide $12.3 billion for the SSA's administra-tive budget so that it can continue efforts to reduce hearings and disability backlogs, pay monthly benefits in a timely manner, and determine post-entitlement issues in a timely manner. Conclusion The National MS Society thanks the Committee for the opportunity to provide written testimony and our recommendations for fiscal year 2015 appropriations. The agencies and programs we have discussed are of vital importance to people living with MS and we look forward to continuing to working with the Committee to help move us closer to a world free of MS. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Specifically, NNCC and its members request an appropriation of $20 million to support grants to nurse-managed health clinics through the Nurse Managed Health Clinic grant program under the Health Resources and Services Administra-tion's Bureau of Primary Health Care in the Department of Health and Human Services. 592 1Public Health Services Act, 42 USC \u00a7 254(c)-1a(e) (2014). 2American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC).

NNCC is a 501(c)(3) member association of nonprofit, nurse-managed health clin- ics, sometimes called nurse-managed health centers or NMHCs. Section 254(c)- 1a(a)(2) of the Public Health Services Act defines ''nurse-managed health clinic'' as ''a nurse practice arrangement, managed by advanced practice nurses, that provides primary care or wellness services to underserved or vulnerable populations and that is associated with a school, college, university or department of nursing, federally qualified health center (FQHC), or independent nonprofit health or social services agency.'' Currently, there are approximately 250 NMHCs in operation throughout the United States. Section 254(c)-1a also mandates the creation of a Nurse Man-aged Health Clinic grant program and authorizes $50 million in grant funding. 1The NMHC grant program was established to provide these clinics with a stable source of Federal funding that would place them on footing similar to other safety-net pro-viders. However, to date, funding for the grant program has not been appropriated. The Value of NMHCs and the Need for NMHC Grant Funding NMHCs Expand Primary Care Workforce Capacity .\u2014The Nation is facing a pri- mary care crisis that is about to get worse. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), by 2025 there will be a dearth of 130,600 physicians, which includes a shortage of 65,800 primary care physicians. 2AAMC data also shows that American medical schools are not graduating enough doctors to meet this need. 3The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Medicaid expansion called for by the ACA will lead to 11 million new enrollees.4As these new enrollees establish primary care homes, the burden on the primary care workforce is likely to increase dramatically. Data from Massachusetts shows just how bad the problem could get. A study conducted 2 years after expanding its public coverage found that only 52 percent of internists in Massachusetts were accepting new patients and one- third of family physicians were no longer accepting new patients. 5 NMHCs are primarily managed by nurse practitioners, which make up the fastest growing segment of primary care providers in the country. According to the Health Resources and Services Agency, the number of primary care NPs is expected to grow by 30 percent, from 55,400 in 2010 to 72,100 by 2020. 6Because of these growing numbers, policymakers across the country are calling for nurse practitioners and NMHCs to assume a greater role in primary care. For example, in its report, ''The Future of Nursing, Leading Change, Advancing Health,'' the Institute of Medicine (IOM) states, ''advanced practice registered nurses should be called upon to fulfill and expand their potential as primary care providers across practice settings based on their education and competency.'' 7When discussing the role of NMHCs, the IOM report says, ''Nurse-managed health clinics offer opportunities to expand access; pro-vide quality, evidence-based care; and improve outcomes for individuals who may not otherwise receive needed care.'' 8 Along with the IOM, the National Governor's Association (NGA) and the National Institute for Health Care Reform (NIHCR) both released reports identifying the greater use of nurse practitioners as a means of alleviating the pressure on the pri-mary care workforce and presenting NP scope of practice law and payment policy reform as important to ensuring comprehensive access to primary care. Most re-cently, in a 2013 study published in Health Affairs, the RAND Corporation projected 593 9Auerbach, D. I. (Nov. 2013).

Survey of NMHCs. that greater use of the nurse-managed health centers model could address the in- creased demand for primary care.9 As safety-net providers, NMHCs offer high quality primary care to medically un- derserved patients regardless of the patient's ability to pay. However, NMHCs are struggling financially and often lack access to FQHC money available to other safety net providers. Thus, the NMHC grant program was created, providing NMHCs with alternative Federal funding to ensure their continued ability to meet the needs of their patients and communities. Because they already serve a high percentage of Medicaid patients, the clinics are positioned to not only absorb demand from the newly ensured but also fill gaps in care resulting from the fragmented application of Medicaid expansion. To lessen the primary care crisis and ensure the underserved can take full advan- tage of the care NMHCs offer, NNCC requests that the Subcommittee appropriate funding to the NMHC grant program. Evidence suggests that funding NMHCs will not only expand access but also lower the cost of care. In addition to lower labor costs, research shows that NMHCs decrease costs by reducing unnecessary emer-gency room visits and hospitalizations. 10 NMHCs Help Educate the Health Professionals of Tomorrow .\u2014FQHC funding is often unavailable to NMHCs, because many are affiliated with academic schools of nursing. Academically-affiliated NMHCs operate under the jurisdiction of a univer-sity, so most cannot meet FQHC governance requirements without breaking their academic connection and giving up their clinical programs. Ironically, it is these aca-demic affiliations that make the NMHC model especially responsive to primary care shortages, since they contribute to workforce development. NMHCs naturally serve as community-based clinical training sites for a diverse group of health profession students including those training to be registered nurses and advance practice nurses (mostly nurse practitioners) as well as medical, pharmacy, dental, social work, public health, and other students. In post-clinical focus groups, students re-port being ''overwhelmingly satisfied'' with their experience in NMHC clinical rota-tions, crediting, in part, the community-based experience absent from other clinical rotations. 11The Future of Nursing report also praised NMHC clinical programs for their interprofessional education, which relates to both job satisfaction and a flexible workforce. 12 In 2012, the NNCC conducted a survey of its members to measure their contribu- tion to health professions education. Twenty-eight NMHCs in a mix of urban, rural, and suburban communities reported providing educational opportunities for nearly 1,500 students. 13The average number of students educated by the NMHC grant funded clinics was 80, while the clinics participating in the 2012 survey reported educating an average of 55 students. These results demonstrate that (1) NMHCs ad-vance workforce development and (2) increased funding enhances the ability of NMHCs to offer educational opportunities. Despite the benefits of NMHC clinical programs, NMHC leaders are often forced to abandon this important piece of the NMHC model to qualify for FQHC funding. By providing an alternative source of funding for NMHCs, the Nurse-Managed Health Clinic grant program helps to preserve the contribution of NMHCs to work-force development. Given the country's growing need for nurses, NNCC respectfully requests that the subcommittee members appropriate funding to support clinical programs and place NMHCs on a similar footing with other safety-net providers through the NMHC grant program. In October of 2010, HRSA released $14.8 million in Prevention and Public Health Fund dollars to fund ten NMHC grants. In addition to serving over 27,000 patients and recording more than 72,000 encounters, the NMHC grantees have provided interdisciplinary clinical training to over 800 health profession students annually. 14 Request .\u2014The 10 NMHC grants distributed in 2010 will expire this year if Con- gress does not move to appropriate funding to the program. NNCC respectfully re-quests an appropriation of $20 million in fiscal year 2015 for the Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Grant Program, as authorized under Title III of the Public Health Service Act. 594 [This statement was submitted by Tine Hansen-Turton, CEO, National Nursing Centers Consortium.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL RESPITE COALITION Mr. Chairman, I am Jill Kagan, Chair of the National Respite Coalition (NRC), a network of respite providers, family caregivers, national, State and local agencies and organizations who support respite. Thirty State respite coalitions are also affili-ated with the NRC. This statement is presented on behalf of these organizations. The NRC also facilitates the Lifespan Respite Task Force, a coalition of over 100 national, State and local groups who support the Lifespan Respite Program and its continued funding. We are requesting that the Subcommittee include $2.5 million for the Lifespan Respite Care Program administered by ACL/AoA in the fiscal year 2015 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill or designate this amount from the Prevention and Public Health Fund as recommended in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget. This amount is only modestly above the current fiscal year 2014 level of $2.3. This will enable: \u2014State replication of best practices in Lifespan Respite to allow family caregivers, regardless of the care recipient's age or disability, to have access to affordable respite, and to be able to continue to play the significant role in long-term care that they are fulfilling today, saving Medicaid billions; \u2014Improvement in the quality of respite services currently available; \u2014Expansion of respite capacity to serve more families by building new and en- hancing current respite options, including recruitment and training of respite workers and volunteers; and \u2014Greater consumer direction by providing family caregivers with training and in- formation on how to find, use and pay for respite services. WHO NEEDS RESPITE? A 2012 national survey from the Pew Research Center found that four in ten adults in the U.S. are caring for an adult or child with significant health issues, up from 30 percent in 2010 (Fox, S, et al, 2013). The estimated economic value of the unpaid contributions of family caregivers caring for someone over the age of 18 is approximately $450 billion. This amount is more than total Medicaid spending, including both Federal and State contributions for healthcare and long-term services and supports. If parents caring for children with special needs are also considered, another $50 to $100 billion would be added to the economic value of family caregiving (AARP Public Policy Institute, 2011). Family caregiving is not just an aging issue, but also a lifespan one. While the aging population is growing rapidly, the majority of family caregivers are caring for someone under age 75 (56 percent); 28 percent of family caregivers care for someone between the ages of 50-75, and 28 percent care for someone under age 50 (National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and AARP, 2009). Many family caregivers are in the sandwich generation\u201446 percent of women who are caregivers of an aging family member and 40 percent of men also have children under the age of 18 at home (Aumann, K, and Galinsky, E, 2008). And 6.7 million children are in the primary custody of an aging grandparent or other relative. Families of the wounded warriors, military personnel who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with traumatic brain injuries and other serious chronic and debilitating conditions, don't have full access to respite. Even with enactment of the VA Family Caregiver Support Program which serves only veterans since 9/11, the need for res-pite will remain high for all veterans and their family caregivers. Caregivers whose veterans have PTSD are about half as likely as other caregivers to receive respite (11 percent vs. 20 percent) (NAC, November 2010). Sixty-eight percent of veterans' caregivers reported their situation as highly stressful compared to 31 percent of caregivers nationally, and three times as many say there is a high degree of phys-ical strain (40 percent vs. 14 percent) (NAC, 2010). Veterans' caregivers specifically asked for up-to-date lists of respite providers in their communities and help to find services, the very thing Lifespan Respite is charged to provide (NAC, 2010). National, State and local surveys have shown respite to be the most frequently requested service of the Nation's family caregivers (The Arc, 2011; National Family Caregivers Association, 2011). Other than financial assistance for caregiving through direct vouchers payments or tax credits, respite is the number one national policy related to service delivery that family caregivers prefer (NAC and AARP, 2009). Yet respite is unused, in short supply, inaccessible, or unaffordable to a ma-jority of the Nation's family caregivers. The NAC 2009 survey found that despite the fact that among the most frequently reported unmet needs of family caregivers 595 were ''finding time for myself'' (32 percent), ''managing emotional and physical stress'' (34 percent), and ''balancing work and family responsibilities'' (27 percent), nearly 90 percent of family caregivers across the lifespan are not receiving respite services at all. An estimated 80 percent of all long-term care in the U.S. is provided at home. This percentage will only rise in the coming decades with greater life expectancies of individuals with disabling and chronic conditions living with their aging parents or other caregivers, the aging of the baby boom generation, and the decline in the percentage of the frail elderly who are entering nursing homes. RESPITE BARRIERS AND THE EFFECT ON FAMILY CAREGIVERS Barriers to accessing respite include reluctance to ask for help, fragmented and narrowly targeted services, cost, and the lack of information about respite or how to find or choose a provider. Even when respite is an allowable funded service, a critically short supply of well-trained respite providers may prohibit a family from making use of a service they so desperately need. Lifespan Respite is designed to help States eliminate these barriers through improved coordination and capacity building. While most families take great joy in helping their family members to live at home, it has been well documented that family caregivers experience physical and emotional problems directly related to their caregiving responsibilities. In a 2009 survey of family caregivers, a majority (51 percent) who are caring for someone over age 18 have medium or high levels of burden of care, measured by the number of activities of daily living with which they provide assistance, and 31 percent were identified as ''highly stressed'' (NAC and AARP, 2009). Parents of children with spe-cial healthcare needs report poorer general health, more physical health problems, worse sleep, and increased depressive symptoms compared to parents of typically developing (TD) children (McBean, A and Schlosnagle, L, 2013). A family caregiver's declining health status is a risk factor for care recipient insti- tutionalization. When caregivers lack effective coping styles or are depressed, care recipients may be at risk for falling, developing preventable secondary health condi-tions or limitations in functional abilities. The risk of abuse from caregivers among care recipients with significant needs increases when caregivers themselves are de-pressed or in poor health (American Psychological Association, nd). Supports that would ease family caregiver stress, most importantly respite, are too often out of reach or completely unavailable. Restrictive eligibility criteria also preclude many families from receiving services or continuing to receive services for which they once were eligible. Children with disabilities will age out of the system when they turn 21 and they will lose many of the services, such as respite. A survey of nearly 5000 caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabil-ities (I/DD) conducted by The Arc found: the vast majority of caregivers report that they are suffering from physical fatigue (88 percent), emotional stress (81 percent) and emotional upset or guilt (81 percent) some or most of the time; 1 out of 5 fami-lies (20 percent) report that someone in the family had to quit their job to stay home and support the needs of their family member; and more than 75 percent of family caregivers caring for adult children with developmental disabilities could not find respite services (The Arc, 2011). Respite may not exist at all in some States for indi-viduals with Alzheimer's, those under age 60 with conditions such as ALS, MS, spi-nal cord or traumatic brain injuries, or children with serious emotional conditions. RESPITE BENEFITS FAMILIES AND IS COST SAVING Respite has been shown to be an effective way to reduces stress and improve the health and well-being of family caregivers that in turn helps avoid or delay out-of- home placements, such as nursing homes or foster care, minimizes the precursors that can lead to abuse and neglect, and strengthens marriages and family stability. A recent study of parents of children with autism spectrum disorders found that res-pite care was associated with reduced stress and improved marital quality (Harper, Amber, et al, 2013). A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report pre-pared by the Urban Institute found that reducing key stresses on caregivers, such as physical strain and financial hardship, through services such as respite would reduce nursing home entry (Spillman and Long, USDHHS, 2007). In a survey of caregivers of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), two-thirds said that respite would help keep their loved one at home. When the care recipient with MS also has cognitive impairment, the percentage of those saying respite would be helpful to avoid or delay nursing home placement jumps to 75 percent (NAC, 2012). The budgetary benefits that accrue because of respite are just as compelling. De- laying a nursing home placement for just one individual with Alzheimer's or other 596 chronic condition for several months can save Medicaid and other government pro- grams thousands of dollars. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania studied the records of over 28,000 children with autism ages 5 to 21 who were enrolled in Medicaid in 2004. They concluded that for every $1,000 States spent on respite serv-ices in the previous 60 days, there was an 8 percent drop in the odds of hospitaliza-tion (Mandell, David S., et al, 2012). In the private sector, U.S. businesses lose from $17.1 billion to $33.6 billion per year in lost productivity of family caregivers (MetLife Mature Market Institute, 2006). Higher absenteeism alone among working caregivers costs the U.S. economy an estimated $25.2 billion in lost productivity per year (Witters, D., 2011). Respite for working family caregivers could help improve job performance and employers could potentially save billions. LIFESPAN RESPITE CARE PROGRAM WILL HELP The Federal Lifespan Respite program is administered by the Administration for Community Living (ACL), Administration on Aging (AoA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ACL/AoA provides competitive grants to eligible State agencies in concert with Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) working in collaboration with State respite coalitions or respite organizations. Con-gress appropriated $2.5 million each year from fiscal year 2009\u2014fiscal year 2012 and a slightly lower amount due to sequestration in fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014. Since 2009, 32 States and the District of Columbia each received three-year $200,000 start-up Lifespan Respite Grants. Nine States and DC received one-time $150,000 expansion grants to focus on direct services, especially for those who are unserved. In the last 2 years, many of the States received 17-month Integration and Sustainability grants to continue their important work. The purpose of the law is to expand and enhance respite services, improve coordi- nation, and improve respite access and quality. States are required to establish State and local coordinated Lifespan Respite care systems to serve families regard-less of age or special need, provide new planned and emergency respite services, train and recruit respite workers and volunteers and assist caregivers in gaining ac-cess to services. Those eligible would include family members, foster parents or other adults providing unpaid care to adults who require care to meet basic needs or prevent injury and to children who require care beyond that required by children generally to meet basic needs. Lifespan Respite, defined as a coordinated system of community-based respite services, helps States use limited resources across age and disability groups more effectively. Provider pools can be recruited, trained and shared, administrative bur-dens reduced by coordinating resources, and savings used to fund new respite serv-ices for families who do not qualify for any Federal or State program. HOW IS LIFESPAN RESPITE PROGRAM MAKING A DIFFERENCE? With limited funds, Lifespan Respite grantees are engaged in innovative activities such as: \u2014In TN and RI, the Lifespan Respite program is building respite capacity by ex- panding volunteer networks of providers by recruiting University students or Senior Corps volunteers or expanding the national TimeBanks model for estab-lishing voluntary family cooperative respite strategies. \u2014In Texas, the Lifespan Respite program has established a statewide Respite Co- ordination Center, and an online database. \u2014In SC, the State respite coalition and the Lifespan Respite program are partnering in new ways with the untapped faith community to provide respite, especially in rural areas. \u2014The North Carolina Lifespan Respite Program has challenged each of its 100 counties to improve respite service delivery locally, and has partnered with the Money Follows the Person program to develop family caregiver peer-to-peer sup-port and respite. \u2014In NH, new providers have been recruited and trained through partnerships with the NH National Alliance on Mental Illness, New Hampshire Family Voices, and the College of Direct Support with funding from the Department of Labor to expand the pool of respite providers to work with teens and older indi-viduals with mental health conditions or other groups where respite is in short supply. \u2014The AZ Lifespan Respite program housed in Division of Aging and Adult Serv- ices has partnered with their State's Children with Special Health Care Needs Program to provide respite vouchers to families in need across the age and dis-ability spectrum. 597 \u2014The OK Lifespan Respite program partnered with their State's Federal Transit Administration's Section 5310 transportation authority to release a van no longer needed to develop mobile respite to serve isolated rural areas of the State. Across the board, States are building respite registries and ''no wrong door sys- tems'' in collaboration with State respite coalitions and ADRCs to help family care-givers access respite and funding sources. OK, AL, NV, TN and others are using Lifespan Respite grants to expand or implement participant-directed respite through voucher systems so that family caregivers have greater control over the type and quality of the respite they select. State grantees secure commitments from partnering State agencies to share information and coordinate resources to build a seamless Lifespan Respite system for accessing respite. Funding must be maintained to help sustain these innovative State efforts. The goal of Lifespan Respite System is to coordinate respite services and funding, maxi-mize existing resources and leverage new dollars in both the public and private sec-tors to build respite capacity and serve the unserved, but States need more time and fiscal support to do so. Maintaining funding for the program in fiscal year 2015 could allow several new States to start Lifespan Respite Programs and help assist at least a few of the remaining grantees to complete the work that they have start-ed. As it is, given the limited funding for fiscal year 2014, only 1-2 new States and 5-8 of the current grantees are expected to be funded. States are working success-fully with ARCH to develop comprehensive sustainability plans, but without Federal support, many of the grantees will be cut off before they have had a chance to have a lasting impact. No other Federal program mandates respite as its sole focus, helps ensure respite quality or choice, and allows funds for respite start-up, training or coordination to address accessibility and affordability issues for families. With tens of millions of families affected, caregiving is a public health issue requiring an immediate proven preventive response, such as respite. We urge you to include at least $2.5 million in the fiscal year 2015 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill or designate this amount in the Prevention and Public Health Fund. This will allow Lifespan Respite Programs to be replicated and sustained. Families, with access to respite, will be able to maintain their own health and well-being and continue to play the significant role that they are fulfilling today. [This statement was submitted by Jill Kagan, Chair, National Respite Coalition.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION The National Rural Health Association (NRHA) is pleased to provide the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Sub-committee with a statement for the record on fiscal year 2015 funding levels for pro-grams with a significant impact on the health of rural Americans. NRHA is a national nonprofit membership organization with a diverse collection of 21,000 individuals and organizations who share a common interest in rural health. The Association's mission is to improve the health of rural Americans and to provide leadership on rural health issues through advocacy, communications, edu-cation and research. NRHA is advocating support for a group of rural health program that assist rural communities in maintaining and building a strong healthcare delivery system into the future. Most importantly, these programs help increase the capacity of the rural healthcare delivery system and true safety net providers. Rural Americans, on aver-age, are poorer, sicker and older than their urban counterparts. Programs in the rural health safety net increase access to healthcare, help communities create new health programs for those in need and train the future health professionals that will care for the 62 million rural Americans. With modest investments, these programs evaluate, study and implement quality improvement programs and health informa-tion technology systems. Important rural health programs supported by NRHA are outlined below. Rural Health Outreach and Network Grants provide capital investment for plan- ning and launching innovative projects in rural communities that later become self- sufficient. These grants are unique in the Federal system as they allow the commu-nity to build a program around their needs. These grants award funding to develop needed formal, integrated networks of providers that deliver primary and acute services. The grants have led to projects including information technology networks, oral screenings, and preventative care. Due to the community nature of the grants and a focus on self-sustainability after the terms of the grant have run out\u201485 per-598 cent of the Outreach Grantees continue to deliver services 5 full years after Federal funding ended. Request: $62.7 million. Rural Health Research and Policy Grants form the Federal infrastructure for rural health policy. Without these funds, rural America has no coordinated voice in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In addition to the expertise provided to agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, this line item also funds rural health research centers across the country. Additionally, we urge the Subcommittee to include in report language instructions to the Office of Rural Health Policy to direct additional funding to the State rural health associa-tions. Request: $10.3 million. State Offices of Rural Health are the State counterparts to the Federal rural health research and policy efforts, and form the State infrastructure for rural health policy. They assist States in strengthening rural healthcare delivery systems by maintaining a focal point for rural health within each State and by linking small rural communities with State and Federal resources to develop long term solutions to rural health problems. Without these funds, States would have diminished capac-ity to administer many of the critical rural health programs. The State offices play a key role in assisting rural health clinics, community health centers, and small, rural hospitals assess community healthcare needs. This program creates a State focus for rural health interests, brings technical assistance to rural areas, and helps frontier communities tap State and national resources available for healthcare and economic development. In partnership with other State agencies, the State rural health offices have been essential in addressing the unique needs of rural commu-nities. Request: $11.1 million. Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants fund quality improvement and emergency med- ical service projects for Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) across the country. The BBA created this essential program to improve access to essential healthcare serv-ices by CAHs, rural hospital networks and rural emergency medical services. These grants allow statewide coordination and provide expertise to CAHs for quality im-provement or information technology activities. Also funded in this line is the Small Hospital Improvement Program (SHIP), which provides grants to more than 1,500 small rural hospitals (50 beds or less) across the country to help improve their busi-ness operations, focus on quality improvement and to ensure compliance provisions related to health information privacy. Request: $47.7 million. Rural and Community Access to Emergency Devices assist communities in pur- chasing emergency devices and training potential first responders in their use. Defibrillators double a victim's chance of survival after sudden cardiac arrest, which an estimated 163,221 Americans experience every year. This program trains lay res-cuers and first responders in their use and places them in public areas where sud-den cardiac arrest is likely to occur. Request: $3.7 million. The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth supports distance-provided clinical services and is designed to reduce the isolation of rural providers, foster integrated delivery systems through network development and test a range of telehealth appli-cations. Long-term, telehealth promises to improve the health of millions of Ameri-cans, provide constant education to isolated rural providers and save money through reduced office visits and hospital care. The OAT leads, coordinates and promotes the use of telehealth technologies by fostering partnerships between Federal agencies, States and private sector groups to create telehealth projects. These approaches are still new and unfolding and continued investment in the infrastructure and develop-ment is needed. Request: $15.3 million. National Health Service Corps (NHSC) plays a critical role in providing primary healthcare services to rural underserved populations by placing healthcare providers in our Nation's most underserved communities. Investment in our healthcare work-force is absolutely vital to support the newly insured population resulting from health reform and the long-term underserved in isolated rural communities. Pro-grams like the NHSC help maximize the capacity of our health system to care for patients. The demand for primary care providers far exceeds the supply, and the needs of our rural communities continue to grow. The NRHA supports the Presi-dent's request to ensure that the NHSC has access to the dedicated funding through the CHC Fund. Frontier Community Health Integration Demonstration Program (F-CHIP) funds development and testing of new models for the delivery of healthcare services in frontier areas through improving access and integration of the delivery of healthcare to Medicare beneficiaries. Frontier Extended Stay Clinic (FESC) a geographically isolated medical clinic de- signed to provide primary, emergency, and extended-stay care 24 hours per day when hospital services are not readily available. The Federal Office of Rural Health 599 Policy (ORHP) has provided funding for infrastructure development to four clinics in Alaska. Title VII Health Professions Training Programs (with a significant rural focus): \u2014Area Health Education and Centers (AHECs) financially support and encourage those training to become healthcare professionals to practice in rural areas. Without this experience and support while in medical school, far fewer profes-sionals would make the commitment to rural areas and facilities including Com-munity Health Centers, Rural Health Clinics and rural hospitals. The AHEC Programs and Centers play a critical national role in addressing healthcare workforce shortages, particularly those in primary care through an established infrastructure. The program grantees support the recruitment and retention of physicians, students, faculty and other primary care providers in rural and medically underserved areas by providing local, community-based, interdiscipli-nary primary care training. Educating and training rural healthcare providers ensures a sound future in the delivery of rural healthcare. It has been esti-mated that nearly half of AHECs would shut down without Federal funding. Request: $75 million. \u2014Rural Physician Pipeline Grants will help medical colleges develop special rural training programs and recruit students from rural communities, who are more likely to return to their home regions to practice. This ''grow-your-own'' ap-proach is one of the best and most cost-effective ways to ensure a robust rural workforce into the future. Request: $4.4 million. \u2014Geriatric Programs train health professionals in geriatrics, including funding for Geriatric Education Centers (GEC). There are currently 47 GECs nationwide that ensure access to appropriate and quality healthcare for seniors. Rural America has a disproportionate share of the elderly and could see a shortage of health providers without this program. Request: $36.7 million. The National Rural Health Association appreciates the opportunity to provide our recommendations to the Subcommittee. These programs are critical to the rural health delivery system and help maintain access to high quality care in rural com-munities. We greatly appreciate the support of the Subcommittee and look forward to working with Members of the Subcommittee to continue making these important investments in rural health. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL SAFETY COUNCIL Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding the National Safety Council's workplace safety appropriations priorities. My name is Jim Johnson, and I am Vice President of Workplace Safety Initiatives at the National Safety Council. We are a 100 year-old Congressionally chartered nonprofit safety organization dedi-cated to saving lives by preventing injuries and deaths at work, in homes and com-munities, and on the roads through leadership, research, education, and advocacy. Our more than 14,000 member companies represent over 8 million employees at more than 51,000 worksites. Today I am seeking support for $565.01 million for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and $332.86 million for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), two organizations whose work is vitally important to the mission of safety. Occupational Safety and Health Administration The National Safety Council believes that an effective and efficient OSHA is im- portant for the safety of American workers and workplaces. NSC supports stable funding for OSHA that adequately funds all the agency's key functions, including compliance assistance and support to companies striving for safety excellence, the timely promulgation of regulations to protect America's workers, enforcement ac-tions against companies that fail to comply with OSHA standards, and whistle blow-er protection for workers. The Council supports the top line funding level of $565.01 million for the agency included in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget request, and we strongly encour-age the committee to fund the agency at a minimum of this funding level. While the Council is pleased that OSHA rulemaking and enforcement efforts in fiscal year 2014 have been restored to pre-sequester funding levels, we continue to have strong concerns about funding constraints placed on the agency's Federal compliance as-sistance efforts, which are presently funded at $69.4 million, more than 9 percent less than fiscal year 2012 enacted levels. Of special concern to the Council is the impact that reduced compliance assistance funding has had on the agency's Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). We encour-600 1U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. (2013).

Injury Facts \u00ae, 2013 Edition. age the committee to include report language recommending that VPP receive no less than $3 million in fiscal year 2015. VPP were created by OSHA in 1982 as a way of recognizing those employers who successfully implement effective safety and health management systems and main-tain injury and illness rates below the national average for their industries. Under VPP, company stakeholders establish a relationship with OSHA based on a coopera-tive partnership. Because of this, approval into VPP is as much a proactive effort as it is recognition of hard work and effort put in by employers and employees to achieve exceptional records in occupational safety and health. The pursuit of VPP status has helped many safety professionals encourage their employers' leadership to improve safety management systems by complying with the program's criteria. Organizations with VPP status represent business leaders who have implemented strong safety management systems and demonstrated a commit-ment to continuous improvement. VPP sites have a Days Away Restricted or Trans-ferred (DART) case rate of 52 percent below the industry average. The majority of VPP sites have less than 100 employees. However, despite the success of this program, recent budget constraints have re- quired the agency to slow the growth in the number of new cooperative program participants. Following sequestration in fiscal year 2013, OSHA only reapproved sites that could be visited through local travel. As it stands, OSHA is not scheduling new VPP site approvals until a region's backlog of re-approvals of existing VPP fa-cilities is eliminated. Minimum funding at a level of at least $3 million will ensure that OSHA has the resources necessary to address the backlog of re-approvals of existing VPP facilities and to begin to approve new VPP sites. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Funding NIOSH at the fiscal year 2014 program level of $332.86 million at a min- imum, and preserving the fiscal year 2014 level of $24 million for the Institute's Ag-riculture, Forestry and Fishing (AgFF) Sector Program and $27.5 million for the Education and Research Centers (ERCs), is essential to ensuring that NIOSH can fulfill its mission of saving lives and preventing injuries. Finally, I would like to focus on the important role that NIOSH programs play in reducing workplace injuries and fatalities. NIOSH's primary responsibility is to conduct research and make recommendations for the prevention of work-related in-juries and illnesses. NIOSH works to ensure the health and safety of the American workforce through research, education and training. It is not a regulatory agency, and can only issue recommendations for health and safety standards. The Council is disheartened to see the President's budget request again target the Institute's Ag-riculture, Forestry and Fishing (AgFF) Sector Program and Education and Research Centers (ERCs) by eliminating their budget. NIOSH established the AgFF program in 1990 in response to evidence that agri- cultural workers were suffering higher rates of injury and illness than other U.S. workers. The agriculture, forestry, and fishing, industry fatality rate is more than 8 times that of the all-industry average. Yearly, almost 18,000 workers in this sector are injured seriously enough to require time away from work. 1Daily, an average of over 330 workers in this sector sustain injuries serious enough to require medical consultation, and nearly 2 workers die from an injury suffered at work. 2Today, the initiative includes nine regional centers and one national center to address chil-dren's farm safety. These centers conduct vital research leading to evidence-based standards that save lives. The AgFF Program is the only substantive Federal effort to meet the obligation to ensure safe conditions for workers in this sector, and it is effective. NIOSH supports education and research in occupational health through academic degree programs and research opportunities, primarily through 18 university-based ERCs located at leading universities around the country serving all 50 States. The mission of the ERCs is to reduce work-related injuries and illnesses in the U.S. by performing prevention research and by educating, through degree programs and continuing education, high-quality professionals who implement programs to im-prove occupational health and safety and minimize the dangers faced by workers across the country. The ERCs provide programs in a unique group of disciplines that benefit employers of all sizes and industries in every part of the country. Currently, the ERCs are responsible for supplying a good portion of the country's OSH grad-uates who will go on to fill professional roles. With an aging occupational safety and 601 health workforce, and a shortage of qualified OSH professionals, ERCs are essential to educating the next generation of professionals. Thank you again for the opportunity to submit testimony for the record. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF AND ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2015 budget request for the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), one of nine colleges of the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), in Rochester, N.Y. Created by Congress by Public Law 89-36 in 1965, we provide university tech-nical and professional education for students who are deaf and hard of hearing, leading to successful careers in high-demand fields for a sub-population of individ-uals historically facing high rates of unemployment and under-employment. We also provide baccalaureate and graduate-level education for hearing students in profes-sions serving deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. NTID students live, study and socialize with more than 17,000 hearing students on the RIT campus. Budget Request On behalf of NTID, for fiscal year 2015 I would like to request $66,291,000 in Op- erations. NTID has worked hard to manage its resources carefully and responsibly and as such is not requesting an increase in support in 2015. Over the past 2 years we have reduced our workforce by 12 percent (70 positions) and limited our equip-ment expenditures. We also reduced our non-personnel expenditures by over 30 per-cent in such areas as building and equipment maintenance, instructional supplies, freelance interpreting, professional travel and student employment. NTID has also postponed requests for construction funding for critical and long overdue renova-tions to a 33-year old building currently housing three times the number of staff for which it was intended. In terms of non-Federal revenues, from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2014, student tuition and fees increased by 63 percent to offset the rising costs of providing a state-of-the-art college education. Likewise, from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2013, NTID raised almost $20 million in support from indi-viduals and organizations. Our fiscal year 2015 request to continue fiscal year 2014 funding of $66,291,000 in Operations would allow us to maintain a balanced budget and avoid harmful re-ductions. Without this funding, we would have to impose additional limitations in the areas of equipment purchasing, interpreting and captioning, scholarship sup-port, building maintenance, and, most importantly, in personnel and enrollment. These are not the consequences a successful Federal investment should face. Enrollment Truly a national program, NTID has enrolled students from all 50 States. In Fall 2013 (fiscal year 2014), we attracted 1,432, the sixth straight year of more than 1,400 students. For fiscal year 2015, NTID hopes to maintain this high enrollment, if our operational resources allow us to do so. Our enrollment history over the last 8 years is shown below: NTID ENROLLMENTS: FISCAL YEAR 2007\u2014FISCAL YEAR 2014 Fiscal Year Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing Students Hearing Students Grand Total Undergrad Grad RIT MSSE Sub-Total Interpreting Program MSSE Sub-Total 2014 ......................... 1,432 2013 ......................... 1,269 37 25 1,331 167 31 198 1,529 2012 ......................... 1,281 42 31 1,354 160 33 193 1,547 2011 ......................... 1,263 40 29 1,332 147 42 189 1,521 2010 ......................... 1,237 38 32 1,307 138 29 167 1,474 2009 ......................... 1,212 48 24 1,284 135 31 166 1,450 2008 ......................... 1,103 51 31 1,185 130 28 158 1,343 2007 ......................... 1,017 47 31 1,095 130 25 155 1,250 MSSE: Master of Science in Secondary Education of Deaf/Hard of Hearing Stu- dents Grad RIT: other graduate programs at RIT 602 NTID Academic Programs NTID offers high quality, career-focused associate degree programs preparing stu- dents for specific well-paying technical careers. NTID also is expanding the number of its transfer associate degree programs to better serve the higher achieving seg-ment of our student population seeking bachelor's and master's degrees. These transfer programs provide seamless transition to baccalaureate studies in the other colleges of RIT. In support of those deaf and hard-of-hearing students enrolled in the other RIT colleges, NTID provides a range of access services (including sign lan-guage interpreting, real-time speech-to-text captioning, and notetaking) as well as tutoring services. One of NTID's greatest strengths is our outstanding track record of assisting high-potential students to gain admission to, and graduate from, the other colleges of RIT at rates comparable to their hearing peers. A cooperative education (co-op) component is an integral part of academic pro- gramming at NTID and prepares students for success in the job market. A co-op gives students the opportunity to experience a real-life job situation and focus their career choice. Students develop technical skills and enhance vital personal skills such as teamwork and communication, which will make them better candidates for full-time employment after graduation. Almost 300 students last year participated in 10-week co-op experiences that augment their academic studies, refine their so-cial skills, and prepare them for the competitive working world. Student Accomplishments For our graduates, over the past 5 years, an average of 91 percent have found jobs commensurate with their education level. Of our fiscal year 2012 graduates (the most recent class for which numbers are available), 93 percent were employed 1 year later, with 65 percent employed in business and industry, 24 percent in edu-cation/non-profits, and 11 percent in government. Graduation from NTID has a demonstrably positive effect on students' earnings over a lifetime, and results in a notable reduction in dependence on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). In fiscal year 2012, NTID, the Social Security Administration, and Cornell University examined earnings and Federal program participation data for approximately 16,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals who applied to NTID over our entire history. The stud-ies show that NTID graduates over their lifetimes are employed at a much higher rate, earn substantially more (therefore paying significantly more in taxes), and par-ticipate at a much lower rate in SSI and SSDI than students who withdrew from NTID. Using SSA data, at age 50, 78 percent of NTID deaf and hard-of-hearing grad- uates with bachelor degrees and 73 percent with associate degrees report earnings, compared to 58 percent of NTID deaf and hard-of-hearing students who withdrew from NTID. Equally important is the demonstrated impact of an NTID education on graduates' earnings. At age 50, $58,000 is the median salary for NTID deaf and hard-of-hearing graduates with bachelor degrees and $41,000 for those with asso-ciate degrees, compared to $34,000 for deaf and hard-of-hearing students who with-drew from NTID. Higher earnings, of course, yield higher tax revenues. An NTID education also translates into reduced dependency on Federal transfer programs, such as SSI and SSDI. At age 40, less than 2 percent of NTID deaf and hard-of-hearing associate and bachelor degree graduates participated in the SSI pro-gram compared to 8 percent of deaf and hard-of-hearing students who withdrew from NTID. Similarly, at age 50, only 18 percent of NTID deaf and hard-of-hearing bachelor degree graduates and 28 percent of associate degree graduates participated in the SSDI program, compared to 35 percent of deaf and hard-of-hearing students who withdrew from NTID. Access Services NTID provides an access services system to meet the needs of a large number of deaf and hard-of-hearing students enrolled in baccalaureate and graduate degree programs in RIT's other colleges as well as students enrolled in NTID programs who take courses in the other colleges of RIT. Access services also are provided for events and activities throughout the RIT community. Access services include sign language interpreting, real-time captioning, classroom notetaking services, cap-tioned classroom video materials, and Assistive Listening Services. As enrollments have steadily increased, so has the demand for access services. In fiscal year 2013, 145,003 hours of interpreting were provided\u2014an increase of 27 per-cent compared to fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2013, 18,263 hours of real-time cap-tioning were provided to students\u2014a 9 percent increase over fiscal year 2008. The increase in demand is partly a result of the increase in the number of students en-rolled in baccalaureate programs at RIT and the number of students with cochlear 603 implants. In fiscal year 2014, there were 526 deaf and hard-of-hearing students en- rolled in baccalaureate programs at RIT, a 19 percent increase compared to fiscal year 2008, and 360 students with cochlear implants, a 47 percent increase over fis-cal year 2008. Summary It is extremely important that our fiscal year 2015 funding request be granted in order that we might continue our mission to prepare deaf and hard-of-hearing peo- ple to excel in the workplace. NTID has shown through hard data that our grad-uates have higher salaries, pay more taxes, and depend less on Federal SSI/SSDI payments than their counterparts who do not attend NTID. Our employment rate is 91 percent over the past 5 years\u2014even more remarkable given the state of the economy. Demand for an NTID education is higher than ever. Therefore, I ask that you please consider funding our fiscal year 2015 request of $66,291,000 for Oper-ations. We are hopeful that the members of the Committee will agree that NTID, with its long history of successful stewardship of Federal funds and outstanding edu-cational record of service with people who are deaf and hard of hearing, remains deserving of your support and confidence. Likewise, we will continue to demonstrate to Congress and the American people that NTID is a proven economic investment in the future of young deaf and hard-of-hearing citizens. Quite simply, NTID is a Federal program that works. [This statement was submitted by Dr. Gerard J. Buckley, President, National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and Vice President and Dean, Rochester Institute of Technology. ] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION NETWORK Thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony in support of increased fund- ing for the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), which is adminis-tered by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The National Violence Prevention Network, a broad and diverse alliance of health and welfare, suicide and violence prevention, and law enforcement advocates supports increasing the fiscal year 2015 funding level to $25 million to allow for nationwide expansion of the NVDRS program. fiscal year 2014 NVDRS funding is $11.2 million. BACKGROUND Each year, about 55,000 Americans die violent deaths. In addition, an average of 105 people (22 of which are military veterans) take their own lives each day. The NVDRS program makes better use of data that are already being collected by health, law enforcement, and social service agencies. The NVDRS program, in fact, does not require the collection of any new data. Instead it links together infor-mation that, when kept in separate compartments, is much less valuable as a tool to characterize and monitor violent deaths. With a clearer picture of why violent deaths occurs, law enforcement, public health officials and others can work together more effectively to identify those at risk and target effective preventive services. Currently, NVDRS funding levels only allow the program to operate in 18 States, including Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Several other States have expressed an interest in joining once new funding becomes available. While NVDRS is begin-ning to strengthen violence and suicide prevention efforts in the 18 participating States, non-participating States continue to miss out on the benefits of this impor-tant public health surveillance program. NVDRS IN ACTION Child abuse and other violence involving children and adolescents remains a prob- lem in America, and it is only through a comprehensive understanding of its root causes that these needless deaths can be prevented. Studies suggest that between 3.3 and 10 million children witness some form of domestic violence annually. Addi-tionally, 1,560 children died as a result of abuse or neglect in 2010. Children are most vulnerable and most dependent on their caregivers during in- fancy and early childhood. Sadly, NVDRS data has shown that young children are at the greatest risk of homicide in their own homes. Combined NVDRS data from Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Vir-604 ginia determined that African American children aged 4 years old and under are more than four times as likely to be victims of homicide than Caucasian children, and that homicides of children aged four and under are most often committed by a parent or caregiver in the home. The data also shows that household items, or ''weapons of opportunity,'' were most commonly used, suggesting that poor stress re-sponses may be factors in these deaths. Knowing the demographics and methods of child abusers can lead to more effective, targeted prevention programs. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is another issue where NVDRS is proving its value. While IPV has declined along with other trends in crime over the past dec-ade, thousands of Americans still fall victim to it every year. Intimate partner homi-cides accounted for 30 percent of the murders of women and 5 percent of the mur-ders of men in 2006, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Despite being in its early stages in several States, NVDRS is already providing critical information that is helping law enforcement and health and human service officials allocate resources and develop programs in ways that target those most at risk for intimate partner violence. For example, NVDRS data shows that while oc-currences are rare, most murder-suicide victims are current or former intimate part-ners of the suspect, and a substantial number of victims were the suspect's off-spring. In addition, NVDRS data indicate that women are about seven times more likely than men to be killed by a spouse, ex-spouse, lover, or former lover, and most of these incidents occurred in the women's homes. NVDRS & VA SUICIDES Although it is preventable, every year more than 38,000 Americans die by suicide and another one million Americans attempt it, costing more than $36 billion in lost wages and work productivity. In the United States today, there is no comprehensive national system to track suicides. However, because NVDRS includes information on all violent deaths\u2014including deaths by suicide\u2014information from the system can be used to develop effective suicide prevention plans at the community, State, and national levels. The central collection of this data can be of tremendous value for organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs that are working to improve their sur-veillance of suicides. For instance, CDC determined from national NVDRS data that veterans comprised 20 percent of all suicide victims. The types of data collected by NVDRS including gender, blood alcohol content, mental health issues and physical health issues can help prevention programs better identify and treat at-risk individ-uals. FEDERAL ROLE NEEDED At an estimated annual cost of $25 million for full implementation, NVDRS is a relatively low-cost program that yields high-quality results. While State-specific in-formation provides enormous value to local public health and law enforcement offi-cials, data from all 50 States, the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia must be obtained to complete the national picture. Aggregating this additional data will allow us to analyze national trends and also more quickly and accurately determine what factors can lead to violent death so that we can devise and disseminate strate-gies to address those factors. STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING NVDRS IN FISCAL YEAR 2014 The 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act recognized the public health utility of NVDRS in preventing violent deaths and increased NVDRS funding by roughly $8 million to facilitate continued expansion of the NVDRS program. With this new funding, NVDRS will expand to roughly two-thirds of the country. The time is now to complete the nation-wide expansion of NVDRS by providing an appropriation of $25 million in fiscal year 2015. We thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement for the record. The investment in NVDRS has already begun to pay off, as the 18 participating States are adopting effective violence prevention programs. We believe that national imple-mentation of NVDRS is a wise public health investment that will assist State and national efforts to prevent deaths from domestic violence, veteran suicide, teen sui-cide, gang violence and other violence that affects communities around the country. We look forward to working with you secure an fiscal year 2015 NVDRS appropria-tion of $25 million. 605 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN EDUCATION COUNCIL Aloha Chairman Harkin and members of the Senate Committee on Appropria- tions, Labor, HHS, and Education Subcommittee: Mahalo, thank you, for allowing us an opportunity to submit this request for appropriations. We are seeking continued funding at pre-sequestration levels for the Native Ha- waiian Education Program (NHEP) that targets the Native Hawaiian student popu-lation. The NHEP is an important part of fulfilling the trust relationship between the U.S. and Native Hawaiians, and it helps to improve the educational status of Native Hawaiians. It is an important element in the Native community's effort to control its education programs and policies and to achieve educational parity. NHEP aims to close the education achievement gap between Native Hawaiians and the general population, and also functions to fulfill the trust relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of a once sovereign na-tion. During the time of their own sovereignty in the kingdom of Hawai'i, Native Hawaiians had a higher rate of literacy than citizens of the United States. The edu-cational achievement gap has occurred during the intervening years since the loss of Native Hawaiian sovereignty, so that today Native Hawaiians are among the most disadvantaged groups in the State. The NHEP Works NHEP has been effective over the years in meeting the goals of the program. For example, NHEA has been instrumental in preserving and protecting the Native Ha-waiian language through funding projects that are designed to address the use of the Native Hawaiian language in instruction, one of the priorities named in the NHEA. The number of speakers nearly doubled in 18 years from 8,872 speakers in 1990 to 16,864 in 2008 (Source: OHA Data Book 2011 Tables 4.19 and 4.44) The NHEP has funded programs that incorporate culture and indigenous teaching practices in the classroom that leads to better outcomes for Native Hawaiian stu-dents. An example is the improvement in the graduation rates for Native Hawaiians and math and reading scores. Graduation rates for Native Hawaiians between 2002 and 2010 rose from 70 percent to 72.2 percent (Sources: Kamehameha Schools' Na-tive Hawaiian Education Assessment Update 2009, Fig. 9 and HI DOE 2005-06 to 2009-10). Similarly, math and reading scores have risen for Native Hawaiians. The percent of Native Hawaiians scoring ''Proficient or Above '' from 2007 to 2012 rose from 27 percent to 49 percent in math and from 41 percent to 62 percent in reading (Source: Hawaii DOE Longitudinal Data System ). School attendance rates in schools with student populations that are over 50 per- cent Native Hawaiian have increased from 90.1 percent in the 2000-01 school year to 91.3 percent in the 2011-12 school year (Source: Kamehameha Schools' draft Ka Huaka'i update, p. 58) The Need Still Exists In spite of the gains that Native Hawaiians have made educationally, the need for innovative programs to assist Native Hawaiians to improve their academic per-formance still exists, since Native Hawaiians have not yet attained parity with the rest of the students in the State. Timely high school graduation rates for students in the State rose from 77 percent to 79.6 percent in the same time period that it rose from 70 percent to 72.2 percent for Native Hawaiians (Sources: Kamehameha Schools' Native Hawaiian Education Assessment Update 2009, Fig. 9 and HI DOE 2005-06 to 2009-10). Native Hawaiians still lag behind the rest of the State in academic performance; however the gap between the Native Hawaiians and others is decreasing. From 2007 to 2012 the increase in the percentage of Native Hawaiians scoring ''Proficient or Above '' in math rose 22 percentage points, while the increase for the State dur-ing the same time period was 21 percentage points. The increase for Native Hawai-ians in reading was even more dramatic during that time period, increasing 21 per-centage points compared to the State increase of only 11 percentage points. Unfortu-nately those gains were not enough to bring Native Hawaiians to parity. In 2012 Native Hawaiians were still 10 points behind the State in the percentage scoring ''Proficient or Above'' in math and nine points behind in the percentage scoring ''Pro-ficient or Above'' in reading.

In the area of Native Hawaiian language immersion, although the gains have been tremendous, the nearly 17,000 speakers in 2008 only represents 6 percent of the approximately 290,000 Native Hawaiians in Hawai'i (2010 U.S. Census). Appropriations Request The pre-sequestration appropriations level for the NHEP was $34 million. Seques- tration reduced the amount by $2 million to $32 million, which is the amount en-tered into the President's budget. For such a small program as the NHEP, the $2 million reduction makes a significant negative impact on the program. We would like to continue to make gains in the educational achievement of Native Hawaiians, and request the pre-sequestration level of $34 million so that we don't lose the mo-mentum of improvement. NHEP funds programs to help improve the educational attainment of Native Ha- waiians in ways that are linguistically and culturally aligned to the needs of our Native students and communities in Hawai'i. Improving education, particularly for the most depressed groups, eventually leads to cost savings over time through de-creased incarceration, poor health, and public assistance.(Barnett, W. S., & Acker-man, D. J. 2006. Costs, benefits, and the long-term effects of early care and edu-cation programs: Cautions and recommendations for community developers. Journal of the Community Development Society, 37(2), 86-100.) Academic achievement is also correlated with positive economic outcomes. (Belfield, C. 2008, June. The eco-nomic investments of early education in Hawaii. Issue Brief. Flushing, NY: Queen's College, City University of New York.) Please help us sustain the NHEP to its pre-sequestration level in order to con- tinue the educational gains that have taken this program years to accomplish. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NEPHCURE FOUNDATION SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 \u2014$32 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014Provide a corresponding increase to the National Institute of Diabetes and Di- gestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) \u2014Expansion of the FSGS/NS Research Portfolio at NIDDK, the Office of Rare Dis- eases Research (ORDR) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) by funding more research proposals for Primary Glomerular Disease Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the NephCure Foundation regarding research on idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and pri-mary nephrotic syndrome (NS). NephCure is the only non-profit organization exclu-sively devoted to fighting FSGS and the NS disease group. Driven by a panel of re-spected medical experts and a dedicated band of patients and families, NephCure works tirelessly to support kidney disease research and awareness. NS is a collection of signs and symptoms caused by diseases that attack the kid- ney's filtering system. These diseases include FSGS, Minimal Change Disease and Membranous Nephropathy. When affected, the kidney filters leak protein from the blood into the urine and often cause kidney failure, which requires dialysis or kid-ney transplantation. According to a Harvard University report, 73,000 people in the United States have lost their kidneys as a result of FSGS. Unfortunately, the causes of FSGS and other filter diseases are poorly understood. FSGS is the second leading cause of NS and is especially difficult to treat. There is no known cure for FSGS and current treatments are difficult for patients to en-dure. These treatments include the use of steroids and other dangerous substances which lower the immune system and contribute to severe bacterial infections, high 607 blood pressure and other problems in patients, particularly child patients. In addi- tion, children with NS often experience growth retardation and heart disease. Fi-nally, NS that is caused by FSGS, MCD or MN is idiopathic and can often reoccur, even after a kidney transplant. FSGS disproportionately affects minority populations and is five times more prev- alent in the African American community. In a groundbreaking study funded by NIH, researchers found that FSGS is associated with two APOL1 gene variants. These variants developed as an evolutionary response to African sleeping sickness and are common in the African American patient population with FSGS/NS. FSGS has a large social impact in the United States. FSGS leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) which is one of the most costly chronic diseases to manage. In 2008, the Medicare program alone spent $26.8 billion, 7.9 percent of its entire budget, on ESRD. In 2005, FSGS accounted for 12 percent of ESRD cases in the U.S., at an annual cost of $3 billion. It is estimated that there are currently approxi-mately 20,000 Americans living with ESRD due to FSGS. Research on FSGS could achieve tremendous savings in Federal healthcare costs and reduce health status disparities. For this reason, and on behalf of the thousands of families that are significantly affected by this disease, we encourage support for expanding the research portfolio on FSGS/NS at the NIH. Encourage FSGS/NS Research at NIH There is no known cause or cure for FSGS and scientists tell us that much more research needs to be done on the basic science behind FSGS/NS. More research could lead to fewer patients undergoing ESRD and tremendous savings in healthcare costs in the United States. With collaboration from other Institutes and Centers, ORDR established the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network. This network provided an opportunity for the NephCure Foundation, the University of Michigan, and other university research health centers to come together to form the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE). NEPTUNE is developing a database of NS patients who are interested in participating in clinical trials which would alleviate the problem faced by many rare disease groups of not having access to enough patients for research. NephCure urges the subcommittee to continue its support for RDCRN and NEPTUNE, which has tremendous potential to facilitate advancements in NS and FSGS research. The NephCure Foundation is also grateful to NIDDK for issuing program an- nouncements (PA) that serve to initiate grant proposals on primary glomerular dis-ease. Two PAs that have recently been issued utilize the R01 and UM1 mechanisms to award funding for primary glomerular disease research. NephCure recommends the subcommittee encourage NIDDK to continue to issue primary glomerular dis-ease PAs. Due to the disproportionate burden of FSGS on minority populations, it is appro- priate for NIMHD to develop an interest in this research. NephCure asks the sub-committee to encourage ORDR, NIDDK and NIMHD to collaborate on research that studies the incidence and cause of this disease among minority populations. NephCure also asks the Subcommittee to urge NIDDK and the NIMHD to under-take culturally appropriate efforts aimed at educating minority populations about primary glomerular disease. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the FSGS/NS community. Please contact the NephCure Foundation if additional information is required. [This statement was submitted by Irving Smokler, PH.D., President and Founder, Nephcure Foundation.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NEUROFIBROMATOSIS NETWORK Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to the Subcommittee on the importance of continued funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for re-search on Neurofibromatosis (NF), a genetic disorder closely linked to many common diseases widespread among the American population. We respectfully request that you include the following report language on NF research at the National Institutes of Health within your fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-cation Appropriations bill. Neurofibromatosis [NF]\u2014The Committee supports efforts to increase funding and resources for NF research and treatment at multiple NIH Institutes, including NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NHLBI, NICHD and NEI. Children and adults with NF are at sig-nificant risk for the development of many forms of cancer; the Committee encour-ages NCI to increase its NF research portfolio in fundamental basic science, translational research and clinical trials focused on NF. The Committee also encour-608 ages the NCI to support NF centers, NF clinical trials consortia, NF preclinical mouse models consortia and NF-associated tumor sequencing efforts. Because NF causes brain and nerve tumors and is associated with cognitive and behavioral prob-lems, the Committee urges NINDS to continue to aggressively fund fundamental basic science research on NF relevant to nerve damage and repair, learning disabil-ities and attention deficit disorders. Since NF2 accounts for approximately 5 percent of genetic forms of deafness, the Committee encourages NIDCD to expand its invest-ment in NF2 basic and clinical research. On behalf of the Neurofibromatosis (NF) Network, a national organization of NF advocacy groups, I speak on behalf of the 100,000 Americans who suffer from NF as well as approximately 175 million Americans who suffer from diseases and condi-tions linked to NF such as cancer, brain tumors, heart disease, memory loss, and learning disabilities. Thanks in large measure to this Subcommittee's strong sup-port, scientists have made enormous progress since the discovery of the NF1 gene in 1990 resulting in clinical trials now being undertaken at NIH with broad implica-tions for the general population. NF is a genetic disorder involving the uncontrolled growth of tumors along the nervous system which can result in terrible disfigurement, deformity, deafness, pain, blindness, brain tumors, cancer, and even death. In addition, approximately one-half of children with NF suffer from learning disabilities. NF is the most com-mon neurological disorder caused by a single gene and is more common than Mus- cular Dystrophy and Cystic Fibrosis combined. There are three types of NF: NF1, which is more common, NF2, which initially involves tumors causing deafness and balance problems, and Schwannomatosis, the hallmark of which is severe pain. While not all NF patients suffer from the most severe symptoms, all NF patients and their families live with the uncertainty of not knowing whether they will be se-riously affected because NF is a highly variable and progressive disease. Researchers have determined that NF is closely linked to heart disease, learning disabilities, memory loss, cancer, brain tumors, and other disorders including deaf-ness, blindness and orthopedic disorders, primarily because NF regulates important pathways common to these disorders such as the RAS, cAMP and PAK pathways. Research on NF therefore stands to benefit millions of Americans: Learning Disabilities/Behavioral and Brain Function Learning disabilities affect one-half of people with NF1. They range from mild to severe, and can impact the quality of life for those with NF1. In recent years, re-search has revealed common threads between NF1 learning disabilities, autism and other related disabilities. New drug interventions for learning disabilities are being developed and will be beneficial to military dependants, as well as the general popu-lation. Research being done in this area includes a clinical trial of the statin drug Lovastatin, as well as other categories of drugs. Bone Repair At least a quarter of children with NF1 have abnormal bone growth in any part of the skeleton. In the legs, the long bones are weak, prone to fracture and unable to heal properly; this can require amputation at a young age. Adults with NF1 also have low bone mineral density, placing them at risk of skeletal weakness and in-jury. Research currently being done to understand bone biology and repair will pave the way for new strategies to enhancing bone health and facilitating repair. Pain Management Severe pain is a central feature of Schwannomatosis, and significantly impacts quality of life. Understanding what causes pain, and how it could be treated, has been a fast-moving area of NF research over the past few years. Pain management is a challenging area of research and new approaches are highly sought after. Nerve Regeneration NF often requires surgical removal of nerve tumors, which can lead to nerve pa- ralysis and loss of function. Understanding the changes that occur in a nerve after surgery, and how it might be regenerated and functionally restored, will have sig-nificant quality of life value for affected individuals. Light-based therapy is being tested to dissect nerves in surgery of tumor removal. If successful it could have ap-plications for treating nerve damage and scarring after injury, thereby aiding repair and functional restoration. Wound Healing, Inflammation and Blood Vessel Growth Wound healing requires new blood vessel growth and tissue inflammation. Mast cells, important players in NF1 tumor growth, are critical mediators of inflamma-tion, and they must be quelled and regulated in order to facilitate healing. Re-609 searchers have gained deep knowledge on how mast cells promote tumor growth, and this research has led to ongoing clinical trials to block this signaling, resulting in slower tumor growth. As researchers learn more about blocking mast cell signals in NF, this research can be translated to the management of mast cells in wound healing. New Cancer Treatments NF can cause a variety of tumors to grow, which includes tumors in the brain, spinal cord and nerves. NF affects the RAS pathway which is implicated in 70 per-cent of all human cancers. Some of these tumor types are benign and some are ma-lignant, hard to treat and often fatal. One of these tumor types is malignant periph-eral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a very aggressive, hard to treat and often fatal cancer. MPNSTs are fast growing, and because the cells change as the tumor grows, they often become resistant to individual drugs. Clinical trials are underway to identify a drug treatment that can be widely used in MPNSTs and other hard-to- treat tumors. The enormous promise of NF research, and its potential to benefit over 175 mil- lion Americans who suffer from diseases and conditions linked to NF, has gained increased recognition from Congress and the NIH. This is evidenced by the fact that numerous institutes are currently supporting NF research, and NIH's total NF re-search portfolio has increased from $3 million in fiscal year 1990 to an estimated $18 million in fiscal year 2014. Given the potential offered by NF research for progress against a range of diseases, we are hopeful that the NIH will continue to build on the successes of this program by funding this promising research and thereby continuing the enormous return on the taxpayers' investment. We appreciate the Subcommittee's strong support for NF research and will con- tinue to work with you to ensure that opportunities for major advances in NF re-search are aggressively pursued. Thank you. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NEWENGLAND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ASSOCIATION On behalf of the low-income, first-generation students and students with disabil- ities served by the Federal TRIO Programs (''TRIO'') across Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the New England Educational Opportunity Association (''NEOA'') respectfully requests that the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education boost TRIO funding by $52 million in fiscal year 2015. A $52 million funding increase would allow for a total funding level of $890 mil- lion in fiscal year 2015 which, in turn, would allow TRIO's Student Support Services program to expand its reach by 10 percent and grow to serve 20,000 additional low- income, first-generation students at colleges and universities across the Nation dur-ing the 2015-2016 academic year. This funding level would also allow current TRIO programs to sustain the high-quality access and success services provided to 750,000 students across the Nation as well as allow for the expansion of these services to include 23,000 more who stand in need. Such growth is critical as TRIO programs have lost more than 120,000 students over the last decade. While we are tremen-dously grateful for the work of this Subcommittee to restore 95 percent of the funds lost to sequestration in fiscal year 2014, we would be remiss if we did not request additional funding so that we may continue to recoup from earlier losses. If the suc-cess of TRIO in New England serves as any indicator, it becomes clear that greater investment in TRIO is critical to boosting educational attainment nationally. More than 42,000 students ranging from middle school through graduate study participate in TRIO programs across New England. Throughout the region, stories of student success abound, with strong statistics to support them. For instance, both the Talent Search and Upward Bound programs in Rhode Island can boast of 99 percent high school graduation rates. Moreover, 86 percent of Rhode Island's Talent Search students go directly onto college as do 90 percent of the Upward Bound stu- dents. In New Hampshire, a longitudinal study of Student Support Services (''SSS'') par- ticipants at the University of New Hampshire demonstrated that, compared to eligi-ble non-participants, SSS students exhibited higher graduation rates, greater im-provement in grades, and lower academic suspension rates. Meanwhile, during fiscal year 2010, Plymouth State University had a 92 percent retention rate among non- graduating SSS participants. The SSS program at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut can demonstrate similar success. During the 2013-2014 Academic Year, 610 58 percent of SSS participants made the Dean's List and/or the President's List as a result of their GPAs. In recent years, the Educational Opportunity Center (EOC) in Vermont aided 63 percent of its clients\u2014which include out-of-work adults and military veterans\u2014in enrolling in postsecondary education programs for the first time; a similar percent-age (61 percent) of postsecondary ''stop-outs'' re-enrolled in postsecondary education programs. Similarly, the EOC program in Maine helped more than 900 adult learn-ers enroll in college and assisted nearly 2,000 adults in developing career and edu-cational plans. Massachusetts also produces stellar results through its TRIO programs. Many no- table examples are found at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. For instance, the institution's Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) program found that 81.5 percent of VUB participants who enrolled in postsecondary education programs persisted through to a second year of academic study. Meanwhile, 48 percent of students who participated in their Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement program earned doctoral degrees within 10 years of receipt of their bachelor's degree. This is just a sampling of the success sparked by the supportive services provided by TRIO. We hope that you will strongly consider these examples when determining funding levels for our program in fiscal year 2015. Thank you for your consideration of this request. [This statement was submitted by Karen Keim, President, New England Edu- cational Opportunity Association.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NEWHAMPSHIRE COMMUNITY LOAN FUND Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and distinguished Members of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies: Helping child-care centers finance improvements to their fa-cilities has been a key poverty-fighting strategy of the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund for the last two decades. We see first-hand what the experts are able to prove: that quality early learning provides a critical foundation for social and eco-nomic success. The Community Loan Fund wishes to endorse the testimony of the National Chil- dren's Facilities Network and the network's call for adequate Federal funding for the acquisition, construction, and improvement of child-care facilities. Over the last 7 years, New Hampshire's child-care centers have grown increasingly averse to the risks associated with investing in capital improvements. The recession heightened the typical executive director's financial anxiety and that anxiety persists. Now would be the perfect time for Federal action that would increase their confidence and encourage investments in their facilities. Please let me know if you would like additional information from us. [This statement was submitted by Richard A. Minard, Jr., Vice President, New Hampshire Community Loan Fund.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NURSING COMMUNITY The Nursing Community is a forum comprised of 60 national professional nursing associations that builds consensus and advocates on a wide spectrum of healthcare and nursing issues surrounding practice, education, and research. These organiza-tions are committed to promoting America's health through the advancement of the nursing profession. Collectively, the Nursing Community represents nearly one mil-lion Registered Nurses (RNs), Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs-includ-ing certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and cer-tified registered nurse anesthetists), nurse executives, nursing students, faculty, and researchers. For fiscal year 2015, our organizations respectfully request $251 million for the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Nursing Workforce Devel-opment programs (authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.]), $150 million for the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and $20 million in author-ized funding for the Nurse-Managed Health Clinics (Title III of the Public Health Service Act). These investments will help ensure that our Nation's population re-ceives the highest-quality nursing services possible. 611 Demand for Nurses Continues to Grow According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Employment Projections for 2012-2022, the expected number of practicing nurses will grow from 2.71 million in 2012 to 3.24 million in 2022, an increase of 526,800, or 19.4 percent. The number of job openings due to demand for registered nursing services and replacements in the workforce brings the total of RNs needed to 1.053 million by 2022. In addition, nurse practitioners are one of the fastest growing occupations according to the BLS projections, noting there will be a 33.7 percent increase in nurse practitioners be-tween 2012-2022. Two primary factors contribute to this overwhelming demand. First, America's nursing workforce is aging. A 2013 HRSA report, The U.S. Nursing Workforce: Trends in Supply and Education, indicates that over the next 10 to 15 years, the nearly one million RNs over age 50 (comprising approximately one-third of the cur-rent workforce), will reach retirement age. Secondly, America's Baby Boomer popu-lation is aging. This population will require a vast influx of nursing services, par-ticularly in areas of primary care and chronic illness management. A significant in-vestment must be made in the education of new nurses to provide the Nation with the nursing services it demands. Addressing the Demand: Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Programs For 50 years, the Nursing Workforce Development programs, authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, have helped to build the supply and dis-tribution of qualified nurses to meet our Nation's healthcare needs. The Title VIII programs bolster nursing education at all levels, from entry-level preparation through graduate study, and provide support for institutions that educate nurses for practice in rural and medically underserved communities. Today, the Title VIII pro-grams are essential to ensure the demand for nursing care is met. Between fiscal year 2005 and 2012 alone, these programs supported over 450,000 nurses and nurs-ing students, as well as numerous academic nursing institutions and healthcare fa-cilities. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing's (AACN) Title VIII Student Re- cipient Survey gathers information about Title VIII dollars and their impact on nursing students. The 2013-2014 survey, which included responses from over 800 students, indicated that the Title VIII programs played a critical role in funding these students' nursing education. The survey showed that 78 percent of the stu-dents receiving Title VIII funding are attending school full-time. By supporting full- time students, the Title VIII programs are helping to ensure that students enter the workforce without delay. The Title VIII programs also address the need for more nurse faculty. Data from AACN's 2013-2014 enrollment and graduations survey show that nursing schools were forced to turn away 78,089 qualified applications from entry-level bacca-laureate and graduate nursing programs in 2013, and faculty vacancy was a pri-mary reason. The Title VIII Nurse Faculty Loan Program aids in increasing nursing school enrollment capacity by supporting students pursuing graduate education, provided they serve as faculty for 4 years after graduation. \u2014The Nursing Community respectfully requests $251 million for the Nursing Workforce Development programs in fiscal year 2015. National Institute of Nursing Research: Foundation for Evidence-Based Care As one of the 27 Institutes and Centers at the NIH, the NINR funds research that lays the groundwork for evidence-based nursing practice. Nurse scientists at NINR examine ways to improve care models to deliver safe, high-quality, and cost-effective health services to the Nation. Our country must look toward the prevention aspect of healthcare as the vehicle for saving our system from further financial burden, and the work of NINR embraces this endeavor through research related to care manage-ment of patients during illness and recovery, reduction of risks for disease and dis-ability, promotion of healthy lifestyles, enhancement of quality of life for those with chronic illness, and care for individuals at the end of life. Moreover, NINR helps to provide needed faculty to support the education of fu- ture generations of nurses. Training programs at NINR develop future nurse re-searchers, many of whom also serve as faculty in our Nation's nursing schools. \u2014The Nursing Community respectfully requests $150 million for the NINR in fis- cal year 2015. Nurse-Managed Health Clinics: Expanding Access to Care NMHCs are healthcare delivery sites managed by APRNs and are staffed by an interdisciplinary health provider team which may include physicians, social work-ers, public health nurses, and therapists. These clinics are often associated with a 612 school, college, university, department of nursing, federally qualified health center, or independent nonprofit healthcare agency. NMHCs serve as critical access points to keep patients out of the emergency room, saving the healthcare system millions of dollars annually. NMHCs provide care to patients in medically underserved regions of the country, including rural communities, Native American reservations, senior citizen centers, elementary schools, and urban housing developments. The populations within these communities are the most vulnerable to chronic illnesses that create heavy financial burdens on patients and the healthcare system. NMHCs aim to reduce the preva-lence of disease and create healthier communities by providing primary care serv-ices and educating patients on health promotion practices. Furthermore, NMHCs serve as clinical education training sites for nursing students and other health pro-fessionals. This is crucial given that a lack of training sites is commonly identified as a barrier to nursing school enrollment. \u2014The Nursing Community respectfully requests $20 million for the Nurse-Man- aged Health Clinics authorized under Title III of the Public Health Service Act in fiscal year 2015. Without a workforce of well-educated nurses providing evidence-based care to those who need it most, including our growing aging population, the healthcare sys-tem is not sustainable. The Nursing Community's request of $251 million for the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development programs, $150 million for the National Institute of Nursing Research, and $20 million for Nurse-Managed Health Clinics in fiscal year 2015 will help ensure continued access to quality care provided by America's nursing workforce.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and distinguished Members of the Sub- committee, Oral Health America (OHA), a leading organization dedicated to chang-ing lives by connecting communities with resources to increase access to care, edu-cation, and advocacy for all Americans, especially those most vulnerable; is request-ing fiscal year 2015 funding for all programs administered under the Older Ameri-cans Act (OAA) be restored to fiscal year 2012 levels. Of particular interest to OHA is to ensure Title III-D, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, is restored to at least $21,000,000 because of the cost-effectiveness that health education, preven-tion and promotion programs provide to the system. The OAA provides Federal programs that serve to meet the needs of millions of older Americans. We understand the United States continues to operate amid a challenging budgetary environment. However, OHA believes that proper Federal in-vestment in the OAA is critical to keep pace with the rate of inflation and to meet the needs of this ever-growing segment of the population through the multitude of services the OAA provides. Simply stated, proper investment in OAA saves taxpayer dollars. This is especially evident when it comes to health services. Health services the emphasize prevention and promotion will help to reduce disease, leading to the improvement of the overall health and well-being of America's older adults and re- sulting in the reduction of premature and costly medical interventions. OHA strong-ly contends that one's health and overall well-being begins with proper oral health. Background The population of the United States is aging at an unprecedented rate. Older adults make up one of the fastest growing segments of the American population. In 2009, 39.6 million seniors were U.S. residents. This aging cohort is expected to reach 72.1 million by 2030\u2014an increase of 82 percent. 1 The oral health of older Americans is in a state of decay. The reasons for this are complex. Limited access to dental insurance, affordable dental services, community water fluoridation, and programs that support oral health prevention and education for older Americans are significant factors that contribute to the unmet dental needs and edentulism among older adults, particularly those most vulnerable. While im-provements in oral health across the lifespan have been observed in the last half century, long term concern may be warranted for the 10,000 Americans retiring daily, as it is estimated that only 9.8 percent of this ''silver tsunami''\u2014baby boomers turning age 65\u2014will have access to dental insurance benefits. 2 Dental Health and Disparities .\u2014Older adults experience an increased risk for oral conditions such as edentulism, oral cancer, and periodontal disease. The reasons for this vary but are often related to age-associated physiologic changes, underlying chronic diseases, race, gender, and the use of various medications. These oral condi-tions disproportionately affect persons with low income, racial and ethnic minorities, and those who have limited or no access to dental insurance. Older adults with physical and intellectual disabilities and those persons who are homebound or insti-tutionalized are also at greater risk for poor oral health. 3 As examples of these disparities, older African American adults are 1.88 times more likely than their white counterparts to have periodontitis;4low-income older adults suffer more than twice the rate of gum disease than their more affluent peers (17.49 verses 8.62 respectively); and Americans who live in poverty are 61 percent more likely to have lost all of their teeth when compared to those in higher socio-economic groups. Edentulism and Overall Health .\u2014Despite these existing conditions, recent dental public health trends demonstrate that as the population at large ages, older Ameri-cans are increasingly retaining their natural teeth. 5Today, many older adults ben- efit from healthy aging associated with the retention of their natural teeth, improve-614 6Ira B.

Oral health data reveals that many older adults experience adverse oral health associated with chronic and systemic health conditions. For example, associations between periodontitis and diabetes have emerged in recent years, as well as oral conditions such as xerostomia associated with the use of prescription drugs. 6,7 Xerostomia, commonly known as dry mouth, contributes to the inception and pro-gression of dental caries (cavities). For older Americans, the occurrence or recur-rence of dental caries coupled with an inability to access treatment may lead to sig-nificant pain and suffering along with other detrimental health effects. Oral Care Provider Issues .\u2014Although a growing number of older Americans need oral healthcare, the current workforce is challenged to meet the needs of older adults. The current dental workforce is aging, and many dental professionals will retire within the next decade. 2A lack of geriatric specialty programs complicates this problem, and few practitioners are choosing geriatrics as their field of choice. While these trends are favorable, adverse oral health consequences are emerging. Due to reasons stated in this report, together with increased demand for services, lack of access to dental benefits through Medicare, increased morbidity and mobility among older adults, and reduced income associated with aging and retirement, many older Americans are unable to access oral healthcare services. As a result, many older adults who have retained their natural teeth are now experiencing den-tal problems. Older Adults' Oral Health in State of Decay OHA released State of Decay on October 8, 2013, which is a State-by-State anal- ysis of oral healthcare delivery and public health factors impacting the oral health of older adults. The report revealed more than half of the country received a ''fair'' or ''poor'' assessment when it comes to minimal standards affecting dental care ac-cess for older adults. The top findings of the report were: \u2014Persistent lack of oral health coverage across much of the Nation. Forty-two percent of States (21 States) provide either no dental benefits or provide only emergency coverage through adult Medicaid Dental Benefits. Nearly 70 percent of older Americans lack dental insurance, and in the context of a rapidly aging Nation, this percentage will only likely increase. \u2014Strained dental health work force. Thirty-one States (62 percent) have high rates of Dental Health Provider Shortage Areas (HPSAs), meeting only 40 per-cent or less of dental provider needs. \u2014Tooth loss remains a signal of suboptimal oral health. Eight States had strik- ingly high rates of edentulism, with West Virginia notably having an adult pop-ulation that is 33.8 percent edentate. \u2014Deficiencies in preventive programs. Thirteen States (26 percent) have upwards of 60 percent of their residents living in communities without water fluoridation (CWF), despite recognition for 68 years that this public health measure mark-edly reduces dental caries. Hawaii (89.2 percent) and New Jersey (86.5 percent) represent the highest rates of citizens unprotected by fluoridation, an unneces-sary public peril. Moreover, poor oral health has substantial financial implications. For example, in 2010 alone, between $867 million and $2.1 billion was spent on emergency dental procedures. When compared to care delivered in a dentist's office, hospital treat-ments are nearly ten times more expensive than the routine care that could have prevented the emergency. This places a costly yet avoidable burden on both the indi-vidual and the health institutions that must then bear the expense. In sum, oral health and access to preventive care significantly impact overall health and expenditure, yet are difficult to maintain\u2014particularly for older adults\u2014 in the Nation's present context of support systems and healthcare. How OHA Empowers Older Adults to Meet their Oral Health Needs Oral Health America's Wisdom Tooth Project \u00ae aims to change the lives of older adults especially vulnerable to oral disease. Its goal is to educate Americans about the oral health needs of older adults, connect older adults to local resources, and to advocate for policies that will improve the oral health of older adults. The Wis-615 dom Tooth Project achieves these goals through five strategies: publications, our web portal, regional symposia, communications, and demonstration projects. In addition to the State of Decay report referenced above, a vital component of the Wisdom Tooth Project is Toothwisdom.org, which is a first-of-its-kind website created to connect older adults and their caregivers to local care and education around the oral health issues they face, the importance of continuing prevention as we age, and the overall impact of oral health on overall health. Importance of OAA Reauthorization to Oral Health of Older Adults Recognizing this current State of oral health among older adults, Oral Health America welcomes the bipartisan-supported Older Americans Act reauthorization in the U.S. Senate, S.1562. The Senate's bill includes\u2014for the first time\u2014a small pro- vision that allows the Aging Network to use funds they receive for disease preven-tion and health promotion activities to conduct oral health screenings. Preventive dental care that can be provided through oral health screenings can head off more expensive dental work and help prevent severe diseases. Unfortunately, dentists see older adults everyday living with infection and pain that could be easily avoided with proper care that these screenings could provide. Although the oral health screenings provision would not require new or additional funding under Title III- D, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Services, restoring funding to fiscal year 2012 levels would greatly assist the Aging Network to conduct the screenings. More succinctly, the Senate's bill recognizes the importance of oral health and its role in disease prevention. We view this as a step toward improving the oral\u2014and overall\u2014health of older adults and call for the bill's passage. RECOMMENDATION It is evident the United States' healthcare system is woefully unprepared to meet the oral health challenges of a burgeoning population of older adults with special needs, chronic disease complications, and a growing inability to access and pay for dental services. However, the benefits of proper oral hygiene and routine care for 616 older adults to our Nation's healthcare system and economy are also quite clear. Through OHA's Wisdom Tooth Project, OHA aspires to change the lives of older adults especially vulnerable to oral disease. OHA views proper funding of the Older Americans Act as a crucial Federal investment vehicle to advance health promotion and disease prevention. Therefore, OHA recommends the Subcommittee to restore fiscal year 2015 funding for all OAA program to fiscal year 2012 levels, and more-over, to ensure Title III-D, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, is restored to at least $21,000,000 because of the cost-effectiveness that health education, pre-vention and promotion programs provide to the system. Thank you for the opportunity to present and submit our written testimony before the Subcommittee. [This statement was submitted by Beth Truett, CEO/President, Oral Health America.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE OVARIAN CANCER NATIONAL ALLIANCE The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance (the Alliance) greatly appreciates the op- portunity to submit testimony for the record regarding our fiscal year 2015 funding recommendations. The fiscal year 2015 programmatic funding levels we are advo-cating for will help advance the awareness, detection and treatment of ovarian can-cer, the deadliest of gynecologic cancers. Specifically, the Alliance respectfully re-quests Congress provide $7.5 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention's (CDC) Ovarian Cancer program, which funds critical public health re-search of ovarian cancer. CDC also leads a public gynecologic cancer (ovarian, uter-ine, cervical, vaginal, vulvar) awareness initiative, authorized by Johanna's Law, that plays an integral role in women's cancer education, detection and prevention. As such, the Alliance respectfully requests Congress appropriate $5.5 million for Johanna's Law implementation. Furthermore, to advance and leverage the impor-tant ovarian cancer research funded through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Alliance respectfully requests Con-gress allocate $5.26 billion to NCI, as a portion of $32 billion appropriated to NIH in fiscal year 2015. For 17 years, the Alliance has worked to increase awareness of ovarian cancer and advocate on behalf of women with ovarian cancer. As an umbrella organization of 58 State and regional Partner Member organizations, the Alliance unites the ef-forts of survivors, caretakers and healthcare professionals to bring national atten-tion to ovarian cancer. The Alliance advocates at a national level for greater invest-ment in Federal research to support the development of an early detection test, im-proved healthcare practices and life-saving treatment protocols. The Alliance also educates healthcare professionals about\u2014and raises public awareness of\u2014risk fac-tors for and symptoms of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a highly deadly disease. According to the American Cancer Soci- ety, in 2013, an estimated 22,240 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,030 women lost their lives to this terrible disease. A quarter of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer will die within 1 year of diagnosis and over half of women do not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Unfortunately, these rates have not changed in nearly 40 years. These grim statistics arise from the fact that there is no early de-tection test for ovarian cancer; tragically, most cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed after the disease has already begun to spread and are more difficult to effectively treat. However, if ovarian cancer is caught in the early stages, nearly ninety percent of women survive. As such, it is critical that women and healthcare providers be aware of the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and that valid and reliable early detection tests be developed. Few treatments for ovarian cancer have been approved by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA). Many FDA approved drugs are platinum-based therapies, to which cancers readily become resistant if multiple rounds of chemotherapy are needed. Nearly 80 percent of ovarian cancer patients will have a recurrence of dis-ease, underscoring the great need for new and better treatments for ovarian cancer. For these reasons, we respectfully urge you and your colleagues to support ovarian cancer research, education and awareness efforts. CDC DIVISION OF CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL \u2014OVARIAN CANCER The Ovarian Cancer Line (also known as the Ovarian Cancer Control Initiative) funds public health research of ovarian cancer to better identify women most at risk for developing ovarian cancer, and design risk-reduction and prevention-focused interventions. In fiscal year 2014, CDC's ovarian cancer program received $4.75 mil-617 lion to achieve its mission. Some of the projects being supported by those funds in- clude: the development of a Continuing Medical Education curriculum on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that educates physicians about how to identify, screen and manage high-risk patients; the investigation of ways to improve follow-up care for ovarian cancer patients given that so many experience disease recurrence; and the examination of risk factors, treatment disparities and other factors influencing survival rates to identify ways to improve patient outcomes with existing tools and treatments. With an allocation of $7.5 million in fiscal year 2015, the CDC will be able to con- tinue this important work, and expand a pilot initiative that promotes educating women and providers about the BRCA mutations, identifies women at high risk for developing breast/ovarian cancer and ensures appropriate referral of these at risk women for genetic counseling or testing. This pilot program is currently operational in three States, but with increased funding, similar programs can be established in additional States and communication among women and their providers about genomic risk and testing can be further encouraged. Given the shared risk between ovarian and breast cancers for individuals with BRCA mutations, it is imperative that we integrate ovarian cancer risk assessment, education and genetic testing into other CDC cancer-related programs, such as the EARLY Act and the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Programs. Combining breast and ovarian cancer programs in this manner will leverage scarce resources, better coordinate efforts between existing Federal programs, create econo-mies of scale and efficiencies with respect to CDC education and awareness pro-grams and advance complementary efforts to reduce ovarian cancer related deaths. CDC DIVISION OF CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL \u2014JOHANNA 'S LAW Johanna's Law funds a CDC-led gynecologic cancer awareness campaign, Inside Knowledge, which educates women and healthcare providers about the signs and symptoms of gynecologic cancers. In fiscal year 2014, CDC received $4.85 million for Johanna's Law activities, which include supporting the ongoing creation and dis-semination of awareness campaign materials in English and Spanish, and a series of print, radio and television PSAs featuring survivor stories. In 2012, the campaign achieved one billion views of its PSAs across media types. With $5.5 million in fiscal year 2015, CDC will be able to continue to raise aware- ness of the signs and symptoms of ovarian and other gynecologic cancers, undertake a targeted outreach of its messages to high risk women and expand its partnerships with external patient advocacy, health professional and other stakeholder organiza-tions to leverage scarce resources and amplify their messages. Collaboration with these organizations, such as the Alliance, would magnify the CDC's efforts to raise awareness and help ensure that women, particularly those known to be at a higher risk, seek the healthcare they need to identify and treat gynecologic cancers early. NCI AT NIH NCI and the NIH fund the majority of ovarian cancer research in the United States and the world. On average, each year, NCI and NIH fund more than $140 million in peer-reviewed research grants to researchers at universities and small businesses across the United States. These studies are generating insights into the origins of ovarian cancer and disease progression that may lead to the development of early detection tests and better treatments for ovarian cancer. For example, NIH and NCI investments in basic research led to the understanding of a class of en-zymes called PARPs implicated in ovarian cancer. Pharmaceutical companies have built upon these insights to develop PARP inhibitors, a class of drugs holding great promise for ovarian cancer patients. In addition to the basic research underlying future cures, NCI supports clinical research necessary for translating those ideas into treatments. NCI funding pro-vides critical support to the ovarian cancer Specialized Programs of Research Excel-lence (SPORE), which facilitate collaborative research studies on the early detection and treatment of ovarian cancer. The Roswell Park Cancer Institute and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Ovarian Cancer SPORE is working on reducing mor-bidity and mortality of ovarian cancer through groundbreaking translational re-search aimed at risk stratification, treatment, and prevention of relapse. Currently, a phase I clinical trial is being conducting on vaccines that induce anti-tumor immu-nity and several other clinical trials are in development. NCI's clinical trials enter- prise plays an essential role in testing the safety and effectiveness of potential treat-ments for ovarian cancer. Robust NCI funding is critical to the continued excellence of the SPOREs. 618 Furthermore, NCI recently launched the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), which consolidates and streamlines existing cooperative clinical trial groups. One of these new groups, the NRG Oncology Clinical Trial network, includes the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), whose trials have been responsible for sev-eral advances in ovarian cancer research. Specifically, a GOG trial found that chem- otherapy followed by maintenance use of Avastin increased progression free survival time of advanced ovarian cancer patients, when compared to chemotherapy alone. By funding important trials such as this, GOG (and now NRG) fills a clinical re-search gap left open by pharmaceutical companies that do not often research main-tenance therapies. Due to the NCTN's critical importance in clinical trial design and implementation, robust NCI funding is necessary to accomplish these and other im-portant tasks. Robust investment in NCI of $5.26 billion, out of a total $32 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2015, is critical to ensuring the next generation of discoveries that will improve the health and well-being of women with\u2014and at-risk for\u2014ovarian cancer, as well as all Americans. *** The Alliance maintains a long-standing commitment to working with Congress and other stakeholders to improve the survival rates for women with ovarian cancer through increased research, education and awareness. On behalf of our community of patients, caregivers and survivors, we thank you for your consideration of our fis-cal year 2015 requests and urge you to support the aforementioned Federal pro-grams so vital to conquering this horrible disease. PREPARED STATEMENT OF PARENTS OF DEAD CHILDREN Can you please address a serious health epidemic that is affecting families every- where? There is a medical epidemic that no one in Congress seems to want to ad-dress. That is heroin addiction and proper ways to treat it. The government is spending way too much money in the wrong places and the money should go for helpful and intensive treatment, including a significant amount of time addressing mental health treatment\u2014again, something no one wants to talk about. Addicts do not choose to be addicts, which seems to be the way the vast majority of Americans like to think about it. There are mental health issues that go untreated and lead to self-medication. Methadone Clinics are a huge failure and have little to no over-sight and certainly have no statistics that provide meaningful data as to their suc-cess or failure. The money poured into those places could be better utilized. Also, more oversight of in patient treatment centers is desperately needed\u2014these are money making ventures and they say they treat for co-occurring disorders (such as bi-polar), it is a joke. If a patient meets one on one with a psychiatrist for half an hour every 2 weeks, how does that help? Read this article:The Problem Busi- nesses Sine Nomine, Yahoo Contributor Network Mar 30, 2007 Today, many Americans go to a methadone clinic. Some do it for legitimate rea- sons, others do it just to get a high. The problem with these methadone clinics are that they are for-profit organizations. Many people do not realize that the metha-done clinic is a business. Businesses are open to make money. Here in lies the big-gest problem facing people who do go to these clinics. The nurses, the counselors, and the doctors that are there to help patients are actually there to keep patients coming back. Why would they want someone to quit coming to the clinic? If every-one decided to quit using methadone then they would be out of a job. I know many people who get up every morning and make it to the methadone clinic. Some of these people have tried to quit and they always go back. Most don't even last 2 days without their methadone. These people have ended up trading one addiction for an-other. That is what methadone is, a legal addiction. People can go there everyday and get a legal high. Besides that, regulations for methadone clinics are practically non existent. You can fail a drug test there and not have to worry about it. All that will happen to you is that they will make you come there everyday to get your methadone. You won't be allowed to take any home with you. What is even worse is they do not care if you fail a drug test just as long as your back there the next day to get your next dose. The government needs to step in and make some serious regulations on this business. 619 1''The Current and Projected Economic Burden of Parkinson's Disease in the United States,'' Movement Disorders, Vol. 28, No. 3, 2013. As it stands, right now you can go to the methadone clinic for as long as you need to. There is no turning you away just as long as you can pay for your dose and to make that easier they will even let you charge a day if you don't have the money. People go to the methadone clinic for years even decades because they are addicted to the methadone. Their bodies won't let them quit. They start suffering withdraw symptoms within the first 48 hours. So back to the methadone clinic they go. No one will help you detox if they know you are on methadone. You have to go to a specialized institution to detox off methadone. The government can step in and ban the sell of prescription drugs, ban the use of marijuana, they even tell you where you can and can't smoke today. But what are they doing for the growing methadone problem? Very little. More and more peo-ple are dying every day because of methadone. But let me be clear it is not just the methadone that is killing them. These people are mixing methadone with other drugs such as Xanax, Valium, Percocet, OxyContin, etc. The drug tests done at these methadone clinics show up these other drugs. Yet nothing is done about the fact that these people are abusing other drugs that interact with methadone causing a lethal combination. The government should step in and implement a system for checking this so called business. A system that would allow them to check the drug screens of each individual. Those individuals that cannot pass three drug screens should be eliminated from the program. The government should also make it man-datory to drug test each individual at least twice a week. I also believe that a set time limit for methadone maintenance should be implemented. Every two weeks the patient should be made to come down a minimum of two milligrams of methadone. This means that a patient starting out at 50 mg will be completely off the metha-done in a little under a year. By implementing this system the government would decrease the patients who abuse methadone and would help those who need the methadone without making them methadone addicts.

The deadline for submitting this testimony, May 23rd, would have been his 25th birthday. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE PARKINSON 'SACTION NETWORK Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran: The Parkinson's Action Net- work (PAN) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the fiscal year 2015 appro-priations for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Our comments will focus on the importance of Federal investment in biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Neurological Dis-orders and Stroke (NINDS), which recently adopted a series of priority research rec-ommendations for Parkinson's disease. PAN supports at least $32 billion in funding for the NIH and an increase for NINDS to support the research recommendations set forth by the NINDS planning strategy to bring us closer to better treatments and a cure for Parkinson's disease. PAN is the unified voice of the Parkinson's community advocating for better treat- ments and a cure. In partnership with other Parkinson's organizations and our pow-erful grassroots network, we educate the public and government leaders on better policies for research and improved quality of life for the estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million Americans living with Parkinson's, for whom there is no treatment available that slows, reverses, or prevents progression. As the second most common neurodegenerative condition after Alzheimer's dis- ease, Parkinson's disease is projected to grow substantially over the next few dec-ades as the size of the elderly population grows and will have a direct impact on the healthcare system and economy. A study published in Movement Disorders esti-mated that the economic burden of Parkinson's disease is at least $14.4 billion a year in the United States, and the prevalence of Parkinson's will more than double by the year 2040. 1In addition, the study calculated an additional $6.3 billion in in- direct costs such as missed work or loss of a job for the patient or family member who is helping with care, long-distance travel to see a neurologist or movement dis-order specialist, as well as costs for home modifications, adult day care, and per-sonal care aides. A second study also published in Movement Disorders projected that if Parkin- son's progression were slowed by 50 percent, there would be a 35 percent reduction in excess costs, representing a dramatic reduction in cost of care spread over a 620 2''An Economic Model of Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Slowing Progression in the United States,'' Movement Disorders, Vol. 28, No. 3, 2013. 3''Investing in the Nation's Health,'' Dr. Francis Collins.

De- cember 24, 2013. longer expected survival.2Both studies highlight the enormous economic implica- tions of this devastating disease, and make it abundantly clear that increased re-search funding is a wise investment on the front end to help significantly lower or eliminate costs on the back end. NIH has the unique role of being at the forefront of medical discovery in the United States. NIH supports research in all fifty States, with more than 80 percent of the funding going to universities, research institutions, and small businesses, which create thousands of jobs and grow local economies. In 2012, this amounted to over 402,000 jobs nationwide and $57.8 billion in economic activity. Perhaps even more important than their economic contributions is the practical impact NIH grants have in identifying and developing a better understanding of and treatments for countless complex diseases and disorders. There is currently a concerted effort at NIH to better target areas of unmet med- ical need, including Parkinson's research. In January 2014, NINDS approved a list of 31 priority research recommendations specific to Parkinson's that highlight areas in which NINDS and the broader field should direct its resources to achieve the greatest impact in addressing treatments and the underlying causes of the disease. These recommendations were the result of an intensive planning process that brought together clinicians, researchers, and the patient community to determine the areas of greatest need to reframe how we approach the disease. We applaud NINDS for their leadership in this effort, which represents an unparalleled oppor-tunity to coordinate critical initiatives to help unlock the mysteries of Parkinson's\u2014 but its success is dependent upon strengthening funding at NIH and NINDS to en-sure that sufficient capacity and resources are available. Unfortunately, due to ongoing fiscal constraints, including sequestration, the NIH research budget has not kept pace with inflation or the growing needs of an aging population and the overall public health. Sequestration alone cut over $1.55 billion from NIH in fiscal year 2013, which is roughly equivalent to the entire budget for NINDS. NIH, the largest funder of Parkinson's research in the world, was also forced to reduce its Parkinson's-related research from a high of $154 million in fiscal year 2012 to $135 million in fiscal year 2013, a 12 percent decrease. Across the country, many institutions have felt the burden of these cuts, receiving smaller grants or no grants at all. As NIH continues to find high-priority areas to fund in order to advance Parkinson's research, we should be increasing support and not ap-plying cuts that could possibly delay years of progress toward a cure for Parkinson's and other diseases. Despite some greater certainty in the current appropriations cycle because of the budget agreement passed in December 2013, there is still grave concern over the implications for medical research long-term. Dr. Francis Collins, director of NIH, has even noted that ''without sustained investment, many high-priority efforts would move at a substantially slower pace, and years of effectively flat funding for biomedical research have left scientists facing the lowest chances in history of hav-ing their research funded by NIH.'' 3Because of this trend, there is also the fear that the next generation of scientists will leave the United States or be reluctant to enter the field of neurological research at all because of the uncertainty in finan-cial support they see and feel here at home. Innovation and new possibilities for medical research are at our fingertips, and we must be sure that we have the re-sources in place to fully recognize and cultivate their potential. We recognize that due to spending caps put into place by the 2013 budget agree- ment, the President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal only requests a modest in-crease for NIH and many other important programs. But, we also understand that the final decision on how these funds should be allocated within those caps is the responsibility of Congress\u2014and we look to you for your leadership and support. PAN urges the Subcommittee to prioritize biomedical research funding by sup-porting at least $32 billion for the NIH overall and increasing funding for NINDS to advance critical priorities designed to fundamentally change our understanding of Parkinson's disease. We look forward to working with the Subcommittee as the fiscal year 2015 appropriations process moves forward. 621 1U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General, DHHS, Rockville, MD, 2000. 2Ibid. 3Ibid. 4HCUPnet, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, ''Information on ED visits from the HCUP Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS),'' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. http://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/ 5''315 Patients a Day Seek Dental Treatment in Florida's Hospital Emergency Rooms,'' a news release by the Florida Public Health Institute, (December 15, 2011). 6Andy Miller, ''Fight over Georgia dental rules flares again,'' Georgia Health News, September 7, 2011, http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2011/09/fight-dental-rules-flares/. 7U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General, DHHS, Rockville, MD, 2000. 8T.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE PEWCHILDREN 'SDENTAL CAMPAIGN On behalf of the Pew Children's Dental Campaign, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding appropriations for fiscal year 2015. We appreciate the subcommittee's recognition of oral health as a key aspect of overall health and its continued support of programs that expand access to preventive and restorative services through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Pew Children's Dental Campaign works at the State and national levels to ensure that more children receive dental care and benefit from evidence-based poli-cies, such as community water fluoridation, dental sealant programs, and expansion of the dental workforce. Since it was established in 2008, our initiative has produced numerous reports evaluating access to care across the 50 States and the District of Columbia, and while we have made significant progress in advancing reforms na-tionally and in the States, there is still much to be done on this important issue. Tooth decay affects nearly 60 percent of the Nation's children, and, unsurprisingly, its consequences are concentrated disproportionately among low-in-come children. 1Dental disease is the most common chronic disease among children in the U.S.\u2014five times more prevalent than asthma, and in a single year, U.S. stu-dents may miss as many as 51 million hours of school due to dental health prob-lems. 2It causes pain, hampers school performance, and if left untreated can lead to tooth loss and abscesses that spread infection to the blood and brain.3 Lack of access to preventive services and oral healthcare also imposes a huge cost on States. In 2011, preventable dental conditions were the primary reason for 857, 712 emergency room (ER) visits in the U.S. 4In 2010, Florida spent more than $88 million on more than 115,000 hospital ER visits for dental problems and in 2007, 60,000 dental visits to ERs cost the State of Georgia more than $23 million. 5,6Den- tal problems can also impact the workforce, causing an estimated 164 million hours of lost work time each year, and can inhibit a person's ability to find a job. 7Addi- tionally, a 2008 study of the armed forces found that 52 percent of new recruits were found to be Class 3 in ''dental readiness,'' meaning they had oral health prob-lems that needed urgent attention and would delay overseas deployment. 8 Given the enormous impact of oral health on overall health and the associated so- cial and economic consequences, we respectfully request that the subcommittee con-sider the following appropriations requests for programs that aim to expand access to care and preventive services for those most in need. Focusing on prevention With support from the CDC Division of Oral Health, States can better promote oral health and efficiently administer scarce resources, monitor oral health status and problems, and conduct and evaluate prevention programs through cooperative agreements. This funding is critical to a State's ability to prevent problems before they occur, rather than treating them when they are painful and expensive. The co-operative agreement program also supports State community water fluoridation pro-grams and school-based dental sealant programs, and while funding for this pro-gram has been authorized for all 50 States, the Division is currently only able to support 21 States: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Research shows that community water fluoridation offers one of the greatest re- turns on investment of any preventive healthcare strategy.

Funding request for fiscal year 2015: $19 million for the CDC Division of Oral Health to expand cooperative agreements to additional States Addressing the dental access crisis Pew's 2013 brief, In Search of Dental Care, found that roughly 45 million Ameri- cans live in dental professional shortage areas, regions that have a scarcity of den-tists relative to the population. 13Additionally, in 2011, more than 14 million chil- dren enrolled in Medicaid did not receive any dental service, in part due to the low numbers of dentist participation in the Medicaid program. 14The supply of dentists nationally is also likely to shrink in the coming years. The American Dental Asso-ciation projects that despite the addition of new dental schools and possible increase in graduates, between 2010 and 2030 the ratio of dentists to Americans will con-tinue to fall due to high numbers of dentists approaching retirement age. 15 Many States are expanding scope of practice laws to enable a variety of dental care providers to expand access to care to the underserved, such as dental therapists in Minnesota and Alaska tribal lands, public health hygienists in Kentucky, Mary-land, and New Hampshire, and community dental health coordinators in Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. A Federal demonstra- tion grant program authorized in 2010 but currently unfunded would provide train-ing institutions, community health centers, public hospitals, and other organizations with funding to train these types of providers, all in accordance with State scope of practice laws, and evaluate their impact on access to care. 16Also eligible for fund- ing through this demonstration are programs such as one in California that uses telehealth services to bring care to patients in Head Start centers and nursing homes 17and ER diversion programs that link public hospitals to federally qualified health centers.18 Pilot efforts to assess how new dental providers can increase access to care are being developed in Oregon, Michigan, Connecticut and Hawaii, and Maine, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, and Washington are among the States considering legislation to 623 19David A.

These providers and programs can increase access at a lower cost to States, and numerous studies have reaffirmed the quality of the services being provided. 19These evaluations would not only benefit those States that have authorized alternative providers, but would also provide information to inform policies in the many other States that are struggling to find answers to the challenge of expanding access to the underserved. HRSA funding request for fiscal year 2015: \u2014Removal of the current funding block on existing funding for the Alternative Dental Health Care Provider Demonstration Grants, Section 340G-1 of the Public Health Service Act, and an appropriation of $10 million to initiate the program \u2014$32 million for Title VII program grants to expand and educate the dental workforce By making targeted Federal investments in effective policy approaches, the sub- committee can enable States to sustain programs that prevent the pain, missed school hours and long-term health and economic consequences of untreated dental disease. A handful of States are leading the way, but all States can and must do more to ensure access to dental care for those who need it most. Thank you for your consideration of this testimony. [This statement was submitted by Shelly Gehshan, Director, Pew Children's Den- tal Campaign.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT EDUCATION ASSOCIATION On behalf of the 187 accredited physician assistant (PA) education programs in the United States, the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA) is pleased to submit these comments on the fiscal year 2015 appropriations for PA education programs that are authorized through Title VII of the Public Health Service Act. PAEA supports funding of at least $280 million in fiscal year 2015 for the health professions education programs authorized under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act and administered through the Health Resources and Services Adminis-tration (HRSA). We also request $12 million of that funding support PA programs operating across the country. This is the only designated source of Federal funding for PA education and is crucial to the U.S. PA education system's ability to meet the demand for education and to continue to produce highly skilled physician assist-ants ready to enter the healthcare workforce in an average of 26 months. The way that PAs are educated in America\u2014the caliber of our institutions and the expertise of our educators\u2014is the gold-standard throughout the world and that distinction must be maintained in this period of unprecedented patient need and rapid growth within the PA profession. Need for Increased Federal Funding The unmet need for primary care services in the United States is well docu- mented, and only expected to grow as Baby Boomers age and the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented. The very parameters of access and healthcare quality are rapidly evolving. Yet the one constant in our healthcare system remains the need for qualified healthcare providers in numbers sufficient to meet demand, and pri-mary care has been clearly identified as the critical entry point into the healthcare system where that access must be guaranteed. The PA profession was created spe-cifically to address a shortage of primary care physicians almost fifty years ago, and today's PAs stand ready to help address the challenges our Nation faces in primary care. The effectiveness of physician assistants is well-documented by studies show-ing better patient access, especially for Medicaid patients, high patient satisfaction, more frequent patient education, and healthcare outcomes similar to physicians. Im-portantly, PAs could play an even larger role in high-quality, cost-effective care if offered appropriate financial support and through innovations in the PA education system. Like physicians, the PA profession also faces a shortage of graduates that will hinder its ability to help fully address the primary care issue in the United States. Without new solutions, at the current output of approximately 7000 graduates from PA programs per year, these shortages will persist, particularly in the rural and un-derserved communities where care is needed the most. Title VII is the only funding 624 source that provides direct support for PA programs and plays a crucial role in de- veloping and supporting the education system's ability to produce the next genera-tion of these advanced practice clinicians. Background on the Profession Since the 1960s, PAs have consistently demonstrated they are effective partners in healthcare, readily adaptable to the needs of an ever-changing delivery system. Physician assistants are licensed health professionals with advanced education in general medicine that practice medicine as members of the healthcare team. They provide a broad range of medical and therapeutic services to diverse populations in rural and urban settings, including prescriptive authority in all 50 States, the Dis-trict of Columbia, and Guam. PAs practice medicine to the extent allowed by law and within the physician's scope of practice and their combination of medical train-ing, advanced education, and hands-on experience allows PAs to practice with sig-nificant autonomy, and in rural and other medically underserved areas where they are often the only full-time medical provider. The profession is well established, yet nimble enough to embrace new models of care, adopt innovative approaches to train-ing and education, and adapt to health system challenges. The PA practice model is, by design, a team-based approach to patient-centered care where the PA works in tandem with a physician and other health professionals. This PA practice ap-proach to quality care is uniquely aligned with the patient-centered, collaborative, interprofessional and outcomes-based care models transforming the U.S. healthcare system. PA Education: The Pipeline for Physician Assistants There are currently 187 accredited PA education programs in the United States\u2014 a 23 percent increase over the past 5 years; together these programs graduate over 7,000 PA students each year. PAs are educated as generalists in medicine and that training gives them the flexibility to practice in more than 60 medical and surgical specialties. More than one third of PA program graduates are working in a primary care specialty. The average PA education program is 26 months in length and includes one didac- tic year in the classroom, and another year devoted to clinical rotations. Most cur- ricula include 340 hours of basic sciences and nearly 2,000 hours of clinical training, second only to physicians in time spent in clinical study. As of today, approximately 65 new PA programs are in the pipeline at various stages of development and moving toward accredited status. The growth rate in the applicant pool is even more pronounced. Since its inception in 2001 through the most recent application cycle, the Centralized Application Service (CASPA) used by most programs grew from 4,669 applicants to over 20,000. As of March 2014, there were 19,968 applicants to PA education programs, a 36 percent increase in CASPA applicants over the past 5 years alone. The PA profession is expected to continue to grow as a result of the projected shortages of physicians and other healthcare professionals, the growing demand for care driven by an aging population, and the continuing strong PA applicant pool. Accordingly, The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 39 percent increase in the number of PA jobs between 2008 and 2018. With its relatively short initial training time and the flexibility of generalist-trained PAs, the PA profession is well-posi-tioned to help fill projected shortages in the numbers of healthcare professionals\u2014 if appropriate resources are available to support the education system behind them. AREAS OF ACUTE NEED Faculty Shortages Faculty development is one of the profession's critical needs and educators are an often overlooked element to developing an adequate primary care workforce. Nearly half of PA program faculty are 50 years or older and the PA teaching profession faces large numbers of retirements in the next 10-15 years. An interest in education must be developed early in the educational process to ensure a continuous stream of educators, and to do so, we must alleviate the significant loan burdens that pre-vent many physician assistants from entering academia. In order to attract the most highly qualified faculty, PA education programs must have the resources to help cli-nicians transition into education, including curriculum development, teaching meth-ods, and laboratory instruction. Most educators come from clinical practice and these non-clinical professional skills are essential to a successful transition from clinical practice to a classroom setting. Without Federal support, we will face an im-pending shortage of educators who are prepared for and committed to the critical teaching role that will ensure the next generation of skilled practitioners. 625 Clinical Site Shortages Outside of the classroom, PA education faces additional challenges in meeting de- mand. A lack of clinical sites for PA education is hampering PA programs' ability to produce PAs at the pace needed to meet the demand for primary care in the U.S. This shortage is caused by two main factors: a shortage of medical professionals willing to teach students as they are cycling through their clinical rotations (precep-tors), and a lack of sites with the physical space to teach. This phenomenon is experienced throughout the health professions, and is par- ticularly acute in primary care. It has created unintentional competition for clinical sites and preceptors within and among PAs, physicians and advance practice nurses. Federal funding can help incentivize practicing clinicians to both offer their time as preceptors, and volunteer their clinical operations as training grounds for PAs and other health professionals to train together and directly interact with patients as a team. PAEA believes that interprofessional clinical training and practice are nec-essary for optimum patient care and will be a defining model of healthcare in the U.S. in the 21st century. We can only make that a reality if we begin to build a sufficient network of health professionals who are willing to teach the next genera-tion of primary care professionals\u2014that approach will benefit PAs as well as the fu-ture physicians, nurses and other clinicians that comprise the full primary care team. Enhancing Diversity Workforce diversity, and practice in underserved areas are key priorities identi- fied by HRSA and are consistent with those of PAEA. It is increasingly important for patient care quality that the health workforce better represents America's chang-ing demographics, as well as addresses the issues of disparities in healthcare. PA programs have been committed to attracting students from underrepresented minor-ity groups and disadvantaged backgrounds into the profession, including veterans who have served our country and desire to transition to civilian health professions. Studies have found that health professionals from underserved areas are three to five times more likely to return to underserved areas to provide care, and PA pro-grams are looking for unique ways to recruit diverse individuals into the profession, and sustain them as leaders in the education field. If we can provide resources to schools that are particularly poised to improve their diversity recruitment efforts and replicate or create best practices including transition programs for our veterans, we can begin to address this systemic need. In order to leverage the efforts of PA programs through Title VII funding to in- crease workforce diversity in the PA profession, PAEA also supports the restoration of funding for the Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP), and increased funding for the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students and National Health Serv-ice Corps. Historically, access to higher education has been constrained for individ-uals from disadvantaged backgrounds. These programs help to provide a clear path for students who might not otherwise consider a physician assistant career. Title VII Funding Title VII funding fills a critical need for curriculum development, faculty develop- ment, clinical site expansion and diversification of the primary care workforce\u2014 areas that if appropriately supported can help ensure the PA profession realizes its full promise in the U.S. healthcare system. These funds enhance clinical training and education, assist PA programs with recruiting applicants from minority and dis-advantaged backgrounds, and enable innovative programs that focus on educating a culturally competent workforce. Title VII funding increases the likelihood that PA students will practice in medically underserved communities with health profes-sional shortages. The absence of this funding would result in the loss of care to pa-tients with the most urgent need for access to care. Title VII support for PA programs was strengthened in 2010 when Congress en- acted a 15 percent allocation in the Appropriations process specifically for PA pro-grams working to address the health provider shortage. This funding has enhanced capabilities to train a growing PA workforce, creatively expand care to the under-served, and develop a more diverse PA workforce: \u2014One Texas program has used its PA training grant to support the program at a distant site in an underserved area. This grant provides assistance to the pro-gram for recruiting, educating, and training PA students in the largely Hispanic South Texas and mid-Texas/Mexico border areas and supports new faculty de-velopment. \u2014A Utah program has used its PA training grant to promote interprofessional teams. The grant allowed the program to optimize its relationship with three service-learning partners, develop new partnerships with three service-learning 626 sites, and create a model geriatric curriculum that includes didactic and clinical education. \u2014An Alabama program used its PA training grant to update and expand the cur- rent health behavior educational curriculum and HIV/STD training. They were also able to include PA students from other programs who were interested in rural, primary care medicine for a four-week comprehensive educational pro-gram in HIV disease diagnosis and management. Recommendations on fiscal year 2015 Funding The Physician Assistant Education Association requests the Appropriations Com- mittee's support in funding for Title VII health professions programs at a minimum of $280 million for fiscal year 2015.This level of funding is crucial to support the Nation's ability to produce and maintain highly skilled primary care practitioners, particularly those from diverse backgrounds and the military who will practice in medically underserved areas and serve vulnerable populations. We also ask for the continuation of the 15 percent allocation for PA education programs in the Primary Care cluster as mandated in the Affordable Care Act. The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant estimates that an additional 75 programs will be added by 2018. Therefore, we request an increase in funding to $12 million which will allow sufficient funding for the expanding number of PA programs expected to begin enrolling students during the next four to 5 years. We thank the members of the subcommittee for their support of the health profes- sions and look forward to your continued commitment to finding solutions to the Na-tion's health workforce shortage. We appreciate the opportunity to present the Phy-sician Assistant Education Association's fiscal year 2015 funding recommendation. [This statement was submitted by Anthony Miller, M.Ed., PA-C Chief Policy and Research Officer.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE POPULATION ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AND ASSOCIATION OF POPULATION CENTERS Introduction Thank you, Mr. Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and other distin- guished members of the Subcommittee, for this opportunity to express support for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These agencies are important to the members of the Population Association of America (PAA) and Association of Popu-lation Centers (APC) because they provide direct and indirect support to population scientists and the field of population, or demographic, research overall. In fiscal year 2015, we urge the Subcommittee to adopt the following funding recommendations: NIH, $32 billion, consistent with the level recommended by the Ad Hoc Group for Medical Research; NCHS, $182 million, consistent with the Administration's re-quest; and BLS, $610 million, consistent with the Administration's request, at a minimum. The PAA and APC are two affiliated organizations that together represent over 3,000 social and behavioral scientists and almost 40 population research centers na-tionwide that conduct research on the implications of population change. Our mem-bers, which include demographers, economists, sociologists, and statisticians, con-duct scientific research, analyze changing demographic and socio-economic trends, develop policy recommendations, and train undergraduate and graduate students. Their research expertise covers a wide range of issues, including adolescent health and development, aging, health disparities, immigration and migration, marriage and divorce, education, social networks, housing, retirement, and labor. National Institutes of Health Demography is the study of populations and how or why they change. A key com- ponent of the NIH mission is to support biomedical, social, and behavioral research that will improve the health of our population. The health of our population is fun-damentally intertwined with the demography of our population. Recognizing the connection between health and demography, NIH supports extramural population research programs primarily through the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). National Institute on Aging To inform the implications of our rapidly aging population, policymakers need ob- jective, reliable data about the antecedents and impact of changing social, demo-graphic, economic, health and well-being characteristics of the older population. The 627 NIA Division of Behavioral and Social Research (BSR) is the primary source of Fed- eral support for basic research on these topics. In addition to supporting an impressive research portfolio that includes the pres- tigious Centers on the Demography and Economics of Aging, the NIA BSR Division also supports several large surveys that produce accessible data. These surveys in-clude the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), which has enrolled 8,000 Medicare beneficiaries with the goal of studying late-life disability trends and dynamics. The study also includes a supplement to examine informal caregivers and their impact on the utilization of long-term care by people with chronic disabilities. Another NIA survey, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), provides unique in-formation about economic transitions in work, income, and wealth, allowing sci-entists to study how the domains of family, economic resources, and health interact. The HRS has collected data every 2 years since 1992, including most recently, bio-markers, from a representative sample of more than 26,000 Americans over the age of 50. These data are accessible to researchers worldwide and have informed numer-ous scientific findings. For example, in 2013, researchers using the HRS published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, concluding that the cost of pro-viding dementia care is comparable to, if not greater than, those for heath disease and cancer. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Since 1968, NICHD has supported research on population processes and change. This research is housed in the Institute's Population Dynamics Branch, which sup-ports research and training in demography, reproductive health, and population health and funds major national studies that track the health and well-being of chil-dren and their families from childhood through adulthood. These studies include Fragile Families and Child Well-Being, the first scientific study to track the health and development of children born to unmarried parents, and the National Longitu-dinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), tracing the effects of childhood and adolescent exposures on later health. One of the most important population research programs that the NICHD sup- ports is the Population Dynamics Centers Research Infrastructure Program. This program promotes innovation, supports interdisciplinary research, translates sci-entific findings into practice, and develops the next generation of population sci-entists. In addition, the centers provide incentives to reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of research by streamlining and consolidating research infrastructure. The population research centers generate and facilitate significant scientific re-search findings as well. For example, in March 2014, researchers at Johns Hopkins University published findings in JAMA, concluding that opening or expanding casi-nos on California tribal lands reduces poverty and the obesity rate of children by almost 3 percent. National Center for Health Statistics The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is the Nation's principal statis- tical agency. Most notably, NCHS funds and manages the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), which contracts with the States to collect birth and death certificate information, and funds a number of complex large surveys, such as National Survey of Family Growth and National Health Interview Survey, which are an invaluable resource for population scientists. The Subcommittee's support of NCHS in recent years has enabled it to make significant progress toward modernizing the NVSS and expediting the release of these data to the user community. Yet, much work is still needed to fully modernize the NVSS and to support necessary expansions to the agency's core surveys so that these data can effectively assess Americans' health. Bureau of Labor Statistics The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) produces essential economic information for public and private decisionmaking. Its data are used extensively by population sci-entists who study and evaluate labor and related economic policies and programs. Given the importance and unique nature of BLS data, we urge the Subcommittee to support the Administration's request, $610 million, at a minimum, but to consider increasing its funding to $631 million. This additional funding is necessary to re-store the agency's purchasing power back to fiscal year 2010 levels and specifically to restore recent program cuts. Thank you for considering the importance of these agencies under your jurisdic- tion that benefit the population sciences.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PREVENT BLINDNESS FUNDING REQUEST OVERVIEW Prevent Blindness appreciates the opportunity to submit written testimony for the record regarding fiscal year 2015 funding for vision and eye health related pro-grams. As the Nation's leading non-profit, voluntary health organization dedicated to preventing blindness and preserving sight, Prevent Blindness maintains a long- standing commitment to working with policymakers at all levels of government, or-ganizations and individuals in the eye care and vision loss community, and other interested stakeholders to develop, advance, and implement policies and programs that prevent blindness and preserve sight. Prevent Blindness respectfully requests that the Subcommittee provide the following allocations in fiscal year 2015 to help promote eye health and prevent eye disease and vision loss: \u2014Provide at least $1,000,000 to strengthen the Vision Health Initiative (visual screening education) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u2014Provide at least $3,319,000 to continue the Glaucoma Project at the CDC. \u2014Support the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's (MCHB) National Center for Children's Vision and Eye Health. \u2014Provide at least $639 million in to sustain programs under the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant. \u2014Provide at least $730 million to the National Eye Institute (NEI). INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW Vision-related conditions affect people across the lifespan. Good vision is an inte- gral component to health and well-being, affects virtually all activities of daily liv-ing, and impacts individuals physically, emotionally, socially, and financially. Loss of vision can have a devastating impact on individuals and their families. An esti-mated 80 million Americans have a potentially blinding eye disease, three million have low vision, more than one million are legally blind, and 200,000 are more se-verely visually blind. Vision impairment in children is a common condition that af-fects five to 10 percent of preschool age children, and is a leading cause of impaired health in childhood. Recent research showed that the economic burden of vision loss and eye disorders is $139 billion each year, $47.4 billion of which is Federal spend-ing. Alarmingly, while half of all blindness can be prevented through education, early detection, and treatment, the NEI reports that ''the number of Americans with age-related eye disease and the vision impairment that results is expected to double within the next three decades.'' 1 To curtail the increasing incidence of vision loss in America, and its accompanying economic burden, Prevent Blindness advocates sustained and meaningful Federal funding for programs that promote eye health and prevent eye disease, vision loss, and blindness; needed services and increased access to vision screening; and vision and eye disease research. In a time of significant fiscal constraints, we recognize the challenges facing the Subcommittee and urge you to consider the ramifications of decreased investment in vision and eye health. Vision loss is often preventable, but without continued efforts to better understand eye conditions, and their treatment, through research, to develop the public health systems and infrastructure to dis-seminate and implement good science and prevention strategies, and to protect chil-dren's vision, millions of Americans face the loss of independence, loss of health, and the loss of their livelihoods, all because of the loss of their vision. VISION AND EYE HEALTH AT THE CDC : HELPING TO SAVE SIGHT AND SAVE MONEY The CDC serves a critical role in promoting vision and eye health. Since 2003, the CDC and Prevent Blindness have collaborated with other partners to create a more effective public health approach to vision loss prevention and eye health pro-motion. The CDC works to promote eye health and prevent vision loss; improve the health and lives of people living with vision loss by preventing complications, dis-abilities, and burden; reduce vision and eye health related disparities; and integrate vision health with other public health strategies. However, severely constrained fi-nancial resources have limited the CDC's ability to take the work of the Vision Health Initiative (VHI) to the next level. Prevent Blindness requests at least $1,000,000 in fiscal year 2015 to strengthen vision and eye health efforts of the CDC. This funding level would allow the VHI to increase vision impairment and eye disease surveillance efforts, apply previous 629 CDC vision and eye health research findings to develop effective prevention and early detection interventions, and begin to incorporate vision and eye health pro-motion activities into State and national public health chronic disease initiatives, with an initial focus on early detection of diabetic retinopathy Improving Access to Eye Care for those at High Risk for Glaucoma An estimated 2.2 million people are affected by glaucoma. A disease of the aging eye, risk for glaucoma increases with age, especially among black, Hispanic/Latinos, and Asians. Once vision is lost to glaucoma, it cannot be restored, but with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it is possible to slow disease progression and save the remaining sight. Detection and management of glaucoma are challenged by difficulties in reaching high-risk populations and by the lack of simple, cost-effec-tive screening plans. Prevent Blindness requests at least $3,319,000 in fiscal year 2015 to continue the work of the Glaucoma Project to improve glaucoma screening, referral, and treat-ment. The program is intended to reach those populations experiencing the greatest disparity in access to glaucoma care through an integrated collaboration among pri-vate and public organizations. INVESTING IN THE VISION OF OUR NATION 'S MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE \u2014CHILDREN While the risk of eye disease increases after the age of 40, eye and vision prob- lems in children are of equal concern. The visual system in children younger than 8 years old is in a critical developmental stage. Unidentified and untreated vision problems can lead to permanent and irreversible visual loss and/or cause problems socially, academically, and developmentally in this critical time of a child's life. Cur-rently, only one in three children receive eye care services before the age of six.[1] Requirements for preventive eye care/vision screenings prior to or during the school years vary broadly from State to State. Many States have no standards and those with standards present with little consistency regarding type, frequency, and refer-ral or follow-up requirement protocol.[i] Inclusion of vision screenings with a com-prehensive approach to follow up treatment and an integrated approach to data col-lection as a part of the required health component for grant recipients will help to change disparities in vision and eye health for our Nation's children. In 2009, the MCHB established the National Center for Children's Vision and Eye Health (the Center), a national vision health collaborative effort aimed at developing the public health infrastructure necessary to promote eye health and ensure access to a continuum of eye care for young children. The Center is guided by an Advisory Committee comprised of the Nation's leaders in children's vision and public health to implement national guidelines for quality improvement strategies, vision screening and developing a continuum of children's vision and eye health. With this support the Center, will continue to: (1) provide national leadership in dissemination of best practices, infrastructure development, professional education, and national vision screening guidelines that ensure a con-tinuum of vision and eye healthcare for children; (2) advance State-based perform-ance improvement systems, screening guidelines, and mechanisms for uniform data collection and reporting; and (3) provide technical assistance to States in the imple-mentation of strategies for vision screening, establishing quality improvement meas-ures, and improving mechanisms for surveillance. Prevent Blindness also requests at least $639 million in fiscal year 2015 to sus- tain programs under the MCH Block Grant. The MCH Block Grant enables States to expand critical healthcare services to millions of pregnant women, infants and children, including those with special healthcare needs. In addition to direct serv-ices, the MCH Block Grant supports vital programs, preventive and systems build-ing services needed to promote optimal health\u2014including the National Center for Children's Vision and Eye Health. ADVANCE AND EXPAND VISION RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES Prevent Blindness calls upon the Subcommittee to provide $730 million for the NEI to enable the agency to pursue its primary ''audacious goal'' of restoring vision by bolstering its efforts to identify the underlying causes of eye disease and vision loss, improve early detection and diagnosis of eye disease and vision loss, and ad-vance prevention and treatment efforts. Research is critical to ensure that new treatments and interventions are developed to help reduce and eliminate vision problems and potentially blinding eye diseases facing consumers across the country. By providing additional funding for the NEI at the NIH, essential efforts to identify the underlying causes of eye disease and vision loss, improve early detection and 630 diagnosis of eye disease and vision loss, and advance prevention, treatment efforts and health information dissemination will be bolstered. CONCLUSION On behalf of Prevent Blindness, our Board of Directors, and the millions of people at risk for vision loss and eye disease, we thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony regarding fiscal year 2015 funding for the CDC's vision and eye health efforts, the MCHB's National Center for Children's Vision and Eye Health, and the NEI. Please know that Prevent Blindness stands ready to work with the Subcommittee and other Members of Congress to advance policies that will prevent blindness and preserve sight. Please feel free to contact us at any time; we are happy to be a resource to Subcommittee members and your staff. We very much ap-preciate the Subcommittee's attention to\u2014and consideration of\u2014our requests.

You do not hear about it as much as prostate cancer because men do not discuss such issues with their friends, families and acquaintances. Many couples assume there may be a stigma to having the annoying condition. Even many urologists tell them there is no cure and they will just have to live with it. Prostatitis is a family affair as it presents itself as a disabling pain accompanied by sexual dysfunction and infertility issues. It usually causes a hesitant urination and an inability to empty the bladder. Patients are sometimes unable to work and sometimes even become suicidal. Prostatitis is a huge financial drain as it tends to imitate prostate cancer symp- toms. The tests and procedures needed to rule out prostate cancer are very expen-sive and often unnecessary but needed to reassure the patient and his family. Pros-tatitis has been mentioned in historical literature from previous times and genera-tions ago. The NIH has worked to find a cause and cure for (CP/CPPS) chronic prostatitis/ chronic pelvic pain syndrome for nearly twenty years. In the latest research group called the MAPP Research Network they have included other specialties than urolo-gists to help find a clue to prostatitis which affects 10 percent of men all over the world. It is critical to fully fund those research efforts of the NIH and keep the CDC involved. [This statement was submitted by Mike Hennenfent, President, Prostatitis Foun- dation.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE PULMONARY HYPERTENSION ASSOCIATION Chairman Harkin and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for your time and your consideration of the priorities of the pulmonary hypertension community as you work to craft the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill. ABOUT PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disabling and often fatal condition simply de- scribed as high blood pressure in the lungs. It affects people of all ages, races and ethnic backgrounds. Although anyone can get PH, there are risk factors that make some people more susceptible. Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type of PH. In one type, pul- monary arterial hypertension (PAH), the arteries in the lungs become too narrow to handle the amount of blood that must be pumped through the lungs. This causes several things to happen: a backup of blood in the veins returning blood to the heart; an increase in the pressure that the right side of your heart has to pump against to push blood through your lungs; and a strain on the right side of your heart due to the increased work that it has to do. If this increased pressure is not treated, the right side of your heart can become overworked, become very weak and may possibly fail. Because the blood has difficulty getting through the lungs to pick up oxygen, your blood oxygen level may be lower than normal. This can put a strain 631 not only on your heart, but also decrease the amount of oxygen getting to your brain. There is currently no cure for PAH. Twelve treatment options are available to help patients manage their disease and feel better day to day but even with treat-ment, life expectancy with PAH is limited. ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION From simple beginnings\u2014four women who met around a kitchen table in Florida in 1990\u2014the Pulmonary Hypertension Association has evolved into a community of well over 10,000 pulmonary hypertension patients, caregivers, family members and medical professionals. As we have grown, we have stayed true to our roots and the vision and ingenuity of our founders: We continue to work every day to end the isolation that PH pa-tients face, and find a cure for pulmonary hypertension. Research PHA provides grants to promising researchers in the field of pulmonary hyper- tension. The program fosters new leaders in the field by supporting their interest in PH research and providing them with opportunities to work with mentors and learn new skills. Researchers supported by PHA are looking for new methods for early detection, new treatments to prevent the onset of PH and ultimately a cure for this terrible illness. To date, PHA has leveraged more than $13 million in PH research funding through partnerships with the NIH and others. Early Diagnosis Campaign It takes too long for pulmonary hypertension to be diagnosed. The median sur- vival rate without treatment is approximately 2.8 years, making the need to obtain a rapid and accurate diagnosis urgent. Unfortunately, the median duration from symptom onset to a confirmed diagnosis by right heart catheterization is 1.1 years. We are reaching patients too late in the process. Almost three-fourths of patients have advanced PH by the time they are diagnosed, leading more costly treatments and poorer outcomes. For the most advanced cases of PH, a lung or heart-lung transplant may be the only treatment option. The goal of PHA's Early Diagnosis Campaign is to discover the disease sooner in the early stages. This will allow the start of a treatment regimen that can slow the progression of PH and secure a bet-ter life for the patient. Center Accreditation The Pulmonary Hypertension Association's Scientific Leadership Council, 28 glob- al leaders in the field of pulmonary hypertension, have spearheaded the PHA-Ac-credited PH Care Centers (PHCC) initiative. The goal of this initiative is to estab-lish a program for accreditation of centers with special expertise in pulmonary hy-pertension (PH), particularly pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to raise the overall quality of care and outcomes in patients with this life-threatening disease. ONE PATIENT 'S STORY In 2011, at the age of 29, GS12 Human Terrain Analyst Jessica (Puglisi) Arm- strong began experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness. She was in Afghani-stan at the time. Jessica was first diagnosed with dehydration. Then, as is the case with many PH patients, she was told she had asthma and was given an inhaler. Two months later, she fainted for no apparent reason. An echocardiogram revealed blood clots in her lungs and Jessica was medically evacuated to Germany and then to the U.S. Six months after her fist symptoms, she was finally given a complete work up and diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. Jessica, she had a unique form of PH due to blood clots that can be mitigated with a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE)\u2014a complex surgery that involves opening the chest cavity and stopping circulation for up to twenty minutes. She de-scribes the surgery, which she underwent at the University of California San Diego, as ''more painful than I could ever imagine.'' She notes that UCSD's PTE program did not begin until 1990 and even now, despite being recognized as the global lead-ers on this procedure, has only completed about 3,000 surgeries. The procedure that saved Jessica's was developed in her lifetime. Jessica was terminated from Army employment and spent $60,000 out of pocket on medical expenses which she has not been able to recoup. She was forced to begin a civilian job just two weeks after her PTE in order to retain health insurance. De-spite this, Jessica is, in many ways, one of the lucky ones. I am glad to report that she is now doing well and serving an integral role at PHA as the coordinator of our Early Diagnosis Campaign. 632 Over the past decade, treatment options, and the survival rate, for pulmonary hy- pertension patients have improved significantly. However, courageous patients of every age lose their battle with PH each day. There is still a long way to go on the road to a cure and biomedical research holds the promise of a better tomorrow. SEQUESTRATION We have heard from the medical research community that sequestration and def- icit reduction activities have created serious issues for Federal funding opportunities and the career development pipeline. In order to ensure that the pulmonary hyper-tension research portfolio can continue to grow, and, more importantly, to ensure that our country is adequately preparing the next generation of young investigators, we urge you to avert, mitigate, or otherwise eliminate the specter of sequestration. The Association has anecdotal accounts of the harms of sequestration and the Fed-erated American Societies for Experimental Biology has reported: \u2014In constant dollars (adjusted for inflation), the NIH budget in fiscal year 2013 was $6 billion (22.4 percent) less than it was in fiscal year 2003. \u2014The number of competing research project grants (RPGs) awarded by NIH has also fallen sharply since fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2013, NIH made 8,283 RPG awards, which is 2,110 (20.3 percent) fewer than in fiscal year 2003. \u2014Awards for R01-equivalent grants, the primary mechanism for supporting inves- tigator-initiated research, suffered even greater losses. The number awarded fell by 2,528 (34 percent) between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2013. The pay line for some NIH funding mechanisms has fallen from 18 percent to 10 percent while the average age for a researcher to receive their first NIH-funded grant has climbed to 42. These are strong disincentives to choosing a career as a medical researcher. Our scaling-back is occurring at a time when many foreign countries are investing heavily in their biotechnology sectors. China alone plans to dedicate $300 million to medical research over the next 5 years; this amount is dou-ble the current NIH budget over the same period of time. Scientific breakthroughs will continue, but America may not benefit from the return-on-investment of a ro-bust biotechnology sector. For the purposes of economic and national security, as well as public health, the Association asks that you work with your colleagues to eliminate sequestration and recommit to supporting this Nation's biomedical re-search enterprise. HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Due to the serious and life-threatening nature of PH, it is common for patients to face drastic health interventions, including heart-lung transplantation. Federal organ transplantation activities are coordinated through HRSA. To ensure HRSA can expand its important mission and continue to make improvements in donor lists and donor-matching please provide HRSA with a meaningful funding increase in fis-cal year 2015. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION As a result of Federal investment in medical research, there are now twelve FDA- approved treatments for PH. The effectiveness of these therapies though is depend- ent on how early a patient can receive an accurate diagnosis and begin treatment. Unfortunately, two-thirds of patients are not diagnosed until PH has reached a late stage. In addition to mitigating the impact of many treatments, late diagnosis puts PH patients in a position to face interventions like heart-lung transplantation and even death. CDC and NCCDPHP have the resources to compliment PHA's own Sometimes its PH Early Diagnosis Campaign. Improving public awareness and rec-ognition of PH will not only save lives, it can save the Federal healthcare system money. Please provide CDC with meaningful funding increases so the agency can expand its focus beyond winnable battles into increasingly important and cost-effec-tive areas. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH NIH hosts a sizable PH research portfolio. Further, NIH and PHA have a strong track record of working together to advance our scientific understanding of PH. The twelve FDA-approved treatments, more than nearly every other rare disease, are evidence of the return-on-investment from these activities. Please provide NIH with meaningful increases to facilitate expansion of the PH research portfolio so we can continue to improve diagnosis and treatment. 633 NCATS The Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR), located within NCATS, supports and coordinates rare disease research and provides information on rare diseases to patients, their families, healthcare providers, researchers and the public. In collabo-ration with other NIH institutes, ORDR funds rare diseases research primarily through the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN), which supports clinical studies, investigator training, pilot projects, and access to information on rare diseases. The most recent funding opportunity announcement, which was wide-ly broadcast and open to all rare diseases, including PAH, was issued in the fall of 2013 and awards are expected to be made in the summer of 2014 NHLBI The NHLBI-funded Centers for Advanced Diagnostics and Experimental Thera- peutics in Lung Diseases Stage II program, which will begin in fiscal year 2014, will provide a mechanism to accelerate the development of therapies for lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES S. 1453 Senator Robert Casey (D-PA) has introduced the Pulmonary Hypertension Re- search and Diagnosis Act (S.1453). This budget neutral legislation has a bipartisan companion in the House due to its emphasis on lowering healthcare costs by pro-moting efficiencies within the Federal Government. S. 1453 seeks to establish an HHS-wide Committee tasked with preparing a report on how to leverage limited re-sources to improve early diagnosis of PH. Please consider cosponsoring S. 1453 and working with your colleagues to advance this important legislation. S. 2115 PHA has written to Senators Richard Durbin (D-IL) and Barbara Mikulksi (D- MD) to thank them for their leadership on the American Cures Act (S. 2115). We hope this legislation is an indication that policymakers have committed themselves to supporting innovative proposals to bolster and advance our Nation's biomedical research enterprise. PREPARED STATEMENT OF RESEARCH !AMERICA Research!America, the Nation's largest public education and advocacy alliance committed to advancing medical research and development, appreciates your stew-ardship over such a critical subset of our Nation's discretionary funding priorities. As the subcommittee begins the process of prioritizing fiscal year 2015 funding, we urge you to consider the following thoughts on Federal agencies entrusted with sus-taining our Nation's sophisticated public health infrastructure, partnering with the private sector to accelerate medical progress, and optimizing healthcare outcomes. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention (CDC), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) play pivotal roles in combating disabling and deadly health conditions. Moreover, the funding, or lack of it, allocated to these agencies will bear on our Nation's ability to compete in key export markets within the global economy, foster business devel-opment that grows and maintains jobs across the country, meet our solemn obliga-tions to wounded warriors and support troops on the ground, combat deadly medical errors, and protect our Nation against pandemics and emerging health threats. The stakes truly are that high. NIH as a driver of innovation In fiscal year 2015, we urge you to provide at least $32 billion in NIH funding to drive us beyond the stagnation that squanders opportunities to advance science and strengthen our Nation. Research funded by the NIH at universities, academic medical centers, independent research institutions and small businesses across the country lays the foundation for new product development by the private sector. Since much of the research NIH supports is at the non-commercial stages of the re-search pipeline, NIH funding does not compete with, but rather sets the stage for, critical private sector investment and development. These two complementary fund-ing streams lead to business development, job growth and beneficial medical ad-vances. Taxpayer-funded research through the NIH has helped our Nation make re-markable progress against such insidious health threats as childhood cancer, HIV- AIDS and heart disease. 634 The secrets of diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, myriad cancers and many other diseases can and will be unlocked by science. The question is not if, but w h e n... unless we dismiss the significance of such progress and continue to allow research resources to stagnate. And our Nation's best weapon against spi-raling healthcare costs is research. Ignoring growing healthcare costs is a ticket to disaster. Alzheimer's disease alone is projected to cost the Federal Government over $1 trillion during the next 20 years. Ultimately, we must prevent and cure disease in order to tackle the costs associated with it. CDC as a first responder In fiscal year 2015, we urge you to provide a funding level that continues the growth in CDC budget authority that was initiated in fiscal year 2014. The CDC engages in research that stems deadly and costly pandemics, bolsters our Nation's defenses against bioterrorism, and helps prevent the onset of debilitating and expen-sive diseases. The CDC is the Nation's first responder to lethal viruses and infec-tions, including life-threatening and costly drug-resistant infections that pose a par-ticular threat to children and young adults, as well as investigating tragic phe-nomena like cancer clusters. Due to cuts in recent years, the CDC is functioning with one hand tied behind its back, even as health challenges like the obesity epi-demic, autism epidemic and infectious disease outbreaks capture headlines and ruin lives. It is always more efficient and cost effective to be in front of an outbreak or biological attack than to take reactionary measures. AHRQ translates medical innovation into the right care at the right time In fiscal year 2015, we urge you to provide at least $375 million in funding for AHRQ. Research supported by AHRQ identifies inefficiencies in healthcare delivery that inflate the cost of public and private insurance. AHRQ-supported research also combats medical errors and improves the quality of care to help reduce the length and intensity of disability and disease. It helps patients and physicians make in- formed treatment decisions that improve outcomes and reduce costly ''false starts'' in the provision of healthcare services. Just one of many success stories is AHRQ's issuance of new standards of care and practices related to central line-associated bloodstream infections. The implementa-tion of the guidelines resulted in a reduction of up to two-thirds of cases during early rollout studies. With an annual estimated 80,000 cases, up to 28,000 deaths and an average cost per patient of $45,000, this has the potential to save $2.3 billion annually in healthcare costs. Given the enormity of the challenge of inefficiency in healthcare delivery, AHRQ is severely underpowered. The threat of sequestration's return The Ryan-Murray Bipartisan Budget Act provided America with 2 years of partial relief from sequestration after across the board budget cuts dramatically impacted medical research in March 2013. Unfortunately, sequestration will go back into full effect in 2016 unless Congress takes action, and it will be in effect for 2 years longer than originally established under the 2011 Budget Control Act. The return of se-questration's budget cuts to discretionary spending, including that for NIH, CDC and AHRQ, poses potentially devastating setbacks to medical research. Short-chang-ing medical research is not a solution to the Federal deficit or debt. On the contrary, neglecting medical research undercuts strategies to fight chronic disease and the multipronged Federal costs that arise from it, while squandering opportunities to increase private sector and Federal revenues through new medical innovations. Research!America appreciates the difficult task facing the subcommittee as it seeks to simultaneously confront the budget deficit, strengthen the U.S. and pro-mote the well-being of Americans. There are few Federal investments that confer as many benefits as medical research\u2014new cures, new businesses, new jobs, new solutions to healthcare cost inflation, and new fuel to drive U.S. leadership in a global economy shaped by the ability of countries to continuously innovate. We firm-ly believe that investing in NIH, CDC and AHRQ is a means of advancing all three of these fundamental goals. Thank you for your leadership and consideration; we know that your task is extraordinarily difficult, and that our Nation is fortunate to have such pragmatic, committed and gifted leaders at the helm. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH WORKING GROUP Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget overall and for AIDS research in fiscal year 2015. Tomorrow's scientific and medical breakthroughs depend on your vision, leadership, and com-635 mitment to robust NIH funding this year. To this end, the Research Working Group (RWG) urges this Committee to support a funding target of $36 billion in fiscal year 2015 to maintain the United States' position as the world leader in medical research and innovation. Investments in health research via the NIH have paid enormous dividends in the health and wellbeing of people in the U.S. and around the world. NIH-funded HIV and AIDS research has supported innovative basic science for better drug therapies, evidence-based behavioral and biomedical prevention interventions, and vaccines that have saved and improved the lives of millions, and holds great promise for sig-nificantly reducing HIV infection rates and providing more effective treatments for those living with HIV/AIDS in the coming decade. Despite these advances, the number of new HIV/AIDS cases continues to rise in the U.S. and around the world. There are 1.1 million HIV-infected people in the U.S., the highest number in the epidemic's more than 30 year history; additionally over 50,000 Americans become newly infected every year. In 2012, 35.3 million were infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, 1.6 million died from the disease and 2.3 million people were newly infected. With proper funding, we can capitalize on the ongoing scientific progress in therapeutics and prevention science, vaccines, and finding a cure for HIV, as well as addressing the comorbidity such as viral hepatitis and tu-berculosis that affect patients living with HIV. Major advances over the last few years in HIV prevention technologies\u2014with HIV vaccines, medical male circumcision, antiretroviral treatment as prevention, and pre-exposure prophylaxis using antiretrovirals (PrEP) \u2014demonstrate that ade-quately resourced NIH programs can transform our lives. Because HIV disease en-tails many common co-morbidities, HIV research funding is spread across the Insti-tutes and Centers\u2014and HIV research discoveries have had broad benefits for many other conditions including: aging, cancer, immunosuppression and auto-immune dis-orders, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, viral hepatitis, and influenza, among others. Federal support for AIDS research has led to new treat-ments for other diseases, including cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, hepatitis, osteoporosis, and a wide range of autoimmune disorders. Over the years, the NIH has sponsored the evaluation of a host of vaccine can- didates, some of which are advancing to efficacy trials. The successful iPrEx and HPTN 052 trials have shown the potential of antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV infection. Moreover, increased funding will support the future testing of new vac-cines, microbicides and therapeutics in the pipeline via the newly restructured, cross-cutting NIAID clinical trials network that translates NIH-funded scientific in-novation into critical quality-of-life gains. It is also essential to note that NIH-funded HIV pathogenesis and clinical re- search has contributed substantially to our understanding of potential curative ap-proaches. The NIAID clinical trial networks comprise one of the largest groups of clinical research sites in the world and have been instrumental to the progress made in response to the HIV epidemic domestically and globally. These networks are now taking on the challenges of tuberculosis and hepatitis C and have dramati-cally expanded the opportunities to test new drugs and other critically needed inter-ventions to advance knowledge in these leading infectious disease killers. Increased funding for the NIH in fiscal year 2015 makes good bipartisan economic sense, especially in shaky fiscal times. Robust funding for the NIH overall will en-able research universities to pursue scientific opportunity, advance public health, and create jobs and economic growth. In every State across the country, the NIH supports research at hospitals, universities, private enterprises, and medical schools. This includes the creation of jobs that will be essential to future discovery. Sustained investment is also essential to train the next generation of scientists and prepare them to make tomorrow's HIV discoveries. NIH funding puts 350,000 sci-entists to work at research institutions across the country. According to the NIH, each of its research grants creates or sustains six to eight jobs, and NIH-supported research grants and technology transfers have resulted in the creation of thousands of new, independent private-sector companies. Strong, sustained NIH funding is a critical national priority that will foster better health and economic revitalization. Since 2003, funding for the NIH has failed to keep up with our existing research needs\u2014damaging the success rate of approved grants and leaving very little money to fund promising new research. The real value of the increases prior to 2003 has precipitously declined because of the relatively higher inflation rate for the cost of research and development activities undertaken by the NIH. According to the Bio-medical Research and Development Price Index, which calculates how much the NIH budget must change each year to maintain purchasing power, between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2014, the cost of NIH activities increased by 38.1 percent. By comparison, the overall NIH budget increased by 10.8 percent, over fiscal year 636 2003. So in real terms, the NIH has already sustained budget decreases of close to 30 percent over the past decade due to inflation alone! As such, flat funding or cuts to the NIH will have the clear and devastating effects of undermining our Nation's leadership in health research and our scientists' ability to take advantage of the ex-panding opportunities to advance healthcare. The race to find better treatments and a cure for cancer, heart disease, AIDS, and other diseases, and for controlling global epidemics like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, all depend on a robust long-term investment strategy for health research at NIH. In conclusion, the RWG calls on Congress to continue the bipartisan Federal com- mitment towards combating HIV as well as other chronic and life-threatening ill-nesses by increasing funding for the NIH to $36 billion in fiscal year 2015. A mean-ingful commitment to stemming the epidemic and securing the well being of people with HIV cannot be met without prioritizing the research investment at the NIH that will lead to tomorrow's lifesaving vaccines, treatments, and cures. Thank you for the opportunity to provide these written comments. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE ROTARY INTERNATIONAL Chairman Harkin, members of the Subcommittee, Rotary International appre- ciates this opportunity to submit testimony in support of the polio eradication activi-ties of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is an unprecedented model of cooperation among na-tional governments, civil society and UN agencies working together to reach the most vulnerable children through the safe, cost-effective public health intervention of polio immunization. We appeal to this Subcommittee for continued leadership to ensure we seize the opportunity to conquer polio once and for all. Rotary Inter-national strongly supports the President's 2015 request of $161 million for the polio eradication activities of the CDC to enable full implementation of the polio eradi-cation strategies and innovations outlined in the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan (2013-2018). PROGRESS IN THE GLOBAL PROGRAM TO ERADICATE POLIO Significant strides were made in 2013 toward stopping transmission of polio. Thanks to this committee's leadership in appropriating funds for the polio eradi-cation activities of the CDC: \u2014India was certified polio free in February 2014, following 3 years with no cases of polio. The entire Southeast Asia region was certified polio free on 27 March 2014. \u2014Eradication efforts have led to more than a 99 percent decrease in cases since the launch of the GPEI in 1988. \u2014The number of polio cases in the endemic countries was 40 percent lower in 2013 than in 2012 (160 vs. 217). Afghanistan and Nigeria each had less than half the number of cases in 2013 that they had in 2012. \u2014Pakistan is now considered to be the only country in the world with uncon- trolled transmission of wild polio and as of 20 March, accounts for more than 75 percent of polio cases in 2014. \u2014Outbreaks in the Horn of Africa and Syria accounted for roughly 60 percent of all cases in 2013. These outbreaks underscore the risk to polio-free countries until the wild poliovirus has been eradicated in the remaining places where it persists. \u2014Incidence of type 3 polio is at historically low levels. There have been no cases of type 3 polio since November 2012. \u2014Lack of access to children in insecure areas continues to hamper progress. In Pakistan alone, more than 50 health workers and security personnel assigned to protect them have been killed in targeted attacks since November of 2012. Insecurity/inability to access large populations is now a key factor in all en-demic transmission zones and is also a factor in outbreak areas (Syria, Horn of Africa). The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan (2013-2018) launched in 2013 lays out the strategies for the certification of the eradication of wild poliovirus by 2018 at a total global cost of US$5.5 billion. This new plans builds on the lessons learned from the successful eradication of polio to date and the substantial advances in technology in 2012. The timely availability of funds remains essential to the achievement of a polio free world. The United States has been the leading public sector donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Members of U.S. Rotary clubs appreciate the United States' generous support and recognize increased funding pro-vided by Congress in fiscal year 2014 to ensure the GPEI can fully implement the 637 plan. Rotarians are committed to continuing their own fundraising for the program until the world is certified polio free. Rotarians will also continue to advocate sup-port from the public and other governments, both polio free and polio affected, to support the successful execution of the Strategic Plan. The ongoing support of donor countries, like the United States, is essential to assure the necessary human and financial resources are made available to polio-endemic and at risk countries to cer-tify the world polio free by the end of 2018. THE ROLE OF ROTARY INTERNATIONAL Rotary International, a global association of more than 34,000 Rotary clubs in more than 170 countries with a membership of over 1.2 million business and profes-sional leaders (more than 345,000 of which are in the U.S.), has been committed to battling polio since 1985. Rotary International has contributed more than US$1.2 billion toward a polio free world\u2014representing the largest contribution by an inter-national service organization to a public health initiative ever. Rotary also leads the United States Coalition for the Eradication of Polio, a group of committed child health advocates that includes the March of Dimes Foundation, the American Acad-emy of Pediatrics, the Task Force for Global Health, the United Nations Foundation, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. These organizations join us in thanking you for your support of the GPEI. THE ROLE OF THE U .S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION Rotary commends CDC for its leadership in the global polio eradication effort, and greatly appreciates the Subcommittee's increased support of CDC's polio eradication activities to support full implementation of the Strategic Plan. The United States is the leader among donor nations in the drive to eradicate this crippling disease. CDC is using the increased Congressional support provided in fiscal year 2014 to: \u2014Build capacity in Nigeria. Increased investment in Nigeria will serve to estab- lish and broaden environmental surveillance; strengthen traditional AFP sur-veillance, scale up the National Stop Transmission of Polio Program (N-STOP) in Kano and other high risk polio States to ensure broad coverage at the Local Government Authority Level, trapping poliovirus in its remaining reservoirs in Northern Nigeria. \u2014Build capacity in Pakistan. Increased investment in Pakistan will focus on training and placing local personnel to strengthen the program in areas where access is possible. \u2014Provide essential technical assistance in Afghanistan. The investment in Af- ghanistan will support two staff members in country. \u2014Laboratory Surveillance: Investment with CDC's Polio Global Reference Lab will allow the recruitment of additional staff, training for country and regional labs, essential IPV research, and expansion of environmental surveillance capa-bilities in the field. CDC provides technical and programmatic assistance to the global polio laboratory network through the Polio Laboratory in CDC's Division of Viral Diseases. CDC's labs provide critical diagnostic services and genomic sequencing of polioviruses to help guide disease control efforts. CDC will con-tinue to serve as the global reference laboratory, while expanding environ-mental surveillance in countries to serve as a ''safety measure'' to detect any polioviruses circulating in areas without cases. \u2014Vaccine Purchase: CDC funds are being used to purchase oral polio vaccine to immunize children against polio. \u2014Vaccine Operations & Social Mobilization. CDC, through its cooperative agree- ment with WHO, provides funding for immunization activities in high risk and polio infected countries. CDC funding is essential to supporting the supple-mental immunization activities that both stop existing outbreaks and prevent new outbreaks. CDC collaborates closely with UNICEF and provides critical support on analysis and use of campaign results to identify and address reasons why children are missed and address vaccine hesitancy concerns. \u2014Immunization Systems Strengthening. Investment in this area will allow CDC to provide scientific assistance across a range of topics related to the introduc-tion of IPV to focus countries, other GAVI-eligible countries, and to non-eligible countries. Continued funding will allow CDC to fully capitalize on the resources of the Emergency Operation Center to provide direct support and build capacity to con- tinue intense supplementary immunization activities in the remaining polio-affected countries, continue leadership on data management to drive evidence-based deci-sionmaking, and continue to implement strategies to increase effective management 638 and accountability. These funds will also help maintain essential certification stand- ard surveillance. BENEFITS OF POLIO ERADICATION Since 1988, over 10 million people who would otherwise have been paralyzed are walking because they have been immunized against polio. Tens of thousands of pub-lic health workers have been trained to manage massive immunization programs and investigate cases of acute flaccid paralysis. Cold chain, transport and commu-nications systems for immunization have been strengthened. The global network of 145 laboratories and trained personnel established by the GPEI also tracks measles, rubella, yellow fever, meningitis, and other deadly infectious diseases and will do so long after polio is eradicated. A study published in the November 2010 issue of the journal Vaccine estimates that the GPEI could provide net benefits of at least $40-50 billion. Polio eradication is a cost-effective public health investment with permanent benefits. On the other hand, as many as 200,000 children could be paralyzed annually in the next 10 years if the world fails to capitalize on the more than $10 billion already invested in eradi-cation. Success will ensure that the significant investment made by the U.S., Rotary International, and many other countries and entities, is protected in perpetuity. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE RYAN WHITE MEDICAL PROVIDERS COALITION My name is Dr. James Raper, and I serve as the Director of the 1917 HIV/AIDS Outpatient Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I am writing to sub-mit testimony on behalf of the Ryan White Medical Providers Coalition (RWMPC), which I co-chaired from 2010-2013. I remain a member of the RWMPC Steering Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to describe the lifesaving HIV/AIDS care and treatment provided by Ryan White Part C funded programs, including those provided at my own clinic. RWMPC is a national coalition of medical providers and administrators who work in clinics supported by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funded by the HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) at the Health Services and Resources Administration (HRSA). I thank the Subcommittee for its support of Ryan White Part C Programs in fiscal year 2014. And while I am grateful for this support, and understand that times are tough, I request $225.1 million, or a $24 million increase for Ryan White Part C programs in fiscal year 2015. While I know that this is a lot of funding, it is in fact well below the estimated need, and Ryan White providers would spend those dollars identifying, engaging and treating persons living with HIV/AIDS\u2014an infectious dis-ease that can be effectively prevented and treated in a way that saves both lives and money. The 1917 Clinic is a dedicated, not-for profit outpatient HIV/AIDS medical and dental clinic established in 1988 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Ryan White Part C funding provides critical assistance in helping the clinic meet the needs of our patients. Today, 35 percent of the 1917 Clinic's patients are uninsured and would be at risk for losing access to lifesaving services without Ryan White Pro-gram funding. The 1917 Clinic provides comprehensive outpatient HIV primary care services to residents of Jefferson, Walker, Winston, Cullman, Blount, St. Clair, and Shelby counties. Although our service area technically includes only these seven counties, we serve people with HIV/AIDS throughout Alabama and its neighboring States. In February 2013, the 1917 Clinic absorbed 800 new patients from the previously Ryan White Part C funded Cooper Green Hospital's St. Georges' Clinic, which closed on January 31, 2013. The 1917 Clinic is now providing care to 2,950 adult pa-tients\u2014this represents approximately 24 percent of the 12,404 known adults living with HIV/AIDS in Alabama. The clinic offers a range of primary care and social services critical to successful HIV treatment, including primary medical and oral healthcare; on-site case man-agement; mental health and substance abuse treatment services; onsite access to clinical trials; medication adherence; spiritual, risk reduction, and nutrition coun-seling; infusion therapy; coordination of hospital discharge planning; and home healthcare/hospice referral. To avoid emergency room visits, the 1917 Clinic pro-vides 'sick call' services five days a week. Subspecialty care is available at the Uni-versity's Kirklin Clinic\u2014which is located just two blocks from the 1917 Clinic. In addition to critical funding that Ryan White Part C provides through direct Federal grants for comprehensive medical care clinics like the 1917 Clinic, most Part C clinics, including the 1917 Clinic, also receive support from other Parts of the Ryan White Program that help support access to medication; additional medical 639 11 See Improvement in the Health of HIV-Infected Persons in Care: Reducing Disparities at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/08/24/cid.cis654.full.pdf+html. 2See CDC's HIV in the United States: The Stages of Care http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/news- room/docs/2012/Stages-of-CareFactSheet-508.pdf. care, such as dental services; and key support services, such as case management and transportation, which are essential components of the highly effective Ryan White HIV care model that result in excellent outcomes for our patients. Ryan White Part C Programs Support Comprehensive, Expert and Effective HIV Care Part C of the Ryan White Program funds comprehensive, expert and effective HIV care and treatment\u2014services that are directly responsible for the dramatic decrease in AIDS-related mortality and morbidity over the last decade. The Ryan White Pro-gram has supported the development of expert HIV care and treatment programs that have become patient-centered medical homes for individuals living with this serious, chronic condition. In 2011, a ground-breaking clinical trial\u2014named the sci-entific breakthrough of the year by Science magazine\u2014found that HIV treatment not only saves the lives of people with HIV, but also reduces HIV transmission by more than 96 percent\u2014proving that HIV treatment is also HIV prevention. The comprehensive, expert HIV care model that is supported by the Ryan White Program has been highly successful at achieving positive clinical outcomes with a complex patient population. 1In a convenience sample of eight Ryan White-funded Part C programs ranging from the rural South to the Bronx, retention in care rates ranged from 87 to 97 percent. In estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 37 percent of all people with HIV are in regular care nationally. 2Once in care, patients served at Ryan White-funded clinics do well\u2014 with 75 to 90 percent having undetectable levels of the virus in their blood. This is much higher than the estimate from the CDC that just 25 percent of all people living with HIV in the U.S. are virally suppressed. Investing in Ryan White Part C Programs Saves Both Lives and Money Early and reliable access to HIV care and treatment both helps patients with HIV live relatively healthy and productive lives and is more cost effective. One study from the 1917 Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that pa-tients treated at the later stages of HIV disease required 2.6 times more healthcare dollars than those receiving earlier treatment meeting Federal HIV treatment guidelines. On average it costs $3,501 per person per year to provide the comprehen-sive outpatient care and treatment available at Part C funded programs. The com-prehensive services provided often include lab work, STD/TB/Hepatitis screening, ob/gyn care, dental care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and case management. Current Challenges\u2014Future Promise However, this effective and comprehensive HIV care model is not completely sup- ported by Medicaid or most private insurance. While many Ryan White Program cli-ents have some form of insurance coverage, without the Ryan White Program, they would risk falling out of care. Barriers include poor reimbursement rates; benefits designed for healthier populations that fail to cover critical services, such as care coordination; and inadequate coverage for other important services, such as ex-tended medical visits, mental health and substance use treatment. Full implementa-tion of the Affordable Care Act plus continuation of the Ryan White Program will dramatically improve health access and outcomes for many more people living with HIV disease. Fully Funding and Maintaining Ryan White Part C Programs Is Essential Because of both the inadequacy of insurance coverage for people with complex conditions like HIV and the fact that some individuals will remain uncovered, even with Affordable Care Act implementation (particularly in the non-Medicaid expan-sion States), fully funding and maintaining the Ryan White Program is essential to providing comprehensive, expert and effective HIV care nationwide. And while RMWPC is concerned about the proposal to consolidate Ryan White Part D funding into Part C, it welcomes the $4 million increase for Part C programs proposed in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget. RWMPC's specific concerns in-clude: \u2014Part D funding supports effective HIV care and treatment services for vulner- able populations, including women and adolescents. With adolescents account-ing for 39 percent of new HIV infections in the U.S., it is critical to target re-640 1National Research Council. Injury in America: A Continuing Public Health Problem.

It is critical to ensure that implementation of any budget proposal does not leave any community without adequate access to effective and comprehensive HIV care and treatment. Also, for Ryan White medical clinics that currently receive only Part D funding, it could prove difficult to success-fully compete for Part C funding if there currently exists a Part C program serving that community. Loss of the aforementioned Part D program would re-duce the community's access to HIV care and treatment. \u2014It is unclear how the proposed consolidation would be implemented. At this time it is unclear what the consolidation process would entail and how it would practically impact grantees and access to HIV care and treatment in commu-nities. Since most Ryan White medical clinics receive funding from multiple parts of the Ryan White Program, reduction of funding to one part can have damaging and unintended consequences to the overall services provided by Ryan White medical clinics, especially now, at a time when providers are work-ing to expand access to HIV care and treatment. At this critical time in the HIV/AIDS epidemic, when research has confirmed that early access to HIV care and treatment not only saves lives but prevents new infec-tions by reducing the risk of transmission to near zero for patients who are virally suppressed, it is essential to maintain overall funding levels for the Ryan White Program. While the ACA provides important new healthcare coverage options for many patients, most health insurers fail to support the comprehensive care and treatment necessary for many patients to manage HIV infection. Exorbitant cost sharing, benefit gaps and limited State uptake of the Medicaid expansion neces-sitate a vital and ongoing role for the Ryan White Program. Increasing access to and successful engagement in effective, comprehensive HIV care and treatment is the only way to lead the Nation to an AIDS-free generation and reduce the dev-astating costs of\u2014including lives lost to\u2014HIV infection. Conclusion Thank you very much for your consideration of RWMPC's fiscal year 2015 request of $225.1 million for Ryan White Part C programs, a $24 million increase over fiscal year 2014.

Safe States Alliance requests that the CDC's National Center for Injury Pre-vention and Control (Injury Center) receive $205.5M in fiscal year 15\u2014an additional $29.7M for the Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program (VIPP), including re-sources to meaningfully address the epidemic of prescription drug misuse, abuse and overdose; and an additional $13.7M for the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). Safe States Alliances also supports continued funding of the CDC's Preventive Health and Health Services (PHHS) Block Grant at $180 million. BACKGROUND In 1985, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) first called attention to the lack of rec- ognition and funding for injury and violence prevention (IVP) as a public health issue in the United States. 1Although some progress has been made in subsequent years, injuries and violence continue to have a significant impact on the health of Americans and the healthcare system, as more people ages 1-44 die from injuries than from any other cause, including cancer, HIV, or the flu. 2 Injuries and violence are serious public health problems. Areas include: 641 3Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Con- trol.

Every 45 minutes, one of those preventable deaths is a child. 2In a single year, injuries and violence will ultimately cost $406 billion in medical costs and lost productivity.3Yet to date, there is no national program to support State public health IVP programs. At the Federal level, the CDC Injury Center serves as the focal point for the pub- lic health approach to IVP. The CDC Injury Center only receives approximately 2 percent of the CDC/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry budget to ad-dress the significant burden of injuries and violence nationwide. In fiscal year 2013, the total Injury Center budget was only $138.9 million. CORE VIOLENCE AND INJURY PREVENTION PROGRAM (VIPP) AND NEW PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERDOSE PREVENTION EXPANDED COMPONENT Given its limited budget, the CDC Injury Center currently provides small capacity building grants of approximately $250,000 to only 20 State health departments (SHDs) through the Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program (VIPP). The Core VIPP is comprised of multiple components including: Basic Prevention (20 States); Regional Network Leaders (5 States); Surveillance Quality Improvement (4 States); Older Adult Falls Prevention (3 States); and Motor Vehicle/Child Injury Prevention (4 States). The President's 2015 Budget Request includes an increase of approxi-mately $15.6M to expand the number of funded Core VIPP programs ($5.6M) and to allow for the development of a new expanded component for States to address the epidemic of prescription drug misuse, abuse and overdose ($10 million). Opioid pain relievers are now involved in more overdose deaths than cocaine and heroin combined. The abuse of prescription opioid pain relievers costs up to $72 bil-lion annually. The CDC Injury Center provides leadership in enhancing drug over-dose surveillance, identifying and evaluating effective program and policy interven-tions for preventing overdoses, improving clinical practice to reduce prescription drug diversion and abuse, and equipping and empowering States with the informa-tion and resources they need to reverse the epidemic. Core VIPP States would be funded to advance promising surveillance and prevention strategies and would com-plement other Federal agencies, such as SAMHSA's work on screening, treatment and community prevention activities. State health departments are well positioned to coordinate the necessary multi-sector responses to reverse the epidemic through the regulation of healthcare professionals, prescription drug monitoring programs, and other major levers for preventing prescription drug abuse. Ohio's Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program (VIPP) provides statewide leadership and funding for community-based efforts to address prescription drug abuse and overdose through the PHHS Block Grant from CDC. The OH VIPP co-ordinates the development and implementation of statewide prevention strategies, conducts surveillance, supports the Governor's Cabinet Opiate Action Team Pre-scriber Education Work Group including the development of opioid prescribing guidelines, and provides support and technical assistance to expand naloxone dis-tribution programs. Examples of locally PHHS Block Grant funded strategies in-clude: expanding access to naloxone distribution programs; facilitating healthcare system changes such as implementation of opioid prescribing guidelines and other pain management strategies; obtaining commitment of prescribers to use the Ohio prescription drug monitoring program; and expanding access to sustainable drug disposal options. With overall program funding of $29.7M, the CDC Injury Center could support injury and violence prevention programs in ALL States and territories, much as it does for other key public health issues including chronic and infectious diseases, as 642 4State of the States: 2011 Report. Atlanta, GA: Safe States Alliance; 2013. well as make significant strides in reversing the prescription drug overdose epi- demic. NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (NVDRS) NVDRS is a state-based surveillance system that uses information from a variety of States and local agencies and sources\u2014medical examiners, coroners, police, crime labs and death certificates\u2014to form a more complete picture of the circumstances that surround violent deaths. State and local violence prevention practitioners use these data to guide their prevention programs, policies and practices including: iden-tifying common circumstances associated with violent deaths of a specific type (e.g. gang violence) or a specific area (e.g. a cluster of suicides); assisting groups in select-ing and targeting violence prevention efforts; supporting evaluations of violence pre-vention activities; and improving the public's access to in-depth information on vio-lent deaths. CDC Injury Center currently funds 18 States to implement NVDRS and received an approximately $7.9M increase in fiscal year 2014 to expand number of participating States up to 30-35 States. The Oregon Older Adult Suicide Prevention Advisory Work Group and the Oregon Department of Human Services used NVDRS data to inform efforts to develop and focus suicide prevention programs for older adults. Almost 50 percent of men ages 65 and older who died by suicide were reported to have a depressed mood before death, but only a small proportion were receiving treatment, suggesting screening and treatment for depression might have saved lives. As a result, Oregon developed primary care recommendations in 2006 to better integrate with mental health serv-ices so that suicidal behavior and ideation are diagnosed and older adults received appropriate treatment. These recommendations were implemented as part of Or-egon's ''Healthy Aging'' efforts. The recommendations include the objectives of in-creasing the confidence and competence of primary care providers and other clini-cians to identify, assess and treat older adult suicide behavior and depression. The suicide rates among males ages 65 and older in Oregon decreased approximately 8 percent from 2007 to 2010. Safe States Alliance supports the investment of an additional $13.7 million to ex- pand NVDRS to all States and territories. PREVENTIVE HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES (PHHS) BLOCK GRANT For more than 30 years, the PHHS Block Grant has remained an essential source of Federal agencies to support State solutions to State health problems. The PHHS Block Grant allows each State to respond to its own distinct health priorities and need. In fiscal year 2011, more than 20 percent of the Prevent Block Grant was used by States to support IVP and emergency medical services. According to a 2011 sur-vey conducted by Safe States Alliance, 29 States reported receiving an average of $329,000 from the Prevent Block Grant for IVP efforts. 4The Prevent Block Grant is a critical source of funding for SHD IVP programs representing 9.4 percent of total State funding in 2011. Safe States Alliance supports continued funding of the PHHS Block Grant at the $180 million level. Preventable injuries exact a heavy burden on Americans through premature deaths and disabilities, pain and suffering, medical and rehabilitation costs, disrup-tion of quality of life for families, and disruption of productivity for employers. Strengthening investments in public health IVP programs is a critical step to keep Americans safe and productive for the 21st century. Safe States Alliance would like to thank the Committee for consideration of this testimony. [This statement was submitted by Amber Williams, Executive Director, Safe States Alliance.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SCLERODERMA FOUNDATION Chairman Harkin and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for your time and your consideration of the scleroderma community's priorities while working to craft the fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health and Human Services Appropria-tions Bill. ABOUT SCLERODERMA Scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis, is a chronic connective tissue disease generally classified as one of the autoimmune rheumatic diseases. 643 The word ''scleroderma'' comes from two Greek words: ''sclero'' meaning hard, and ''derma'' meaning skin. Hardening of the skin is one of the most visible manifesta-tions of the disease. The disease has been called ''progressive systemic sclerosis,'' but the use of that term has been discouraged since it has been found that scleroderma is not necessarily progressive. The disease varies from patient-to-patient. It is estimated that about 300,000 Americans have scleroderma. About one third of those people have the systemic form of scleroderma. Since scleroderma presents with symptoms similar to other autoimmune diseases, diagnosis is difficult. There may be many misdiagnosed or undiagnosed cases. Localized scleroderma is more common in children, whereas systemic scleroderma is more common in adults. Overall, female patients outnumber male patients at a ratio of 4-to-1. Factors other than gender, such as race and ethnic background, may influence the risk of getting scleroderma, the age of onset, and the pattern or sever-ity of internal organ involvement. The reasons for this are still unknown. Although scleroderma is not directly inherited, some scientists feel there is a slight predisposi-tion to it in families with a history of rheumatic or autoimmune diseases. While, scleroderma can develop in every age group from infants to the elderly, its onset is most frequent between the ages of 25 to 55. Currently, there is no cure for scleroderma. Treatments are based on a patient's particular symptoms. For instance, heartburn can be controlled by medications called proton pump inhibitors or medicine to improve the motion of the bowel. Some treatments are directed at decreasing the activity of the immune system. Due to the fact that there is so much variation from one person to another, there is great vari-ation in the treatments prescribed. Any chronic disease can be serious. The symptoms of scleroderma vary greatly for each person, and the effects of scleroderma can range from mild to life threatening. The seriousness will depend on which organ systems of the body are affected, and the extent to which they are affected. A mild case can become more serious if not properly treated. Prompt and proper diagnosis and treatment by qualified physi-cians may minimize the symptoms of scleroderma and lessen the chance for irre-versible damage. ABOUT THE FOUNDATION The non-profit Scleroderma Foundation is the national organization for people with scleroderma and their families and friends. It was formed January 1, 1998, by a merger between the West Coast-based United Scleroderma Foundation and the East Coast-based Scleroderma Federation. The national office is headquartered in Danvers, Massachusetts. The Foundation has a three-fold mission of support, edu-cation, and research. Support The Scleroderma Foundation offers the following tools and resources in support of people living with scleroderma and their families: \u2014A nationwide network of 24 chapters and more than 150 support groups \u2014A toll-free helpline providing information and referrals to callers \u2014Educational materials, including a quarterly magazine called ''Scleroderma Voice \u2014Offer a variety of brochures, booklets and newsletters, along with our inform- ative website Additionally, the Foundation hosts an annual National Patient Education Con- ference. The conference offers various educational and networking opportunities for people living with scleroderma, their caregivers, family members and friends. Work-shops, panel discussions and other educational sessions are led by the leading scleroderma researchers and healthcare professionals. Education As part of our education mission, we not only perform all the functions mentioned above, we also work with our Medical Advisory Board of internationally known scleroderma experts to provide patient education programs as well as education for physician/healthcare professionals. Research The Scleroderma Foundation budgets at least $1 million a year for research fund- ing, its single largest budgeted expense. The Scleroderma Foundation takes its fidu-ciary responsibility to donors very seriously, especially with regard to our research grant program. In the case of research funds, the Foundation's Peer Research Review Committee, composed of medical experts on scleroderma from around the world, helps determine 644 which proposals will be funded by reading, analyzing and ranking all proposals re- ceived. It follows a peer review system based on that of the National Institutes of Health. ONE FAMILY 'S STORY Cheyenne Cogswell is an 8-year old third-grader living in the poverty-stricken town of Falmouth, Kentucky. Cheyenne was diagnosed at age six with a severe case of systemic scleroderma. The disease has caused kidney failure and significant dam-age to her digestive system, making it difficult for the body to receive the proper nutrition needed for a growing child. She has undergone several life-saving oper-ations and numerous hospitalizations. Her skin and other internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, are also affected. Cheyenne's treatment first consisted of hos-pitalization and intense chemotherapy. She continues with daily chemotherapy in-jections, now given by her mother, to help suppress her immune system and slow the progression of the disease. Cheyenne is being raised by a single mother who has faced extreme consequences from the financial burden created by scleroderma, los-ing her job in the economic downturn, as well as the family's home. Doctors doubted if Cheyenne would survive beyond her seventh birthday, but she continues to beat the odds. Chronic diseases like scleroderma are unpredictable in their course, and the family\u2014together with their close circle of friends\u2014continues to fight and hope for the best. Their road is uncertain and illustrates why funding for NIH and its research programs are vital to so many people whose lives are impacted by chronic illness such as scleroderma. SEQUESTRATION We have heard from the medical research community that sequestration and def- icit reduction activities have created serious issues for Federal funding opportunities and the career development pipeline. In order to ensure that the scleroderma re-search portfolio can continue to grow, and, more importantly, to ensure that our country is adequately preparing the next generation of young investigators, we urge you to avert, mitigate, or otherwise eliminate the specter of sequestration. While the Foundation has anecdotal accounts of the harms of sequestration, the Federated American Societies for Experimental Biology has reported: \u2014In constant dollars (adjusted for inflation), the NIH budget in fiscal year 2013 was $6 billion (22.4 percent) less than it was in fiscal year 2003. \u2014The number of competing research project grants (RPGs) awarded by NIH has also fallen sharply since fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2013, NIH made 8,283 RPG awards, which is 2,110 (20.3 percent) fewer than in fiscal year 2003. \u2014Awards for R01-equivalent grants, the primary mechanism for supporting inves- tigator-initiated research, suffered even greater losses. The number awarded fell by 2,528 (34 percent) between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2013. The pay line for some NIH funding mechanisms has fallen from 18 percent to 10 percent while the average age for a researcher to receive their first NIH-funded grant has climbed to 42. These are strong disincentives to choosing a career as a medical researcher. Our scaling-back is occurring at a time when many foreign countries are investing heavily in their biotechnology sectors. China alone plans to dedicate $300 million to medical research over the next 5 years; this amount is dou-ble the current NIH budget over the same period of time. Scientific breakthroughs will continue, but America may not benefit from the return-on-investment of a ro-bust biotechnology sector. For the purposes of economic and national security, as well as public health, the Foundation asks that you work with your colleagues to eliminate sequestration and recommit to supporting this Nation's biomedical re-search enterprise. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION Early recognition and an accurate diagnosis of scleroderma can improve health outcomes and save lives. CDC in general and the NCCDPHP specifically have pro-grams to improve public awareness of scleroderma and other rare, life-threatening conditions. Unfortunately, budgetary challenges at CDC have pushed the agency to focus resources on combating a narrow set of ''winnable battles.'' Please increase funding for CDC and NCCDPHP so that the agency can invest in additional, critical education and awareness activities that have the potential to improve health and save lives. 645 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH NIH has worked with the Foundation to lead the effort to enhance our scientific understanding of the mechanisms of scleroderma with the shared-goal of improving diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately finding a cure. Since scleroderma impacts multiple organ systems, NIAMS, NHLBI, and NIDDK all play crucial roles in basic, translational, and clinical research efforts. Further, emerging NIH initiatives like the Cures Acceleration Network and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership are creating meaningful opportunities to advance scleroderma research. Please provide NIH with a significant funding increase to the scleroderma research portfolio can continue to expand and facilitate key breakthroughs. \u2014NHLBI, is leading Scleroderma Lung Study II, is comparing the effectiveness of two drugs in treating pulmonary fibrosis in scleroderma. \u2014NIAMS, is leading efforts to discover whether three gene expression signatures in skin can serve as accurate biomarkers predicting scleroderma, and investiga-tions into progression and response to treatment to clarify the complex inter-actions of T cells and interleukin-31 (IL-31) in producing inflammation and fi-brosis, or scarring in scleroderma. ADDITIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES In recent years, scleroderma has been listed as a condition eligible for study through the Department of Defense (DOD) Peer-Reviewed Medical Research Pro-gram (PRMRP). Since fiscal year 2005, the opportunity for scleroderma researchers to compete for funding through this mechanism led to over $10 million in scleroderma research funding as well as the initiation of meaningful research projects. Research on the underlying mechanisms of scleroderma is showing rel-evance to all fibrosis, which occurs at higher rates among individuals who served in the military and our veterans. Further, military service-associated environmental triggers, particularly silica, solvent, and radiation exposure, are believed to be po-tential triggers for scleroderma in individuals that are genetically predisposed to it. Despite the connection between military service and scleroderma, the condition was left off the PRMRP's eligible conditions list in fiscal year 2014. While we appre-ciate that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and the Senate play important roles in crafting the annual eligible conditions list, the scleroderma community urges you to weigh in with your colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to ac-tively work to see that scleroderma is re-listed as a condition eligible for study through the PRMRP within the Committee Report accompanying the fiscal year 2015 Defense Appropriations Bill. Thank you again for your time and your consideration of the scleroderma commu- nity's requests. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SENIOR SERVICE AMERICA , INC. This statement concerns the Administration's proposed fiscal year 2015 appropria- tions of $380 million for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014Adminis-tration for Community Living's Senior Community Service Employment Program. We urge that funding for this program be increased to $600 million, returning the program to its funding levels prior to the Great Recession (adjusted for inflation). This investment would provide jobs and training for more than 30,000 additional unemployed older Americans than the Administration's proposal. We also urge that the Congress refer to the authorizing committee any proposals to revise the mission of the program or transfer the program from the Department of Labor. The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is the only Federal program targeted to provide jobs and training to low-income older adults 55 and older. According to GAO Report GAO-11-92, SCSEP is one of only three Federal workforce development programs that do not overlap with any other program. Launched in 1968, SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act and is currently administered by the Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration. In the year ending June 30, 2013, SCSEP provided jobs and train-ing for 67,551 economically disadvantaged older adults, who in turn provided over 37.2 million hours of staffing to 30,000 local private and private nonprofit agencies serving the community. The value of these community service hours was $825 mil-lion, based on hourly-wage estimates from the Independent Sector. The Administration's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes to cut funding for SCSEP to $380 million, $52 million less than $432 million in total grants awarded by the USDOL for fiscal year 2014. Senior Service America estimates that this cut would 646 result in 8,600 fewer jobs and training nationwide for low income older adults and 4.4 million fewer staff hours in local agencies (whose value exceeds $97 million). The following facts strongly support increasing the appropriations for SCSEP in fiscal year 2015: Low-income older workers, most of whom are long-term unemployed, continue to suffer extremely high rates of joblessness .\u2014As the following table shows, since 2000 the jobless rate of low-income older workers (55 years and older with annual family incomes less than $20k) has been 2.5 to 3 times higher than the rate among all older workers: Year Unemployment rate for low income older workers (%) Unemployment rate of All 55+ (%) 2000 ........................................................................................................................... ............. 6.6 2.6 2001 ........................................................................................................................... ............. 3.0 tabulations fromCurrent Population Survey, by the Center for Labor Market St ud- ies,Northeastern University, for Senior Service America, Inc., January2014. SCSEP is a unique employment and training program of the Federal Govern- ment .\u2014Cited in the previously mentioned 2011 GAO report as one of only three Federal workforce programs ''that do not overlap with other programs.'' It also as-sists a harder-to-serve segment of the older adult workforce: 88 percent of partici-pants were at or below the poverty level; 60 percent were at least 60 years old; near-ly two-thirds were women; and over half of the participants were from a racial/eth-nic minority (PY2012). SCSEP grantees succeed in carrying out the Congressional intent for the pro- gram .\u2014According to an independent national evaluation conducted by Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) and Social Policy Research Associates (SPR) in 2012 for the U.S. Department of Labor, ''SCSEP projects are largely successful in recruiting and enrolling older workers with serious barriers to employment, providing participants with community service assignments at host agencies, and [annually] placing nearly half of program exiters who are available for work into unsubsidized jobs.'' Programs under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) continue to underserve older workers .\u2014Several GAO reports have cited that WIA performance measures may cre- ate disincentives for serving older workers seeking part-time work. As a result, a disproportionately small percentage of those served by American Job Centers are older workers. The 2012 MPR/SPR evaluation of SCSEP stated that ''SCSEP projects find it difficult to draw on the resources of American Job Centers to support participants in finding jobs.'' The value of work performed by SCSEP participants in their community service assignments is nearly double the total amount appropriated for SCSEP .\u2014In PY2012, SCSEP participants worked over 37 million hours at minimum wage in over 30,000 host agencies (nonprofit, faith-based, and public), including more than 10 million hours serving other older persons through Meals on Wheels, area agencies on aging, and other organizations. Using the Independent Sector's estimated hourly value of volunteer work, the estimated value of this community service was nearly $825 mil-lion. The fiscal year 2015 budget proposes to cut SCSEP funding to 66 percent of the 2008 level (in constant 2000 dollars), yet low-income older workers continue to suffer from extraordinarily high rates of unemployment .\u2014The following graph shows the unemployment rate among low-income older workers since 2000 (described in the previous table on page 2) in contrast to the history of SCSEP funding, in both cur-647 rent dollars and constant 2000 dollars. In 2008, the average annual unemployment rate for low-income older adults 55 and over was 11.8 percent and SCSEP funding was $521.6 million (unadjusted) or $417.2 million (in constant 2000 dollars). In unadjusted dollars, the proposed fiscal year 2015 budget for SCSEP of $380 million represents 73 percent of the 2008 funding for SCSEP, but the fiscal year 2015 budg-et would cut SCSEP to only 66 percent of the 2008 funding in constant dollars\u2014 yet the average annual unemployment rate for the SCSEP-eligible population is about 17 percent in 2013 compared to less than 12 percent in 2008. 648 The following table shows the history of SCSEP funding since 2000: Fiscal Year Final appropriations in current dollars (millions) Real value of annual appropriations in constant dollars (base year: 2000) 380.0 274.6 (est) Note: Estimation Procedure for 2015 Constant Dollar Value (base year = 2000): Estimated Cumulative Inflation Index (CII) for 2015 is based on projected annual inflation rate of 1.5 percent. OMB proposed SC SEP appro- priation for fiscal year 2015 = $380m. fiscal year 2015 $380m = $278.7m in 2014 constant dollars. The CII through 2014 = $380/$ 278.7 = 1.3635. Estimated CII for 2015 (based on 1.5 percent inflation rate) = 1.3635 + (1.3635 x 0.015) = 1.3840. fiscal year 2015 pro posed $380m appropriation = $380m/1.3840 = $274.57m in constant dollars (base year 2000). The proposed fiscal year 2015 would have a damaging impact on local commu- nities .\u2014As the following table shows, cuts in SCSEP funding would harm small and large States: 649 Total fiscal year 2014 funding awarded by USDOL ($) Estimated funding in fiscal year 2015 ($) Cut in funding in fiscal year 2015 ($) Cut in number of SCSEP participants Cut in total hours of community service Value of lost hours of community service ($) All States and Territories .................................................................................. 432,285,000 380,000 economy continues to leave millions of low-income older Ameri- cans behind. These older workers help expand the capacity of local agencies to meet the basic needs of their communities. In an independent national survey of 10,000 of these agencies, 75 percent reported that SCSEP significantly or somewhat in-creased their ability to provide services. SCSEP is a unique program that achieves a wide range of outcomes and produces multiple returns on investment. Throughout the Nation, older Americans and communities need and depend on the Senior Com-munity Service Employment Program. [This statement was submitted by Anthony R. Sarmiento, Executive Director, Senior Service America, Inc.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SLEEP RESEARCH SOCIETY Chairman Tom Harkin, Ranking Member Jerry Moran, and distinguished mem- bers of the Subcommittee, as you begin to craft the fiscal year 2015 Labor-HHS- Education appropriations bill, the Sleep Research Society (SRS) is pleased to submit this statement for the record asking you to provide $32 billion for NIH, including a proportional increase for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), $1 million in funding for sleep disorders awareness and surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), full support for the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR), and implementation of the 2011 NIH Sleep Dis-orders Research Plan. These actions will ensure increased awareness of the impor-tance of sleep and circadian rhythms and further the advancements being made by sleep researchers to better understand the relationship between sleep and health. SLEEP RESEARCH SOCIETY SRS was established in 1961 by a group of scientists who shared a common goal to foster scientific investigations on all aspects of sleep and sleep disorders. Since that time, SRS has grown into a professional society comprising over 1,100 research-ers nationwide. From promising trainees to accomplished senior level investigators, sleep research has expanded into areas such as psychology, neuroanatomy, pharma-cology, cardiology, immunology, metabolism, genomics, and healthy living. SRS rec-ognizes the importance of educating the public about the connection between sleep and health outcomes. We promote training and education in sleep research, public awareness, and evidence-based policy, in addition to hosting forums for the ex-change of scientific knowledge pertaining to sleep and circadian rhythms. According to an Institute of Medicine's report entitled, ''Sleep Disorder and Sleep Deprivation: An Unmet Public Health Problem'' (2006), chronic sleep and circadian disturbances and disorders are a very real and relevant issue in today's society as they affect 50-70 million Americans across all demographic groups. Sleep depriva-tion is a major safety issue, particular in reference to drowsy driving, where it is a factor in 20 percent of motor vehicle injuries. The widespread effect of sleep dis-orders on every age group poses a public health risk, extending from the ability to learn to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that sleep disorders and circadian disturbances are often an indicator of, or a precursor to other major diseases and disorders including; obesity, diabetes, hypertension, car-diovascular disease, stroke, depression, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse. An-other increasingly detrimental condition affecting 15 percent of the population is sleep-disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea results in excessive daytime somnolence, poor performance, increased frequency of road traffic accidents, and arterial hypertension. Studies show that 85 percent of 725 troops re-turning home from Afghanistan and Iraq had a sleep disorder and the most common was obstructive sleep apnea (51 percent). If left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea has significant negative impacts on health, including early mortality. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH Due to the fact that sleep is a multi-disciplinary issue, many institutes and cen- ters at NIH, utilize a portion of their funding to support sleep and circadian re-search. The majority of sleep research is coordinated by NHLBI, particularly the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research. An appropriation of $32 billion for NIH, and $3 billion for NHLBI, is needed to facilitate the continued growth and ad-vancement in the sleep and circadian research portfolio. The reason NCSDR is housed at NHLBI is due to the important link between sleep disorders and cardiovascular health. NCSDR supports research, health edu-cation, and research training related to sleep-disordered breathing and the funda-mental function of sleep and circadian rhythms. Furthermore, NCSDR coordinates 651 sleep research across NIH and with other Federal agencies and outside organiza- tions. NCSDR's coordinating role between institutes is made possible through adequate funding. These research activities also have far reaching effects, beginning with training grants targeted towards undergraduate students and career development opportunities attracting top talent in doctoral programs. Sequestration has the po-tential to disrupt the research training pipeline by reducing the amount of K, T, and F series awards for new investigators. It could also disrupt the career development pipeline designed to train future investigators who are pursuing research in sleep disorders and circadian rhythms. It is important to fund NIH at $32 billion and NHLBI at $3 billion in fiscal year 2015 so that we can continue these advancements in sleep and circadian research. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS & DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES It is also important to recognize that by increasing the Federal commitment to sleep and circadian research, we can improve the health of those brave Americans who have served in uniform and are suffering from sleep disorders. Both obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia have a high prevalence among active-duty U.S. Armed Forces and among Veterans. Post-traumatic stress disorder and/or depression are highly prevalent in returning Iraq and Afghanistan combat Veterans. Sleep disturb-ance is a prominent symptom in these disorders. Traumatic brain injury is increas-ingly common in modern combat, and sleep disruption in the aftermath of TBI may have negative effects on long-term recovery of normal brain function. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense have shown a commitment to collaborating with NIH on sleep research related to Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and Gulf War Ill-ness (GWI). This is highlighted in the fiscal year 2014 president's budget request detailing research initiatives in PTSD and TBI. The ''Longitudinal Health Study of Gulf War Era Veterans'' is one of the largest scientific research studies on chronic diseases and multi-symptom illnesses, including Gulf War Illness. Researchers found that prazosin, an inexpensive drug already used by millions of Americans for hypertension and prostate problems, improves sleep and reduces nightmares for vet- erans with PTSD. They continue to pursue activities such as the difference between female and male veterans with PTSD and possible intervention strategies to help veterans with TBI return to daily activities. One study described in the Veteran's Health Administration report State of VA Research 2012, found that 96 percent of veterans with chronic multi-symptom illnesses experienced sleep disordered breath-ing. By using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) these veterans reported reductions in pain and fatigue and improvements in cognitive function. Sleep disruption, especially insomnia, is a contributing risk factor to the onset and severity of major mental health problems such as depression, bipolar disorder, sub-stance abuse, PTSD, TBI, and suicide among the veteran population. It is important to continue supporting the sleep research endeavors of the VA through robust fund-ing for the Medical and Prosthetic Research Program at $589 million. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION CDC gathers important data on sleep disorders through their surveillance efforts under the Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion program. Most nota-bly, CDC hosts a National Sleep Awareness Roundtable (NSART) by promoting the importance of sleep through the production of State fact sheets, updating the CDC website, and disseminating information on sleep related topics. CDC also promotes awareness of sleep disorders and the dangers associated with sleep deprivation for the benefit of millions of Americans. Currently population-based data on the preva-lence of circadian disruption and its relationship to disease risk is relatively limited. Please fund CDC at $7.8 billion including an allocation of $1 million solely for sleep awareness and surveillance activities within the Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion program and within NSART, so that progress can continue in the areas of sleep disorders and disturbances, sleep awareness, and education to the public community. NIH SLEEP DISORDERS RESEARCH PLAN NCSDR published the NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan in November of 2011 highlighting the implementation of pertinent sleep research goals to enable further advancements in the realm of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders. A Joint Task Force between the two leading organizations representing the sleep medicine and research community, Sleep Research Society (SRS) and American Academy of Sleep 652 Medicine (AASM), has identified research opportunities that will have the highest impact on health within the plan. The Plan recommends implementation of the following sleep research goals which will help us understand the function of sleep and inform individuals on healthier lifestyle choices: \u2014Advance the understanding of sleep and circadian functions and of basic sleep and circadian mechanisms, in both the brain and the body, across the lifespan. \u2014Identify genetic, pathophysiological, environmental, cultural, lifestyle factors, and sex and gender differences contributing to the risk of sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances, and their role in the development and pathogenesis of co-morbid diseases and disability. \u2014Improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep and circadian disorders, chronic sleep deficiency, and circadian disruption, and evaluate the resulting impact on human health. \u2014Enhance the translation and dissemination of sleep and circadian research find- ings and concepts to improve healthcare, inform public policy, and increase com-munity awareness to enhance human health. \u2014Enable sleep and circadian research training to inform science in cross-cutting domains, accelerate the pace of discovery, and the translation of enhanced therapies from bench to bedside to community. Research activities and stakeholders addressed by the plan benefit from the en- compassing range of NIH research, training, and outreach programs. Over the past 2 years, steps have been taken to implement portions of this research plan, but ad-ditional work needs to be done. SRS encourages you to recommend that this re-search plan continue to be implemented during fiscal year 2015. Thank you for the opportunity to submit the views of the sleep research commu- nity. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions or require additional information. [This statement was submitted by Dr. Janet Mullington, Ph.D., President, Sleep Research Society.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THESOCIETY FOR HEALTHCARE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AMER- ICA AND THE ASSOCIATION FOR PROFESSIONALS IN INFECTION CONTROL AND EPIDE- MIOLOGY The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) thank you for this opportunity to submit testimony on Federal efforts to detect dangerous infectious diseases, protect the American public from preventable healthcare-associated infec-tions (HAIs) and address the rapidly growing threat of antibiotic resistance (AR). We ask that you support the following programs: First, under the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases: $250 million for Core Infectious Diseases including $30 million for the new Detect and Protect Against Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Initiative, $32 million for the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), and $30 million for the Advanced Mo-lecular Detection (AMD) Initiative. Additionally, we request $34 million for HAI re-search activity conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and $4.58 billion for the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). HAIs are among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States. In hospitals alone, CDC estimates that one in 25 patients has an HAI, totaling ap-proximately 722,000 infections in 2011. According to the CDC, every day, more than 200 Americans with HAIs will die during their hospital stay. Further, AR is one of the most critical public health and patient safety threats facing us today, causing an estimated two million illnesses and approximately 23,000 deaths annually. It is estimated that as much as half of antibiotic prescribing in hospitals is not nec-essary. Antibiotics, created to save lives, are now contributing to patient's deaths by promoting the emergence of highly resistant bacteria and leading to deadly ad-verse events. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) We urge you to support the CDC Coalition's request for $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2015 for the CDC's ''core programs.'' We are concerned that the President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal would reduce the CDC's budget authority by $243 million when compared with fiscal year 2014. This total is, in fact, lower than 2003 levels. We urge Congress to prioritize funding for the activities and programs supported 653 by CDC that are essential to protect the health of the American people and reduce healthcare costs. We especially want to highlight our support for the $30 million in the President's budget for the Detect and Protect Against Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Initiative. This initiative will establish a robust network of five regional labs that will detect the deadliest AR threats and protect patients and communities through the rapid identi-fication of outbreaks, saving lives and reducing healthcare costs. It will prioritize healthcare prevention collaboratives focused on improving antibiotic use and pre-venting deadly infections caused by Clostridium aureus (MRSA). Most importantly, the initiative will invest in direct action by implementing proven evidence-based interventions that reduce the emergence and spread of AR pathogens and improve antibiotic use. It is critical that Congress prioritize this rapidly growing threat to public health and patient safety in our Na-tion and around the world. Moreover, we strongly support CDC's focus on the imple-mentation of antimicrobial stewardship programs in all healthcare settings. We urge you to support the $32 million in the President's budget for the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). The President's request represents a $14 million increase over the fiscal year 2014 enacted level for the NHSN to extend HAI prevention efforts to more than 3,000 ambulatory surgery centers and other non-hospital settings. This will enable CDC to conduct applied research on interven-tions for infection prevention and continue to provide data for national HAI elimi-nation and targeted HAI prevention intervention. This funding level will also allow for the extension and implementation of the NHSN Antimicrobial Use and Resist-ance Components to enable rapid detection of highly resistant pathogens and track antibiotic use in healthcare settings. The NHSN serves as the foundation for the development of innovative, evidence- based HAI prevention strategies through high-quality monitoring of HAI prevalence as well as antibiotic usage in the US. It is a critical tool used by healthcare facilities to monitor and prevent HAIs. The NHSN provides medical facilities, states, regions, and the Nation with data collection and reporting capabilities needed to comply with state and Federal public reporting mandates, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Value-Based Purchasing Program. Consistent, scientifically sound and validated data are necessary to be reported at the state and Federal lev-els to ensure that accurate data are available to evaluate progress related to the HHS National Action Plan to Prevent HAIs as well as to support transparency to the public, allowing for fair comparisons between facilities. By August 2013, over 12,400 healthcare facilities, including nearly all U.S. hos- pitals, participated in NHSN for quality improvement. The number of acute care hospitals reporting multi-drug resistant organisms (such as C.diff and MRSA) through NHSN more than doubled to 4,000 in fiscal year 2013. Since 2008, the cu- mulative impact of CDC data systems, guidelines and programs has contributed to significant reductions of HAIs in healthcare settings, including a 44 percent reduc-tion in central line-associated bloodstream infections, a 31 percent reduction in healthcare-associated invasive MRSA infections, and a 20 percent reduction in sur-gical site infections. We strongly support the CDC Prevention Epicenters Program. Funded through the NHSN, this program is a collaboration between CDC and academic medical cen-ters that conduct innovative infection control and prevention research to address im-portant scientific questions regarding the prevention of HAIs, antibiotic resistance and other adverse healthcare events. The Epicenters Program has provided a unique forum in which academic leaders in healthcare epidemiology can partner di-rectly with each other and with CDC subject matter experts. The resultant empha-sis on multicenter collaborative research projects, through which investigators work together as a group, allows for research that in many cases, would not have been possible for a single academic center. Going forward, the Prevention Epicenters will continue to address gaps and pilot innovative ways to prevent HAIs and anti-microbial resistance. We urge your continued support of the President's $30 million request for the Ad- vanced Molecular Detection (AMD) Initiative in bioinformatics and genomics, which allows CDC to more quickly determine where emerging diseases come from, whether microbes are resistant, and how microbes are moving through a population. This Initiative is critical because it strengthens CDC's epidemiologic and laboratory ex-pertise to effectively guide public health action. We strongly support the critical work conducted through the Emerging Infections Program (EIP), which engages a network of state health departments and their aca-demic medical center partners to help answer important questions about emerging 654 HAI threats, advanced infection tracking methods and antibiotic resistance in the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality We request your support of the proposed investment of $34 million for AHRQ's HAI research activity, the level of enacted support in fiscal year 2014. Building on the successes of fiscal year 2013 and 2014, these funds will support a portfolio of grant- and contract-funded projects seeking to advance our knowledge about effec-tive approaches to reducing HAIs while promoting the implementation of proven methods for preventing HAIs. These grants ($13.9 million) and contracts ($20.1 mil-lion) will investigate methods of controlling HAIs in diverse healthcare settings and will address the major types of HAIs. In addition, contracts funded by the HAI budget will accelerate the nationwide implementation of the Comprehensive Unit- based Safety Program (CUSP). To date, widespread adoption of this evidence-based checklist of safety practices to over 1,000 intensive care units has reduced the inci-dence of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) by 41 percent. Our organizations are pleased to participate in the On the CUSP: Stop CAUTI ini-tiative, which aims to reduce mean rates of CAUTI in U.S. hospitals by 25 percent by working with state organizations and hospitals across the country to implement the CUSP and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) reduction prac-tices in hospital units. In spite of notable progress, there remains work to be done toward the goal of HAI elimination. National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis- eases (NIAID) Within NIH, we believe that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dis- eases (NIAID) should be funded at least at the $4.58 billion requested by the Ad-ministration in the fiscal year 2014 budget request. Nearly flat-funding NIAID lim-its investment in new research and serves as a disincentive for young people to pur-sue infectious disease research careers so critical to the discovery of new therapies, new diagnostic approaches, and new preventive strategies. In 2013, the NIAID began funding a new clinical trials network focused on anti- biotic-resistant bacterial infections. With sufficient funding, the new research net-work/infrastructure will conduct studies to address antibiotic resistance as well as begin to answer questions that will help fill the nearly empty antibiotic research and development pipeline. Severe economic disincentives have caused a mass exodus of private companies from the antibiotics market, making federally funded research in this area more critical than ever. We applaud NIAID's initiative in launching the new network. We recommend increased investment in this area. We thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony and greatly appreciate your leadership in the effort to eliminate preventable HAIs and combat antibiotic resist-ance.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SOCIETY FOR NEUROSCIENCE Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, my name is Carol Ann Mason, Ph.D. I am a professor of pathology and cell biology, neuroscience, and ophthalmic science at Columbia University. I study the development of visual pathways in mammalian brains, with a focus on how neurons in the eye are encoded to project to the correct side of the brain, setting up the circuit for binocular vision. This state-ment is in support of increased funding for NIH for fiscal year 2015. I am pleased to submit this testimony in my capacity as president of the Society for Neuroscience (SfN). On behalf of the nearly 40,000 members of SfN, thank you for your past support of neuroscience research at NIH. SfN's mission is to advance the understanding of the brain and nervous system; provide professional develop-ment activities, information and educational resources; promote public information and general education; and inform legislators and other policymakers. The Society stands with others in the research community in requesting at least $32 billion for NIH for fiscal year 2015. Sequestration is taking an enormous toll on biomedical research, coming on top of recent years when funding has failed to keep pace with the cost of research\u2014let alone the scientific opportunities that are available. SfN urges Congress to reverse the current course and find ways to invest more in biomedical research. Let's work to put biomedical research on a trajectory 655 of sustained growth that recognizes its promise and opportunity as a tool for eco- nomic growth and, more importantly, for advancing the health of Americans. Neuroscience: An Investment in Our Future Even in the face of the difficult funding situation, the last several years have been a tremendously exciting and productive time for neuroscience discoveries. Major re-search advances on brain development, imaging, genomics, circuits, computational neuroscience, neural engineering, and many other disciplines are leading to new tools, new knowledge, and greater understanding that were unimaginable even a few years ago. Sustained investment to fuel and speed these discoveries is essential to American health and economic well-being for many reasons. First, major investment in basic and translational neuroscience is not only fueling an enduring and vital scientific endeavor; it is the essential foundation for under-standing and treating diseases that strike nearly 1 billion people worldwide. All told, there are more than 1,000 debilitating neurological and psychiatric diseases that strike over 100 million Americans each year, producing inestimable hardship for millions of America families and costing the U.S., in a conservative estimate, at least $760 billion a year, with expenses in the trillions looming for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Advances made possible by publicly-funded basic research will help better understand and treat traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's, Parkin-son's disease, Down syndrome, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and post-traumatic stress disorder, to name just a few. With so much promising research, now, more than ever, it is time to fan the flames of research in order to ensure lifesaving break-throughs continue. Additionally, NIH funding is an investment in America's current economic strength. Funding for research supports quality jobs and increases economic activ-ity. NIH supports approximately 400,000 jobs and $58 billion in economic output na-tionwide. Eighty-five percent of the NIH budget fund extramural research in com-munities located in every State. Finally, without robust, sustained investment, America's status as the preeminent leader in biomedical research is at risk. Other countries are investing heavily in bio-medical research to take advantage of new possibilities. Even with the growing phil-anthropic support, private sector cannot be expected to close the gap. The lag time between discovery and profitability means that the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries need federally-funded basic (also known as funda-mental) research to develop products and treatments. The foundation that basic re-search provides is at risk if federally-funded research declines. The BRAIN Initiative SfN appreciates that both Congress and the administration recognize brain science as one of the great scientific challenges of our time. The Brain Research through Application of Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative\u2014announced by the President last April\u2014will enable NIH and other Federal agencies to develop tools and plans that will help accelerate fundamental discoveries and improve the health and quality of life for millions of Americans. An eminent group of neuroscientists with diverse research interests is helping to formulate a scientif-ically-driven direction for the initiative, and SfN thanks public leaders for their in-terest and early support for a truly transformative scientific grand challenge that would need major financial emphasis in future years. The overarching goal of the BRAIN Initiative is to map the circuits of the brain and the activity within those circuits to understand our unique cognitive and behav-ioral capabilities. The Initiative has a strong focus on developing technologies which has the potential to benefit all of neuroscience and even non-neuroscience research. BRAIN, like other major brain-related initiatives around the world, demonstrates the global interest in tackling the mysteries of the brain. But BRAIN\u2014as with all the neuroscience research that takes place with Federal support\u2014can only be suc-cessful if it is part of a broad neuroscience commitment across Congress and the Administration. Such an investment will also help ensure the U.S. remains a global leader, as other nations and regions are now rapidly ramping up their investments in neuroscience research. Cross-Disciplinary Neuroscience and the Promise of Brain Circuits NIH-funded basic research continues to be essential for discoveries that will in- spire scientific and medical progress for generations. Past NIH-supported projects have helped neuroscientists make tremendous strides in diagnosing and treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. A prime example of the importance of funding research at levels from the most basic to translational is the current focus on understanding brain circuits. Circuits in the brain underlie every thought, emotion, and action we take. Current knowl-656 edge about the intricate patterns connecting brain cells is extremely limited. Identi- fying these patterns is essential to understand healthy brain function and dysfunc-tion in injury or disease. Research suggests that some brain disorders, like autism and schizophrenia, may result from errors in neural circuit development. Eluci-dating brain circuit structure and function is an enormously challenging endeavor; the brain consists of billions of cells, and each cell contacts thousands of others. These cells communicate with precisely-timed signals, which then activate a mul-titude of biochemical pathways that influence every process in the cell. However, scientists are beginning to map the functions of brain circuits with previously un-heard-of specificity using cutting-edge technologies, and learning how these circuits produce behaviors. The following examples are just a few of the many basic research success stories in the science of brain circuitry emerging now thanks to interdisciplinary research funded by a strong historic investment in NIH and other research agencies. Optogenetics Optogenetics is a technique which uses light to activate specific populations of neurons with millisecond precision. It is difficult to overstate how revolutionary optogenetics is for neuroscience research. With optogenetics, flashes of light are used to activate neurons that have been genetically modified to contain a light-sens-ing protein. This precise control over specific populations of neurons at specific times was impossible until a confluence of basic research in marine biology, genetic engineering, cellular biology, and fiber optic technology facilitated its development; together these developments created an approach that enables the proteins to be used as ''on switches'' for cells. Introduced a decade ago, optogenetics is now used by hundreds of labs; it is one of the many neurotechnologies that today is trans-forming the field's ability to understand brain function, and is being used to study brain circuits in both normal function and disease, including Parkinson's disease, as described below. The development of this technology also perfectly demonstrates the often serendipitous nature of scientific discovery and the need to fund both re-search on all levels, from basic to translational to clinical. Understanding the Development of Vision My own area of research is the development of the circuits underlying vision. For binocular vision to function, the brain must receive information from both eyes. Nerve fibers from each retina grow to the 'optic chiasm,' at the midline of the bot-tom of the brain. Here, nerve fibers from each eye cross to the other side of the brain. Other axons, however, are repelled at the midline and project to the same side of the brain. These connections underlie binocular vision which enables ani-mals, including humans, to calculate how far objects lie in the distance. One area of my research focuses on this question and the molecular mechanisms that prompt some growing nerve fibers to ''stop in their tracks'' and reroute to the same side. These two groups of cells in the eye, each taking different routes, are endowed with distinct genes that direct their time of birth and their growth to the regions where they make their synaptic connections. Understanding their genetic ''signatures'' and growth helps us to learn how to encourage stem cells to be integrated into the dis-eased eye and injured nerve fibers to regrow in the correct circuits. We also inves-tigate how the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) surrounding the eye, directs retinal development. Perturbations in the RPE occur in albinism and in juvenile forms of macular degeneration, the latter leading to blindness, and our gene identification efforts are important for gene therapy at early stages of the disease. Moreover, un-derstanding how tracts are laid down is essential for unraveling the basis of defects in fiber pathways and synapse formation in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. This research is made possible with support primarily from NIH, especially the National Eye Institute and with a team of innovative and collaborative sci-entists and trainees in my lab and in our community, and provides a foundation for future discovery and new understanding about diseases of the eye and other neurodevelopmental conditions. Deep Brain Stimulation Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a tool that emerged as a result of advances in health research. DBS involves a surgical procedure in which a neurostimulator de-vice\u2014similar to a heart pacemaker\u2014is implanted to deliver electrical stimulation to targeted areas in the brain. While both DBS and optogenetics have emerged as in-strumental methods to influence circuits, DBS has also been developed into a revo-lutionary therapy for the treatment of neurological disease. The electrical pulses de-livered through the electrodes can transiently disrupt abnormal activity that occurs in localized circuits of diseased brains, such as in Parkinson's patients. 657 DBS has created a new way to approach the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Many patients experience pronounced relief from symptoms that include tremor, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems. Moreover, DBS can allow pa-tients to reduce the dosage of their medication, providing relief from debilitating motor side-effects. Additionally, advances in materials science to create more flexible electrodes and in imaging research to produce higher resolution images of the brain will improve the precision and outcome of this intervention. At this time, how and why DBS works is unknown. Insight into its mechanism of action came from optogenetic studies in rodents of the brain circuits that control movement. By systematically manipulating precise areas of the circuit affected by this disease, scientists were able to implicate the connection between two areas of the brain as the most effective target for DBS. These studies will also inform the design of other interventions in Parkinson's, and establish a model for study of basic brain circuitry to inform DBS treatment. DBS has also had success in treating both intractable depression and epilepsy, and has the potential to improve therapies for a whole host of brain diseases and disorders\u2014as long as the correct target is identified. Because stimulating adjacent regions in the brain can have vastly different effects, researchers are attempting to better understand the complex brain circuits that control our normal functions (e.g., movement, emotion) and how they can go wrong (e.g., addiction). They also are tweaking the physical devices used, as well as the frequency and strength of the electrical pulses delivered. As we understand more about language of the brain through the research made possible by NIH funding, new applications of DBS will be possible. The Future of American Science As the subcommittee considers this year's funding levels, please consider that sig- nificant advancements in the biomedical sciences often come from young investiga- tors. As a director of the PhD training program of a leading neuroscience depart-ment, I see firsthand that the current funding environment is taking a toll on the energy and resilience of these young people and their career choice. America's sci-entific enterprise\u2014and its global leadership\u2014has been built over generations. With-out sustained, consistent investment, we will quickly lose that leadership. Dramatic swings in funding have stifling and irreversible impacts on progress; a closed labora-tory can't simply open again when funding is restored. The culture of entrepreneur-ship and curiosity-driven research could be hindered for decades. We live at a time of extraordinary opportunity in neuroscience. A myriad of ques- tions once impossible to consider are now within reach because of new technologies, an ever-expanding knowledge base, and a willingness to embrace many disciplines. To take advantage of the opportunities in neuroscience we need an NIH appropria-tion that allows for sustained, reliable growth. That, in turn, will lead to improved health for the American public and will help maintain American leadership in science worldwide. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. [This statement was submitted by Carol Ann Mason, Ph.D., President, Society for Neuroscience.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THESOCIETY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION I am pleased to submit this testimony on behalf of The Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE), a 501 (c)(3) professional organization founded in 1950 to pro-vide global leadership to the profession of health education and health promotion. SOPHE's 4,000 national and chapter members work in universities, medical/ healthcare settings, businesses, voluntary health agencies, international organiza-tions, and all branches of Federal/State/local government. Members include behav-ioral scientists, faculty, practitioners, and students engaged in disease prevention and health promotion in both the public and private sectors. The Society contributes to the health of all people and the elimination of health disparities through ad-vances in health education theory and research; excellence in professional prepara-tion and practice; and advocacy for public policies conducive to health. SOPHE is the only independent professional organization devoted exclusively to health edu-cation and health promotion. SOPHE's two scientific peer-reviewed journals, elec-tronic newsletters, listservs, websites, new Center for Online Education (CORE), as well as its national conference help ensure that vital public health activities and programs in various regions are expeditiously disseminated. There are currently 20 SOPHE chapters covering more than 30 States and regions across the country. SOPHE's vision of a healthy world through health education compels us to advo- cate for increased resources targeted at the most pressing public health issues. For 658 the fiscal year 2015 funding cycle, SOPHE encourages the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS) Subcommittee to in-crease funding for public health programs that focus on preventing chronic disease and other illnesses in adults as well as youth, and eliminating health disparities. In particular, SOPHE requests the following fiscal year 2015 funding levels for Labor-HHS programs: \u2014$7.8 billion for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2014$1.1 billion for the CDC National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) \u2014$25 million for CDC's National Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Pro- motion's Division of Population Health School Health Program \u2014$1 billion for the Prevention and Public Health Fund \u2014$80 million for Community Prevention Grants \u2014$50 million for Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health The discipline of health education and health promotion, which is some 100 years old, uses sound science to plan, implement, and evaluate interventions that enable individuals, groups, and communities to achieve personal, environmental and popu-lation health. Beyond supporting individual behavior change, health education fo-cuses on policy, systems, and environmental changes to support a healthy lifestyle. There is a robust, scientific evidence-base documenting not only that health edu-cation specialists and their various health education interventions work, but that they are also cost-effective. These principles serve as the basis for our support for the programs outlined below and can help ensure our Nation's resources are tar-geted for the best return on investment. Our profession is the first to recruit and train community health workers in terms of cost-effective program interventions. SOPHE is requesting a fiscal year 2015 funding level $7.8 billion for CDC in order to prevent chronic diseases and other illnesses, promote health, prevent injury and disability, and ensure preparedness against health threats. Unfortunately, President Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget request of $6.6 billion for CDC represents a de-crease of some $243 million when compared with fiscal year 2014. CDC is at the forefront of U.S. efforts to monitor health, detect and investigate health problems, conduct research to enhance prevention, develop sound public health policies, and foster safe and healthful environments. More than 80 percent of all CDC funds go back to States to address State and local health issues. Measured investments now in community-led, evidence-based innovative programs will help to increase our Na-tion's productivity and performance in the global market; help ensure military readi-ness; decrease costly deaths due to infant low birth weight and adult onset of can-cer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS, and; increase pediatric and adult immunization rates. Moroever, cuts to CDC's budget are not sustainable and will reduce the ability to investigate and respond to public health emergencies as well as foodborne and infectious disease outbreaks. Preventing Chronic Disease The data are clear: chronic diseases are the Nation's leading causes of morbidity and mortality and account for 75 percent of every dollar spent on healthcare in the U.S. Collectively, they account for 70 percent of all deaths nationwide. Healthcare accounts for 18 percent of GDP, and it is expected to account for 19.6 percent by 2021. Yet evidence shows that investing just $1 in preventing chronic disease will yield a $5 return on investment. SOPHE requests an appropriation of $1.1 billion for the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP). For example, heart conditions cost the Nation more than $107 billion annually in healthcare costs, and nearly $95 billion in lost economic productivity. Studies show that spend-ing as little as $10 per person on proven preventive interventions could save the country over $16 billion in just 5 years. The public overwhelmingly supports in-creased funding for disease prevention and health promotion programs. Among the many vital programs in CDC's NCCDPHP, SOPHE is requesting a fis- cal year 2015 funding level of $25 million to the CDC Division of Population Health's School Health Branch (SHB). The increase in funding will allow the SHB to create a coordinated, national response to school health and chronic disease, which will maximize program effectiveness and accelerate health improvements. School health activities supported through the SHB include: supporting healthier nutrition environments in schools; providing comprehensive school physical activity programs and multi-component physical education policies; and improving capacity to manage chronic conditions. Almost 80 percent of young people do not eat the rec-ommended five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Daily participation in high school physical education classes dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to 32 per-659 cent in 2001. Health and fitness are linked to improved academic achievement and grades, cognitive ability, and behavior as well as reduced truancy. Since fiscal year 2012, funding for CDC's school health activities to prevent chron- ic diseases has essentially been level funded at $14.9 million. DPH provides a basic level of funding for school health activities in all 50 States (about $75,000 per State). This small amount of funding allows States to only conduct a minimum of school-based health activities. The School Health Branch also provides an enhanced level of funding on a competitive basis to a smaller number of States. Increasing resources for the SHB will enable all 50 States and DC to engage in enhanced school health activities that improve the school nutrition environment and increase the quality and quantity of physical education and physical activity opportunities. States would also be strongly encouraged to fund a school health position at the State education agency to coordinate efforts with the State health department. CDC's Coordinated School Health Programs are cost-effective in improving chil-dren's health, their behavior, and their academic success. This funding builds bridges between State education and public health departments to coordinate health education, nutritious meals, physical education, mental health counseling, health services, healthy school environments, and parent and community involvement. The 2013 IOM report Educating the Student Body: Taking Physical Activity and Phys-ical Education to School, stated that the school environment is key in encouraging and providing opportunities for children and adolescents to be active. The lack of physically fit and health-literate graduates has become a national security issue\u2014 being overweight or obese has become the leading medical reason why applicants fail to qualify for military service. An Avenue to Future Health Savings SOPHE is requesting a fiscal year 2015 funding level of $1 billion for the Preven- tion and Public Health Fund. We applaud Congress for appropriating the Fund for the first time, as was intended by the law since the Fund's inception, in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus bill. We strongly encourage Congress to continue to appropriate the Fund at this level in fiscal year 2015 to sustain essential core public health in-frastructure, the workforce, and our capacity to improve health in our communities. This fund provides the agility for innovation and meeting the needs of communities at the State and local levels. Specifically, the Prevention Fund helps States tackle the leading causes of death and root causes of costly, preventable chronic disease; detect and respond rapidly to health security threats; and prevent accidents and injuries. With this investment, the Fund helps States and the Nation as a whole focus on fighting disease and ill-ness before they happen. The evidence is overwhelming: investing in prevention saves lives and money. A 2011 Urban Institute study concluded that it is in the Na-tion's best interest from both a health and economic standpoint to maintain funding for evidence-based, public health programs that save lives and bring down costs; a July 2011 study published in the journal Health Affairs found that increased spend-ing by local public health departments can save lives currently lost to preventable illnesses; and a follow up to that study in 2013 found that low-income communities experience the largest health and economic gains with respect to increases in local public health spending. In addition, lower death rates and healthcare costs were seen especially in communities that allocated their public health funding across a broader mix of preventive services. SOPHE supports the new Community Prevention Grant program that will be funded at $80 million to help communities build multi-sector partnerships to strengthen multisector partnerships aimed at better health. Although SOPHE is disappointed that the Community Transformation Grant (CTG) program was discon-tinued in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus, we look forward to a new stream of funding that will support communities to implement evidence-based chronic disease preven-tion strategies. SOPHE has met with key stakeholders in both Congress and the Ad-ministration and looks forward to realizing the vision of forthcoming funding oppor-tunity announcements. As part of the Prevention Fund, SOPHE strongly supports the increase in funding CDC's Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Across the U.S. (REACH U.S.) program, which addresses health risk behaviors in both children and adults. Chronic diseases account for the largest health gap among populations and increase health disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups. As the U.S. population becomes increasingly diverse, the Nation's health status will be heavily influenced by the morbidity of racial and ethnic minority communities. With addi-tional funding from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, the REACH program will address strategies in the areas of tobacco-free living, active living and healthy eating, clinical and other preventive services, social and emotional wellness, and 660 healthy and safe physical environments\u2014with a primary focus on African-American/ Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and American In-dian/Alaskan Native populations. These culturally sensitive, population specific pro-grams, often led by health education specialists in tandem with community health workers, are aimed at disease risk reduction and preventing costly hospital re-ad-mission rates. Thank you for this opportunity to present our views to the Subcommittee. We un- derstand there will be difficult choices to make in this fiscal environment, and join you in seriously evaluating how our Nation's scarce resources can provide maximum return on investment. Public health funding gets the job done at the State and local levels and only represents 1.5 percent of Federal budget; lack of full funding would only be ''penny wise and pound foolish''. SOPHE shares the Subcommittee's goals to support the Nation's efforts to thrive and grow through sound investments in labor, education and health. This can only be accomplished with a healthy population contributing to a skilled, healthy and productive workforce. We look forward to working with you to prevent chronic ill-ness, improve the quality of lives, and save billions of dollars in healthcare spend-ing. [This statement was submitted by M.

[This statement was submitted by Elaine Auld, Chief Executive Officer, Society for Public Health Education.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SOCIETY FOR WOMEN 'SHEALTH RESEARCH The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is pleased to have the oppor- tunity to submit the following testimony urging renewed investment in scientific and medical research within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). For almost 25 years, our organization has been considered the thought leader in re-search on biological differences in disease and is dedicated to transforming women's health through science, advocacy, and education. We believe that a robust Federal research agenda that is inclusive of women's health research is critical for the U.S. to meet the needs and expectations of its citizens. We request that for fiscal year 2015, Congress fund the following agencies and programs at the following levels: \u2014Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality-$471 million \u2014Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-$6.904 billion \u2014Health Resources Services Administration-$6.113 billion \u2014National Institutes of Health-$32 billion \u2014Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-$3.6 billion \u2014Office of Research on Women's Health at NIH-$42 million \u2014HHS Office of Women's Health-$35 million SWHR remains concerned with the ramifications of the Budget Control Act and sequestration. Funding levels for Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), were significantly cut and those agencies that fall underneath the umbrella of HHS; The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC), Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA), Na-tional Institutes of Health (NIH), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-ministration (SAMHSA), all play vital roles in improving and protecting the health of Americans but are forced to do more with less funding. Continued cuts to public health agencies decrease public health emergency preparedness and response capa-bilities, reducing funding for States to monitor air quality and offer mental health services, and increasing the risk for infectious disease outbreaks. These are essen-tial public health services that save lives and protect our health. Currently, healthcare spending is the largest driver of the Federal deficit. By 2021, estimates indicate that this spending will account for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. economy. Proper and sustained Congressional investment in medical and scientific research can ultimately save valuable healthcare dollars that are wasted on inappropriate and ineffective treatment. We realize that the current budgetary environment limits the amount of monies available for a substantial increase; however, the benefit from every dollar invested in medical research outweighs the cost many times over and 663 is, perhaps, the single most cost effective strategy in reducing our Federal deficit. Past investments in medical research have allowed scientists to begin unraveling the biologic and genetic underpinning of disease. This research has shown that bio-logical sex impacts every organ of the body, and plays an important role in disease susceptibility, prevalence, time of onset and severity. Sex differences are evident in all major disease categories, including cancer, obesity, and heart disease. These dif-ferences are also evident in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimi-nation. The medical community has now begun to tailor treatments to meet the needs of individual patients, taking the first step towards truly personalized medi-cine. National Institutes of Health-NIH serves as the America's premier medical re- search agency and is the largest source of funding for biomedical and behavioral re-search in the world. Many of the medical advances in recent decades are direct re-sults from investments in the agency. Unfortunately, years of flat-funding, without controlling for rising inflation, has meant that NIH's overall budget has decreased by 10 percent between 2004 and 2014, and its purchasing power has decreased by 22 percent. This number does not just impact NIH's campus in Maryland. Approxi-mately 85 percent of NIH funding is spent in communities across the country, cre-ating jobs at more than 3,000 universities, medical schools, teaching hospitals, and research institutions. In 2013, NIH funded 750 fewer grants than in 2012 and grant funding fell to an all-time low of 20 percent. A shrinking number of available grants put scientists out of work. With limited opportunities for research funding, scientists have little choice than to pursue opportunities outside of academic research in the U.S., resulting in the loss of skilled bench scientists and researchers to Asia, the European Union and the United Kingdom, who continue to heavily invest in re-search. Unfortunately, the Administration's request of a 0.7 percent increase doesn't make much headway in reversing the $1.5 billion cut the agency sustained under sequestration in fiscal year 2013, nor does it keep up with biomedical inflation rate, projected by the HHS's Biomedical Research and Development Price Index, to be 2.2 percent. Once that inflation rate is taken into account, the Administration's budget request results in another cut to the Agency. SWHR recommends that Congress set, at a minimum, a budget of $32 billion for NIH for fiscal year 2015. Further we rec-ommend that Congress expand NIH's mandate on the inclusion of women in basic research to include women in all phases of basic, clinical and medical research. Cur-rent practice only mandates sufficient female subjects only in Phase III research, and researchers often miss out on the chance to look for variability by sex in the early phases of research, safety and effectiveness is determined. Federal offices of women's health-The offices of women's health within the Federal health agencies do critical work, both individually and in collaboration with other offices and Federal agencies, to ensure that women receive the appropriate care and treatments in a variety of different areas. Under HHS, the agencies currently with offices, advisors or coordinators for women's health or women's health research in-clude the AHRQ, CDC, FDA, HRSA, Indian Health Service (INS), and SAMHSA. These offices do important work, both individually and in collaboration with other offices and Federal agencies to ensure that women receive the appropriate care and treatments in a variety of different areas. In a time of limited budgetary dollars, Congress should invest in these offices that promote working in collaboration with other agencies, which shares much needed expertise while avoiding unnecessary du-plication. SWHR recommends that these offices be sufficiently funded to ensure that these programs can continue to provide much needed services to women and their families in fiscal year 2015. Office of Research on Women's Health\u2014ORWH is the focal point for coordinating women's health and sex differences research at NIH, and supports innovative inter-disciplinary initiatives that focus on women's health and sex differences research. ORWH promotes opportunities for and support of recruitment, retention, re-entry and advancement of women in biomedical careers. The Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH) is an innovative, trans-NIH career development program that pairs junior faculty with senior investigators in a mentored environment. Approximately 500 scholars, the majority of them female, have been trained at 39 centers and have produced approximately 5,000 publica-tions. ORWH's administrative supplements for research on sex and fender dif-ferences, a trans-NIH initiative to broaden the field of sex and gender differences research, adds new dimensions to on-going studies. The specialized centers of re-search on sex and gender factors affecting women's health (SCOR) are designed to integrate basic and clinical approaches to sex and gender research across scientific disciplines and has resulted in over 650 articles, reviews, abstracts, book chapters and other publications. To allow ORWH's programs and research grants to continue make their impact on the research community, Congress must direct that NIH con-664 tinue its support of ORWH and provide it with a $1 million dollar budget increase, bringing its fiscal year 2015 total to $42 million. Health and Human Services' Office of Women's Health-The HHS OWH is the gov- ernment's champion and focal point for women's health issues. It works to address inequities in research, healthcare services, and public education gaps, which have historically placed the health of women at risk. Without OWH's actions, the task of translating research into practice would be only more difficult and delayed. Con- sidering the impact of women's health programs from OWH on the public, we urge Congress to provide an increase of $1 million for this office, a total of $35.7 million for fiscal year 2015. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, we thank you and this Committee for its support for medical and health services research and its commitment to the health of the Nation. We look forward to continuing to work with you to build a healthier future for all Americans. [This statement was submitted by Leslie Ritter, Director of Government Affairs, Society for Women's Health Research.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE SQUAXIN ISLAND TRIBE On behalf of the Tribal Leadership and members of the Squaxin Island Tribe, I am honored to submit our recommendation to this Subcommittee for appropriations to address the un-funded needs of American Indian and Alaska Native Treatment (AI/AN) Centers. The alarming statistics of increased alcohol and substance abuse use in the AI/AN communities speaks volumes to the need for improved and addi-tional facilities to provide treatment and recovery opportunities to our citizens, our youths, our future leaders and the next seven generations. Although SAMHSA has limited discretionary funding and even less resources for residential care facilities, the Indian Health Service cannot keep pace with the growing need for these treat-ment centers. The only funding opportunity available in SAMHSA is the Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum Women. In 2015, we respectfully request the Sub-committee: \u2014$10 million\u2014Expand access to residential care facility appropriations to include Treatment Centers and increase the annual appropriations to supplement inad-equate funding for these centers from the Indian Health Service of which the NWITC will receive $1.5 million; \u2014$50 million\u2014SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Tribal Prevention Grant Program; and, \u2014$15 million\u2014SAMHSA for Behavioral Health The Squaxin Island Tribe has been operating the Northwest Indian Treatment Center (NWITC) since 1994. Ingenious in creativity, the center offers a wide variety of cultural activities and traditional/religious ceremonies, making it a natural place to heal\u2014body, mind and soul. Fittingly, the center was given the spiritual name ''D3WXbi Palil'' meaning ''Returning from the Dark, Deep Waters to the Light.'' NWITC is a residential chemical dependency treatment facility designed to serve American Indians from Tribes located in Oregon, Washington and Idaho who have chronic relapse patterns related to unresolved grief and trauma. NWITC is unique in its integration of Tribal cultural values into a therapeutic environment for co-oc-curring substance abuse and mental health disorders. It is a 28 bed, 30-60 day resi-dential facility. Welcomed and hailed by Tribal Leaders who felt the urgent need for such a facil- ity, NWITC is centrally located in Grays Harbor County between Olympia and Aber-deen, on 2.5 acres in the small rural town of Elma, Washington. NWITC accepts patients that are referred through outpatient treatment programs, parole and pro-bation services, hospitals, assessment centers and child and family service centers. Medical care is provided through local Indian Health Service clinics and other med-ical service providers. NWITC has responded with an overwhelming success rate of nearly 65 percent. Since the original Congressional set-aside in 1993, NWITC has not received an adequate increase in the base Indian Health Service budget. It is critical to increase the NWITC's annual base in order to sustain the current services to the Tribes of the Northwest. An increase of $1.5 million would restore lost purchasing power and meet the need to add mental health and psychiatric components to the treatment program. This increase would allow NWITC to continue its effective treatment of Native Americans. In 2011, the NWITC served 225 patients from 28 Tribes and added intensive case management and crisis support to alumni in order to continue to promote positive outcomes for clients. Despite funding challenges, NWITC has continued to develop 665 and deliver innovative, culturally appropriate services to meet increasingly complex demands. The Treatment Center's traditional foods and medicines program is supported through a partnership with the Northwest Indian College and is funded through grants from the Washington Health Foundation, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, The Potlatch Fund and several Tribes. Weekly hands-on classes focus on traditional foods and medicines, including methods for growing, harvesting, proc-essing, and preparation. Twice a month, Tribal elders, storytellers, and cultural spe-cialists speak as part of the program. A monthly family class allows patients to share what they are learning with their loved ones. Patients gain hands-on experi-ence by working in three on-site teaching gardens. This program serves as a model for other Tribal communities. $50 million\u2014SAMHSA Behavioral Health Tribal Prevention Grant Program The Behavioral Health Tribal Prevention Grant will support behavioral health services that promote overall mental and emotional health, specifically substance abuse prevention and suicide prevention services. If funded, the grant program would be the only source for Federal substance abuse and suicide prevention fund-ing exclusively available to Tribes. $15 million\u2014SAMHSA for Behavioral Health This SAMHSA grant program has been authorized to award grants to Indian health programs to provide prevention or treatment of drug use or alcohol abuse, promotion of mental health, or treatment services for mental illness. To date, these funds have never been appropriated. An appropriation of $15 million would provide support to Indian health programs to meet the critical substance abuse and mental health needs of our citizens. Self-Governance\u2014An Efficient and Effective Use of Federal Funds (Title VI of the ISDEAA) Self-Governance is the most successful policy in the history of Tribal\u2014Federal re- lations and it inspires efficient and effective government spending. Through Self- Governance, Tribes are empowered, as sovereign nations, to exercise self-determina-tion and to design facilities, manage programs and funds, and provide services that are responsive to the needs of our communities and Tribal citizens. Tribes partici-pating in Self-Governance have become successful in the business of healthcare and perform several key roles, serving as, governments, employers, healthcare providers and patients. Self-Governance Tribes have made every attempt to be innovative to operate suc- cessful health programs given the budget constraints and cuts Tribal programs have incurred the past two decades. For more than a decade we have made every effort to expand Self-Governance to other programs and our efforts to seek expansion of the program will continue until we achieve our goal. We request that this Com-mittee recognizes the success of Self-Governance and encourage HHS to work with Tribes to make the most efficient and effective use of Federal appropriations to fund Tribal programs. Thank you for this opportunity to submit written testimony.

American Journal of Bioethics 7: 31-41. In far too many communities across the country, individuals whose severe mental illness impairs their ability to seek and voluntarily comply with treatment become caught up in a revolving door of hospitalization, incarceration, homelessness and re-peated victimization. This small segment of the total population of individuals with a severe mental illness consumes a disproportionate percentage of their commu-nities' limited mental health resources, without a concurrent benefit. AOT is a life-line that can break this cycle, allowing this otherwise highly vulnerable population to survive and thrive safely in the community. AOT achieves this by providing medi-cally prescribed mental health treatment under court order. Unfortunately, local communities are sometimes unable to realize AOT's benefits due to the initial start-up costs of moving away from their current flawed approach to one that effectively utilizes AOT. The AOT Grant Program will help to address this concern by providing communities with resources they can leverage to imple-ment these proven programs. Studies show that AOT benefits not only those who receive court-ordered treatment, but also, ''those who will be served in a more effi-cient public behavioral healthcare syste m... with greater capacity that produces better outcomes for a broader population in need.'' 1For example, an analysis of New York's Kendra's Law found that, ''In the long run . . . overall service capacity was increased, and the focus on enhanced services for AOT participants appears to have led to greater access to enhanced services for both voluntary and involuntary recipients'' 2 AOT is a Proven Means of Assisting Those Most in Need AOT is proven to help address the revolving door that traps far too many individ- uals with severe mental illness. In 2012, the Department of Justice deemed AOT to be an effective, evidence-based program for reducing crime and violence. 3 AOT Reduces Hospitalization Researchers in 2009 conducted an independent evaluation of New York's court- ordered outpatient treatment law (Kendra's Law) and documented a striking decline in the rate of hospitalization among participants. During a 6-month study period, AOT recipients were hospitalized at less than half the rate they were hospitalized in the 6 months prior to receiving AOT. Among those admitted, hospital stays were shorter: average length of hospitalization dropped from 18 days prior to AOT to 11 days during the first 6 months of AOT and 10 days for the seventh through twelfth months of AOT. 4 A randomized controlled study in North Carolina (Duke Study) in 1999 dem- onstrated that intensive routine outpatient services alone, without a court order, did not reduce hospital admission. However, when the same level of services (at least three outpatient visits per month, with a median of 7.5 visits per month) were com-bined with long-term AOT (6 months or more), hospital admissions were reduced 57 percent, and length of hospital stay was reduced by 20 days compared to individuals receiving the services alone. The results were even more dramatic for the subset of individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders\u2014long-term AOT re-duced hospital admissions by 72 percent and length of hospital stay by 28 days com-pared with services alone. The participants in the North Carolina study were from both urban and rural communities and ''generally did not view themselves as men-tally ill or in need of treatment.'' 5 A Washington State study of 115 patients found that AOT decreased hospitaliza- tion by 30 percent over 2 years. The savings in hospital costs for these 115 patients alone was $1.3 million. 6In an AOT program in Florida, AOT reduced hospital days 667 7Esposito, Rosanna, Westhead, Valerie, and Jim Berko. 2008.

The savings in hospital costs averaged $14,463 per patient.7 AOT Reduces Arrests and Incarceration A study of Kendra's Law published in 2010 concluded that the ''odds of arrest in any given month for participants who were currently receiving AOT were nearly two-thirds lower'' than those not receiving AOT. 8According to a 2005 New York State Office of Mental Health report on Kendra's Law, arrests for AOT participants were reduced by 83 percent, from 30 percent prior to the onset of a court order to only 5 percent after participating in the program. 9 A Florida report found AOT reduced days spent in jail among participants from 16.1 to 4.5 days, a 72 percent reduction.10Similarly, the Duke Study found that, for individuals who had a history of multiple hospital admissions combined with ar-rests and/or violence in the prior year, long-term AOT reduced the risk of arrest by 74 percent. The arrest rate for participants in long-term AOT was 12 percent, com-pared with 47 percent for those who had services without a court order. 11 AOT Reduces Violence, Crime, and Victimization. The New York State Office of Mental Health report also found that Kendra's Law resulted in dramatic reductions in harmful behaviors for AOT. Among AOT recipi-ents at 6 months of assisted outpatient treatment compared to a similar period of time prior to the court order: 55 percent fewer recipients engaged in suicide at-tempts or physical harm to self; 47 percent fewer physically harmed others; 46 per-cent fewer damaged or destroyed property; and 43 percent fewer threatened physical harm to others. Overall, the average decrease in harmful behaviors was 44 per-cent. 12 A 2010 study by Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health reached equally striking findings about the impact of Kendra's Law on the incidence of vio-lent criminal behavior. When AOT recipients in New York City and a control group of other mentally ill outpatients were tracked and compared, the AOT patients\u2014de-spite having more violent histories\u2014were found four times less likely to perpetrate serious violence after undergoing treatment. 13 The Duke Study found that long-term AOT combined with intensive routine out- patient services was significantly more effective in reducing violence and improving outcomes for severely mentally ill individuals than the same level of outpatient care without a court order. Among a group of individuals characterized as ''seriously vio-lent,'' 63.3 percent of those not in long-term AOT repeated violent acts, while only 37.5 percent of those in long-term AOT did so. Long-term AOT combined with rou-tine outpatient services reduced the predicted probability of violence by 50 per-cent. 14 The Duke Study further demonstrated that individuals with severe psychiatric ill- nesses who were not on AOT ''were almost twice as likely to be victimized as were outpatient commitment subjects.'' 24 percent of those on AOT were victimized, com-pared with 42 percent of those not on AOT. 15 668 16New York State Office of Mental Health. 2005.

New York State Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program Evaluation. Duke University School of Medicine. AOT Improves Treatment Compliance AOT has also been shown to be effective in increasing treatment compliance. In New York, AOT led to a 51 percent increase in recipients' exhibition of good service engagement, and more than doubled the exhibition of ''good'' adherence to medica-tion. 16 In North Carolina, only 30 percent of AOT patients refused medication during a 6-month period, compared to 66 percent of patients not under AOT.17In Ohio, AOT increased attendance to outpatient psychiatric appointments from 5.7 to 13.0 per year; it also increased attendance at day treatment sessions from 23 to 60 per year. 18 AOT also promotes long-term voluntary treatment compliance. In Arizona, ''71 percent [of AOT patients ]... voluntarily maintained treatment contacts 6 months after their orders expired'' compared with ''almost no patients'' who were not court- ordered to outpatient treatment. 19In Iowa, ''it appears as though outpatient com- mitment promotes treatment compliance in about 80 percent of patients while they are on outpatient commitment. After commitment is terminated, about three-quar-ters of that group remained in treatment on a voluntary basis.'' 20 The New York Independent Evaluation also yielded interesting findings on the likelihood of voluntary compliance after AOT is allowed to expire. For individuals who received AOT for periods of 6 months or less, the researchers found that post- AOT sustainability of improvements in medication adherence depended on whether intensive outpatient services were continued on a voluntary basis. Those who con-tinued with intensive services maintained their substantial increase in medication adherence relative to the pre-AOT period (from 37 to 45 percent); those who discon-tinued such assistance dropped back to near the pre-AOT levels (33 percent). Pa-tients who received AOT for more than 6 months, however, experienced increased medication adherence whether or not intensive services were continued. The medi-cation adherence rate was higher for those who continued intensive services than for those who did not (50 percent vs. 43 percent), but both groups maintained sub-stantial improvements from the pre-AOT rate (37 percent). 21 The Treatment Advocacy Center reemphasizes it support for full funding of the AOT Grant Program at $15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2018.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE TREVOR PROJECT Dear Chairman Harkin and Senator Moran: The Trevor Project appreciates the opportunity to submit a statement on the critical and timely issue of funding for children's suicide prevention and mental health initiatives.

Among young people ages 10 to 24, suicide is the second leading cause of death. 1According to the National Survey of Children's Health, up to 20 percent of young people have a diagnosable mental illness, but only 60 percent of those in need of mental healthcare receive the treatment they re-quire. 2In fact, half of all individuals with mental illness experience onset of the dis- order by age 14, but do not seek treatment, on average, until the age of 24.3For youth, the consequences of untreated mental illness vary and include increased sui-cide risk, school failure, involvement in the criminal justice system, unemployment, substance abuse, and homelessness. Among stigmatized populations such as LGBTQ young people, these negative outcomes can be exacerbated by prejudice, fear, and hate experienced in homes, schools, and communities. Suicidality is closely associated with mental illness; more than 90 percent of those who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental disorder. 4Therefore suicide preven- tion is an essential component of a comprehensive mental health system. We thank the Committee for your ongoing support for suicide prevention and mental health initiatives, and we hope that this letter will identify the critical pro-grams that exist to protect our most vulnerable youth. The Trevor Project recommends the following fiscal year 2015 appropriations to improve access to effective mental healthcare and reduce suicide risk for young peo-ple: GARRETT LEE SMITH MEMORIAL ACT SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS (SAMHSA) The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act provides the largest dedicated source of Fed- eral funding for youth suicide prevention efforts, which are a life-saving and effec-tive means to address the daunting issue of youth suicide. We can help avoid trag-edy by appropriately funding programs that focus on extreme harming behaviors and mental illness in young people. To date, Garrett Lee Smith funding has sup-ported suicide prevention programs in 49 States, 48 tribes, and 138 colleges. Fully appropriating these programs would ensure that the Suicide Prevention Resource Center continues to provide technical assistance to organizations nationwide; and it would allow for the expansion of State, tribal, and campus grants. Also encompassed within our funding recommendations for these programs is the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, which works towards a unified approach to suicide preven-tion through collaboration between public and private sectors; and the National Sui-cide Prevention Lifeline, which answers more than 94,000 calls a month, including calls from veterans, active duty members and their families, as well as the general public. 670 5Durso, L.

RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH ACT (HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES) An estimated 40 percent of all homeless youth are LGBTQ-identified, often be- cause they are thrown out of their homes or face family rejection.5Nearly 2/3 of these young people are likely to attempt suicide at least once.6 HUDs last Point in Time Count counted over 46,000 homeless youth, but less than 5,000 beds. Less than 10 percent of our homeless youth are receiving services, but funding for the RHYA has not significantly increased since 2008, despite a growing population desperately in need of the services provided by this Act. In order to meet the Administration's goal of ending youth homelessness by 2020, funding for runaway and homeless youth services needs to significantly increase. Through the RHYA, Congress ensures funding for community outreach programs, transi-tional housing and support services, and counseling and reunification guidance for families to be reconnected. Congress should appropriate $152.5 million to help keep our vulnerable youth safe and healthy as part of a nationwide commitment to end-ing youth homelessness by 2020. SUICIDE PREVENTION RESEARCH (NIMH) There is a strong correlation between research funding and morbidity rates associ- ated with diseases and disorders. Between 2009 and 2012, $165 million has been spent on suicide prevention research, and yet in the last decade, suicide rates have increased by 31 percent. Conversely, over 5 billion dollars has been spent on heart disease research, and rates in the past decade have decreased by 16 percent. We encourage you to include an additional $40 million for the National Institute of Mental Health to conduct suicide prevention and brain research, a recommenda-tion that reflects current legislation in the Senate and House (S. 2305/H.R. 7045), the Suicide Prevention Research INnovaTion Act (the SPRINT Act). The SPRINT Act aims to reduce the risk of self-harm, suicide, and interpersonal violence, espe-cially in rural communities with a shortage of mental health services. PROJECT AWARE \u2014(SAMHSA) The President's Now is the Time plan is an important step forward to effectively address school safety and youth mental health. These programs must be adequately funded in order to fulfill the promise of making our schools and communities safe for all young people. Through piloting Mental Health First Aid training with $20 million , Project AWARE would support innovative, State-based strategies for im-proving mental health training and responsiveness to mental health emergencies; and would be particularly effective in rural communities, where community mental health services are less frequently available. Additionally, through $40 million in State grants, Project AWARE would put more trained teachers and mental health professionals on the ground; help school districts make sure students get the refer-rals they needs; and would underscore the importance of prevention by offering stu-dents mental health services for trauma or anxiety, conflict resolution programs, and other school-based violence prevention strategies. NATIONAL VIOLENT DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM (NVRDS) (CDC) The NVDRS serves as a clearinghouse for the details and circumstances sur- rounding suicides completed in the jurisdictions in which it operates. This valuable information informs suicide prevention and crisis intervention efforts, but it is cur-rently only collected in 18 States. Proposals to expand this system have received broad bipartisan support, and the NVDRS expansion was included in the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act (S. 689), which passed nearly unanimously in the Senate as an amendment to S. 649. Fully funding the NVRDS with $25 mil-lion would allow nationwide collection of this data to further public health research on suicide prevention. Conclusion We thank the Committee for taking the time to fully assess our Nation's mental healthcare system, and we appreciate the opportunity to provide a written state-ment. We strongly support efforts to increase access to suicide prevention and men-671 tal healthcare for young people, and we urge the Committee to fully fund these crit- ical programs. [This statement was submitted by Abbe Land, Executive Director & CEO, Trevor Project.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE TRI-COUNCIL FOR NURSING The Tri-Council for Nursing, comprising the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), the American Nurses Association, the American Organization of Nurse Executives, and the National League for Nursing, respectfully requests $251 million for the Nursing Workforce Development programs authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 296 et seq.) and administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration in fiscal year 2015. The Tri-Council is a long-standing nursing alliance focused on leadership and ex- cellence in the nursing profession. The members of these respective organizations are acutely aware of the demand for nursing services due to a growing aging popu-lation, an increased focus on preventative care, and skyrocketing rates of individuals with multiple chronic conditions. In fact, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta-tistics (BLS) Employment Projections for 2012-2022, the profession of registered nurses (RN) will grow by 19 percent for the 10-year timeframe between 2012 and 2022. The number of job openings due to both the increasing demand for nursing services and the large number of retiring RNs, brings the total of RNs needed to 1.053 million by 2022. A 2013 HRSA report, The U.S. Nursing Workforce: Trends in Supply and Education, indicates that over the next 10 to 15 years, the nearly one million RNs over age 50 (comprising approximately one-third of the current workforce), will reach retirement age. Moreover, the acute nurse faculty shortage is one significant reason why schools of nursing across the country turn away tens of thousands of qualified applications each year. The demand for nurses and the faculty who educate them is a serious impediment to improving the Nation's healthcare needs. Nurses continue to be the largest group of healthcare providers whose services are directly linked to quality and cost-effectiveness. The Tri-Council is grateful to the Subcommittee for your past commitment to Title VIII funding and respectfully asks that you continue to make the long-term investment that will build the nursing workforce necessary to deliver the quality, affordable care envisioned in health reform. A Proven Solution: Nursing Workforce Development Programs The Nursing Workforce Development programs, authorized under Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, have helped build the supply and distribution of qualified nurses to meet our Nation's healthcare needs since 1964. Over these past 50 years, the original programs, newly added, and expanded programs have addressed all as-pects of supporting the workforce\u2014education, practice, retention, and recruitment. They have bolstered nursing education at all levels\u2014from entry-level preparation through graduate study\u2014and have provided support for institutions that educate nurses who practice in rural and medically underserved communities. A description of the Title VIII programs and their impact are included below. Advanced Nursing Education (ANE) Programs (Sec. 811) fund a number of grant activities\u2014including several traineeships\u2014that aim to increase the size and quality of the advanced nursing workforce. Supporting the preparation of RNs in master's and doctoral nursing programs, the ANE grants help prepare our Nation's nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, nurse educators, nurse administrators, nurses in executive practice, public health nurses, and other nursing specialists requiring advanced nursing education. In fiscal year 2012, these grants supported the education of 15,986 students. Under the ANE pro-gram are two critical traineeship programs that are particularly relevant as the de-mand for primary and acute care services rise. Advanced Education Nursing (AEN) Traineeships assist graduate nursing stu- dents by providing full or partial reimbursement for the costs of tuition, books, pro-gram fees, and reasonable living expenses. Funding for the AEN Traineeships sup-ports the education of future nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, nurse educators, nurse administrators, public health nurses, and other nurse specialists requiring advanced education. Nurse Anesthetist Traineeships (NAT) support the education of students in nurse anesthetist programs. In some States, certified registered nurse anesthetists are the sole anesthesia providers in almost 100 percent of rural hospitals. In fiscal year 2012, the AEN Traineeship and the NAT supported 5,545 nursing students. 672 Nursing Workforce Diversity (NWD) Grants (Sec. 821) prepare students from dis- advantaged backgrounds to become nurses, producing a more diverse nursing work-force. This outcome will help meet the increasing need for culturally aligned, quality healthcare for the Nation's rapidly diversifying population and help close the gap in health disparities. This program awards grants and contract opportunities to schools of nursing for a variety of clinical training facilities to address nursing edu-cational needs, not only for disadvantaged students, but also or racial and ethnic minorities underrepresented in the nursing profession. In fiscal year 2012, the pro-gram supported 12,077 students. Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention (NEPQR) Grants (Sec. 831) help schools of nursing, academic health centers, nurse-managed health clinics, as well as State and local governments strengthen nursing education programs, thereby in-creasing the size and quality of the nursing workforce. The purposes of the NEPQR grants are broad and flexible, allowing the program to address emerging needs in nursing workforce development. For example, projects have been funded to develop and disseminate collaborative practice models that incorporate the full range of healthcare workers in team-based care are of certain interest. NEPQR supports in-frastructure development to enhance the coordination and capacity building of inter-professional practice and education among health professions across the United States, and particularly in medically underserved areas. For other interests, a number of grant activities have been funded to support sev- eral legislative purposes such as expanding the size of academic programs that are able to confer a baccalaureate degree of science in nursing (BSN); recruiting and educating individuals as qualified personal and home care aides in occupational shortage and/or high demand areas; training qualified nursing assistants and home health aides to meet the growing healthcare needs of the aging population; and/or supporting nurse-managed health clinics that serve as primary care access points in areas where primary care providers are in short supply. NURSE Corps (formerly known as the Nursing Education Loan Repayment and Scholarship Program) (Sec. 846) provides monies to students by paying up to 85 per-cent of a student's loan in return for at least 3 years of service in a designated health shortage area or in an accredited school of nursing. The NURSE Corps Loan Repayment Program (LRP) is a financial incentive program under which individual RNs and advanced practice registered nurses enter into a contractual agreement with the Federal Government to work full-time in a healthcare facility with a crit-ical shortage of nurses, in return for repayment of qualifying nursing educational loans. In fiscal year 2013, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program sup-ported 1,446 nurses working in these facilities. However, given the current climate, the HRSA 2015 Congressional Budget Justification anticipates that they will only be able to support 1,296 in fiscal year 2014. Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) (Sec. 846 A) increases the number of quali- fied nurse faculty by creating a student loan fund within individual schools of nurs-ing. Students agree to teach at a school of nursing in exchange for cancellation of up to 85 percent of their educational loans, plus interest, over a 4-year period. In fiscal year 2012, these grants supported the education of 2,259 future nurse edu-cators. Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP) Grants (Sec. 855) provide support to nursing students specializing in care for the elderly. These grants may be used to educate RNs who will provide direct care to older Americans, develop and disseminate geriatric curriculum, prepare faculty members, and provide continuing education. They may also fund traineeships for individuals who are preparing for advanced education nursing degrees in geriatric nursing, long-term care, gero-psy-chiatric nursing or other nursing areas that specialize in the care of the elderly pop-ulation. In fiscal year 2012, there were 11,600 trainees supported by these grants. Our Nation is faced with a growing healthcare crisis that must be addressed on many fronts. Nurses are an important part of the solution to the crisis of cost, bur-den of disease, and access to quality care. To meet this challenge, funding of proven Federal programs such as Title VIII will help ease the demand for RNs. The Tri- Council respectfully requests your support for $251 million for the Title VIII Nurs-ing Workforce Development Programs in fiscal year 2015. If our organizations can be of assistance, please contact AACN's Director of Government Affairs and Health Policy, Dr. Suzanne Miyamoto, at Smiyamoto@aacn.nche.edu.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE TRUST FOR AMERICA 'SHEALTH Trust for America's Health (TFAH), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedi- cated to saving lives by working to make disease prevention a national priority, is pleased for this opportunity to provide written testimony on the State of public health funding. As this subcommittee works to develop a fiscal year 2015 Labor, Health & Human Services, Education and Related Agencies (LHHS) appropriations bill, I urge you to ensure adequate funding for public health prevention and pre-paredness programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies. After several years of cuts, Congress included a significant increase to CDC in the fiscal year 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, and we thank you for recognizing the importance of public health. Eighty-five percent of the CDC's annual budget flows to your States and districts in the form of grants and contracts to State and local public health departments, and community partners, to conduct critical public health and prevention activities that every American relies on, such as protecting us from infectious disease by combating healthcare-associated infections, delivering immunizations, ensuring preparedness, and conducting nonstop surveillance. The CDC and its grantees across the country are working to help give Americans the information they need to adopt the healthy lifestyles that will reduce the chronic disease burden on our healthcare system. In 2012, we spent roughly 75 percent of our Nation's annual $2.8 trillion healthcare bill on treating preventable chronic dis-eases. Long-term healthcare spending at these levels is unsustainable for our econ-omy and our Federal budget. There is a growing evidence base that demonstrates that the majority of chronic disease is preventable by addressing common risk factors. We have begun to see signs of success, with childhood obesity rates declining in cities and States that were among the first to adopt a comprehensive approach to obesity prevention. We must bring that knowledge to scale, so that Americans across the country have the oppor-tunity to lead healthier lives. We were pleased that last year Congress made impor-tant new investments in community prevention that will help continue our efforts to transform our healthcare system to one that values prevention and wellness, and we urge the Committee to build on those investments in the fiscal year 2015 bill. The recently released Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 2014 County Health Rankings serve as another sobering reminder that an American's zip code is a strong predictor of whether or not they have the opportunity to lead a healthy life. Meeting these twin challenges of protecting the American people from natural and man-made threats and preventing disease can only occur with continued support for CDC. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) From fiscal year 2010 to 2013, the CDC saw its budget authority cut by 18 per- cent. We were pleased that the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations measure provided CDC with an increase of more than $550 million, including $373 million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, resulting in a nearly $175 million in-crease for chronic disease programs. For perspective, however, that increase simply brought CDC funding back to fiscal year 2013 levels. Scarce resources means CDC will be forced to make extremely difficult, sometimes life and death choices. We urge the Committee to maintain adequate CDC funding levels in fiscal year 2015. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) TFAH was pleased to see Congress exercise its authority to allocate the Preven- tion and Public Health Fund in fiscal year 2014, and we urge this committee to do so again in the fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill. To date, the Fund had made investments in every State to support State and local efforts to transform and revi-talize communities, build epidemiology and laboratory capacity to track and respond to disease outbreaks, address healthcare associated infections, train the Nation's 674 public health and health workforce, prevent the spread of HIV, expand access to vaccines, reduce tobacco use, and help control the obesity epidemic. National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) Our Nation's doctors and hospitals are our trusted front line when illness appears, but we must continue to engage not only health systems but sectors such as edu-cation, housing, business and planning to transform communities to make the healthy choice the easy choice and prevent illness in the first place. The Chronic Disease Center has made progress in moving away from the traditional categorical approach to funding disease prevention and toward more coordinated, cross-cutting strategies. While we were disappointed at the premature termination of the Com-munity Transformation Grants program, TFAH appreciates the new investments in community prevention made in fiscal year 2014. We hope the Committee restores funding for the Chronic Disease Center to fiscal year 2010 levels ($1.167 billion), building upon fiscal year 2014 investments in diabetes, heart disease and stroke, the Partnerships to Improve Community Health initiative, the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health program and the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant program. For the block grant, TFAH calls upon the Committee to promote its use to modernize our public health system by supporting health de-partment accreditation and other efforts to ensure the Nation's health departments can deliver foundational public health capabilities to all Americans. National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) Critical programs conducted at the CDC National Center for Environmental Health support our chronic disease prevention and public health preparedness ef-forts. Yet it remains one of the most critically underfunded parts of CDC. We rec-ommended that you fund NCEH at fiscal year 2010 levels ($181.004 million) in fis-cal year 2015 to continue to rebuild the lead control program, grow our National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, and pursue other priorities. Public Health Emergency Preparedness Grants The Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Grants, administered by CDC, is the only Federal program that supports the work of health departments to prepare for all types of disasters, including bioterror attacks, natural disasters, and infectious disease outbreaks. The grants fund nearly 4,000 State and local public health staff positions, and support 15 core capabilities including public health lab-oratory testing, surveillance and epidemiology, community resilience, counter-measures and mitigation, and more. These funds are used for everyday prepared-ness activities, such as monitoring public health threats, and have been integral in expanding to respond to full-scale disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, the fungal meningitis outbreak, and the West Nile Virus outbreak in Texas. TFAH rec-ommends $670 million for the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreements in fiscal year 2015 to help States and localities restore some of the core capabilities lost due to significant cuts to the program. Hospital Preparedness Program The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), administered by the Assistant Sec- retary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), provides funding and technical as-sistance to prepare the health system to respond to and recover from a disaster. The program, which began in response to 9/11, has evolved from one focused on equip-ment and supplies held by individual hospitals in response to a terrorist event, to a system-wide, all-hazards approach. The new HPP is building the capacity of healthcare coalitions\u2014regional collaborations between healthcare organizations, pro-viders, emergency managers, public sector agencies, and other private partners\u2014to meet the disaster healthcare needs of communities. Through the coalition planning process, facilities are learning to leverage resources, such as developing interoper-able communications systems, tracking beds, and writing contracts to share assets. HPP helped a prepared healthcare system save lives during recent events, includ- ing the Boston Marathon bombings and tornadoes in Kentucky and Joplin, MO. HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in fiscal year 10 to $255 mil-lion in fiscal year 2014, including a one third cut in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus. TFAH recommends $300 million for fiscal year 2015 for HPP, an incremental step to rebuild the program. The significant reduction in fiscal year 14 will likely result in fewer staff, fewer coalitions and less of the Nation prepared for disasters. Combatting Prescription Drug Abuse Prescription drug abuse is a growing public health crisis. Overdose deaths involv- ing prescription painkillers have quadrupled since 1999 and now outnumber deaths from all illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine, combined. This is a multi-faceted 675 problem, and the CDC, SAMHSA, NIH and a range of other agencies have a role to play in finding a solution. TFAH recommends a $15.6 million increase to the CDC Injury Center's Injury Prevention Activities line to enable the CDC to work with ad-ditional States with a high burden of prescription drug abuse to help address the main drivers of the epidemic of prescription drug overdoses, and also urge you to provide the funding to ensure that patients with prescription drug addiction have access to the treatment they need to turn their lives around. Conclusion Investing in disease prevention is the most effective, common-sense way to im- prove health and address our long-term deficit. Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year to pay for healthcare services once patients develop an acute illness, injury, or chronic disease. A sustained investment in public health and prevention is essential to reduce high rates of disease and improve health in the United States. [This statement was submitted by Jeffrey Levi, Executive Director, Trust for America's Health.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF REBECCA UNDERWOOD , PARENT /GUARDIAN /ADVOCATE Thank you for this opportunity to provide outside witness testimony for the record to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies. I strongly object to the use of United States De-partment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) appropriations to develop coercive and subversive methods of deinstitutionalization resulting in the eviction of the most vulnerable individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities from DHHS Medicaid licensed and funded facilities including intermediate care facilities for indi-viduals with intellectual disabilities (ICFs/IID). I submit this testimony as a request that Congress prohibit Federal funds be allocated to Federal programs which are currently using their public funds to achieve dangerous public policies of forced de-institutionalization, resulting in the eviction of eligible individuals with severe, pro- found and extreme intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) from their HHS-licensed and funded homes, without regard to individual choice. I am the mother and co-guardian of an adult son, aged 34 who, as the result of brain and pulmonary hemorrhaging occurring during a premature birth, functions at the level of a 4-12 week old infant with chronic and complex medical issues. After providing his 24/7 care in our home for several years, we accepted the reality that our son would benefit from the extended care available in a highly specialized intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Our son has benefitted tremendously from the highly specialized medical services provided in this setting as evidenced by his continued survival beyond any one's expectations. Our parenting decisions, our son's continued residence in his current DHHS fund- ed facility and receipt of the services uniquely suited to meet his extensive and com-plex physical and medical needs, which have proven beneficial for his survival, are under attack. A number of DHHS funded programs are targeting forced displace-ment of our most fragile constituency without regard to individual choice, need and safety. Examples of how government dollars, through DHHS appropriations, are being misused in a cruel and absurd method by DHHS funded programs and policies to affect the downsizing and closure of DHSS licensed and funded facilities include: \u2014Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AIDD) admin- isters programs and grants created under Public Law 106-402, Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act). The DD Act was last reauthorized in 2000. Authorizations for DD Act appropriations expired in 2007; however Congress continues to fund these programs. DD Act programs, including Protection and Advocacy (P&A) and DD Councils, operate in every State. AIDD, now under the umbrella of the Administration for Community Liv-ing within DHHS, administers the DD Act programs. In 2011 AIDD's (f/k/a ADD) proposed recommendations included ''[d]evelop and implement plans to close public and private institutions''. There have been no hearings or recourse for families to address concerns as to the way in which programs, including AIDD, use/misuse Federal funds. DHHS has been unresponsive to complaints from families of persons with severe, profound and extreme forms of develop-mental disabilities about AIDD policies. DHHS has turned a blind eye to the tragic, but predictable, results for many individuals when they are forced from their specialized, Medicaid certified and funded congregate care settings. Inde-pendent oversight of Federal AIDD and DD Act programs is desperately needed. How long will Congress and society continue to ignore the increasing rate of 676 1Audra T. Wenzlow and Debra J. Lipson, ''Transitioning Medicaid Enrollees from Institutions to the Community: Number of People Eligible and Number of Transitions Targeted Under MFP'', Reports from the Field, Number 1, January 2009, Mathematica Policy Research, pg 6, http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/health/MFPfieldrpt1.pdf (accessed 20 March 2014). tragic outcomes due to a misguided ideological agenda of forced deinstitu- tionalization of our most vulnerable citizens from their safe environments? \u2014National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent Federal agency funded through DHHS appropriations. In October 2012 the NCD released a 110 page policy document and an accompanying 201 page ''tool-kit'' to assist opponents of congregate care to accomplish the closure of Medicaid-certified specialized homes of 4 or more beds in which individuals with severe and profound cog-nitive and other developmental disabilities receive supports and services. Fami-lies and guardians of these affected individuals are universally opposed to such closures and are united in their opposition to NCD's misuse of their authority as an independent Federal agency and their Federal funding. NCD has been called upon by these families to reject their stance on forced deinstitutionaliza-tion. The NCD has thus far ignored, and failed to respond to, the request of these most important stakeholders. Despite extensive documentation of wide-spread abuse in community settings, along with a nationwide crisis of under-staffed, underpaid, and poorly trained direct care workers resulting in tragic outcomes, the NCD continues pressing forward with their position that ALL in-dividuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities, even those who experience profound and complex medical, physical and/or behavioral challenges, be forced from their safe homes if that safe home is 4 or more beds. As an ''independent Federal agency charged with advising the President, Congress, and other Fed-eral agencies regarding policies, programs, practices and procedures that affect people with disabilities'' NCD should not be taking any position which tramples on the rights of a portion of the disability community. \u2014DHHS Incentive grants (increase in FMAP funds) to encourage States to move away from providing institutional care. \u2014Money Follows the Person is a Federal ''reward'' for cash strapped States to move away from providing institutional care. Money Follows the Person (MFP) grants provide increased FMAP (Federal Medical Assistance Percent-age) funds to States as a reward for each institutionalized person in the tar-get population who transitions to an eligible non-institutional setting. Money Follows the Person grants ($4 Billion) have been acknowledged to dispropor-tionately target individuals with developmental disabilities for transition. 1 MFP has also been acknowledged as a way for States to transition individuals ''out the back door'' of institutions while ''closing the front door'' to new admis-sions in an effort to close facilities. \u2014Balancing Incentive Program (BIP) is another Federal incentive in the amount of $3 billion to cash strapped States to divert eligible individuals from institutional settings, disregarding choice and need. Combined total of $7 Billion in Federal funds through these Incentive grants, in addition to States' regular Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), to en-courage States to abandon institutional settings. Federal funds should not be uti-lized to favor one service setting over another, particularly as clarified in the Su-preme Court's Olmstead ruling: ''We emphasize that nothing in the ADA or its im-plementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings...Nor is there any Federal re-quirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not de-sire it.'' Olmstead, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 2187 (1999) (majority). It will be a travesty if the Federal Government is successful in pigeon-holing dis- ability policy into a one-size-fits-all, eliminating choice, while continuing to ignore Supreme Court clarifications within Olmstead regarding the care of those with the most severe forms of developmental disabilities. We need an increasing array of via-ble options for services and supports for our most vulnerable, not less. How long will Congress and society continue to ignore the increasing rate of tragic outcomes (abuse, neglect, unnecessary & preventable deaths) of a misguided ideolog-ical agenda of forced deinstitutionalization of our most vulnerable citizens from their safe environments? In conclusion I call upon Congress to prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services' use of appropriations for deinstitutionalization activities that re-sult in the eviction of eligible individuals with intellectual and other developmental disabilities from DHHS licensed and funded facilities. 677 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNITED NEGRO COLLEGE FUND Introduction I am Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, President of Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. Founded in 1881, Spelman College is a global leader in the education of women of African descent and a Historically Black College. Since 2008 Spelman College has averaged a 6-year graduation rate of 77 percent\u2014one of the highest of the 105 His-torically Black Colleges and Universities and substantially above the national aver-age of 59 percent. Spelman College is one of the 37 private Historically Black Colleges and Univer- sities (HBCUs) that are members of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), which I am representing. UNCF is the Nation's largest higher education organization serv-ing students of color, perhaps best known by the iconic motto\u2014''A mind is a terrible thing to waste \u00ae.'' In its 70-year history, UNCF has raised more than $4 billion in scholarship aid to help more than 400,000 students of color attend HBCUs and 900 other colleges and universities across the country to obtain the education they need to excel in the 21st century economy. UNCF's largest scholarship is the Gates Millennium Scholar-ship offered to high-achieving, low-income African American, American Indian/Alas-ka Native, Asian Pacific Islander and Hispanic American students. UNCF has awarded $179 million in Gates Millennium Scholarships to help 3,200 students from the States the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Subcommittee rep-resents earn college degrees. HBCU Value Proposition UNCF's core mission, however, remains its partnership with the Nation's 37 pri- vate HBCUs. The money raised by UNCF has become even more important today as HBCUs have suffered from a ''perfect storm'' of Federal disinvestments since 2011. Limitations on Pell Grant eligibility requirements, sequestration cuts to the Title III HBCU Program and Parent PLUS Loan reductions have resulted in a loss of more than $250 million in Federal support. Despite these challenges, HBCUs pro-vide enormous value for students and the Nation. HBCUs represent approximately 4 percent of all 4-year colleges and universities; enroll 9 percent of all African Amer-ican college students; confer 16 percent of bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans; and generate 27 percent of the STEM bachelor's degrees awarded to Af-rican Americans. Moreover, HBCUs accomplish this while serving students with greater need: more than 70 percent of students who attend HBCUs are low-income students who depend on Federal Pell Grants for their education, a substantially greater share than the 43 percent of students at all other 4-year colleges and uni-versities. At the same time, total cost of attendance at HBCUs is 30 percent lower, on average, than other 4-year institutions. Fiscal year 2014 Appropriations I would like to thank the Subcommittee and, in particular, Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran for playing leadership roles in restoring some of the vital Federal resources to HBCUs and the students we serve in the fiscal year 2014 budg-et. UNCF appreciates you providing a maximum Pell award of $5,730, restoring se-questration cuts to other student aid programs, and restoring two-thirds of the se-questration cuts to the Title III HBCU Program. Fiscal year 2015 Appropriations Priorities Looking to fiscal year 2015, a national strategy to produce more college graduates, boost our economy and enhance global competitiveness must include greater invest-ment in HBCUs. On behalf of the UNCF institutions and all HBCUs, I urge the Subcommittee to support our highest priority programs listed below: \u2014I urge you to appropriate $267 million in discretionary dollars and $85 million in mandatory dollars for the Title III, Part B\u2014Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program. These are formula funds awarded to HBCUs for operational support and essential academic services. Let me note that during the 2007-2012 grant cycle, Spelman College received and expended more than $11 million in Title III funding. Spelman has enhanced its campus infrastructure to include upgrades in technology to facilities, classrooms, labs and centers. Title III assisted with the establishment of the SpelBots (Spelman's Robotic Team) a winning robotics initiative. Additional examples of the achievements that critical Title III funding has supported at Spelman are included as an attachment to my testimony. Please reinvest in this program and restore the $43 million cut from the program since fiscal year 2010. \u2014The HBCU Capital Financing Program finances low-risk Federal loans to help HBCUs, especially private institutions, improve facilities, infrastructure and 678 technology. Investing in capital projects not only enhances the educational envi- ronment for students but also reinvigorates our communities and provides much needed jobs. I urge you to increase the appropriation for loan subsidies to $25 million, which would leverage $390 million in annual loans to meet the infra-structure needs of our institutions. \u2014Without Pell Grants, most HBCU students could not pay for the college edu- cation that is essential in today's economy. I urge you to fund a $5,830 max-imum Pell award to help our students persist and complete college. In addition, I encourage you to reinstate ''summer'' Pell Grants so students can earn their college degrees faster and at a lower cost. \u2014UNCF also strongly supports the President's fiscal year 2015 request of $75 Million for College Success Grants for Minority-Serving Institutions. These com-petitive grants would help Minority-Serving Institutions launch new innova-tions and best practices to improve student outcomes. I urge you to fully fund this important initiative. \u2014I urge you to approve the proposed College Opportunity and Graduation Bo- nuses, which would reward institutions that enroll and graduate large numbers of low-income students. UNCF recommends that this proposal be amended to take into consideration both the numbers and percentages of low-income stu-dents graduating from institutions, given that some HBCUs have smaller en-rollments. \u2014Finally, I urge you to restore the Health Professions Training for Diversity pro- grams to fiscal year 2012 levels and ask that you expand the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities to $283 million to improve diversity in the workforce and research funding for minority populations. Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Moran and members of this Sub- committee\u2014you have the power to increase Federal resources for operating support, student assistance, best practices and innovations so that HBCUs can thrive in years to come. Or, you can adhere to the status quo and allow our institutions to merely survive. UNCF does not accept the status quo. We are accelerating our fundraising efforts, investing in capacity building at our member institutions, building new partnerships and leveraging our resources to enhance educational opportunities for minority stu-dents. In fact, UNCF has updated its motto to recognize education is an investment in better futures for everyone. We believe that, ''A mind is a terrible thing to waste, but a wonderful thing to invest in.'' Please help us invest in our youth, in our HBCUs, and most importantly, in our country so that millions more low-income, mi-nority students can graduate from college and lead our country to heights we have yet to imagine. Thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony. [This statement was submitted by Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, President, Spelman College.] Attachments: \u2014HBCU Coalition fiscal year 2015 Appropriations Priorities \u2014Spelman College Title III Accomplishments ATTACHMENTS HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES $267 Million Discretionary/$85 Million Mandatory for Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program\u2014Title III, Part B, supports critical invest-ments in HBCUs such as student academic services, infrastructure and teacher edu-cation programs needed to enhance educational opportunities for our students. This critical investment helps HBCUs to continue delivering services to our Nation's neediest students. The HBCU Coalition respectfully requests $267 million discre-tionary funding, which would restore this program to its fiscal year 2010 level, and $85 million mandatory funding for fiscal year 2015. $61 Million for Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions Program\u2014 This program provides financial assistance to Historically Black Graduate Institu-tions to establish or strengthen physical buildings and supports graduate students with scholarships and fellowships. This aid allows the next generation of scientists, mathematicians and graduate students to complete professional degrees in under-represented fields of study. The HBCU Coalition requests $61 million funding, which would restore this program to its fiscal year 2010 funding level. $11 Million Discretionary/$15 Million Mandatory for Strengthening Predomi- nantly Black Institutions\u2014This program provides Predominantly Black Institutions 679 with funds to develop and implement programs to educate more low-income, African American college and secondary students. The HBCU Coalition requests $11 million discretionary and $15 million mandatory funding, which would restore this program to its fiscal year 2010 funding level. $25 Million for the HBCU Capital Financing Program and Remove the Loan Guarantee Cap\u2014The HBCU Capital Financing program provides low-cost capital to finance physical improvements on HBCU campuses by guaranteeing and admin-istering loans. In fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014, demand is expected to ex-ceed $800 million. We urge Congress to increase loan subsidies by $5.5 million to $25 million. This increase would support $86 million in new loans to approximately 2\u20148 additional institutions for a total annual loan volume of $390 million. At a minimum, we recommend restoring the loan subsidy to its pre-sequester level of $20.5 million. We support the appropriations language recommended by the Edu-cation Department to remove the $1.1 billion loan guarantee statutory cap. $5,830 for the Pell Grant Maximum Award and Reinstate ''Summer'' Pell Grants\u2014Pell Grants provide low- to moderate- income students with the financial assistance to go to and through college. The HBCU Coalition requests funding for the maximum Pell award at its authorized fiscal year 2015 level (currently esti-mated by OMB to be $5,830). In addition, we request reinstatement of the ''summer'' Pell Grant to allow students to accelerate their paths to graduation and lower their overall college costs. $75 Million for College Success Grants for Minority-Serving Institutions\u2014The President's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes to initiate new College Success Grants for Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) to assist MSIs in developing sustainable strategies to reduce costs and improve student outcomes. Funded activities could in-clude partnering with school districts and schools to provide college recruitment, awareness, and preparation activities; establishing high-quality dual-enrollment programs that allow students to earn college credit while still in high school; pro-viding comprehensive student support services; and reducing the need for remedial education. The HBCU Coalition supports the President's request of $75 million for this program. $647 Million for a College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus Program\u2014Presi- dent Obama's fiscal year 2015 budget proposes a College Opportunity and Gradua-tion Bonus program that will reward colleges that successfully enroll and graduate a significant number of low- and moderate-income students on time. Grants would fund key investments and best practices such as providing need-based financial aid, enhancing academic and student supports and other innovative strategies to im-prove low-income student outcomes. The HBCU Coalition supports the President's request but also encourages Congress to modify the proposal to recognize institu-tions that enroll and graduate significant numbers or percentages of Pell-eligible students, accounting for the many HBCUs that have small enrollments. $50 Million for a National Five Fifths Agenda for America Initiative\u2014To support the Administration's My Brother's Keeper initiative, the HBCU Coalition proposes $50 million for a new program called the Five Fifths Agenda for America to expand educational outcomes for African American males. The objective of this program is to demonstrate how colleges and universities, especially HBCUs, and K-12 schools can forge partnerships to help African-American males prepare for, get to and through college by implementing research-based best practices. $250 Million Authorization for a HBCU Innovation Fund\u2014To support the Admin- istration's efforts to drive change in higher education policies and practices that im-proves college access, affordability, completion and quality, the HBCU Coalition pro-poses that additional financial resources be provided to HBCUs through an Innova-tion initiative under the Higher Education Act. An Innovation Fund would incentivize HBCUs to address performance goals in certain categories, such as stu-dent retention and completion, STEM, use of technology and new educational deliv-ery methods that can speed time to degree and lower costs. All public and private HBCUs, or consortia of these HBCUs, other institutions and nonprofit organiza-tions, would be eligible to receive planning and implementation grants. SPELMAN COLLEGE HIGHLIGHTS : TITLE III , PART B , SEC. 323\u2014STRENGTHENING HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES PROGRAM Spelman College is the oldest historically black college for women. Located in At- lanta, Georgia, Spelman was founded in 1881 as the Atlanta Baptist Female Semi-nary. The College maintains a student population of approximately 2,000 from 45 680 U.S. States and 13 countries, and since 2008 has had an average 6-year graduation rate of 77 percent. Title III\u2014Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities funding plays a critical role in obtaining resources that provide students and faculty with unparalleled opportunities for educational enrichment and advancement. In the 2007-2012 grant cycle, Spelman College expended more than $11 million in Title III funds. Those resources were expended on a number or projects with wide-rang-ing effects on student life, faculty engagement, and facility improvement. \u2014Title III funding supports and enhances institutional efforts in four critical areas: Academic Quality, Student Services Outcomes, Institutional Management and Fiscal Stability. Our advancements in these key areas are reflected in key indicators related to enrollment, retention, graduation and fiscal stability. \u2014Title III funding undergirds 100 percent of the Foundational Priorities of the College's Strategic Plan, enhancing academic rigor in new student orientation, freshman-year and sophomore-year experiences. \u2014The College's retention rate is 90 percent. The average 5-year (2007-2011) sec- ond-year retention rate is 87 percent. Title III funds continue to assist the insti-tution with providing supportive programs that ensure Spelman's first and sec-ond year students successfully progress to junior status. \u2014The College's 6-year graduation rate has ranged from a high of 83 percent to a low of 73 percent.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNITED TRIBES TECHNICAL COLLEGE For 45 years, United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) has provided postsecondary career and technical education, job training and family services to some of the most impoverished, high risk Indian students from throughout the Nation. We are gov-erned by the five tribes located wholly or in part in North Dakota. We are not part of the North Dakota State college system and do not have a tax base or State-appro-priated funds on which to rely. We have consistently had excellent retention and placement rates and are a fully accredited institution. Section 117 Carl Perkins Act funds represent a significant portion of our operating budget and provides for our core instructional programs. The request of the UTTC Board for fiscal year 2015 is: \u2014$10 million for base funding authorized under Section 117 of the Carl Perkins Act for the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions program (20 U.S.C. Section 2327). This is $2.3 million above the fiscal year 2014 level and the fiscal year 2013 post-sequestration level. These funds are awarded competitively and distributed via formula. We are seeking a change to the formula which is not so reliant on Indian Student Count in order to avoid dramatic swings in annual awards. \u2014Forward Funding. We ask that the Section 117 Perkins funds, like the other funds under the Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, be put on a forward funded basis. \u2014$30 million as requested by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium for Title III-A (Section 316) of the Higher Education Act, $5 million above the fiscal year 2014 level. \u2014Maintain Pell Grants at the $5,830 maximum award level. We are disappointed that the fiscal year 2014 Appropriations Act did not restore the fiscal year 2013 Section 117 sequestration even though funding for the overall Perkins Act was restored. Perhaps Section 117 was overlooked as a source of job training as it is in the Higher Education portion of the budget. We all realize the urgent need to better prepare a workforce to meet industry and other emerging needs. We are part of that undertaking, but need more resources to come closer to our potential. We don't know if Congress will reauthorize the Carl Perkins Act this session, but point out that the Administration's Blueprint for Perkins reauthorization specifically states support for the Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Edu-cation program and includes some national recommendations that UTTC is already implementing including: \u2014Training that is industry certified and provision of postsecondary certificates and degrees. \u2014Alignment with labor market needs\u2014the ramifications of the North Dakota Bakken oil boom are seen throughout the State. We saw the need for more cer-tified welders in relation to the oil boom and so expanded our certified welding program for these good- paying, in-demand jobs. Similarly, our online medical transcription program was designed to meet the growing need for certified med-682 ical support staff. Other courses reflect new emphasis on energy auditing and GIS Technology. \u2014Articulation agreements between UTTC and junior and senior high schools. \u2014A broad range of services for our students to help ensure their success. Additional Information about UTTC. We have: \u2014Renewed unrestricted accreditation from the North Central Association of Col- leges and Schools for July 2011 through 2021, with authority to offer all of our full programs on-line. We have 26 Associate, 20 Certificate and three Bachelor degree programs. \u2014Services including a Child Development Center, family literacy program, wellness center, area transportation, K-8 elementary school, tutoring, coun-seling and housing. \u2014A semester retention rate of 85 percent and a graduate placement rate of 77 percent. Over 45 percent of our graduates move on to 4-year or advanced degree institutions. \u2014Students from 75-88 tribes; 85 percent of our undergraduate students receive Pell Grants. \u2014An unduplicated count of undergraduate degree-seeking students and con- tinuing education students of 1391. \u2014A critical role in the regional economy. Our presence brings at least $34 million annually to the economy of the Bismarck region. A 2005 study showed a pro- jected return on Federal investment of 20-1. \u2014We have recently opened a distance learning center in Rapid City, SD, where there are some 16,000 American Indians in the area. We are also working to-ward the establishment of an American Indian Specialized Health Care Train-ing Clinic. Section 117 Perkins Base Funding. Funds are needed to: 1) maintain 100-year- old education buildings and 50-year-old housing stock for students; 2) upgrade tech-nology capabilities; 3) provide adequate salaries for faculty and staff who are in the bottom quartile of salary for comparable positions elsewhere; and 4) fund program and curriculum improvements. Perkins funds are central to the viability of our core postsecondary education pro- grams. Very little of the other funds we receive may be used for core career and technical educational programs; they are competitive, often one-time targeted sup-plemental funds. Our Perkins funding provides a base level of support while allow-ing the college to compete for desperately needed discretionary funds. Forward Funding. We ask that the Appropriations Committees provide one-time funding for Section 117 Perkins to put it on a forward funded basis. We do not know why it is not already forward funded, given that the rest of the Perkins is forward funded. A number of years ago Section 117 was moved to the Higher Education por-tion of the budget even though it is authorized through the Perkins Act. Perhaps that has something to do with it, although we point out that many education pro-grams are forward funded. Forward funding provides for vital education programs before the start of each school year, which is critically important when appropria-tions are delayed and the Government is funded via Continuing Resolutions. Title III-A (Section 316) Strengthening Institutions. Among the Title III-A statu- torily allowable uses is facility construction and maintenance. We are constantly in need of additional student housing, including family housing. With the completion of a Science, Math and Technology building on our South Campus on land acquired with a private grant, we urgently need housing for up to 150 students, many of whom have families. While we have constructed three housing facilities using a variety of sources in the past 20 years, approximately 50 percent of students are housed in the 100-year- old buildings of what was Fort Abraham Lincoln, as well as housing that was do-nated by the Federal Government along with the land and Fort buildings in 1973. These buildings require major rehabilitation. New buildings are actually cheaper than rehabilitating the old buildings that now house students. Pell Grants. We support maintaining the Pell Grant maximum to at least a level of $5,830. This resource makes all the difference in whether most of our students can attend college. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report. As you know, in March 2011 the GAO issued two reports regarding Federal programs which may have similar or overlapping services or objectives (GAO-11-318SP of March 1 and GAO-11-474R of March 18). Funding from the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) and the Perkins Act for Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions were among the programs listed in the supplemental report of March 18, 2011. The GAO did not recommend defunding these or other programs; in some cases consolidation 683 1Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Lou- isiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mex-ico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Ten-nessee, Utah, Vermont, Virgin Islands, West Virginia, and Wyoming or better coordination of programs was recommended to save administrative costs. We are not in disagreement about possible consolidation or coordination of the ad- ministration of these funding sources so long as funds are not reduced. Perkins funds supplement, but do not duplicate, our BIE funds. It takes both sources of funding to frugally maintain the institution. Even these combined sources do not provide the resources necessary to operate and maintain the college and we actively seeks alternative funding to assist with curricula, deferred maintenance, and scholarship assistance. The need for postsecondary career and technical edu-cation in Indian Country is so great and the funding so small, that there is little chance for duplicative funding. There are only two institutions targeting American Indian/Alaska Native career and technical education at the postsecondary level\u2014 UTTC and Navajo Technical University. Combined, these institutions received less than $15 million in fiscal year 2014 Federal operational funds ($7.7 million from Perkins; $7 million from BIE), a very modest amount for two campus-based institu-tions which offer a wide and expanding array of training opportunities. *** UTTC offers services catered to the needs of our students, many of whom are first generation college attendees and many of whom come to us needing remedial edu-cation and services. Although BIE and Section 117 Perkins funds do not pay for re-medial education, we make this investment through other sources to ensure our stu-dents succeed at the postsecondary level. Thank you for your consideration of our requests. [This statement was submitted by David M. Gipp, Chancellor, United Tribes Technical College.] PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee; thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement regarding fiscal year 2015 funding for the National Insti-tutes of Health's Institutional Development Award or ''IDeA'' Program. The IDeA program is funded by NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and was authorized by the 1993 NIH Revitalization Act (Public Law 103- 43). I submit this testimony on behalf of the Coalition of EPSCoR/IDeA States, 1the Kansas IDeA program, and the University of Kansas Medical Center. The Coalition of EPSCoR/IDeA States respectfully requests that the Subcommittee provide $310 million for the IDeA program in fiscal year 2015. I would first like to provide some basic information about the IDeA program. The IDeA program increases our Nation's biomedical research capability by improving research in States that have historically been less successful in obtaining biomedical research funds. Twenty-three States and Puerto Rico are eligible. The program funds only merit-based, peer-reviewed research that meets NIH's biomedical re-search objectives. While IDeA was authorized by the 1993 NIH Revitalization Act (Public Law 103-43), sizable increases in funding only began in fiscal year 2000. The IDeA program then grew rapidly, due in large part to the thoughtful actions of this Subcommittee. This initial funding permitted the launch of two program ele-ments: the COBRE and BRIN/INBRE programs. The first was the COBRE program or ''Centers of Biomedical Research Excel- lence,'' which are research clusters targeting specific biomedical research problems. The second IDeA program was BRIN or ''Biomedical Research Infrastructure Net-works,'' which targeted key areas such as bioinformatics and genomics, and facili-tated the development of cooperative networks between research-intensive univer-sities and primarily undergraduate colleges. The BRIN grants underwent competi-tive renewals in 2004 and were funded under the new name of ''IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence,'' or INBRE. The COBRE program is designed to increase the pool of well-trained investigators in the IDeA States by expanding research facilities, equipping laboratories with the latest research equipment, providing mentoring for promising candidates, and devel-oping research faculty through support of a targeted multi-disciplinary center, led by an established, senior investigator with expertise in the research focus area of the center. 684 The INBRE program is designed to increase the pipeline of outstanding students and enhances the quality of science faculty in the IDeA States by research-intensive networking with undergraduate institutions. The INBRE program supports research infrastructure and mentoring of young investigators, and prepares students for graduate and professional schools as well as careers in the biomedical sciences at participating institutions. As you can see, these two programs play complementary roles in developing research capability and human capital in biomedical fields in the IDeA States. Impact of the IDeA Program on Kansas Since the year 2000, Kansas has received more than $190 million in awards from the IDeA program. Those IDeA investments have enabled our investigators to se-cure National Institutes of Health grants and more than double the amount of fund-ing coming into Kansas. The IDeA program has resulted in funding of 570 bio-medical research grants, supported 71 core biomedical research core facilities, and has resulted in 1,152 new research related jobs. The Kansas INBRE (K-INBRE) program consists of three research-intensive uni- versities and seven primarily undergraduate universities. Over its 13-year history, the K-INBRE has provided significant benefits to the State of Kansas, including training a skilled workforce and helping to drive scientific commercialization poten-tial. Over $45.1 million from the NIH, numerous Kansas Universities, as well as philanthropies and industry support to the K-INBRE has benefitted Kansas Univer- sities by significantly aiding Kansas's faculty to increase NIH funding from $50.3M (2000) to $82.8M (2013). The K-INBRE has significantly improved in the dissemina-tion of knowledge throughout Kansas via videoconferencing, symposia and increased intra- and inter-State collaborations. The K-INBRE has been successful in establishing the first bioinformatics facility in Kansas (three campus cores) and been instrumental in preparing for new ad-vances in increased medical informatics and translational research. The K-INBRE has also assisted with building the Kansas biomedical science industry by facili-tating industry collaborations. This is critical, as the growth of the Kansas bio-science sector is climbing at more than twice the national rate. Finally, the K-INBRE has contributed to building a skilled workforce for Kansas by assisting with the building of the biomedical workforce in Kansas by supporting research training for over 800 undergraduates, numerous post-docs and new faculty investigators. Importantly, the K-INBRE has helped broaden student research par-ticipation of under-represented groups (rural and ethnic). In 2013 alone, approxi-mately 160 graduate and undergraduate students throughout the State of Kansas were supported by K-INBRE funds. More importantly, these funds have broadened research participation by under-represented rural and ethnic groups, and NIH-level research infrastructure has been initiated in seven of ten campuses within the K- INBRE network. Overall, the implementation of the K-INBRE program facilitates the generation of new strengths in Cell and Developmental Biology in the State of Kansas, and ul-timately contributes importantly to the development of new tools and strategies for improving human health. Kansas researchers are currently involved in six active COBRE awards. Three of these COBREs are located at University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. The Molecular Regulation of Cell Development and Differentiation COBRE has es-tablished a thriving multidisciplinary research group focused on the molecular regu-lation of cell development. This COBRE has been highly successful in helping young faculty obtain NIH funding. The purpose of the Nuclear Receptors in Liver Health and Disease COBRE has been to establish a recognized center to study liver func-tion in health and disease. This COBRE has also been very successful at aiding young faculty in obtaining NIH funding. Importantly, it has also created a valuable ''liver bank'' from many strains of inbred mice. The objective of the Novel Ap-proaches for Control of Microbial Pathogens COBRE is to promote and enhance the research capabilities of tenure track junior faculty members of participating institu-tions in the State of Kansas with an emphasis on inhibiting microbial pathogens. This COBRE has been critical in enabling Kansas faculty to obtain $52 million in NIH funding and has established a highly utilized flow cytometry core facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center The remaining three COBRE programs reside in Lawrence, Kansas at the Univer- sity of Kansas. The Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Protein Structure and Function conducts important basic research in health-related protein structure and function. By better understanding the structure, function, and interaction of proteins present in human cells, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of how proteins carry out critical functions within cells. This COBRE has helped 13 685 faculty establish independent NIH funding and two faculty supported by this COBRE have gone on to receive national recognition for their research. The Center for Molecular Analysis of Disease Pathways (CMADP) COBRE brings together junior and senior faculty from the physical, biological, and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Kansas and other academic institutions in Kansas to conduct multidisciplinary research to develop and implement cutting-edge tech-nologies for elucidating the genetic, chemical, and physical mechanisms of biological processes involved in disease. This COBRE has established a much needed Genome Sequence Core that provides state of the art sequencing capabilities for researchers in Kansas. Finally, the Center for Cancer Experimental Therapeutics (CCET) COBRE brings together researchers from the University of Kansas Lawrence campus, Kansas State University and the University of Kansas Medical Center. The Center combines the resources and faculty of Kansas' institutions to create the infrastructure needed to pursue cancer-related research and experimentation at the interface between chem-istry and biology. This is the oldest of the COBRE programs in Kansas and the CCET works to identify novel bioactive compounds that will be useful basic bio-medical research tools and potential therapeutic agents. Scientists from the partici-pating schools fight cancer through research projects focusing on specific types of cancer and the discovery of new anti-cancer drugs and therapies. This COBRE has established two important research cores associated with medicinal chemistry and high throughput screening, two key services that are important for drug discovery. The CCET was also instrumental in establishing a National Cancer Institute Des-ignated Cancer Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center in 2012. Conclusion Despite these successes, our task is far from complete. Funding disparities be- tween the States remain and may have a detrimental impact on our national self- interest. Together, the 23 States and Puerto Rico that comprise the IDeA commu-nity secured just 5 percent of the total NIH budget in fiscal year 2011. With over 22 percent of the Nation's population living in the EPSCoR/IDeA States, this figure clearly indicates the critical need for further research development and the impor-tance of a strong IDeA program. In fiscal year 1999, the year before COBRE grants were initiated, the 23 IDeA States and Puerto Rico received a total of $596 million from NIH. In fiscal year 2013 total NIH funding to the IDeA community has risen to $1.5 billion. This is evidence that the program is working and that the IDeA States are moving in the right direction. To put the value of the IDeA investment into perspective, the overall fiscal year 2014 IDeA budget, $273.325 million, for 23 States and Puerto Rico, pales in comparison to the $606.8 million in NIH funding that one institution in one single non-IDeA State received in fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2012, the top seven States with NIH funding received over a $1 billion each, and California alone received over $3.5 billion. We request that this committee recommend the program to be funded in fiscal year 2015 at $310 million. As you know, the EPSCoR/IDeA Coalition has main-tained that IDeA program should constitute at least 1 percent of the total NIH budget. This level of funding would restore and continue funding for COBRE and INBRE, provide funding for the IDeA Program Infrastructure for Clinical and Translational Research (IDeA-CTR) program, and provide co-funding which would allow researchers and institutions to merge with the overall national biomedical re-search community. On behalf of the University of Kansas Medical Center, I express gratitude to this Subcommittee for the efforts it has made over the years to provide increased fund-ing for IDeA, in particular this committee's work to ensure the successful inclusion of a $50 million increase for the program in fiscal year 2012. I hope that you will continue to invest in this biomedical research program, which is so important to al-most half of the States in the Union. Every region of the country has talent and expertise to contribute to our Nation's biomedical research efforts\u2014and every region of the country must participate if we are to increase our Nation's biomedical re-search capacity substantially. On behalf of the EPSCoR/IDeA Coalition, the Univer-sity of Kansas Medical Center and our partner institutions across Kansas, I thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to submit this testimony. [This statement was submitted by Douglas Wright, Ph.D., Professor and Vice Chair Principal Investigator, Kansas INBRE, Department of Anatomy and Cell Biol-ogy, University of Kansas Medical Center.] 686 PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA AND NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY On behalf of the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University, thank you for the opportunity to submit our written testimony regarding the fiscal year 2015 funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutional Develop-ment Award (IDeA) program. We respectfully request your support of no less than $310.0 million for this critically important program. We further request that the Subcommittee gives serious consideration to legislative language which would direct that future NIH budgets include funding for the IDeA program that reaches no less than 1 percent of the total NIH budget. IDeA was authorized by the 1993 NIH Revi-talization Act (Public Law 103-43) and funds only merit-based, peer reviewed re- search that meets NIH research objectives in the 23 IDeA States and Puerto Rico. The States eligible for IDeA funding are defined as ''all States/commonwealths with a success rate for obtaining NIH grant awards of less than 20 percent over the period of 2001-2005 or received less than an average of $120 million per year during that time period.'' Currently this includes 23 States and Puerto Rico\u2014nearly half of the States. Funding from this critical capacity-building program has been a key part of the growth in research capacity and impact at the two North Dakota research universities in recent years. Funding for the IDeA program in fiscal year 2014 was $273.325 million. The total budget for NIH in fiscal year 2014 was $30.2 billion; thus in fiscal year 2014, the IDeA program\u2014funding competitively awarded biomedical research in nearly half the Nation\u2014comprised only 0.89 percent of the entire NIH budget. The IDeA pro-gram exists because the 23 eligible States overall receive less than 20 percent of NIH's extramural funding. The President's proposed fiscal year 2015 budget request of $30.4 billion represents only a 0.7 percent increase to the NIH, and the proposed increase of $31 million for the entire National Institute for General Medical Sciences, which houses the IDeA program is even less, only 0.3 percent. The Presi-dent's proposed fiscal year 2015 budget request does not include a recommended in-crease for the IDeA program. The IDeA program is designed to aid small, rural States; it is small in the overall scheme of things at NIH, but huge for the States that compete for these funds. Our requested funding level of $310.0 million rep-resents only 1 percent of the President's total fiscal year 2015 budget request for NIH. Our State, North Dakota, has benefited immensely from the competitive funding available through the IDeA program in the form of COBRE (Center for Biomedical Research Excellence) and INBRE (IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excel-lence) grants. At the University of North Dakota, we have been awarded funding for three phases of a COBRE grant supporting research on neurodegenerative diseases. North Dakota has one of the largest populations of the extremely old in the Nation (second only to Rhode Island in the percentage of its citizens over 85 years of age), and high rates of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. As an example of the impact of this funding and the research capacity it has built, externally funded research at the University of North Dakota's School of Medicine and Health Sciences has grown substantially. Prior to COBRE funding, in fiscal year 2002, the SMHS received about $12.0 million in external funding; by fis-cal year 2013, this had increased to $27.1 million, an increase of 126 percent. In 2010, when UND developed a new strategic plan for research, neuroscience was identified as an existing strength on which to build further. Thus, the neurobiology COBRE grant is achieving its intended purpose of expand- ing our research capacity and our ability to compete for Federal funding. That re-search is directed at problems of direct interest not only to our citizenry, but also to the rest of the United States. The University of North Dakota has also received an additional COBRE grant on the topic of epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study of how environmental factors influ-ence the expression of our genes; in many cases these changes in gene expression can then be inherited by the next generation. This $12.0 million grant was awarded early in fiscal year 2014, and will serve to carry out research on environmental fac-tors that affect disease resistance while developing critical research capacity in the State. At North Dakota State University, the Center for Protease Research, a COBRE supported center, provides fundamental information on how proteases, key biological players, impact several diseases, including cancer, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and asthma. These studies have the potential to provide novel therapeutics that can treat these deadly and debilitating diseases. The multidisciplinary program has established two central Core Facilities in biology and synthesis that have had 687 a significant impact on research programs in the university and throughout North Dakota. The $24.0 million Center has initiated several outreach activities such as workshops for North Dakota University System faculty and students and a summer research program for undergraduates. The Center for Visual and Cognitive Neuroscience established in 2004 at North Dakota State University is devoted to increasing our understanding of the ways that information is perceived and processed by the brain. Center investigators are in-volved in the study of visual and cognitive processing. Core laboratory infrastructure has been developed allowing faculty and students to fruitfully explore the relation-ships between the nervous system and the behavior that it governs. Another critically important IDeA program is INBRE, which provides funding to build the biomedical workforce through activities ranging from outreach to elemen-tary school children to creating opportunities for undergraduates to engage in re-search. This program has provided support for undergraduate students at 2- and 4- year colleges in North Dakota to participate in research during the summer at their home institutions. This program includes two tribal colleges and serves between 70 and 100 students each year. Another program at the University of North Dakota serves about 60 undergraduates per year and applications routinely exceed the num-ber of slots that are available. These programs are critical for keeping students in the pipeline for the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) workforce. Studies have repeatedly shown that engaging undergraduates in original research is a powerful tool for retaining students in college so that they graduate in a timely way. A major emphasis has been on outreach programs to Native American students, the minority group that is most under-represented in the fields of science, engineer-ing, and math. Between 25 and 35 Native American students in grades 7-12 partici-pate each year in a program that uses traditional Native American tools to teach science. As many as 40 students from tribal colleges are funded each year to visit UND and learn about opportunities to transfer to the university and complete their 4-year degrees. INBRE provides support for transfer students from tribal colleges through the Pathway program, a 6-week summer program that prepares partici-pants for advanced coursework in science. Pathway students can also receive tuition waivers from the university. INBRE funding is also provided to support the Amer-ican Indian Health Research Forum on the UND campus each year; this forum at-tracts attendees from across the Nation. North Dakota, with an estimated 2013 population of 723,393, is the smallest of all the IDeA States. Yet, our School of Medicine and Health Sciences graduates a disproportionately large number of primary care physicians who practice in rural areas, and 20 percent of all Native American physicians in the U.S. are graduates of the University of North Dakota. The School recently was recognized by the Amer-ican Academy of Family Physicians for having the largest percentage of its grad-uates enter the field of family medicine of all medical schools in the United States. The medical school clearly is making important contributions to healthcare for un-derserved populations. Like all medical schools, it must have a healthy research pro-gram underpinning its training of physicians, and funding from the IDeA program is critical to the health of that program and to building research capacity for the future. The IDeA States produce STEM graduates at the same per capita rate as States with larger populations and larger research portfolios. The students from IDeA States need and deserve the same exposure to research as students in larger States. If fiscal year 2015 funding levels for the IDeA program are not at least maintained at the current level, and preferably increased to $310.0 million, North Dakota and other small, mostly rural States, will receive a major setback in their efforts to in-crease their capacity to undertake biomedical research and to train the next genera-tion of scientists who are critical for the health of our Nation and our economy. The IDeA program is absolutely critical not only for North Dakota's two research universities, but also for the biomedical research capacity and capability of research institutions nationwide. We sincerely appreciate the Subcommittee's ongoing sup-port of the IDeA program and request that you give full consideration to our rec-ommendations and fiscal year 2015 request of no less than $310.0 million for the National Institutes of Health IDeA program. We further request that the Sub-committee considers legislative language directing that future NIH budgets include funding for the IDeA program that reaches no less than 1 percent of the total NIH budget. 688 PREPARED STATEMENT OF US H EREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA ASSOCIATION SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR 2015 RECOMMENDATIONS \u2014$32 Billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at an increase of $1 bil- lion over fiscal year 2014. \u2014Continued focus on Hereditary Angioedema Research and Education at NIH \u2014Funding to create and support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) to Increase Awareness Efforts for Hereditary Angioedema at CDC Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the US Hereditary Angioedema Association (US HAEA) regarding the importance of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) public awareness activities and research. The US HAEA is a non-profit patient advocacy organization founded in 1999 to help those suffering with HAE and their families to live healthy lives. The Associa-tion's goals were, and remain, to provide patient support, advance HAE research and find a cure. The US HAEA provides patient services that include referrals to HAE knowledgeable healthcare providers, disease information and peer-to-peer sup-port. US HAEA also provides research funding to scientific investigators to increase the HAE knowledge base and maintains an HAE patient registry to support ground- breaking research efforts. Additionally, US HAEA provides disease information ma-terials and hosts forums to educate patients and their families, healthcare pro-viders, and the general public on HAE. HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening inherited disease with symptoms of severe, recurring, debilitating attacks of edema (swelling). HAE patients have a defect in the gene that controls a blood protein called C1-inhibitor, so it is also more specifically referred to as C1-inhibitor deficiency. This genetic defect results in pro-duction of either inadequate or nonfunctioning C1-inhibitor protein. Because the de-fective C1-inhibitor does not adequately perform its regulatory function, a bio-chemical imbalance can occur and produce an unwanted peptide\u2014called bradykinin\u2014that induces the capillaries to release fluids into surrounding tissues, thereby causing swelling. People with HAE experience attacks of severe swelling that affect various body parts including the hands, feet, face, airway (throat) and intestinal wall. Swelling of the throat is the most life-threatening aspect of HAE, because the airway can close and cause death by suffocation. Studies reveal that more than 50 percent of patients will experience at least one throat attack in their lifetime. HAE swelling is disfiguring, extremely painful and debilitating. Attacks of abdom- inal swelling involve severe and excruciating pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Because abdominal attacks mimic a surgical emergency, approximately one third of patients with undiagnosed HAE undergo unnecessary surgery. Untreated, an average HAE attack lasts between 24 and 72 hours, but some attacks may last longer and be ac-companied by prolonged fatigue. The majority of HAE patients experience their first attack during childhood or adolescence. Most attacks occur spontaneously with no apparent reason, but anx-iety, stress, minor trauma, medical, surgical, and dental procedures, and illnesses such as colds and flu have been cited as common triggers. ACE Inhibitors (a blood pressure control medication) and estrogen-derived medications (birth control pills and hormone replacement drugs) have also been shown to exacerbate HAE attacks. HAE's genetic defect can be passed on in families. A child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease from a parent with HAE. However, the absence of family history does not rule out the HAE diagnosis; scientists report that as many as 25 percent of HAE cases today result from patients who had a spontaneous mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene at conception. These patients can also pass the defective gene to their offspring. Worldwide, it is estimated that this condition affects be-tween 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 30,000 people. PUBLIC AWARENESS AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION HAE patients often suffer for many years and may be subject to unnecessary med- ical procedures and surgery prior to receiving an accurate diagnosis. Raising aware-ness about HAE among healthcare providers and the general public will help reduce delays in diagnosis and limit the amount of time that patients must spend without treatment for a condition that could, at any moment, end their lives. Once diagnosed, many individuals are able to piece together a family history of mysterious deaths and episodes of swelling that previously had no name. In some families, over many years, this condition has come to be accepted as something that must simply be endured. Increased public awareness is crucial so that these pa-689 tients understand that HAE often requires emergency treatment and disabling at- tacks no longer need to be passively accepted. While HAE cannot yet be cured, intel-ligent use of available treatments can help patients lead a productive life. In order to prevent deaths, eliminate unnecessary surgeries, and improve pa- tients' quality of life, it is critical that CDC pursue programs to educate the public and medical professionals about HAE in fiscal year 2015. RESEARCH THROUGH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH In years past, HAE research was conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Na-tional Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Center for Research Resources, and the National Institute on Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. However, NIH has not engaged in HAE-specific re-search since 2009, and there is no longer any Federal research as it relates to HAE. As it may provide greater opportunities for HAE research, we applaud the recent establishment of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at NIH. Housing translational research activities at a single Center at NIH will allow these programs to achieve new levels of success. Initiatives like the Cures Ac-celeration Network are critical to overhauling the translational research process and overcoming the challenges that plague treatment development. In addition, new ef-forts like taking the lead on drug repurposing have the potential to speed access to new treatments, particularly to patients who struggle with rare or neglected dis-eases. As a rare disease community, HAE patients may also benefit from the Thera-peutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program, housed at NCATS, as well coordination with the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR). We ask that you support NCATS and provide adequate resources for the Center in fiscal year 2014. In order to reinvigorate HAE research at NIH, it is vital that NIH receive in- creased support in fiscal year 2015. US HAEA recommends an overall funding level of $32 billion for NIH in fiscal year 2015 and the inclusion of recommendations em-phasizing the importance of HAE research to learn more about this rare disease and new pathways for appropriate treatment. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the HAE community.

Introduction VOR is a national organization that advocates for high quality care and human rights for all people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). VOR calls on the U.S. Senate to prohibit the use of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) appropriations in support of deinstitutionalization activities which evict eligible individuals with I/DD from their HHS-licensed and funded Med-icaid homes, in violation of Federal law. Deinstitutionalization activities, including advocacy, lobbying, class action law- suits, and other tactics by some HHS-funded agencies (discussed below) resulting in the downsizing and closure of HHS-licensed homes are a cruel and absurd use of Federal funding. These closures often lead to human tragedy. Medicaid-licensed facility homes, including Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellec-tual Disabilities (ICFs/IID) and other specialized nursing facilities, are uniquely suited to meet the residents' profound support, healthcare and behavioral needs. Tragedies are widespread and predictable when fragile citizens are removed from specialized care. The legally-protected rights of families and legal guardians to serve as primary decision-makers are routinely ignored. II. Using HHS Funds to Eliminate HHS-Supported Homes: The Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AIDD) and its State-based Develop-mental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act) Programs It has been 14 years since Congress last reauthorized the DD Act. Authorizations for DD Act appropriations expired in 2007; however, Congress continues to fund these programs. DD Act programs, including Protection & Advocacy (P&A), DD Councils, and University Programs, operate in every State. AIDD, within HHS, ad-ministers the DD Act programs. 690 1See, VOR Federal Comments Urging Objective Performance\u2014Not More Self-Reporting\u2014of DD Act Programs (January 25, 2012) (vor.net/images/VORCommentDDActEvaluation Jan2012.pdf). 2June 14, 2010 and July 30, 2007 letters to Congress referring to families as ''unaware'' and ''clueless,'' respectively. Independent oversight of Federal AIDD and DD Act programs is nearly non-exist- ent.1DD Act programs are using their public funds to achieve dangerous deinstitu- tionalization, evicting vulnerable people with I/DD from Medicaid-certified homes, disregarding individual choice and the legal right to appropriate services, as re-quired by the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) (as interpreted by the Olmstead decision) and Medicaid law, both discussed below. The DD Act programs' own authorizing statute supports residential choice and recognizes that individuals and their families are in the best position to make care decisions: ''Individuals with developmental disabilities and their families are the pri- mary decisionmakers regarding the services and supports such individuals and their families receive, including regarding choosing where the individuals live from available options, and play decisionmaking roles in policies and programs that affect the lives of such individuals and their families.'' DD Act, 42 U.S.C. 15001(c)(3)(2000); see also, H. Rep. 103-442 (March 21, 1994) (''[T]he goals ex-pressed in this Act to promote the greatest possible integration and independ-ence for some individuals with developmental disabilities may not be read as a Federal policy supporting the closure of residential institutions''). Yet, AIDD persists in its support for DD Act programs' deinstitutionalization ac- tivities and even proposed a recommendation to ''[d]evelop and implement plans to close public and private institutions,'' and ''[k]eep people with disabilities out of con-gregate institutions,'' in collaboration with DOJ and The Arc (2011). Hundreds of families and others objected; the recommendation has not yet been finalized. Like-wise, the national organizations for the three DD Act programs have referred to families who select HHS-licensed homes (ICFs/IID) as ''clueless'' and ''unaware,'' 2a view not shared by the Supreme Court (see, Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 329 (1993) (''. . . close relatives and guardians, both of whom likely have intimate knowledge of a mentally retarded person's abilities and experiences, have valuable insights which should be considered during the involuntary commitment process.'')). With AIDD directive, State-level DD Act program deinstitutionalization activities continue, exacting great harm on the very people Congress entrusted these HHS- entities to protect. Since 1996, more than fifteen (15) P&A class action lawsuits for closure (not relating to conditions of care) and other deinstitutionalization tactics have been pursued over the objection of residents and their families. The P&A class action lawsuits are a particularly egregious use of Federal funds; they equate HHS suing itself because the targets of these HHS-funded lawsuits are HHS/Medicaid- licensed ICFs/IID. AIDD and its State-based programs persist in their ideological devotion to commu- nity placement despite reports of 1,200 ''unnatural and unknown'' deaths in New York, a risk of mortality in community settings of up to 88 percent in California, more than 100 deaths in Connecticut, 53 deaths in Illinois, 114 deaths in the Dis-trict of Columbia, plus many more reports of abuse, neglect and death across the majority of all States (see e.g, Widespread Abuse, Neglect and Death in Small Set-tings Serving People with Intellectual Disabilities (VOR, 2014)). III. Using HHS Funds to Eliminate HHS-Supported Homes: National Council on Disability The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an HHS-funded, independent Federal agency that advises the President, Congress, and other Federal agencies on issues affecting people with disabilities. On October 23, 2012, NCD released a 300-page policy paper and related toolkit calling for the closure of residential homes for people with I/DD, arbitrarily tar-geting residential homes for four or more people. NCD spent nearly $150,000 in Federal funds to prepare and publish ''Deinstitutionalization: Unfinished Business,'' calling on the broader advocacy community to engage in advocacy efforts and law-suits to evict people with I/DD from their homes. NCD did not consult with the indi-viduals who could be evicted from their homes, nor their families and legal guard-ians. Instead, NCD accuses these caring families and guardians of violating their family members' civil rights for choosing a care setting of four or more people. NCD has since received more than 350 letters from families opposing forced deinstitu-tionalization. 691 Like AAID, NCD cites the landmark Supreme Court decision of Olmstead v L.C. (1999) as justification for its position to close HHS homes. Like many organizations that support deinstitutionalization, AAID and NCD misread and misapply the Olmstead decision's requirements. The Supreme Court is clear in its holding that the ADA requires individual choice before community placement can be imposed and recognizes the need for specialized care: ''We emphasize that nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations con- dones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or ben-efit from community settings...Nor is there any Federal requirement that com-munity-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.'' Olmstead, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 2187 (1999) (majority). ''As already observed [by the majority], the ADA is not reasonably read to impel States to phase out institutions, placing patients in need of close care at risk ...'Each disabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated set-ting possible for that person\u2014recognizing on a case-by-case basis, that setting may be an institution'[quoting VOR's Amici Curiae brief].'' Id. at 2189 (plu-rality). Likewise, Medicaid law and regulation requires that ICF/IID residents be ''[g]iven the choice of either institutional or home and community-based services.'' 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.303. NCD's support deinstitutionalization is contrary to Federal law and reckless. ICFs/IID have an array of services not often available elsewhere (e.g., on-site med-ical care, dental care, other specialties, and involvement in their broader commu-nities). As discussed above, tragedies are predictable when residents are separated from life-sustaining supports. IV. Solution and Conclusion HHS-funded agencies should not be allowed to advance an ideological agenda in support of evicting eligible people from HHS-licensed homes, contrary to the DD Act, Medicaid law, and the ADA/Olmstead. Such actions are a cruel and absurd use of Federal funding that is exacting great harm on our nation's most vulnerable citi-zens, and contrary to societal values which respect individual and family decision-making. Please support language to prohibit the use of HHS appropriations in support of deinstitutionalization activities which evict eligible individuals with I/DD from HHS-licensed and funded homes. No Federal agency should define ''choice'' so nar-rowly and illegally as to disenfranchise the most vulnerable segment of our disabled population. PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE WORKFORCE DATAQUALITY CAMPAIGN Workforce Data Quality Campaign (WDQC)\u2014a nonprofit initiative that advocates for inclusive, aligned and market-relevant data systems\u2014urges Congress to support programs that provide crucial data needed to ensure that our Nation is educating its students and workers to succeed in the 21st century economy. Federal investments in State data systems, labor market information and statis- tical programs have real impacts for: \u2014Students and workers trying to figure out which colleges and training programs are best at helping people land a job, continue their studies or advance in the labor market. \u2014Policymakers who need to know whether education and workforce programs are preparing people for good jobs. \u2014Business leaders wondering whether education and training programs are pre- paring enough prospective employees to meet their companies' needs. \u2014Educators who want to know the long-term education and employment out- comes of their graduates, so they can continually improve their courses and cur-ricula. Despite their profound impact on education and workforce development, a number of data-related programs and services have faced stagnant or declining funding in recent years. As Congress deliberates on fiscal year 2015 appropriations, we rec-ommend halting this downward trend and increasing funding for the following pro-grams. State longitudinal data system grants .\u2014The State Longitudinal Data System grants provided by the Department of Education (ED) and the Workforce Data Quality Initiative grants from Department of Labor (DOL) have propelled the suc-cessful development, implementation and expansion of longitudinal data systems. Continued Federal support will incentivize the State interagency cooperation nec-692 essary to build and utilize systems that can hold education and workforce programs accountable for their results. Funding for these grants has been decreasing over the past several years, gradually eroding this important source of support for State data systems. The last grant competition was in fiscal year 2012. Additional funding is important to help more States improve their data infrastructure and conduct a new grant competition that focuses States on using data to improve policy and practice, as well as incorporating longitudinal data from postsecondary and workforce pro-grams into their systems to allow more analysis of varied education and career pathways. Recommendation .\u2014Double the fiscal year 2014 funding level, as requested by the President's Budget, to support about 20 grants and national activities designed to promote data coordination, quality, and use. Include report language directing ED and DOL to collaborate on providing technical assistance to grantees to ensure in-clusive and aligned data systems. Workforce Information Grants/Electronic Tools. DOL awards grants to help States conduct research on local and regional labor markets, including shifts in industrial and occupational demand and its impact on the skills needed by the workforce. This information is critical to align education and training programs with employer needs, and help the workforce system guide students and workers to programs that will prepare them for high-demand occupations. Funding for these grants\u2014included in the Workforce Information/Electronic Tools/System Building line item in the State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations Account\u2014has not increased for over a decade, even as demand for labor market information has grown. This line item also funds important national data activities, including the dissemination of information on different types of credentials and O*NET, which collects and disseminates information about occupations including associated skills, knowledge and abilities. O*NET is used as the foundation for variety of tools to help workers explore careers, such as a new Skills to Work tool from Texas that helps veterans translate their military experience into skills appropriate for civilian re-sumes and match their skills to job openings. Recommendation .\u2014Increase funding by $10 million to support an $8 million in- crease in grants to States and a $2 million increase for O*NET. National Center for Education Statistics. This office at ED provides a number of important services, including labor market-relevant data products and tools on sec-ondary and postsecondary enrollments, completions and credential attainment. Recommendation .\u2014Increase funding to match fiscal year 2012 (pre-sequester) lev- els. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This DOL agency produces an array of important data, including employment and unemployment of individuals, jobs and earnings by in-dustry and occupation, job openings and labor turnover, mass layoffs and occupa-tional projections. As the Nation continues to face high unemployment, this data is vital to help align human capital policies with the needs of employers. Recommendation .\u2014Increase funding by $23 million to support the following ef- forts. \u2014Restore Current Employment Survey funding to 2010 levels (+$7 million) to provide resources to enhance data quality and reduce employer response burden by encouraging businesses to voluntarily provide information through electronic data interchange. This survey is used by local leaders to provide a near real- time summary of employment conditions and to rapidly spot key trends in major industries. \u2014Expand Current Population Survey supplements (+$4 million), which monitor labor market changes that can help State and local leaders understand the edu-cation and training needs in their communities. \u2014Develop new cost-effective approaches for Occupational Employment Statistics and the National Compensation Survey (+$2 million) that allow data users to see occupational trends over time by locality. \u2014Increase funding for cooperative agreements with States (+$10 million) to en- able State partners to produce a variety of labor market information that is crit-ical for workers, educators and employers. Funding for these agreements has not risen in over a decade. 693 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED INCREASES [Dollars in thousands] Department of Labor 2014 Enacted 2015 Recommendation Increase Workforce Data Quality Initiative ....................................................................... 6,000 6,463 463 Workforce Information/E-Tools/System Building Department of Education\u2014Institute of Data Systems ............................................................... 34,539 70,000 35,461 Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
