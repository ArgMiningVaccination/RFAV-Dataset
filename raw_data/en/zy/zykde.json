For many of the 1.1 billion people living in severe poverty, nature is a daily lifeline\u2014an asset for those with few other material means. This is especially true for the rural poor, who comprise three-quarters of all poor house-holds worldwide. Harvests from forests, fisheries, and farm fields are a primary source of rural income,and a fall-back when other sources of employment falter. But programs to reduce poverty often fail toaccount for the important link between environment and the livelihoods of the rural poor. As a conse-quence, the full potential of ecosystems as a wealth-creating asset for the poor\u2014not just a survivalmechanism\u2014has yet to be effectively tapped. The thesis of World Resources 2005 is that income from ecosystems\u2014what we call environmental income\u2014can act as a fundamental stepping stone in the economic empowerment of the rural poor. This requires that the poor manage ecosystems so that they support stable productivity over time. Productiveecosystems are the basis of a sustainable income stream from nature. But for the poor to tap that income, they must be able to reap the benefits of their good stewardship. Unfortunately, the poor are rarely in such a position of power over natural resources. An array of gover-nance failures typically intervene: lack of legal ownership and access to ecosystems, politicalmarginalization, and exclusion from the decisions that affect how these ecosystems are managed.Without addressing these failures, there is little chance of using the economic potential of ecosystemsto reduce rural poverty. World Resources 2005 details the steps necessary to empower the poor to use ecosystems both wisely and for wealth. Using examples and case studies, the report traces a route to greater environmentalincome. Working at the cutting edge of sustainable development, it lays out the governance changesnecessary to give the poor the legal, financial, and management capacity to use nature for wealthcreation without depleting their fragile resource base.

Its mission is to move humansociety to live in ways that protect Earth's environment and its capacity toprovide for the needs and aspirations of current and future generations. For more than 20 years, WRI has demonstrated its commitment to helping find solutions to these enormous global environmental challenges. WRI's workis concentrated on making progress toward four goals: Healthy Ecosystems: Reverse rapid degradation of ecosystems and assuretheir capacity to provide humans with needed goods and services. Stable Climate: Protect the global climate system from further harm due toemissions of greenhouse gases and help humanity and the natural world adapt to unavoidable climate change. Sustainable Enterprise: Harness markets and enterprise to expand economic opportunity and protect the environment.

The World Bank is the world's largest source of development assistance, provid- ing nearly $30 billion in loans annually to its client countries. The Bank uses itsfinancial resources, its highly trained staff, and its extensive knowledge baseto individually help each developing country onto a path of stable, sustainable,and equitable growth. The main focus is on helping the poorest people and thepoorest countries, but for all its clients the Bank emphasizes the need for: Investing in people, particularly through basic health and education Protecting the environment Supporting and encouraging private business development Strengthening the ability of the governments to deliver quality services, efficiently and transparently Promoting reforms to create a stable macroeconomic environment, conducive to investment and long-term planning Focusing on social development, inclusion, governance, and institutionbuilding as key elements of poverty reduction.

UNEP has created abasis for comprehensive, coordinated action within the UN on problems of theenvironment. UNEP's mission is to provide leadership and encourage partner-ships in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and enablingnations and people to improve their quality of life without compromising thatof future generations. One of the most important functions of UNEP is the promotion of environ- mental science and information. UNEP has always recognized that theenvironment is a system of interacting relationships that extends through allsectors. It places, among other things, emphasis on environment for develop-ment. UNEP nurtures partnerships with other UN bodies possessingcomplementary skills and delivery capabilities and enhances the participationof the private sector, scientific community, NGOs, youth, women, and sportsorganizations in achieving sustainable development. UNEP derives its strength and influence from the authority inherent in its mission\u2014environmental management. UNEP has and will continue to play apivotal role in caring for the environment for the future.

UNDP is on the ground in 166 countries, working with them on their ownsolutions to global and national development challenges. As they develop localcapacity, they draw on the people of UNDP and its wide range of partners. World leaders have pledged to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including the overarching goal of cutting poverty in half by 2015 and doingso with full commitment to environmental sustainability. UNDP's networklinks and coordinates global and national efforts to reach these Goals. UNDP's focus is helping countries build and share solutions to the challenges of Democratic Governance, Poverty Reduction, Crisis Prevention and Recovery,Energy and Environment, and HIV/AIDS. UNDP helps developing countries attract and use aid effectively. In all its activities, UNDP encourages the protection of human rights and the empow-erment of women.

Even after five decades of effort to supportdevelopment and growth, the dimensions of poverty still stagger us. Almost half the world'spopulation lives on less than $2 per day; more than a billion live on $1 or less. Poverty at thisscale ripples beyond the boundaries of any particular country or region and affects the well-being of us all. The publication of World Resources 2005 comes at a particularly critical time. Economies in many developing countries have been growing at a rapid pace for several years. Thatgrowth has made us aware of two stark realities: in the largest of those countries it has liftedmillions out of extreme poverty; but the price these nations are paying in accelerated degra-dation of their natural resources is alarming. At the same time, there have been a number of key events this year, 2005, that provide a clearer focus on the future. At the G-8 Summit in Scotland, attention to the problems ofglobal poverty , especially in Africa, was unusual for its single-mindedness and for theacknowledgment of poverty's 5:55 PM Page viiviiiWORLD RESOURCES 2005 In the spring of this year, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), an international appraisal of the health of the world'secosystems, published the first of its series of reports after fiveyears of intensive study . The MA findings sound an alarm bellfor the future, but they also contain within them a framework toaddress the challenges we have created for ourselves. The MA has shown beyond any question the degradation we have caused to the ecosystems of the earth. At the same time, theMA has demonstrated unequivocally that we can better managethese assets, and, by so doing, secure their benefits for the future. World Resources 2005 is about simple propositions: Economic growth is the only realistic means to lift the poor outof extreme poverty in the developing world; but the capacity ofthe poor to participate in economic growth must be enhancedif they are to share in its benefits. The building blocks of a pro-poor growth strategy begin withnatural resources. These provide the base upon which the vastmajority of the poor now depend for their fragile existence,but over which they exercise little control, and therefore can'texercise full stewardship. The role of governance\u2014transparent and accountable gover-nance\u2014is critical to fostering pro-poor growth and essential toensuring that the engine of that growth, natural resourcewealth, is managed wisely . There are some things we know for sure. We know that the great majority of the world's poor are concentrated in rural areas.They depend on fields, forests, and waters\u2014the bounty ofecosystems\u2014for their livelihood. These ecosystems provide anatural asset base that the rural poor can use to begin a processof wealth creation that will boost them beyond subsistence andinto the mainstream of national economies\u2014but only under theright circumstances. If the natural resource base is not managed for the long term, if it is exploited and polluted for short-term gain, it will neverprovide the fuel for economic development on the scaledemanded to relieve poverty . And that is what is happening today , as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment has dramatically shown. If the ecosys-tems of the world represent the natural capital stock of theplanet, we have drawn down that account at an alarming pace inthe past decades. Over the last 50 years, we have changed ecosys-tems more rapidly than at any time in human history , largely tomeet growing demands for food, freshwater, timber, and fiber. The changes have not been without benefit. The resulting increase in food, fiber, and other services has contributed to improved human well-being. H owever, the gains are unevenly distributed, and the poor have more often borne the associated costs. As populations and economies grow, the pressures on ecosystems will inexorably increase. Yet thanks to the MA, we finally under-stand, in terms even the most hard-bitten economist or bankercan appreciate, the economic value of our natural capitalaccount. And like the banker or economist, we now understandthat we must manage that capital account\u2014a trust fund, if youwill\u2014so that it not only provides for our needs today but also forthe needs of future generations. This volume documents that such stewardship of nature is also an effective means to fight poverty . When poor householdsimprove their management of local ecosystems\u2014whetherpastures, forests, or fishing grounds\u2014the productivity of thesesystems rises. When this is combined with greater control overthese natural assets, through stronger ownership rights, andgreater inclusion in local institutions, the poor can capture therise in productivity as increased income. With greater incomefrom the environment\u2014what we refer to as environmental income \u2014poor families experience better nutrition and health and begin to accumulate assets. In other words, they begin thejourney out of poverty . For some time now we have known that economic growth, growth that expands the availability of opportunities, is neces-sary to any permanent effort to alleviate poverty . But the qualityof that growth is crucial if its economic benefits are truly toextend to the poor. Pro-poor growth based on the sustainable useof natural resource capital requires a fundamental change ingovernance. World Resources 2002-2004 demonstrated that the wisest and most equitable decisions about the use of naturalresources are made openly and transparently . Those mostaffected by such decisions must have full access to informationand the ability to participate. Change in governance must necessarily include reforms that give the poorest a real stake in their future. The issues of land tenure,of responsibility for resources held in common, of control, andof accountability must be addressed in a way that acknowledgesand catalyzes the role of individual and community self-interestin managing natural resources as a long-term asset. Included in these reforms must be a clear mandate to end corruption, which particularly oppresses the poor. The graft ofgovernment officials, the inside deals of vested interests, and theexploitation of natural resources for the immediate gain of a fewcreates an environment where the resource rights of the poor areviolated and pro-poor growth cannot flourish. The growth of free and uncorrupt institutions in developing countries provides the catalyst that will help us solve these twoinextricably linked challenges: the eradication of extremejp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:55 PM Page viiiixpoverty and the management of our natural capital to provide for future needs. Access to the natural capital to create wealth, control and responsibility for that capital, information and basic technologyto make that control useful and productive, and the ability toreach markets that bring the poor into the global economy arethe tools at hand. The pay-off for countries that take up thesetools is the prospect of a far better future than what they facetoday , and a social stability based on choice, access, andeconomic opportunity . Achieving these goals will not come without a price for the devel- oped world, but it is one developed countries should be eager topay , given the return. Aid programs will have to become moretargeted and accountable. Free trade will have to mean just that.Tariffs, import quotas, and crop subsidies will have to bemodified, minimized, or eliminated so that the promise of abetter life that starts on a farm in central Africa is not dashed onthe docks of Europe, Japan, or the United States. Consider the consequences of inaction or misguided action: continued poverty . The unchecked ravages of preventablediseases. Lost generations whose talent and promise are deniedto us. Depletion of resources vital to our future. And the socialcorrosion born of inequality and political instability thatnational boundaries can no longer contain. Much of what we call for in this latest Report is captured in the Millennium Development Goals, adopted by the United Nationsin 2000, and committed to by the wealthiest nations of theworld. World Resources 2005 shows us how important pro-poor management of ecosystems is to attaining these goalsWhat World Resources 2005 argues eloquently and unequivo- cally is that the path forward is clearer now than at any time. TheReport presents a wealth of examples to adopt and replicate,demonstrating how nations can support a bottom-up approachto rural growth that begins naturally with the assets that the pooralready possess. We know so much more than we did at Rio in1992. We know the folly of extending aid without the tools tomake use of it, of granting debt relief without improved gover-nance, of stimulating production without access to markets. Andwe know the promise of ecosystems for poverty reduction.Delivering on that promise can allow the bounty of nature tobecome the wealth of the poor. At no time has so much been atstake, and at no time are we better able to respond.

Without addressing these failures, there is little chanceof using the economic potential of ecosystems to reduce rural poverty .CHAPTER 1jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 34WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Making governance more friendly to the poor means tackling issues of property rights, access to information anddecision-making, adequate representation, institutional trans-parency , and fairness in sharing the costs and benefits ofresource management. These are all aspects of democratic governance \u2014decision-making that respects the rights and needs of those who depend on resources. For the poor, democraticgovernance is the door to equity and one of the buildingblocks of sustainability . This fusion of ecosystem management and good gover- nance is also necessary to achieve the Millennium DevelopmentGoals, the set of eight goals adopted by the internationalcommunity in 2000 to address world poverty . As the foundationof rural livelihoods, ecosystems are central to real progresstoward the health, nutrition, sanitation, and environmentaltargets embedded in the Millennium Development Goals.Indeed, without empowering the poor to responsibly managetheir environment for economic gain, we cannot effectivelyattend to rural poverty in its many dimensions. (See Box 1.1.) The goal of this report is to highlight the vital role of ecosystems and their governance\u2014of nature and power\u2014inpoverty reduction. The report's central question is: Who controlsecosystems, and how can this control be reconfigured to allowthe poor to use their natural assets as sustainable sources ofwealth creation, vehicles of political empowerment, and avenuesof integration into the national and global economies? Linking Ecosystems, Governance, and Poverty Ecosy stem management, democratic governance, and poverty reduction are each essential elements of sustainable economicgrowth. Moreover, these elements are inextricably linked. Morethan 1.3 billion people depend on fisheries, forests, and agricul-ture for employment\u2014close to half of all jobs worldwide (FAO2004:169-174). This dependence of livelihoods on naturalsystems is nowhere more important than among the rural poor(MA 2005:7, 48). (See Table 1.1.) In Africa, more than seven in ten poor people live in rural regions, with most engaged inresource-dependent activities, such as small-scale farming,livestock production, fishing, andlogging (IFAD 2001:15). This small-scale production accountsfor a significant percentage of the GDP of many Africannations (Kura et al. 2004:36-39; IFPRI 2004:2). Making wise choices about the use of natural resources and the distribution of environmental benefits and costs iscentral to maximizing the contribution that a nation's resourceendowment makes to social and economic development. Manyof the poorest regions of the wor ld are, howev er, also the least democratic. That means much of their resource wealth istypically diverted from the public good through corruption,mismanagement, and political patronage. It is no coincidencethat fundamental democratic principles such as transparency ,public participation, accountability , and the separation of legislative, judicial, and executive powers are often absent indeveloping countries where poverty is greatest. Many people in developing countries are thus not only poor, they are voiceless. Dependent directly on natural resources, theyhave little say in how those resources are used, but suffer the conse-quences when the decisions are corrupt and the use is destructive.For example, rural peoples' livelihoods are often in direct conflictwith extractive industries such as large-scale fishing, logging, ormining, but they have little say in resolving that conflict. Access todecision-makers\u2014government bureaucrats, lawmakers, or thecourts\u2014is typically for the powerful, not the poor. Rectifying this imbalance means supporting democratic practices. History shows , however, that efforts to promote democratic principles in a vacuum rarely succeed. To takeroot, they must engage citizens, and they must deliver onmatters that are immediate and important to citizens. As thesource of livelihoods, the environment is arguably the mostAn ecosystem is a community of interacting organisms and the physical environment they live in. We know ecosystems as the forests, grasslands, wetlands, deserts, coral reefs, rivers, estuaries, and otherliving environments that surround us. They also include the farms,pastures, and rangelands\u2014collectively known as agroecosystems\u2014that feed us. They are the earth's living engines of production, providingthe goods and services\u2014air, food, fiber, water, aesthetics, and spiritualvalues\u2014that make life possible for rich and poor alike. In World Resources 2000-2001: People and Ecosystems\u2014The Fraying Web of Life, we explored the threats to global ecosystems and stressed the need to adopt an \"ecosystem approach\" to environmental manage-ment. View the report online at http://www.wri.org Governance is the exercise of authority\u2014the decisions, regula-tions, and enforcement that determine how we will act and whowill benefit. It encompasses the laws, institutions (such as government agencies or village councils), and decision-making processes thatembody this authority. Democratic governance implies the participa- tion of those who are governed in the decision-making process\u2014eitherdirectly, through representatives, or both. In World Resources 2002-2004: Decisions for the Earth\u2014Balance, Voice, and Power, we showed how the conditions and quality of governance influence our environmental decisions, and stressedthat good governance that ensures adequate representation, accessto information, and public participation is crucial to the sustainableand equitable management of ecosystems.

Put differently , the environment is not only apowerful tool for promoting democratic reform, but goodenvironmental governance is fundamental to strengtheningand consolidating democracy . Democratic institutions, in turn,are an important factor supporting strong economic growth(Kaufmann et al. 1999:18). This emphasis on good governance and environment is particularly relevant when addressing poverty . The case studies inthis report and the experiences of an increasing number ofvillages and communities in many nations suggest that efforts topromote sustainable livelihoods among the poor are moresuccessful when they simultaneously promote ecosystem steward-ship and democratic governance. For that reason, a number ofdevelopment agencies and nongovernmental organizations(NGOs) are beginning to focus on this integration of environ-ment and governance. In spite of increasing interest in this integration, its applica- tion to the alleviation of poverty is still new. Success will demanda new openness to go beyond traditional economic developmentstrategies, or at least to add a more deliberate recognition of thelinkages among nature, power, and poverty . The Persistence of Poverty The persistence of global poverty is both disturbing andhumbling. Policymakers have long recognized the moral andpractical need to address the substantial number of people wholack basic amenities such as adequate nutrition, housing, educa- tion, or opportunity . But decades of piecemeal efforts havebrought only limited success. (See Box 1.1.) More than a half century of persistent efforts by the World Bank and others have not altered the stubborn reality of rural poverty, and the gap between rich and poor is widening. \u2014World Bank Strategy for Rural Development, 2003 Ending world poverty first become a stated goal of politi- cians from industrialized countries in the 1940s, when U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt stated his desire to extend\"freedom from want\" not only to the people of the United States,but to people in every nation (Roosevelt 1941). The UnitedNations Charter, crafted in the same era, explicitly acknowledgedthe need to promote \"social progress and better standards of life\"across the globe (UN 1945). Almost 60 years later, at the UnitedNations Millennium Summit in 2000, more than 100 heads ofstate committed to reach the eight Millennium DevelopmentGoals (UN General Assembly 2001:55). These commitments confirm the simple fact that poverty remains an obstacle to the development aspirations of most Continues on page 10jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 56BOX 1.1 THE DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY What is Poverty? DEFINING AND MEASURING POVERTY ARE essential to any discussion of poverty reduction. Definitions ofpoverty have traditionally focused only on material\u2014and specif-ically monetary\u2014measures of well-being. But key conceptsbehind poverty have evolved considerably in recent years. Today,a more holistic, multi-dimensional perception of poverty hasemerged, drawn from interviews with the poor themselves.Definitions of poverty have expanded to include the social andpsychological burdens of daily survival on the bottom rungs ofsociety. This broader conception is described by Amartya Sen asa lack of capabilities that enable a person to live a life he or shevalues, encompassing such domains as income, health, educa-tion, empowerment, and human rights (Sen 1999:87-98). As researchers and policymakers struggle to understand these complexities, they have begun to use \"participatory assess-ments\" to let the poor speak in their own voice and identifytheir own priorities. The authors of the Voices of the Poor series interviewed 60,000 poor people in 60 countries in one of thebetter-known assessments (Narayan et al. 2000a, 2000b,2002). Complex descriptions of the \"ill-being\" associated withpoverty emerged, with dimensions other than material depriva-tion given strong significance. Such studies make it clear that, in addition to being without financial resources, being poor often means suffering sickness,chronic pain, or exhaustion. It means enduring difficult socialrelations, sometimes facing exclusion from the community orfamily. Poverty also translates into insecurity and powerless-ness, a lack of access to information and institutions, and oftena lack of self-confidence and voice. Psychological suffering isalso associated, in the form of humiliation, anguish, grief, andworry (Narayan et al. 2000b:37-38). These varying aspects of poverty tend to be self-reinforcing, making it all the more difficult to move out of poverty andconstruct a stable life. It is hard to plan ahead or to seize newopportunities when you are exhausted, stressed, or hungry. Inaddition, the poor often live in dangerous and degraded environ- ments, since that is all they can afford. They are thus the mostvulnerable to violence, crime, and natural and economic catas-trophes (Narayan et al. 2000a:72, 84-88). Finally, living in poverty often means facing a truncated view of the future. The poor are often averse to risk, having sufferedfrom mistakes or false expectations in the past and lackingassets to fall back on. Whereas those with means can save foremergencies and plan for the future, the poor do not have thatluxury. A poor person's planning horizon\u2014how far ahead theycan plan or foresee\u2014is often determined by when food will run out. It may be as soon as the end of the day. This element ofpoverty\u2014the lack of ability to reasonably plan for the longterm\u2014has real significance for anything related to ecosystemmanagement, which works over extended periods of time, oftenyielding benefits in the future. Quantifying Poverty Poverty estimates are usually constructed from householdsurvey data. The head of a household is typically asked aboutincome and consumption levels, and these are used as themeasure of well-being (World Bank 2001:17). Most govern-ments have established national \"poverty lines\" by compilingand pricing a basket of goods meant to reflect the basic humannecessities, such as food, clothing, and housing. Manycountries have a \"food\" or \"absolute\" poverty line calculatedfrom a food basket representing minimum nutritional require-ments, and a \"basic needs\" line that is slightly higher (Deaton2004:3-4; Coudouel et al. 2002:34). In 1990, the World Bank began using the measure of $1 per day as an official \"international poverty line,\" meant to roughly approx- PROFILING HOUSEHOLDS IN BOLIVIA, 1999-2003 Population of Bolivia 8.8 million Number of Bolivians Living on Less than $1 a Day 1.3 millionNumber of Bolivians Living Below the Basic Needs Poverty Line 5.1 million Percent of Urban Population Living Below the Poverty Line 39Percent of Rural Population Living Below the Poverty Line 91Percent of Poor Bolivians Living in Rural Areas 59Percent of Total Spending Accounted for by the Poorest 20% 4Percent of Total Spending Accounted for by the Richest 20% 49Percent of Rural Households in Lowest Income Decile with Electricity 5 Percent of Rural Households in Highest Income Decile with Electricity 46 Percent of Rural Households Using Dung for Cooking 6Percent of Adults Who Are Literate 87Percent of Poor Rural Children Attending School 83Percent of Poor Rural Children Working 51 Sources: Demographic and Health Surveys, 2005; UNESCO 2004; World Bank 2002, 2004ajp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 67 Sources: World Bank 2004a; United Nations Population Division 2003; UNESCO 2004Per Capita GDP Adult Literacy Rate Life ExpectancyTHE MANY MEASURES OF POVERTY Well-being can be measured using indicators other than income poverty.

This measure remains controversial,but has provided a starting point for international comparison andfor important poverty initiatives, including the United Nations'Millennium Development Goals. The World Bank's most recent estimate is that some 1.1 billion people lived below the $1 per day line in 2001. About 46percent of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa and 31 percent of South Asians live on less than a dollar a day (Chen and Ravallion 2004:1, 30). These numbers have not been static;the distribution of world poverty has changed significantly overthe last quarter-century, due in large part to a dramatic drop inthe number of poor people in East Asia. Chen and Ravallionbroadly estimate that between 1981 and 2001, the number ofpeople living below $1 per day in China declined by over 400million, while in the rest of the world, the number rose from850 to 880 million. The number of poor in Sub-Saharan Africa almost doubled over this period (Chen andRavallion 2004:17, 20). In addition, many morepeople around the world live only slightly above the$1 per day line, suffering many of the symptoms of $1 per day poverty. Some 2.7 billion\u2014almosthalf the world population\u2014live on less than $2 perday (Chen and Ravallion 2004:16). As useful as these aggregate numbers are, they tend to mask some important elements of thepoverty landscape. For example, not all the poor fallinto a single category\u2014some are poorer thanothers. The depth and distribution of materialpoverty in different countries can be extremelyvaried. Weighing how far below the poverty linehouseholds fall\u2014their \"poverty gap,\" or gapbetween household income and the nationalpoverty line\u2014offers a useful measure of the depthof a nation's poverty (World Bank 2001:320). 0102030405060 1980 1990 2000Percent of Po pulationSub-Saharan Africa East Asia an d Pacific South Asia Latin America an d the Caribbean Eastern Euro pe and Central Asia Middle East an d North Africa Sources: Chen and Ravallion 2004:30; World Bank 2004bPERCENT OF ON DAY, 1981-2001jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 7BOX 1.1 THE DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY 8Although few, if any, in the United States live on $2/day, some 16% of residents live below the national poverty line. Central America is recovering from a war-torn past. Its poverty rates are the highest in the hemisphere. Landlocked and mountainous countries present a unique challenge for poverty alleviation because the poor often live in remote and hard-to-reach areas. In Bolivia, over 80% of people living in rural areas are poor.Plagued by government failure and political unrest,Haiti is one of the poorestcountries in the Caribbean. In Brazil, income per person is relatively high, but severe inequality keeps many in poverty. Sources: ON $2 PER DAY Another variation on the standard poverty line looks at \"relative poverty\" by assessing the proportion of a country's populationthat lives at less than one-third the national consumptionaverage. When this measure is applied, the poverty numbers forSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia stay relatively similar tothose calculated using national poverty lines. But the numbersin other regions soar, rising to 51 percent in Latin America andthe Caribbean, and 26 percent in Europe and Central Asia(Hulme et al. 2001:18). Still another way to measure poverty is to assess whether a household's total assets\u2014cash, property, livestock, transport,and other possessions\u2014fall below a critical level (Barrett andSwallow 2003:9). This approach is consistent with the percep-tions of the poor themselves. When poor people are asked abouttheir material concerns, they tend to focus not just on income,but on their lack of assets in general and the insecurity thisbrings (Narayan et al. 2000b:49). Because poverty has so many dimensions, monetary measures are not the only, nor necessarily the best, way to count the poor.For example, the conventional household survey approach doesnot reveal disparities within households, and hence has no wayof measu ring income or consumption poverty among women, who often hold lower status. Education and health statistics, on theother hand, can be used to get a better perspective on manyaspects of poverty, including those that are gender-related (WorldBank 2001:27). Life expectancy, child mortality, the incidence of child stunting, literacy rates, and school enrollment are some ofthe more commonly used nonmonetary indicators. In an effort toaddress some of the gaps left by money-based assessments,analysts have developed a number of indices that measure multi-ple dimensions of poverty.The best known is the UN DevelopmentProgramme's Human Development Index (HDI), a weighted indexthat includes education, life expectancy, and per-capita GDP(UNDP 2004:139).

For example, 70% of men in Yemen are literate, compared with only 29% of women. Poverty in Australia ranges widely by locale--from 2% to 15%. The nationwide average is 9%.China has seen 300 million people emerge from poverty in the last two decades. However, these gains are largely in the east, close to the coast. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are AIDS-stricken. In Botswana, nearly 40% of adults between the ages of 15 and 49 have AIDS or HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the biggest challenge in poverty alleviation. More than 2/3 of all inhabitants are poor.Much of Eastern Europe is still in transition from Soviet rule. Poverty exists in countries where it was extremely rare 20 years ago.No poverty data are available for Afghanistan, where only 5% of rural residents have access to improved sanitation. Some countries, such as Somalia, are mired in conflict, and accurate data on human well-being cannot be collected.India is home to the most people living on an income of less than $2/day, over 800 million.

It goes without saying that poverty levies heavy personal costs on the poor themselves. It robs families of security , opportu-nity , and health. In so doing, it also robs nations of the potentialcontributions these families could make to economic growth, socialwell-being, and political stability . Poverty thus squanders a nation'shuman capital. It acts as a drag on economic development, requir-ing substantial state expenditures to address (UNDP 1996:5).Poverty also undermines national security by promoting disaffec-tion and magnifying class and political divisions within society ,increasing migration, and potentially contributing to internationalterrorism (Sachs 2003:27). When combined with other drivingforces, it also can exacerbate local and global environmentalproblems, contributing to unsustainable land and resource use(ASB 2003:2; Duraiappah 1998:2177). Given this list of ills, it isclearly in the self-interest of every nation to confront poverty . And, indeed, nations have made some progress in combat- ing poverty . The percentage of people suffering severepoverty\u2014those who live on incomes of roughly $1 per day (1993prices)\u2014has fallen from 40 percent of the world's population in1981 to 21 percent in 2001. This means that the number ofimpoverished people has dropped by an estimated 400 million\u2014from roughly 1.5 to 1.1 billion\u2014over 20 years, in spite of a 1.6 billion rise in world population during that period, most of which took place in poor nations (Chen and Ravallion2004:31). (See Box 1.1.) This positive development is, h owever, largely the result of rising incomes in China and India. The populations in thesenations are so large that improvements in their poverty rates caneasily influence world poverty totals. For example, China's robusteconomic growth, coupled with de-collectivization of agricul-ture, stronger property rights, and other policy changes, resultedin a substantial drop in the number of people in profoundpoverty , particularly in the early 1980s and mid-1990s. In fact,China's accomplishments alone accounted for much of theglobal progress against poverty in the last 20 years (Dollar2004:31; Chen and Ravallion 2004:18). There are other success stories as well. The poverty rate in Vietnam dropped sharply over five years\u2014from 58 percent in1992 to 37 percent in 1998\u2014on the strength of its economicgrowth and pro-poor policies (Glewwe et al. 2000:39; Kakwani2004:6). In just eleven years\u2014from 1987 to 1998\u2014Chilesucceeded in cutting its poverty rate in half (World Bank2001a:5). The rate of primary-school completion in the devel-oping world rose from 73 percent to 81 percent during the1990s (Bruns et al. 2003:3). Over the past 40 years, lifeexpectancy in developing countries has increased by 20 years\u2014about as much as was achieved in all of human history prior tothe middle of the twentieth century , although this is beingsharply eroded by the AIDS epidemic today (Goldin et al2002:iii; WHO 2004:5). These successes notwithstanding, poverty is very much present in the world today . In fact, in many countries povertycontinues to worsen. Between 1981 and 2001, the number ofpeople living on less than $1 per day in Sub-Saharan Africadoubled from 164 million to 313 million people. In Latin America and the Caribbean it climbed from 36 million to 50million (Chen and Ravallion 2004:31). The percentage of peopleliving on less than $2 per day in Eastern Europe and Central Asiarose from 2 percent in 1981 to 20 percent in 2001, largely as aresult of the collapse of communism in those regions (Chen andRavallion 2004:19). The scourge of AIDS adds to the problem,particularly in Africa, where the disease is wiping out many of theTABLE 1.1 ECOSYSTEMS BRING JOBS Percent of Global Workforce Employed in Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry, 2001 Region/Country Percent of Active WorkforceWORLD 4 4DEVELOPED COUNTRIES 7DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 5 4ASIA AND PACIFIC 6 0 Cambodia 70China 67India 59Nepal 93 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN 1 9 Bolivia 44Guatemala 45Haiti 62 NEAR EAST AND NORTH AFRICA 3 3 Afghanistan 67Turkey 45Yemen 50 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 6 2 Burkina Faso 92Ethiopia 82Niger 88Tanzania 80 COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION 1 5 Source: PM Page 1011gains against poverty made over the last few decades (Wines and LaFraniere 2004:1; WHO 2004). Even in China, the incidence ofpoverty increased during the late 1990s as the nation's torrid paceof economic growth slowed for a few years (Kakwani 2004:6). To be sure, progress against poverty has been held back in many poor nations by a lack of economic growth. Experienceshows that such growth is an important component of large-scale poverty alleviation. Over the last two decades , however, economic growth has often not kept pace with populationgrowth in the poorest countries. From 1981 to 2001, per capitaGDP dropped in 43 percent of developing nations (Hufbauer2003:31, 33, 35). This lack of economic growth is particularlyacute in rural areas, compounded by the political weakness ofthese areas and consequent underinvestment in rural develop-ment. For example, from 1999-2002, the World Bank directedjust 25 percent of its total lending toward rural areas, in spite ofthe predominance of poverty there (World Bank 2003:10-11). Growth Alone is Not Enough Even where there is economic growth, many poor people are leftbehind. Economic growth alone does not necessarily translate topoverty reduction. In Latin America, for instance, the number ofpeople in poverty has increased in the last decade even as the GDPper capita has increased, indicating that economic inequality hasintensified (Chen and Ravallion 2004:31; World Bank 2005:24). We all know the basic facts. Half the people in the world live on less than $2 a day. A fifth live on less than $1 a day. Over the next three decades, two billion more people will be added to the global population\u201497 percent of them in developing countries, most of them born into poverty. \u2014James D. Wolfensohn, President, World Bank, Oct. 3, 2004 In China, too, the nation's growing wealth has by-passed many families, with the benefits often captured by rapidly indus-trializing regions and cities, and missing many rural residents.One result has been a widening of the income gap betweenurban and rural areas over the last two decades, as well as greatergrowth and poverty reduction in China's coastal provinces wherethe engine of economic growth runs hottest (Ravallion and Chen2004:15-16, 25). Moreover, the rural poor often suffer theenvironmental costs of China's industrialization and rapidgrowth disproportionately . Highly polluting industries haveroutinely relocated from cities to China's rural areas to avoidclean-up costs, leaving a legacy of water and air pollution thatmany rural residents are too poor to escape (Yardley 2004:1). All too often, such inequalities in income and vulnerability amonggroups are exacerbated by rapid economic growth, with the poorfalling further behind (Kakwani 2004:6). Perhaps the most striking examples of the difficulty of spreading the benefits of growth equitably occur in the indus-CHAPTER 1 NATURE, POWER, AND POVERTY Working toward economic equity\u2014toward a more equal distribution of economic benefits within a nation\u2014is a powerful means to fight poverty.It is a necessary complement to strategies that expand the nationaleconomy, so that some of the benefits of growth make their way to thosein the lowest income bracket. Even when economic growth is slow,policies that more equally distribute economic gains can help reducepoverty, as shown by the success of Jordan in lowering its poverty ratefrom 1992-1997. In 1989, following a currency devaluation, Jordan suffered an economic crisis that increased the poverty rate sixfold. At the same time, thenation's level of economic inequality\u2014the difference between theincomes of the rich and the poor\u2014increased dramatically as well,prompting a significant rethinking of economic strategy among govern-ment policymakers (Shaban et al. 2001:iv). Beginning in 1991, Jordan changed its spending policies to increase the proportion of economic benefits flowing to the lowest income sector. Oneof the most effective changes was the gradual replacement of generalfood subsides, from which richer families benefited most, with directcash payments to poor families only (Shaban et al. 2001:iv, 15-20). Thisreprogramming reduced the nation's economic inequality, with the gapbetween the wealthiest segment of Jordanian society and the poorestnarrowing over the next six years (Shaban et al. 2001:viii, 10-13). Subsequent analysis showed that it was this reduction of inequality that helped Jordan reduce its poverty rate from 14.4 percent in 1992 to11.7 percent in 1997, even though the nation experienced little or noeconomic growth during this period (Shaban et al. 2001:viii, 7). Inaddition, those who remained poor were not as far below the poverty line,and extreme poverty had declined (Shaban et al. 2001:8). The reductionin inequality was driven by a greater percentage of government expendi-tures being captured by the poor. Had this trend toward reducedinequality been accompanied by genuine economic growth, Jordan'spoverty rate would likely have dropped even more.REDUCING INEQUALITIES REDUCES POVERTY Source: Shaban et al. 2001:10,12JORDAN: LESS INEQUALITY, LESS POVERTY 1992 1997 Percent of Population in Poverty1: 14.4 11.7 Level of Inequality (Gini Index2) 0.40 0.36 1 Annual per capita consumption is below 314 JD or US $443 at 1997 prices. 2The Gini index is scaled between 0.0 and 1.0; 0.0 indicates perfect equality and 1.0 indicates perfect inequality.jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 11trialized world, where poverty persists in spite of the general affluence of the population. In the United States, the number ofpoor has risen steadily since 2000, reaching almost 36 millionpeople in 2003\u2014some 1.3 million more than in 2002.Historically marginalized groups such as Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics continue to suffer significantlyhigher rates of poverty . For example, 24.4 percent of AfricanAmericans fell below the poverty line in 2003, compared to thenational rate of 12.5 percent. Among Native Americans andHispanics, poverty rates were 23 percent and 22.5 percent,respectively (DeNavas-Walt et al. 2004:10). (See Figure 1.1.) In general, research shows that to benefit the poor most, economic growth must be coupled with policies that reduceinequalities and improve how income is distributed in a society(Kakwani 2004:6). Where dependence of the poor on naturalresources is high, as it is in most developing nations, thesepolicies must necessarily involve the environment. And theymust translate to governance practices that increase the poor'saccess to vital natural resources and their ability to governthose resources so that they share in the income from them. Environment Matters to the Poor The link between environment and poverty reduction is strong.Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the importance of asound environment to sustainable livelihoods has been widelyacknowledged, particularly for the rural poor in Africa, Asia,and Latin America (UN 1992; UN 2002:2). Income derived 12WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Although poverty in urban areas is substantial and increasing, global poverty is still predominantly a rural phenomenon. Some 75 percent of thepoor live in rural areas despite the global trend toward urbanization. Evenin 20 years, 60 percent of the poor are expected to live outside of cities(IFAD 2001:15). Providing a route out of poverty for these rural residentswill remain a priority for national governments and the internationalcommunity for decades to come (Reed 2001:13; World Bank 2003:1). In addition, while urban ecosystems such as parks, waterways, and green spaces provide important services, it is rural ecosystems that provide thebulk of the goods and services on which humans depend for survival. Theforest areas, fisheries, grasslands, agricultural fields, and rivers thatprovision both urban and rural residents, be they poor or rich, exist prima-rily in rural areas, and this is where most ecosystem governance andmanagement occurs.However, even as we focus on rural ecosystems and the rural poor, we recognize the intimate connection between the urban and rural spheres.Much urban poverty, for example, begins as rural poverty, exported fromthe countryside through rural-to-urban migration. Working for a healthierrural economy thus helps address urban poverty too, by lessening thismigration. At the same time, the rural and urban economies are deeplyintertwined, particularly through the flow of remittances from the cityback to family members in the country. In fact, being able to tap into suchremittances is often one of the dividing lines between poverty and suffi-ciency, and modern rural economies could hardly function without this netflow of income out of urban areas. In the end, then, we realize thataddressing rural poverty has an important urban dimension as well.Urban and rural poverty can never be completely disentwined.

The environment is also a source of vulnerability . Environ- mental factors contribute substantially to the burden of ill-healththe poor suffer. In addition, low-income families are especiallyvulnerable to natural disasters and environment-related risks suchas the growing impacts of global climate change. As these environ-ment-poverty links have become clear, major developmentinstitutions and donors have begun to make the environment amore central feature of their efforts to tackle poverty (USAID etal. 2002; and EC 1999; World Bank 2001b). Natural Resources Play a Vital Role in the Livelihoods of the Poor Poor rural families make use of a variety of sources of income and subsistence activities to make their livings. Many of these aredirectly based on nature\u2014like small-scale farming and livestock-rearing, fishing, hunting, and collecting of firewood, herbs, orother natural products. These may be sold for cash or useddirectly for food, heat, building materials, or innumerable otherhousehold needs. This \"environmental income\" is added toother income sources such as wage labor and remittances sentfrom family members who have emigrated. The decline ofnatural systems through soil depletion, deforestation, overex-ploitation, and pollution represents a direct threat tonature-based income and is a contributor to increasing poverty .(See Chapter 2 for a thorough discussion of how ecosystemscontribute to the livelihoods of the poor.) Common Pool Natural Resources Are a Key Source of Subsistence The poor make extensive use of goods collected from lands or waters over which no one individual has exclusive rights\u2014resources known generally as common pool resources (CPRs) orsimply the \"commons\" (Jodha 1986:1169; in many different ecosystems andunder a variety of public or community ownership regimes.Typical examples include village pastures, state or communityforests, waste lands, coastal waters, rivers, lakes, village ponds,and the like (Jodha 1986:1169). Materials gleaned from CPRs consist of a wide range of items for personal use and sale including food, fodder, fuel, fiber,small timber, manure, bamboos, medicinal plants, oils, andbuilding materials for houses and furniture. Fish, shellfish,seaweed, and other items harvested from coastal waters, rivers,and other aquatic environments are also of major importance tothe poor. Nearly all rural families\u2014both rich and poor\u2014benefitfrom CPR income, but it is particularly important to landlesshouseholds, for whom it provides a major fraction of totalincome. Researchers estimate that common pool resourcesprovide about 12 percent of household income to poor house-holds in India\u2014worth about $5 billion a year, or double theamount of development aid that India receives (Beck andNesmith 2001:119). When access to common pool resources is unrestricted, as it is often is, it is difficult to keep them from being overexploited.Degradation of open access resources in the form of overfishing,deforestation, and overgrazing is an increasing burden on thepoor\u2014a trend that leads away from wealth. Natural Resources Are Vital Social Safety Nets During Lean Times Natural resources play a key role as a subsistence source of last resort in times of economic decline and when other food suppliesare constrained. In southeastern Ghana, for example, recessionand drought in 1982 and 1983 coincided with the normal leanseason\u2014the time before harvest when food supplies are naturallylow. During this lean season, the poorest households dependedon the \"bush\" for 20 percent of their food intake, compared tothe highest income bracket, for which the bush provided only 2percent of the household food intake. Women and children inparticular relied on wild products such as roots, fibers, leaves,bark, fruit, seeds, nuts, insects, and sap. Men also hunted andtrapped small mammals, reptiles, and birds (Dei 1992:67). Environmental Factors Add to the Health Burden of the Poor Environmental risks such as unclean water, exposure to indoor air pollution, insect-borne diseases, and pesticides account foralmost a quarter of the global burden of disease, and an even 13CHAPTER 1 NATURE, POWER, AND POVERTY FIGURE 1.2 CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY Source: Thornton et al. 2002:89 Continues on page 16Changes in Projected Growing Season, 2000-2050jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 1314TO BE OFFICIALLY POOR IN INTERNATIONAL TERMS is to live below the World Bank's poverty line of US$1 perday. In actuality, the incomes of poor people vary by nationand by region, but by definition always add up to less thanwhat is needed to make ends meet. To be poor is to have tochoose among a range of necessities, not all of which youcan afford. Food, shelter, health care, clothes, fuel, trans-portation, and tools or equipment needed for work are allbasic expenditures vying for the limited family budget. Socialobligations such as weddings, funerals, and gifts add tothese basic needs. With little means and many needs, whatdo you spend your income on? The Necessities Food is the primary and immediate concern, and by far themajor expense, for poor households. Studies show that thepoorer the household, the greater the percentage of incomespent on food. This is in spite of the fact that the poor oftengrow some of their own food. In Tanzania, the average ruralhousehold survived on just 32 cents a day in 2001, with 21 cents\u201465 percent\u2014going for food (National Bureau ofStatistics of Tanzania 2002:68-70). Food spending amongthe poor shows similar patterns in other regions: foodpurchases account for 60 percent of household spending inrural Morocco ($0.37/day) (World Bank 2001:4, Table 5) and75 percent ($0.50/day) in Georgia (Yemtsov 1999:15, Table5, 42). By comparison, a family in the United States spendsan average of 14 percent of the household budget on food(U.S. Dept. of Labor 2004:4). With food accounting for so large a share of daily finances, other critical necessities must receive proportionately less\u2014often only pennies a day. Housing and the fuel or electricityto heat and cook with, for example, account for only 12percent of spending among Argentina's poor (Lee 2000:8,Table 2). Health care, another priority for low-incomefamilies, receives only three cents of every dollar spent byMorocco's rural poor, the same amount spent in rural Georgia(World Bank 2001:9, Table 17; Yemtsov 1999:15, Table 5).Clothing and transportation costs account for a similarly smallshare of the daily dollar.BOX 1.2 LIFE ON A DOLLAR A DAY A family of four interviewed in rural Bangladesh calculated that they spent roughly 80 cents a day on food and fuel, allowing them to buy andcook two meals of rice and beans, as well as an occasional piece ofmeat. Medical costs came to 3.3 cents a day ($12 per year), mainly onmedicines for the husband's coughs and colds. Other family expensesincluded 4.1 cents per day on clothes ($15 per year), 1.6 cents onschool books ($6 per year), and 2.2 cents ($8 per year) visiting andgiving presents to relatives. Family health and food costs thusaccounted for more than 90 percent of the household's basic expenses(Rutherford 2002:10).WHAT CAN YOU BUY FOR A DOLLAR?

Thus there are a great manythings that the poor cannot afford to buy. Tools, materials,and upkeep for income-generating assets like transportationor farm equipment are all expenses that are routinely left outof the family budget. To cover gifts, dowries, and funerals\u2014expenses at the heart of many social structures andcustoms\u2014the poor must often sell what little land or livestockassets they have (Narayan et al. 2000a:149-150). Furniture,stylish clothing, or appliances\u2014all items taken more or lessfor granted in the developed world\u2014are largely an extrava-gance. Investments in hard assets or insurance to cushionagainst future hardships are even more difficult to afford.With no insurance or provision for emergencies, an alreadymarginal income becomes an even more precarious founda-tion for the future. Poverty often means not being able to take advantage of opportunities and investments that are open to others withmore secure incomes. Education is a good example. Althoughthe benefit of an education can dramatically increase achild's chance of leaving poverty, a poor family's budget doesnot always permit this. School costs can include tuition,supplies, and the loss of labor that the child could havecontributed had he or she stayed home (Narayan et al.2000b:242-244). Other investments that require savings orstart-up capital are also out of reach, such as launching asmall business, buying fertilizer or a fishing boat, or adver-tising to reach a wider market. Lacking such investmentability, the poor are often confined to subsistence activitiesand low-value wage labor that make it hard to get ahead. /orn8flip 15WHAT THE RURAL POOR SPEND IN MOROCCO Daily Per Capita Expenditures of Rural, Low-Income Individuals in Morocco 1998/99 (US$) Amount Spent % jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 15greater proportion of the health burden of the poor (Cairncross et al. 2003:2; Lvovsky 2001:1). The poor are farmore likely to be exposed to environmental health risks thanthe rich by virtue of where they live. They also have much lessaccess to good health care, making their exposure more damag-ing. In turn, poor health is an important obstacle to greaterincome and a contributor to diminished well-being in everydimension of life. (See Box 1.3.) Climate Change Adds to the Vulnerability of the Poor The adverse impacts of climate change will be most striking in developing nations\u2014and particularly among the poor\u2014bothbecause of their high dependence on natural resources andtheir limited capacity to adapt to a changing climate. Waterscarcity is already a major problem for the world's poor, andchanges in rainfall and temperature associated with climatechange will likely make this worse. Even without climatechange, the number of people impacted by water scarcity isprojected to increase from 1.7 billion today to 5 billion by 2025(IPCC 2001:9). In addition, crop yields are expected to decline in most tropical and sub-tropical regions as rainfall and temperaturepatterns change with a changing climate (IPCC 2001:84). (See Figure 1.2.) A recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that developing nations may experi-ence an 11 percent decrease in lands suitable for rainfedagriculture by 2080 due to climate change (FAO 2005:2).There is also some evidence that disease vectors such asmalaria-bearing mosquitoes will spread more widely (IPCC2001:455). At the same time, global warming may bring anincrease in severe weather events like cyclones and torrentialrains. The inadequate construction and exposed locations ofpoor people's dwellings often makes them the most likelyvictims of such natural disasters. Nature as an Economic Stepping Stone Nature has always been a route to wealth, at least for a few.Profit from harvesting timber and fish stocks, from convertinggrasslands to farm fields, and from exploiting oil, gas, andmineral reserves has created personal fortunes, inspired stockmarkets, and powered the growth trajectories of nations forcenturies. But this scale of natural resource wealth has beenamassed mostly through unsustainable means, and the benefitshave largely accrued to the powerful. It is the powerful whogenerally control resource access through land ownership orconcessions for logging, fishing, or mining on state lands; whocommand the capital to make investments; and who cannegotiate the government regulatory regimes that direct the useof natural resources. The poor, by contrast, have reapedprecious little of the total wealth extracted from nature. Butthat can change.Natural Resources Are a Key Determinant of Rural Wealth Even though they do not currently capture most of the wealth created by natural systems, the livelihoods of the poor are builtaround these systems. Indeed, natural resources are the funda-mental building block of most rural livelihoods in developingnations, and not just during lean times. Chapter 2 offers manyexamples of the environmental income that both the poor andrich derive from nature. The ability to efficiently tap the productivity of ecosys- tems is often one of the most significant determinates ofhousehold income. For example, studies show that the keyvariable explaining income levels for rural households inUganda is access to land and livestock. In Ugandan villagesnear Lake Victoria, the key variable explaining wealth is accessto fishing boats and gear. Income-wise, these are found to beeven more important than other wealth-associated factors suchas access to education (Ellis and Bahiigwa 2003:1003). Beyond Subsistence: Natural Endowments as Capital for the Poor Ecosystem goods and services\u2014the natural products and processes that ecosystems generate\u2014are often the only signifi-cant assets the poor have access to. These natural endowments,if managed efficiently , can provide a capital base\u2014a founda-tion for greater economic viability , and a stepping stonebeyond mere subsistence. Yet the potential of these assets isoften overlooked. 16WORLD RESOURCES 2005 jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 1617Typical commercial evaluation of natural resources tends to undervalue the total array of ecosystem goods and services,which includes not just the crops, lumber, fish, and forage thatare the usual focus of exploitation, but also a wide variety ofother collectibles, agroforestry products, small-scale aquacultureproducts, as well as services such as maintenance of soil fertility ,flood control, and recreation (Lampietti and Dixon 1995:1-3;Pagiola et al. 2004:15-19). One of the consequences of the difficulty of assigning a monetary value to ecosystem benefits isthat it has led to the systematic undervaluation of the assets ofthe poor and the underestimation of the potential benefits ofimproved environmental management. But the potential for strategic management of ecosystems to raise the incomes of the poor is real. In fact, good ecosystemmanagement can become one of the engines of rural economicgrowth more generally . Experience shows that the poor useseveral strategies to make their ecosystem assets a stepping stoneout of poverty . Restoring Productivity Where ecosystems are degraded, it limits their potential as asource of environmental income. Many communities have foundthat restoring the productivity of local forests, pastures, orfisheries has the opposite effect, raising local incomes substan-tially . Often this entails a community effort to more carefullycontrol the use of common property areas and even privatelands. For example, the village of Sukhomajri in Haryana, India,has gained widespread recognition for its success in raisingvillage incomes through community efforts to restore andmaintain the productivity of local forests and farmland. Carefulland management and rainwater harvesting produced largegains in agricultural production, tree density , and availablewater, increasing annual household incomes by 50 percent in fiveyears (Agarwal and Narain 1999:16). Many other watershed management projects in India have also reported benefits to village residents, including poorfamilies who do not own land. In the Adgaon watershed inMaharashtra, annual days of employment (wage labor) perworker increased from 75 days at the project's inception to over200 days after restoration was complete. In Mendhwan Village,laborers found eight months of agricultural work per year afterfour years of watershed management, compared with onlythree months before the community began its restoration andmanagement project (Kerr et al. 2002:56). Marketing Niche Products and Services One common way to translate ecosystem assets into economicgain is to create or take advantage of niche markets for nontim-ber forest products, such as bamboo, mushrooms, herbs, andother collectibles. In Nam Pheng village in northwestern Laos,villagers began a cooperative effort in 1996 to expand themarket for bitter bamboo and cardamom. They created acoordinated management plan for sustainable harvest of thesetraditional products, improved the harvest technology , andestablished a marketing group to both increase sales and obtain higher prices for their wares. By 2001 a day's harvest of bitterbamboo brought ten times the wages of slash-and-burn cultiva-tion, which had been the villagers' main livelihood activity(Morris 2002:10-24). (See Table 1.2.) By 2002, harvesting bitter bamboo and cardamom provided the main source of income for most villagers and thecommunity had made considerable progress toward higherincomes and more secure livelihoods. (See Figure 1.3.) The village poverty rate had fallen by more than half, food securityhad increased, and the mortality rate for children under five hadfallen to zero. In addition, enough community funds from thejoint marketing group had been raised to build a school, prompt-ing school enrollment to double, with more than half of thestudents being girls. While the income potential from bambooand cardamom is not unlimited, it has clearly provided astepping stone to larger capital investments, such as livestock,and allowed villagers to diversify their income sources. It has alsobrought villagers an appreciation of the forest as an economicasset, providing an incentive for long-term care of the forestecosystem (Morris 2002:10-24). In addition to marketing forest products like bamboo, poor households can find substantial income marketing ecosystemservices, such as recreation. In Namibia, communities havesuccessfully tapped the ecotourism trade built around viewingand hunting the area's springbok, wildebeest, elephants,giraffes, and other animal populations. To accomplish this, thecommunities have formed legally constituted \"conservancies\" toregulate the hunting, sightseeing, camping, and other activitiesthat affect local wildlife. The conservancies have generateddirect benefits ranging from jobs and training to cash and meatpayouts to community members. In 2004, total communityCHAPTER 1 NATURE, POWER, AND POVERTY TABLE 1.2 BITTER BAMBOO AND CARDAMOM VS.

Studies have documented that, over the course of 10 years,the conservancies have enhanced the livelihood security oflocal people while spurring major recoveries in wildlifepopulations (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:v-vi;Vaughan et al. 2003:18-19). Capturing a Greater Share of the Natural Resource ValueMaximizing environmental income involves not only improvedresource management or creation of new markets for nontradi-tional or underexploited products. It also requires greaterattention to marketing traditional products such as fish, so thatmore of the revenue generated is captured by the fishersthemselves in the form of higher prices for their harvests. InKayar, a community along the coast of Senegal, local fishersworked together to regulate their fish catch, with the idea ofstabilizing the catch and insuring a good price at market(Lenselink 2002:43). By limiting the quantity of fish each boatowner could deliver to market each day , they successfully raisedfish prices to the point that fishers had surplus income to save. Atthe same time, fish stocks were better managed by limiting thenumber of fishers allowed in a given area, the number of fishingtrips allowed per day , and the kinds of permissible fishing gear(Lenselink 2002:43; Siegel and Diouf 2004:4, 6). The Kayarfishers made economics and ecosystem management work handin hand. ( See the case studies in Chapter 5 for other examples of how communities have used better ecosystem management to improve theireconomic prosperity and reduce poverty.) The examples described above involved a different under- standing of nature's wealth from the conventional view oflarge-scale extraction\u2014a different view of what natural wealthis, how it can best be tapped, and who is to benefit from it.Ecosystem Management as a Basis for Agriculture Growth, Rural Diversification, andGeneral Economic Growth Making ecosystems work as an economic asset for the poor should be seen not as an isolated goal but part of a larger strat-egy for rural development. Utilizing the natural assets of thepoor is not a \"silver bullet\" for poverty reduction that can single-handedly bring wealth to poor families. It is rather part of ageneral transition of rural economies from subsistence to wealthaccumulation, working first to support a more profitable small-scale agriculture and natural resource economy\u2014the currentmainstays of rural livelihoods\u2014and eventually to build acomplementary rural industrial and service economy (WorldBank 2003:xix-xxvi). Agriculture is a particularly important piece of the rural poverty equation. There is a well-established connectionbetween improvements in small-scale agriculture and povertyreduction. One study in Africa found that a 10 percent increasein crop yields led to a 9 percent decrease in the number ofpeople living on $1 per day (Irz et al. 2001 in World Bank2003:xix). Indeed, rapid agricultural growth is considered aprimary avenue for poverty alleviation (Smith and Urey2002:71). From the 1960s to the1980s, the Green Revolution'suse of modern seeds and fertilizers, irrigation, better credit,roads, and technical assistance helped bring this kind of rapidagricultural growth to many rural areas, with a correspondingreduction in poverty . For example, from 1965 to 1991\u2014theperiod of greatest Green Revolution gains\u2014rural poverty ratesin India declined from 54 percent of the population to 37percent (Smith and Urey 2002:17). But spreading the Green Revolution's success to the poor families and the marginal lands it has by-passed will requiresomething more than the technocratic approach of those earlier 18WORLD RESOURCES 2005 051015202530 Well-off Middle Poor Wealth ds1996 2002Well-off : Permanent house, equi d accessories (e. g., truck, TV/V CR); enou gh money an d rice for one year; some livestock; an d enou gh labor.

It will also require good ecosystem management by the poor that helps build and retain soil fertility and allows smallfarmers to harvest and efficiently use water resources. Failure totake this approach has resulted in fertility loss, salinization, andoverdrafting of groundwater on many of the Green Revolutionfarms\u2014environmental problems that have begun to erodeproductivity gains in many areas (Smith and Urey 2002:10). Sustained agricultural growth, augmented by other forms of environmental income, from forest products to forage to aquacul-ture, can help many poor rural families to create an asset base thatallows them to begin the transition away from sole dependence onfarming and nature-based activities. Research shows that asgrowth proceeds, agriculture eventually begins to play a lesscrucial role in the overall development process and subsequentlydeclines as a share of economic output (Timmer 1988:276, 279).Rural residents begin to depend more on rural industry and so-called \"off-farm\" income, which provide an additional andquicker route out of poverty to complement agriculture. But even as rural economies slowly diversify , nature will still play an important role. Many rural industries\u2014such as localprocessing of agriculture or fishing products, crafts production,and ecotourism\u2014will themselves be indirectly dependent onnatural resources. They will thus benefit from a sound approachto ecosystem management. For example, when the shrimp-processing company Aqualma was established in 2000 in aremote corner of Madagascar, it brought permanent jobs to1,200 rural workers, most of whom had never held a wage-paying job. But Aqualma's future relies entirely on sound fishingpractices that insure a continuing shrimp supply . In other words,a good relationship to ecosystems and environmental incomesupports many dimensions of rural growth and is beneficial atseveral points in the economic evolution of the rural poor fromsubsistence to wealth (World Bank 2003:xxii). Better Governance Is Vital for Higher Incomes Maximizing environmental income for the poor requires changes in the governance of natural resources. The need forsuch changes is pressing because the poor are at a great disad-vantage when it comes to controlling natural resources or thedecisions surrounding them. They often lack legal ownership ortenure over land and resources, which restricts their access andmakes their homes and livelihoods insecure. They also sufferfrom a lack of voice in decision-making processes, cutting themout of the decision-making loop. Natural-resource corruptionfalls harder on the poor as well, who may be the victims of bribe-demanding bureaucrats or illegal logging and fishing facilitatedby corrupt officials who look the other way . The poor are alsosubject to a variety of policies\u2014such as taxes and various regula-tions\u2014that are effectively anti-poor. These governance burdens make it hard for poor families to plan effectively , to make investments that might allow them to profitfrom their assets or skills, or to work together effectively to manage common areas or create markets for their products. In other words,governance burdens quickly translate to economic obstacles. Tenure Security is a Primary Obstacle Ownership and access are the most fundamental keys to thewealth of nature. Unfortunately , many poor people do not ownthe land or fishing grounds they rely on for environmentalincome. This lack of secure tenure makes them vulnerable tobeing dispossessed of their homes and livelihoods, or, if they renthomes or land, subject to sometimes exorbitant rent payments. The importance of tenure\u2014or the lack of it\u2014to the ability to tap nature's wealth can't be stressed too much. The rights toexploit, sell, or bar others from using a resource\u2014the bundle ofrights associated with tenure or ownership\u2014are essential to legalcommerce. Ownership also provides an incentive to manageecosystems sustainably by assuring that an owner will be able tocapture the benefits of long-term investments like soil improve-ments, tree planting, or restricting fishing seasons to keep fishstocks viable. Tenure issues affecting the poor involve not only private ownership of land, but also the use of common lands. Many areasCHAPTER 1 NATURE, POWER, AND POVERTY Continues on page 23 jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 19GOOD HEALTH IS A BASIC COMPONENT OF HUMAN well-being and a necessity for earning a livelihood.Unfortunately, the poor are much more vulnerable to ill health,and ill health is itself an important factor in reinforcing thepoverty cycle. The health vulnerability of the poor has manyfacets, with environmental exposure being one of these faces. Health as an Asset Good health is among the most valuable assets the poorpossess. Not only is good health essential to almost anyincome-generating activity, but most of the other assets of thepoor\u2014such as livestock and farmland\u2014yield few returnswithout the physical capacity to maintain or use them (Barrettand McPeak 2003:8; Lawson 2004:20). Individuals who aresick or disabled are less likely to be hired for wage work, mayhave difficulty working effectively, and will often be paid lessfor their services (Narayan et al. 2000:96). Ill health is not just the lack of an asset, but a negative asset. Having a household member fall ill can destroy a poor family'sstandard of living. Household and village-level studies showthat the illness of a key income-earner\u2014a so-called \"healthshock\"\u2014is one of the leading causes of a household's declineinto abiding poverty (Krishna 2004:11; Lawson 2004:3). Theimmediate loss of income is only the start: health bills canmount quickly and create an urgent need for cash, and sincethe poor possess few liquid assets that can be used for suchemergencies, they may have to sell land or items central tosustaining their livelihoods. Families facing a health shock veryoften fall into substantial debt, from which they can onlyemerge with difficulty. One common coping strategy is to pullchildren out of school and send them to work, depriving themof training they will need in the future to keep themselves outof poverty (Narayan et al. 2000:98). Elevated Risk of the Poor The poor are more likely to suffer serious illness during theirlifetime. They tend to live in higher-risk areas, with greaterexposures to pollution, disease agents, and natural hazardssuch as floods. They also tend to work more dangerous jobs andhave less access to services than the wealthy. Once ill, theyface greater challenges in receiving adequate care. A shortageof trained health personnel and gaps in clinics and hospitalsmay mean that the poor must travel substantial distances andwait in long lines to receive treatment, particularly in rural areas(Narayan et al. 2000:72, 95; World Bank 2004:135). Corruption in the public health care sector is also widely reported among the poor in the developing world. Patients maybe forced to pay for services and medicines that should be free,and are turned away or given inferior care if they cannot affordto pay (Narayan et al. 2000:102;World Bank 2001:83). InPakistan, a survey found that 96 percent of patients reportedsome type of corruption associated with visiting the local hospital, such as having to pay extra for beds, X-rays, tests, ormedicines (Transparency International 2002:22). As a result,the public health care system is often the last resort of the poor,and many avoid using it at all (Narayan et al. 2000:100;Narayan and Petesch 2002:33-34).Box 1.3 HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND POVERTY 2046% 33%11%5%5% Unsafe water, sanitation, andhygiene Indoor smoke fromsolid fuels Lead exposure Urban air pollution Climate change The Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is a statistical measure of the human costs of sickness in terms of the number of healthy years lost toillness and disability (Ezzati et al. 2004: 2142-3). Time spent in poor healthwill translate into a loss of income, making the DALY a helpful measure of theimpact of health hazards upon the livelihoods of the poor. Source: Ezzati et al. 2004:2144-45 Serious back problems required a hospital stay for Susan, a poor Kenyanfarmer. Even before purchasing medicines, Susan's hospital bill cost herUS$27 (2,100 Kenyan shillings). She sold her only 2 goats, her bean cropfrom the previous year, kitchen utensils, and her few pieces of furnitureto raise the money. Even if her back recovers, Susan has been reduced todestitution, and will be hard-pressed to earn a livelihood. Her friendsremain as her only source of help in the future (Hamilton 2003:21).THE HIGH PRICE OF ILL HEALTHDALYs ATTRIBUTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RISKSjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 2021Hunger Malnutrition is the leading health risk among the poor, accounting for 1 in 15 deaths globally (WHO 2002:54). Ofthe 1.1 billion people living below the \"dollar-a-day\" thresh-old, 780 million suffer from chronic hunger (FAO et al.2002:8). Because they are often marginalized in society,women and female children in particular may eat last and eatless than the principal breadwinner in the family.Undernourishment of women and children alone accounts foralmost 10 percent of the global burden of disease (WHO2002:54; Economist 2004:68). Hunger is not only an outcome of poverty but a prime cause for remaining in poverty. Chronically hungry people are lessproductive at whatever labor they are able to obtain, and thusfind it harder to accumulate the financial capital they need totake them out of poverty (FAO et al. 2002:10). The effects ofpoverty reach across generations as well. Children sufferingfrom malnutrition may suffer physical stunting and impededcognitive development, and are more susceptible to other formsof disease, both during youth and later in life. An estimated 40-60 percent of children in developing countries suffer from irondeficiencies severe enough to impede cognitive development(Economist 2004:68; WHO 2001:7-8). These disabilities arelikely to limit their capacity to generate income in the future,extending the cycle of poverty for yet another generation (FAO2002:10; WHO 2002:53). Environmental Health Environmental hazards comprise a significant portion of thehealth risks facing the poor. By one estimate, environmentalcauses account for 21 percent of the overall burden of diseaseworldwide (the combination of days spent sick and deaths dueto sickness) (WHO 2002 in Cairncross et al. 2003:2). Acuterespiratory infections and diarrhea rank among the highestcontributors to the disease burden in the developing world, andthese are mostly diseases of the poor (WHO 2002:83). A disproportionate share of environmental health risk is borne by the very young. Although children under five constitute just10 percent of the world's population, they suffer 40 percentof the environment-related burden of disease. Diarrhea,caused by unclean water and inadequate sanitation, isresponsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.8 million peopleworldwide each year, 1.6 million of which are children underfive (Gordon et al. 2004:14). Respiratory ailments are caused in large part from exposure to high levels of indoor smoke from cooking with dung, wood, orother biomass fuels. More than half the world's population\u20143.5 billion people\u2014currently depend on such fuels as theirmain energy source (Desai 2004:vii). Analysis by theInternational Energy Agency shows that this dependence willlikely increase in the years ahead, with an additional 200million people\u2014most of them poor\u2014relying on these fuels by2030 (IEA 0102030405060708090100 Africa Latin AmericaSouth-East AsiaIncome of less than $1/ day Income of $1-$2/ day Income of more than $2/ day Percent of Po pulation Ex posed to Indoor Air PollutionPercent of Po pulation Without Access to an Im proved Water SourceAfrica Latin AmericaSouth-East AsiaEnvironmental risk factors in countries with high a dult an d childhood mortality Source: Blakely 2004:1990, 1992, 2003THE ARE MORE RISKSjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 21Indoor air pollution is linked to over 1.6 million deaths a year, 500,000 of them in India alone. More than half of those whodie of respiratory infections related to indoor air pollution arechildren under the age of five (Warwick and Doig 2003:2). Inurban areas, ambient air pollution from auto exhaust, indus-trial smoke stacks, dust, and other particulates is also asignificant health risk. Ambient air pollution causes some800,000 deaths a year, most of them in the developing world(WHO 2002:69). Looking to the future, climate change comprises a consider- able environmental health risk, since it can intensify existingenvironmental health threats. Vector-borne diseases such asmalaria, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, and Chagas diseasecould expand their ranges as temperature and rainfall patternschange. Mosquitoes are among the first organisms to expandtheir range when climate conditions become favorable, socases of malaria and dengue fever may increase their alreadyheavy toll among the poor (WRI et al.1998:70). Diarrhealorganisms are also sensitive to changes in temperature andhumidity, with the health risk they pose increasing as averagetemperatures rise. A study in Peru found that hospital admis-sions for diarrhea increased as much as 12 percent for every 1 degree C increase in temperature (McMichael et al.2003:215). On a broader scale, the World Health Organizationestimates that in 2000, climate change was responsible for2.4 percent of all cases of diarrhea and 2 percent of all casesof malaria worldwide (WHO 2002:72). The Scourge of AIDS AIDS poses one of the most potent health threats to poor house-holds. High rates of infection are common in many of thepoorest nations in Africa and Asia, and the disease has begunto ravage rural household economies in many areas. When AIDSstrikes a family member\u2014particularly a key wage-earner\u2014it admin isters the kind of health shock that often drives the family into profound poverty. In the Tanzanian village ofKagabiro, households with an AIDS patient spent between 29 and 43 percent of household labor on AIDS-related duties\u2014time that previously was available for earning money (Tibaijuka1997 in Stover and Bollinger 1999:5). A study in C\u00f4te d'IVoirefound that when a family member with AIDS died or movedaway for treatment, average consumption in the family fell byas much as 44 percent the following year due to loss of income(Bechu 1998 in Stover and Bollinger 1999:4). Research onAIDS-afflicted families in rural Ethiopia found that the averagecost of medical treatment, funeral, and mourning expensesamounted to several times the average household income(Demeke 1993 in Stover and Bollinger 1999:4).AIDS also has profound effects on food security. In eastern Africa, AIDS-related labor shortages have led to lower cropyields, smaller amounts of land being cultivated, and a movefrom cash crops to subsistence crops, as the rural agriculturaleconomy retrenches. /orn8flip 22 Box 1.3 HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND POVERTYjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 2223CHAPTER 1 NATURE, POWER, AND POVERTY under state ownership provide the resource base for poor commu- nities, but these communities often have no legal basis for their useof common pool resources. In many instances, these resources\u2014whether they are forests, grazing areas, or fishing grounds\u2014havebeen governed locally for centuries under traditional forms of\"communal tenure,\" in which resources are owned in common bya group of individuals, such as a village or tribe. Unfortunately , such customary arrangements are often not legally recognized, and conflicts between communal tenure andmodern state-recognized ownership frequently threaten rurallivelihoods. State recognition of such traditional ownershiparrangements or new power-sharing agreements between localcommunities and the state that grant specific rights to use andprofit from the state commons are often important ingredients insuccessful efforts to tap the wealth of natural systems (Meinzen-Dick and Di Gregorio 2004:1-2).Lack of Voice, Participation, and Representation When important decisions about local resources are made, thepoor are rarely heard or their interests represented. Often thesedecisions, such as the awarding of a timber concession on stateforest land that may be occupied by poor households, are madein the state capitol or in venues far removed from rural life. Evenif they could make it to these decision-making venues, thepoor\u2014and other rural residents as well\u2014would still be unlikelyto find a seat at the table. The right for local resource users toparticipate in resource decisions is still a relatively new conceptin most areas and often not embodied in law. Language barriers,ignorance of their legal rights, and a lack of full informationabout how resource decisions are likely to affect them are alsopotent obstacles to the participation of the poor. Lack of money ,of political connections, and of lawyers or other advocates thatcan articulate their needs are all sources of political isolation andmarginalization (WRI et al. 2003:44-64). jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 23The Wealthy Dominate the Economic Machinery Wealthier landowners and traders tend to dominate the resources and economic tools necessary to turn natural resources to wealth.In addition to owning more and better land, livestock, farmmachinery , boats, or other assets directly relevant to profiting fromecosystems, the rich also tend to have greater access to resourceslike irrigation water, seed, fertilizers, pest control, and labor(Narayan and Petesch 2002:58-59, 188; Narayan et al. 2000:49-50; Kerr et al. 2002:61). The wealthy also have easier access tocredit, which is a key constraint for the poor wishing to improvetheir ecosystem assets by planting trees, undertaking soil or waterconservation projects, or developing new products or markets. These advantages are often magnified by the dense and inter- linked social networks in rural areas, which tend to reinforce thenear-monopoly position enjoyed by some wealthier families,leaving poorer families with fewer options and sometimes all-or-nothing choices (Bardhan 1991:240). For instance, surveys fromWest Bengal, India, found that laborers tied to their landlordsthrough credit were less likely to take part in group bargaining andagitation for raising rural wages. These indentured workers felt itwas a choice between a low wage or no job at all\u2014a cycle ofdependence that can be self-perpetuating (Bardhan 1991:240). Capture of State-Owned Natural Resources by the Elite\u2014Facilitated by Corruption In many cases, state-owned resources like forests and fisheries are opened to exploitation by granting individuals or companiesconcessional leases or harvest licenses. The wealthy are muchmore likely to be able to take advantage of these. In Bangladesh,the government leases rights to fish in state-owned water bodiesfor a period of one to three years through a public auctioningsystem that generates considerable revenue for the state.Unfortunately , poor fishermen can rarely afford to bid, so thelicenses are purchased by rich investors known as \"waterlords.\"These entrepreneurs hire fisher-men as daily laborers at lowwages, keeping most of the profitsfor themselves. This has led, ineffect, to the institutionalizedexploitation of the fishermen by asmall rural elite (B\u00e9n\u00e9 2003:964).In other instances, lease holderswill exclude the poor altogetherfrom their concession, eventhough they may have tradition-ally lived on and collected fromthese lands. This problem of the capture of state resources by the elite isworsened by corruption, politicalpatronage, and sweetheart dealsfor insiders. Such corruption andfavoritism often focuses on naturalresource concessions in remoteareas far from official concern and public scrutiny\u2014precisely those areas inhabited by the poor. In 2001, Bob Hasan,Indonesia's former Minister of Industry and Trade, wassentenced to prison for forest-related graft worth $75 million.For years, the timber magnate and close associate of formerPresident Suharto dominated Indonesia's lucrative plywoodtrade, at one point controlling nearly 60 percent of world tropi-cal plywood exports (Borsuk 2003:1; Barr 1998:2, 30). Apart from its role in enabling the elite capture of state resources, corruption also stands as a fundamental obstacle tothe sustainable management of resources and thus another wayin which the natural assets of the poor are diminished. Illegallogging and fishing are prime causes of the depletion ofcommon pool resources that the poor depend on, short-circuit-ing effective state management of ecosystems and underminingcustomary management arrangements at the village or triballevel as well (WRI et al. 2003:36-38). (See Figure 1.4.) Demands by local officials for bribes or other considerations for access toresources place a special burden on the poor and encourage low-income families to themselves engage in illegal logging, fishing,and other unsustainable resource uses. At a national level,corruption acts as a drag on the economy , behaving essentially asa tax on legitimate businesses. Research shows that corruptionsuppresses national economic growth\u2014one of the main require-ments for effective and widespread poverty reduction (Thomas etal. 2000:144-150). Anti-Poor Taxes and Regulations Work Against Economic Empowerment In many countries, natural resource-related activities such as timber extraction, fishing, grazing, small-scale agriculture,and water use are subject to controls and taxes that areregressive with respect to the poor. In China, grain farmers\u2014many of whom are poor\u2014until recently were obliged to sell 24WORLD RESOURCES 2005 0102030405060708090100 Education Health Lan d AdministrationPolice Ju diciaryPercent of Survey Res pondents Reporting Corru ption Nepal Bangladesh India Sri Lanka Pakistan Source: Transparency International 2002:2FIGURE 1.4 CORRUPTION BY SECTOR IN SOUTH ASIA, 2002jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 2425CHAPTER 1: NATURE, POWER, AND POVERTY the government a fixed quota of their production at below- market prices, essentially lowering their potential income(Ravallion and Chen 2004:21-22). In Uganda, householdsface a confusing array of resource-related taxes, which oftenappear arbitrary to rural families. These include taxes onactivities as diverse as smoking fish, growing maize, andslaughtering cows or goats (Ellis and Bahiigwa 2003:1008-1009). Around Lake Chad in central Africa, fishery fees arelevied by three distinct groups: by traditional authorities, bythe central government, and by soldiers (B\u00e9n\u00e9 2003:970).Such overlapping fees discourage low-income families fromengaging in market transactions that would help them gener-ate returns from their access to natural resources. In addition, well-intentioned environmental regulations are sometimes introduced in a draconian way that hurts thepoor. For example, there is evidence that China's 1998 ban ontree felling in the upper watersheds of the Yangtze and YellowRiver Basins has had very negative impacts on some poorhouseholds. The ban was meant to restore the health of thewatersheds and avoid repeating the disastrous floods on theYangtze that had occur red earlier that y ear. Howev er, expansion of the logging ban beyond state-owned forests into private andcollectively owned land has cost numerous jobs and restrictedlocal communities' access to forest products in these areas (Xu et al. 2002:6, 8). In Mali, a 1986 forest law banned bushfires, made felling of certain species illegal without ForestDepartment permission, and made wood-saving stoves compul-sory . In response, the wood trade was forced underground, andpoor people unable to pay fines levied against them had theirlivestock confiscated (Benjaminsen 2000:97, 99-100). The Environment as a Route to Democratic Governance The environment provides a powerful tool to promote democratic reform. Particularly among the poor, it offers aunique opening for localizing and building demand fordemocratic practices because of its connection with livelihoods.In turn, good environmental governance is essential to develop-ing, strengthening, and consolidating democracy in the world'spoorest nations because it is a prerequisite for the poor to realizegreater income from the environment. Counteracting the bias against the poor that is embedded in government policies, institutions, and laws will require significantpolitical change. That in turn demands greater access by thepoor to true participation, accurate information, and fair repre-sentation. The environment itself provides one effective route forthis needed transition to democratic decision-making. In count-less communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, controlover and use of natural resources are matters of everydaysurvival. These are governance issues with immediate bearing.The prospect of more equitable decisions about land andresources gives the ideals of democracy personal relevance to thepoor. And it provides a motive for the kind of public activism that brings political change. There are many examples of poor people organizing around environmental issues to prompt government action, gainrights, or call attention to gross inequities. The 1980s saw poorfishermen in the Indian state of Kerala organize to demand aseasonal ban on industrial trawlers that directly competed withlocal fishers and reduced their catch. Using tactics such as publicfasts, road blocks, and marches against the government, thefishers became a political force that eventually coaxed fisheriesmanagers to adopt a three-month seasonal ban on trawlers(Kurien 1992:238, 242-243). In Brazil's Amazon region, rubbertappers joined forces with the Indigenous People's Union to formthe Alliance of Forest Peoples in the mid-1980s, demandinggreater recognition of their resource rights. By 1995, their effortshad gained widespread support and the government designatedsome 900,000 ha of rainforest as Extractive Reserves (Brown andRosendo 2000: 216). Although initially the Green Belt Movement's tree planting activities did not address issues of democracy and peace, it soon became clear that responsible governance of the environment was impossible without democratic space. Therefore, the tree became a symbol for the democratic struggle in Kenya. Citizens were mobilized to challenge widespread abuses of power, corruption, and environmental mismanagement.... \u2014Wangari Muta Maathai, Kenyan Environmental Activist and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize Winner, from her Nobel Laureate Lecture Civil society in general has used the environment to great effect to push the process of democratization in regimes wherecivil liberties had been restricted. During the turn towardsdemocracy in Chile and East Asia in the 1980s, and EasternEurope in the 1990s, protests led by environment-focused civilsociety groups played an important role (McNeill 2000:347-348,WRI et al. 2003:67). For example, WAHLI, a prominentIndonesian environmental group, was one of the few NGOstolerated by the Suharto government in the 1980s (Steele 2005). The power of the environment as a stage for social action arose for two reasons. First, environmental problems wereserious and were widely known, and second, environmentalprotests were seen\u2014at least initially\u2014as less overtly \"political\"jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 25and hence were more tolerated by government authorities. This ability for the environmental movement to maneuver whereother civil society groups have not been given as much latitude isnow manifesting in China, where activity by environmentalNGOs is increasing (Economy 2005:1). Linking Environment and Governance in the Global Poverty Fight More than ever, national governments, international institutions, and donors are focused on poverty reduction. But their effortshave often given limited attention to the role of healthy ecosys-tems in providing sustainable livelihoods, and equally limitedattention to the importance of environmental governance inempowering the poor. The models of economic growth thatnations continue to rely on for poverty reduction\u2014job creationthrough increased industrialization, intensified large-scaleagriculture, industrial fishing fleets, and so on\u2014do not fullyappreciate the realities of rural livelihoods. For example, these strategies miss the fundamental fact that if ecosystems decline through poor governance, the assetsof the poor decline with them. Findings from the recentlyconcluded Millennium Ecosystem Assessment\u2014a five-yeareffort to survey the condition of global ecosystems\u2014confirmthat the burden of environmental decline already falls heavieston the poor (MA 2005:2). This often results in an immediatedrop in living standards\u2014a descent into greater poverty .This in turn precipitates migration from rural areas to urban slums or a resort to unsustainable environmental practices\u2014overfishing, deforestation, or depletion of soil nutrients\u2014forbare survival's sake. For this reason alone\u2014simply to preventan increase in poverty\u2014greater attention to ecosystem manage- ment and governance practices that serve the poor is vital. Thepromise that environment can be one of the engines of ruralgrowth is all the more reason to keep environment as a focalpoint in poverty reduction efforts. Refocusing the Millennium Development Goals One way to increase the profile of environment and governancein poverty reduction is to make them more dynamic players inthe global effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). The MDGs represent a new commitment by the worldcommunity to concentrate on poverty alleviation. Nations haveendorsed a limited set of universally accepted goals and time-bound targets, and have promised to measure progress towardthese goals and hold the community of nations accountable.Goal 7 of the MDGs recognizes the connection between environ-mental sustainability and poverty reduction, with a specific commitment to \"[i]ntegrate the principles of sustainable devel-opment into country policies and programs and reverse the lossof environmental resources\" (UN General Assembly 2001). Unfortunately , this sustainable development target is the least specific and the least understood by nations of all the MDGtargets, making it easy to pass over in favor of targets that are simpler to understand and measure, such as the provision of safedrinking water, or the reduction of infant mortality . In addition,no specific measures of governance (with the exception ofmeasuring the tenure security of urban slum dwellers) areincluded in the sustainable development target, so the essentialtie between a healthier environment and the governance ofnatural resources is missing. Furthermore, the idea that the sustainable development goal is basic to the achievement of all the other goals and central tolasting progress against poverty is acknowledged in the MDG struc-ture, but it is not elaborated in a way that guides nations to act orgives them adequate measures of how well they are integratingsustainable development principles in their work to meet the other MDGs (UNDP 2005:3-5). Addressing these important lacksrequires clearer guidance on the links between ecosystems, gover-nance, and each MDG, as well as an expanded slate of indicatorsthat better encompasses the governance dimension of these goals. Refocusing Poverty Reduction Strategies Much the same kind of criticism can be made of the process thatdeveloping countries are using to design their national efforts toreduce poverty . Guided by the World Bank, poor nations aredrawing up formal plans\u2014called poverty reduction strategy papers, or PRSPs\u2014that describe how they envision creating the conditionsfor growth and social development that will raise incomes andlower national poverty rates (Boj\u00f6 and Reddy 2003:3). PRSPs themselves represent a significant step toward pro- poor development. They arose out of the realization that thestructural economic reforms recommended in earlier decades bythe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\u2014policessuch as market liberalization and an emphasis on export-oriented trade\u2014have not yet produced enough growth in manypoor nations to result in sufficient progress against poverty (Reed2004:7-9). Therefore the Bank and the IMF have encouragedpoor nations to draw up their own blueprints for poverty reduc-tion through a process of national consultation. Beingself-generated, it is hoped these strategies will better engage poornations' poverty efforts and provide a guide for development aidfrom the World Bank and wealthy nations (IMF 2004:3). Just as with the Millennium De velopment Goals, h owever, the initial attempts at poverty reduction strategies have takenlittle note of the centrality of ecosystems in the lives ofthe poor and the need to enhance the ability of the poor togovern them as sustainable sources of income. For example, asurvey of initial PRSPs in 11 West African nations showed that they paid little attention to the small-scale fishing sector, even though this sector provides one of the major sources oflivelihoods for the poor in the region and is faced with adeclining resource base (FAO 2002:iv). More generally , analysishas shown that environmental concerns are often poorlymainstreamed in PRSPs. This is beginning to change as PRSPs mature from draft to final versions (Boj\u00f6 et al. 2004:xii). For example, Cambodia's WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:28 PM Page 2627poverty plan emphasizes the importance of increasing environ- mental income through community forestry and small-scalefisheries management, as well as better market access for smallfarmers (Cambodia PRSP 2002:53, 60-61). Still, few PRSPscontain quantified, time-bound targets for improved environmen-tal conditions or better resource management (Boj\u00f6 et al. 2004:xii). Since PRSPs provide a national roadmap to poverty reduction, it is particularly important that they do a better jobof highlighting the role of natural resources in rural develop-ment and prioritizing the need to strengthen local capacity tomanage ecosystems. This means they must grapple with theissue of how best to devolve control over natural resources tolocal communities in a way that empowers the poor rather thansimply transferring power to local elites. PRSPs must also adopta long-term perspective that identifies lasting poverty reductionwith sustainability , rather than focusing totally on short-termeconomic growth. Typically , PRSPs do not reflect long-termstrategic thinking about the environment (Boj\u00f6 and Reddy2003:1, 9) or the consequences of possible environmentalchange from climate instability , land use change, pollution,population, or other forces. From Vulnerability to Wealth Progress on incorporating ecosystems and governance into theMillennium Development Goals and the PRSP process is onlya first step in the effort to make the environment a way out ofpoverty , rather than another source of vulnerability for the poor. Completing this transition will require much more. Itwill demand local institutions that are accessible to the poorand empowered to manage local ecosystems; secure tenurethat gives the poor a legal stake in good resource manage-ment; and viable models to commercialize nature-basedproducts and services, including access to credit, transporta-tion, and marketing savvy . And it will demand scientificguidance and technical help to optimize ecosystem manage-ment at low cost, and to ensure that local uses of nature donot threaten ecosystems at larger geographical scales and areconsistent with national environmental goals. Facilitating thismust be pro-poor political change that increases the account-ability of government officials and service providers to thepoor, and recognizes the potential role of the poor in nationaleconomic growth. The chapters that follow expand on these themes, provid- ing examples of the vital role that nature can play in povertyalleviation if governance, economic, and management factorsare aligned. In doing so, it shows how both social and environ-mental goals depend on each other for their achievement andmust be pursued simultaneously . World Resources 2005: The Wealth of the Poor is not only an exploration of the power of nature to provide sustainable livelihoods and support ruralgrowth that increases the incomes and options of the poor. It isequally an exploration of the power of nature as a meanstoward democratic change and greater social equity . /orn8flipCHAPTER 1 NATURE, POWER, AND POVERTY jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 27MANY OF THE OBSTACLES THE POOR FACE I N turning their natural assets into wealth manifest themselves at the local and national levels. But these governance andeconomic obstacles often have their roots in policies andpractices at the global level. The arenas of international trade,development aid, and international finance and investmentinfluence global poverty trends, in as much as they influencethe broad economic and political setting that poor people findthemselves in. Over the past five years, the controversy over the benefits and dangers of globalization has highlighted the power of interna-tional policies to affect poverty. This influence can be positive:inflows of capital, goods, and services to developing countriesexceeded US$2.5 trillion in 2003 (World Bank 2005). SeveralEast Asian countries like China, Korea, and Taiwan have usedexport-oriented trade to spur the economic growth that helpedmany of their citizens escape poverty. China has also attractedlarge quantities of foreign direct investment, another growthaccelerant. Remittances that immigrants to industrializedcountries send back home provide a vital source of funds formany developing nations. In addition, industrialized countriesprovide significant amounts of technical assistance and foreignaid to developing countries\u2014more than US$76 billion in 2003(World Bank 2005). But the fact remains that just as national power is generally controlled by a limited group of powerful individuals andcompanies, international economics and politics are alsodominated by a limited group of wealthier countries. Even whenbenefits to poor countries do occur, they tend to be restrictedto a few countries with the ability to compete in the global marketplace. In 2003 only ten percent of all exports fromdeveloping countries originated in the 61 nations classified as\"Low Income\" by the World Bank (World Bank 2005). The resulting inequality in global power can exacerbate the causes of rural poverty, dampen growth in developing nationeconomies, or encourage models of development that may beless effective at reducing poverty. This is why decisions madein industrialized countries are the focus of so much attention inthe worldwide debate over poverty reduction.

They typicallytake one of three forms: (1) Official aidincludes grant and loans by governmentsand international institutions to developingcountries to promote economic developmentand welfare; (2) foreign direct investment(FDI) is private investment in a foreigneconomy to obtain an ownership interest inan enterprise; (3) Worker's remittancesinclude the transfer of earned workers to their home country.jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 28The Effects of Private Investment Are Mixed Foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014the acquisition of an ownership interest in a private enterprise\u2014became the dominant route for money flowing from rich to poor countries after the liberaliza-tion of global financial markets in the 1970s (Oxfam 2002:11,15). In 2002 the overseas investments of 64,000 corporationssupported 53 million jobs worldwide (UNCTAD 2003:4). Private investment does not necessarily benefit the poor, however. In the past decade, 80 percent of the private investmentin developing countries has gone to just 15 countries\u2014and theyare not the world's poorest countries (World Bank 2005). In2003, for example, the 50 least-developed countries receivedonly 4 percent of private investment to developing countries(UNCTAD 2004:48; World Bank 2005). The investment environ-ment in poor countries is often unattractive, for they lack theeconomic stability, coherent legal system, and physical infra-structure that investors seek. In addition, FDI is typically channeled into infrastructure and larger-scale investments, rather than small or medium-scaleenterprises that might benefit the poor. Thus FDI investmentsmay help the poor in the long term, but have not been proven toreduce poverty in the near term. In Latin America, foreign privateinvestment has increased sixfold since 1981 due to expansion in the oil, gas, timber, water, and mining sectors. However, thepercentage of the population living below the poverty line has not changed significantly, and the absolute number of poor people inLatin America actually increased from 200 million in 1990 to225 million in 2003 (World Bank 2004; FAO 2004). Private investment can help developing nations acquire capital to fund domestic projects, receive new technology and skills,and improve productivity. Without proper regulations, however, itcan also increase economic volatility if investors lose interestand pull out. Economic volatility has historically hurt the poor.Since the 1970s, wages have declined in developing countriesduring economic contractions without expanding to previouslevels during periods of growth. An analysis of 32 developingcountries experiencing currency crises shows a total wage loss of$545 billion between 1980 and 1998; subsequent recoveriesonly offset about one-third of this loss (Oxfam 2002:33-36). International Aid Can Miss Its Target The international community plays an important role in providingtechnical and financial support to developing countries. From1998 to 2003, official development assistance increased bymore than one-third, to US$76 billion (World Bank 2005). Therehas been a concerted effort by donors in the last decade to focusmore on poverty reduction in the broadest sense, and most aidagencies are now actively working to support the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). 05101520253035 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001020406080100120140160180 Living on $2 a day or less Living on $1 a day or less P rivate investment D evelo pment assistancePercent of Po pulation in Poverty Foreign Investment per Capita (Current U S Dollars) 29FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, 1993-2002 Total Investment in Billion US Dollars Other Asia, $171 Europe, $185South America, $374Oceania, $2 China, $ 396 Middle East and North Africa, $4 3Sub-Saharan Africa, $67Central America an d Caribbean, $164 Source: World Bank 2005 TRENDS IN INVESTMENT AND POVERTY RATES, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, 1981-2001 Source: World Bank 2004, 2005jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 29Accompanying this move towards a greater poverty focus has been a shift by donors away from funding individual projects and towardmore programmatic support. While this is a welcome develop-ment, many countries still formally \"tie\" their aid, requiring it tobe used to purchase goods or professional services from the donorcountry. This has been estimated to reduce aid effectiveness byroughly 25 percent compared to untied aid (World Bank 2005). Technical assistance (TA) is earmarked in many aid packages to provide countries with the knowledge to utilize aid effectively; in2003 it accounted for more than 25 percent of all aid transfers.While TA can build capacity in developed countries, it can alsodivert much-needed funds away from their intended recipients.For example, records from the United Kingdom Department forInternational Development reveal that the 34 largest recipients ofits TA contracts are private firms in developed countries(Greenhill and Watt 2005:22). There has been an ongoing international campaign to reduce the debt that many low-income countries have accumulated over the years. Some debt relief has been forthcoming, but many argue that more is needed (UNDP 2003:14-15, 49). Advocates of development assistance worry, however, that aid agenciesmeasure debt relief in a way that exaggerates its importancerelative to other types of aid, since it does not represent actualmonetary transfers to a country or contribute directly to povertyreduction (Greenhill and Watt 2005:20). Agricultural Trade Policy Favors Industrialized Countries The world's existing trading system puts most developing countries at a disadvantage. Agricultural products, which makeup the main exports of many developing countries, still faceheavy tariffs in rich countries. It has been estimated that devel-oping countries would gain well over US$100 billion a year fromtrade liberalization resulting in reduced tariffs\u2014much more thanthey receive in current aid flows (Anderson 2004:14-15, 49). At the same time, rich countries often subsidize their own farmers and the agricultural products they sell abroad. Thesesubsidies enable the products to be sold on world markets atprices below the cost of production. Such \"dumping\" practicesdeprive developing countries of vital export markets and suppressworld agricultural commodity prices (Murphy et al. 2004:2-5).

That may be startingto shift, as shown by the coordinated action taken by develop-ing nations at the WTO's meeting in Cancun in 2003, wherethey refused to back down from their demands (CAFOD 2003).Nonetheless, wealthy nations continue to hold enormous trade advantages. Using export credit agencies, they invest millionsof dollars each year to build markets for their own exports(Maurer 2003:13). They also pursue bilateral trade agreementswith individual or small groups of developing nations.

Central to this is income , whether in the form of cash, or in the form of natural products directly consumed for subsistence, such as fish,fuel, or building materials. As this chapter will show, the rural poor derive a significant fraction of their total income from ecosystem goods and services. We refer to such nature-based income as environmental income . Because of their dependence on environmental income, the poor are especially vulnerable to ecosystem degradation.CHAPTER 2 jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 3334WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Of course, environmental income is not the only important component in rural livelihoods. A poor family's total income isgenerally derived from at least four different sources: environmental income (including small-scale agriculture), income from wage labor (such as agricultural labor) andhome businesses, remittances (money or goods sent from relatives outside thecommunity), and other transfer payments, such as assistance from state agencies.All these sources are important, and none can be ignored without losing sight of the reality of the rural economy .However, this chapter's primary concern is exploring how environmental income fits into rural livelihoods. This includesasking how important it is compared to other types of income,where it comes from, how it is obtained, and what role it plays inthe total livelihoods of the poor. Even though this chapter dwellsprimarily on income, it does so with the cognizance thatmaximizing income is only one component of a total livelihoods approach to development. How Important is Environmental Income? Environmental income\u2014the income generated from ecosystemgoods and services\u2014is a major constituent of the householdincomes of the rural poor. It includes income from naturalsystems such as forests, grasslands, lakes, and marine waters. Italso includes agricultural income\u2014the output of agroecosystems. Researchers often make a distinction between agricultural income and what in this report we term \"wild income\"\u2014thatis, income from less manipulated natural systems like forestsand fisheries. This distinction means that these two incomestreams are often counted and analyzed separately . Wildincome deserves special attention, since it is often the elementthat is not accurately accounted for in most considerations ofrural livelihoods. But both agricultural and wild income areimportant to an accurate assessment of the dependence of thepoor on ecosystems for income. In addition, there is overlapbetween the two, as in the use of forest grasses for livestockforage, or forest leaf litter as a soil amendment or crop mulch. Environmental income can be derived in several distinct ways. Income might accrue to households through direct use ofecosystem services, for instance, by consuming bushmeat andother wild foods, cutting fodder for livestock, using woodproducts in home construction, or eating produce grown in ahome garden. Where markets exist, goods harvested fromecosystems, such as fish, herbs, or fuelwood, can be sold for cashor exchanged for services like school tuition. In addition,communities may charge stumpage fees for providing loggersJust as the physical forms of ecosystems vary widely\u2014from delicate coral reefs to arid deserts\u2014so do the array of goods and services avail-able to local communities. The benefits that humans obtain fromecosystems fall into four main categories (MA 2003:53-60): Provisioning services comprise the production of basic goods such as crops and livestock, drinking and irrigation water, fodder, timber,biomass fuels, and fiber such as cotton and wool. Regulating services are the benefits obtained as ecosystem processes affect the physical and biological world around them. Theseservices include flood protection and coastal protection by mangrovesand reefs; pollination; regulation of water and air quality; the modula-tion of disease vectors; the absorption of wastes; and the regulation of climate. Cultural services are the nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflec-tion, recreation, and aesthetic experiences. These provide the basis forcultural diversity, spiritual and religious values, as well as the moreprosaic experience of tourism. Supporting services are those that are necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services. Their impacts are indirect or extend overlong time-scales. They include primary production of biomass throughphotosynthesis, soil formation, production of atmospheric oxygen, andnutrient cycling. WHAT ARE ECOSYSTEM GOODS AND SERVICES?

The income benefits ofthese public revenues may then be passed on to households inthe form of public infrastructure like roads, schools, and clinics,or public services like agricultural extension programs. Ecosystems have several characteristics that make them attractive as a source of income. Environmental resources arerenewable, widespread, and they are often found in commonproperty areas where the poor can access them without owningthe land (Cavendish 2000:1980). In addition, exploiting naturalsystems often can be done with little need for investment orexpensive equipment, making the cost of entry low\u2014an impor-tant consideration for poor families with limited assets. Important at Every Scale The importance of environmental income to the poor can bejudged at different scales. At the global scale, estimates ofnature's contribution to livelihoods are impressive. Forexample, the World Bank estimates that 90 percent of theworld's 1.1 billion poor\u2014those living on $1 per day or less\u2014depend on forests for at least some of their income (WorldBank 2002:1). Agriculture is likewise essential to poor families.Small-scale agriculture\u2014the kind the poor practice\u2014accountsfor more than 90 percent of Africa's agricultural production(Spencer 2001:1). In addition, over 600 million of the world'spoor keep livestock, a critical cash asset for many(IFAD et al. 2004:1). The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that over 90 percent of the 15 million people working the world's coastalwaters are small-scale fishers, most of them poor. That does notcount the tens of millions of the poor who fish inland rivers, lakes,ponds, and even rice paddies (FAO 2002 in Kura et al. 2004:35). (See Table 2.1.)At the national level, environmental income is also impor- tant, not only to the poor, but to national economies. Small-scalefisheries, for example, are not only common sources of income forthe impoverished but are major contributors to the economies ofmany nations. In Asia small-scale fisheries contributed 25 percentof the total fisheries production of Malaysia, the Philippines,Thailand, and Taiwan for the decade ending in 1997 (Kura et al.2004:38). In West Africa the importance of small-scale fishing isgreater still, constituting three-fourths of the region's al. 2004:39). In Indonesia, small-scale fishers areresponsible for almost 95 percent of the total marine catch (FAO2000a:2). (See Figure 2.1.) At the same time, export revenues from small-scale agricul- ture are vital to many poor nations. In Mali, cotton grown bysmall-holder farmers generates 8 percent of the nation's GDP and15 percent of all government revenues. Some 30 percent of allMalian households grow cotton on small plots, and it is secondonly to gold as the nation's most important export (Tefft 2004:1).CHAPTER 2 ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF GhanaNigeria GuineaCote d\u00edIvoire The GambiaMauritania Cape VerdeTotal catch artisanal catch) Artisanal FAO 2004FIGURE 2.1 ARTISANAL AND TOTAL CATCH FOR SELECTED WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES, 1996 Environmental Income is the value derived\u2014in cash or direct use\u2014 from ecosystem goods and services. As we use the term in this report, environmental income is the sum of two important income streams. Wild Income: Income from wild or uncultivated natural systems, such as forests, marine and inland fisheries, reefs, wetlands, and grass-lands. This includes commodities such as fish, timber, and nontimberforest products such as fuelwood, game, medicinals, fruits and otherfoods, and materials for handicrafts or art. It also includes incomefrom nature-based tourism, as well as payments that rural landownersmight receive for environmental services such as carbon storage orpreservation of watershed functions. Agricultural Income: Income from agroecosystems\u2014all agricul- tural lands, such as croplands, pastures, or orchards. In the contextof the poor, agricultural income is mostly generated through small-scale agriculture, including commodity crops, home gardens, andlarge and small livestock. Income from aquaculture would also fit inthis category. Environmental income could also reasonably include a third component: Mineral and Energy Income: Income from mining or extraction of oil, gas, hydrothermal energy, or hydroelectric energy. Large-scale mineraland energy exploitation is not usually a direct source of income for poorrural households, so in this report we do not consider this incomestream as part of rural livelihoods. We should note that other definitions of environmental income exist that are not as broad-reaching as ours (see Vedeld et al. 2004:5-6). Our aimis to account for all sources of income based on nature that figure intothe household budgets of the poor or can be tapped by them for sustain-able wealth creation. THE COMPONENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL INCOMEjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 3536WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Livelihoods are our means of everyday support and subsistence. As commonly conceived, a livelihood generates financial resources thatcome from employment or subsistence activities. But livelihoods alsodraw on other resources: human and social resources that give structureand context to our daily lives, as well as the natural and physicalresources that underpin our work. In the 1990s, development agenciesbegan to adopt this more holistic view of livelihoods, with the goal offocusing development activities more effectively. The UN DevelopmentProgramme's Human Development Reports in particular drew attention to human well-being\u2014defined by health, education, opportunity, a healthyenvironment, and a decent standard of living\u2014as the core of develop-ment practice (Solesbury 2003:vii). The United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) made the \"sustainable livelihoods approach\" a core principle of its devel-opment strategy in 1997 (Solesbury 2003:vi). Building in part from the Human Development Reports and the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report, Our Common Future, DFID's approach assesses the strengths and vulnerabilities of poor people in terms of five types of capital: human,social, natural, physical, and financial (UK DFID 1999:2.3). As opposed tothe more traditional focus on macroeconomic policies, this approach puts people at the center of development and is inherently nonsectoral. It alsoexplicitly concerns itself with the condition of the natural resource base. The \"sustainability\" element of the livelihoods approach is achieved by helping people to build resistance to external shocks and stresses,maintain the long-term productivity of natural resources, move away fromdependence on unsustainable outside support, and avoid underminingthe livelihood options of others. Addressing these challenges requiresthat development agencies view the poor as a mixed, rather than ahomogenous, group, and tailor policies to the various sub-groups.Listening to the poor and involving them in the policy process is a key partof this approach (UK DFID 1999:5, 7; Chambers and Conway 1991:6). The sustainable livelihoods approach has been recognized and adopted to varying degrees by a number of development agencies. One of thechallenges of its application is finding ways to match such a dynamicframework to existing policies and institutions (Hussein 2002:55). That iswhy an emphasis on governance\u2014dealing with who wields power andhow decisions are made\u2014has become a key element in modern develop-ment practice. ADOPTING A LIVELIHOODS APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT HOW IS ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME CALCULATED? Environmental Income of a Small-Scale Fisher Gross Value of Natural Resource Value of fish consumed by producer (subsistence income) Sales at market * (cash income) Labor and Materials Costs Labor Costs: fishing, repairing equipment, etc Capital Costs: purchase or rental of nets, fishing rods, boats, etc. TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME = Gross Value of Resource - Labor and Materials Costs * Includes value added by producer through preparation such as smoking, preserving, etc. Environmental income\u2014the value of goods and services from ecosys- tems\u2014can be difficult to measure. Typically, it is calculated as thegross value of natural resource goods minus the cost of labor andmaterials needed to collect and sell these goods (Vedeld et al. 2004:6).The environmental income for a family dependent on fisheries is illustrated above. The gross value of the natural resource (fish) wouldinclude both the value of the fish consumed by the household and the price of any fish sold at market. The total environmental income is calculated by subtracting from the gross value any labor and materi-als costs, such as rental fees for boats or the purchase price of fishingrods and nets.jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 3637Assessing environmental income at the household level is the most difficult, but also the most valuable in judging howmuch of a factor nature-based income is in the lives of the poorand whether it can be increased or at least made more secure.Household surveys have been used for decades to measureincome and consumption patterns, but they have not tradition-ally assessed what portion of this income was from naturalresources (Cavendish 2000:1980). As a result, the kind ofcomprehensive data needed to quantify the dependence of thepoor on environmental income has been scarce, increasing thetendency of policymakers to minimize the environment in theirpoverty prescriptions. In recent years, researchers have begun to fill this breach with quantitative studies of environmental income at the villageand household level. While the amount and dependence onenvironmental income differs depending on the ecosystem, thecommunity , and other social and economic factors, these studieshave confirmed that environmental income is near-universallyimportant to poor households.Estimating the Importance of Wild Income William Cavendish's study of 30 villages in the Shindi ward ofZimbabwe in the late 1990s provides a careful look at how thepoor make use of nature-based income. Cavendish's survey ofnearly 200 households excluded farm income, concentrating onwild income from forests and other natural sources, particularlycommon areas in the public domain. He found that this kind ofenvironmental income constituted over 35 percent of total house-hold income. It was not usually obtained from one source, butmany small sources combined. Households derived direct subsis-tence value from collecting firewood, consuming fruits and berries,and browsing their livestock. They received cash income from thesale of materials, fruits, medicines, or meat they had collected orhunted. They even derived some income from small-scale goldpanning. Cavendish also found that the dependence of householdson environmental income decreased as their average incomes rose.Although the poor tended to get more of their total income fromthe environment, the rich still made heavy use of natural productsfor income (Cavendish 2000:1979, 1990, 1991).CHAPTER 2 ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE POOR TABLE 2.2 DIVERSE USES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME Location Shindi Ward, Southern Zimbabwe Southern Malawi Gulf of Mannar, India Coquimbo Region, Chile Iquitos, Peru Budongo Forest, Uganda Reserve, Malawi Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, IndiaEcosystem Forests and Forest Reefs Semi-Arid Tropical forest Semi-deciduous tropical forest AgricultureAgricultureAgricultureGoods or Services Used Wild fruits, timber, thatching grass, livestock fodder Firewood, fruit, mushrooms, bushmeat, insects, honey Seaweed, shellfish, sea cucumber, medicines, lobster Pasture, fodderNon-timber forest products, including fruits, latexes, medicines,tourism and carbon sequestration Fuel wood, building materials, wood for furniture, food, medicinal plants All crops including maize, cassava, morogo, various fruits Maize, cassava, ground nuts, pulses, soy beans, potatoes Agriculture, fuelwood, timber, fodder for livestockBenefit to Households Ecosystems contribute an average of 35% of total income. Cavendish 2000 Forest income contributes up to 30% of total income. Fisher 2004 Reefs are often the only source of cash income for poorfamilies, providing up to $199 of income annually. Whittingham et al. 2003 80-90% of poor households use common pool resources. Bahamondes 2003 Forests provide $422 of potential sustainable income per hectare annually. Lampietti and Dixon 1995 Biomass provides 90% of the energy needs for the country and between 6% and 25% of householdincome in Bundongo village. Aryal 2002 Total value of wild and crop plants was US$269 per household per year. High and Shackleton 2000 Food crops contributed between 45% and 55% of household income. Botha et al. 2004 Environmental income (including agriculture and resource collection) was the largest householdincome source for the poorest 25%. Narain et al. 2005jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 3738WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Other studies confirm Cavendish's general findings. Research in South Africa found communities regularly usingbetween 18 and 27 wild products, the most valuable again beingfuelwood, construction wood, wild fruits and herbs, and fodder(Shackleton et al. 2000a:2). Quantities consumed per householdcan be substantial. Average annual usage figures of 5.3 metrictons of fuelwood, 104 kg of edible fruits, 58 kg of wild vegeta-bles, and 185 large poles for house construction and fencing aretypical in rural South Africa (Shackleton and Shackleton2004:658; Shackleton et al. 2000a:2). Subsistence use represents the greater part of the value of these natural products to households. Home use of wild productsbrings a direct reduction in cash expenditures of households\u2014a form of income that is essential to the survival of the very poor. Estimated cash equivalents for subsistence use of wildproducts ranged from US$194 to US$1,114 per year over aseries of seven studies in South Africa\u2014a significant incomefraction (Shackleton et al. 2000a:2). But wild products can be a considerable source of cash income. In the Indian state of Kerala, residents in the Wayananddistrict sell wild foods such as honey and mushrooms, along withcoveted gooseberries and other medicinal plants, earning anannual average of Rs. 3,500 (US$75) per household (Shylajanand Mythili 2003:109, 112-113). Likewise, medicinal-plantvendors in rural South Africa bring in significant cash, with amean annual income of 16,700 rand (US$2,680) (Botha et al. 2004). At the other end of the scale, rural charcoal makers inKenya sell a 30-35 kilogram bag of charcoal for a mere 280 Ksh(US$3.50) to middle men who transport it to Nairobi for cookingfuel (Kantai 2002:16). (See Table 2.2.) Gauging the importance of wild income to a poor family's total income is difficult, of course, because theamount of such income is highly variable across families andacross the seasons. In general, h owever, wild income tends to be more an auxiliary source rather than the main incomesource for most poor families. But there are many exceptionsto this rule. For example, in some alpine villages in theWestern Himalayas, wild income provides around 70 percentof household income, mostly from grazing of sheep and goatsand the collection of medicines and herbs (Asher et al. 2002:20). If markets\u2014such as tourists\u2014are handy , wild income canbe impressive. A skilled wood carver using native materials inNamibia, for example, can earn as much as US$1,800 per yearby plying the tourist trade. In general, h owever, wild income contributes more modestly to total income, providing perhaps15-40 percent of family income, if current studies are anyguide (Shylajan and Mythili 2003:100-102; Cavendish 2000;Beck and Nesmith 2001). Although the value of many wild products seems small when considered in isolation, their aggregate value can beIt is often difficult to assign a monetary value to the ecosystem goods and services on which the poor rely. Some have a market value when sold, butmany are consumed locally or at home, and do not enter into the formaleconomy. In effect, the poor exist in an informal, and often unrecognized,economy. This has led to the systematic undervaluation of the assets ofthe poor and the underestimation of the potential benefits of soundecosystem management. Several studies have tried to delineate this \"other economy\" of the rural poor. A recent World Bank analysis, for example, found that the poorderive, on average, one-fifth of their household income from forests,mostly from nontimber products like wild foods, fuel, fodder, and thatchgrass (Vedeld et al. 2004:27-29). Regretfully, much of the economicvalue of forests to the poor is missed in official state accountings of theforest economy. Kenya is a typical example. By official estimate, the formal forest sector only generates about $2 million in earnings per year for sawn timber,pulp, and other industrial wood products. This is dwarfed by the value ofthe informal forestry sector, which contributes some $94 million in valueto rural households in the form of charcoal, fuelwood, and the panoply ofother forest products. And this does not include the recreational value offorests for leisure and tourism, which could come to $30 million or so.Since so much of this forest value accrues to the informal sector, most ofits value is missed (Mogaka et al. 2001:17). This undervaluation causes decision-makers to assign a lower priority to intact forest ecosystems as an economic asset than they should. Forexample, in spite of their place in rural livelihoods, woodfuels aregenerally not seriously considered in rural development plans andpoverty reduction strategies, even though they provide the majority ofthe energy requirements of poor families on every continent (Arnold etal. 2003:25; IEA 2002:27). A similar situation exists with small-scale fisheries. Despite the unques- tioned importance of coastal and inland fisheries to the poor, small-scalefisheries are also an overlooked resource in most poverty alleviationstrategies (B\u00e9n\u00e9 2003:949). Again, this reflects the fact that fisheriesincome for the poor frequently escapes official notice, since fish are oftenlocally consumed, and often at home. A survey in four rural Cambodianprovinces found that, even though three-fourths of households engage infishing as a primary or secondary occupation, fully half of them never sellany fish in the open market (Degen et al. 2000:1, 20). If programs to alleviate poverty continue to undervalue the assets of the poor and misunderstand the dynamics of the informal economy, they willremain only partially effective. Better valuation and accounting of wildincome, as well as income from home-based agriculture, is part of anysensible strategy to incorporate environmental income into poverty reduc-tion programs. MISUNDERSTANDING THE WEALTH OF THE POORjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 3839CHAPTER 2 ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE POOR substantial, and their contribution to rural economies crucial. In South Africa, Shackleton has estimated the value of wildproducts extracted by households in the savanna biome alone at8 billion rand (US$1.3 billion) per year\u2014a figure that works outto about R750-1,000 (US$120-160) per hectare of accessibleland. That compares favorably with the economic productivityof cattle ranching and plantation forestry in these areas. In fact,when collection and sale of wild products is compared head tohead with other rural employment options, it often proves to bemore lucrative. In Nigeria, research shows that returns on laborare 3-4 times higher for harvesting and selling woodlandproducts than for agricultural wage labor (Shackleton et al.2001:583; Shackleton and Shackleton 2004). Unfortunately , the size and importance of these economic contributions often goes unnoticed. Such transactions belongto the informal economy , and are generally unaccounted for inofficial economic statistics. Adding in Agricultural Income Income from wild products is only a part of the environmentalincome equation. Agricultural income is just as crucial. Onlywhen income from agriculture is combined with the income fromwild products do we begin to get a clear idea of how importantecosystem goods and services are as a source of rural livelihoods. A study of households (rich and poor) in the Masvingo Province in southeastern Zimbabwe provides a good example ofhow agricultural income complements wild income and how itcompares with other income sources such as wages and remit-tances. As Figure 2.2 shows, agricultural income\u2014from crops and home gardens\u2014contributed 30 percent of total householdincome (cash and subsistence income combined). Livestockrearing\u2014a modified form of agriculture that relies on wildforage\u2014contributed another 21 percent. Wild products fromwoodlands contributed 15 percent. Together, these elements ofenvironmental income sum to 66 percent of total income. Inother words, goods and services from ecosystems contribute two- thirds of family incomes in rural Zimbabwe. The remaining 34 percent came from wage labor, income from home industries,and remittances. For the poorest of these rural households,dependence on these different kinds of environmental income iseven higher, providing a full 70 percent of total income whencombined (Campbell et al. 2002:89-95). The balance between agricultural income and wild income varies by location, with agriculture supplying more income insome areas, and wild income more in others. For example, arecent survey in the Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh, India,found that agriculture provided 58 percent of total income ofthe poorest families, with livestock and wild income providinganother 12 percent. In this district, farming is the main occupa-tion, with over 90 percent of the workforce employed inagriculture. But families in Jhabua also supplement theirincomes with livestock-rearing and collection of various forestproducts, such as wood fuel, fodder, tendu leaves, and mahuaflowers (Narain et al. 2005:6, 14). (See Figure 2.3.)Common Pool Resources as a Source of Environmental Income Much of the environmental income earned in the developing world comes from common pool resources (CPRs). Commonpool resources are forests, fisheries, reefs, waterways, pastures,agricultural lands, and mineral resources that no individualhas exclusive rights to. They are typically owned and adminis-tered by the state, a village, a tribe, or other social grouping,with the idea that the benefits will accrue to many peoplerather than one person or family . Local and distant residentsgo there to collect fire wood, graze their cattle, gather nontim-ber forest products like medicinal herbs or mushrooms, hunt,fish, collect water, or make use of a variety of other servicessuch as visiting sacred groves. Because these \"commons\" or\"public domain\" lands are such a rich source of environmen-tal income, they are a crucial element in the livelihoodstrategies of the poor, particularly those who do not own landthemselves (Jodha 1986:1169). Just how important are they? Research over the past two decades has amassed a fair amount of evidence on this topic,particularly in India. N.S Jodha, in his pioneering study of 80villages across seven semi-arid states in India, found that the poormake extensive use of common areas, with CPRs contributing15-25 percent of household income (Jodha 1986:1177). Otherstudies from different states in India have found that CPRscontribute up to 29 percent of the income of poorer households(Adhikari 2003:5). Altogether, CPRs contribute some US$5billion a year to the incomes of India's rural poor, according toone estimate (Beck and Income Source: Campbell et al. 2002FIGURE 2.2 HOUSEHOLD INCOME BY SOURCE, MASVINGO PROVINCE, ZIMBABWE ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME OTHER INCOMEjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 3940WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Fewer studies have been done in other parts of the world, but there are indications that many of the rural poor derive a similaror higher percentage of their income from the commons (Beckand Nesmith 2001:119). In Botswana, researchers found that thepoorest 20 percent of the population earn 51 percent of theirhousehold income from CPRs (Kerapeletswe and Lovett2001:1). In southeastern Zimbabwe, households (both rich andpoor) get 35 to 40 percent of their income from the commons(Cavendish 1998:7). Over 90 percent of Cambodians reportedthey make use of common property fish resources from lakes,rivers, flooded ricefields, and even flooded forests (Ahmed et al.1998 in UK DFID 2000:31). Without access to these resources, poor families would be virtually unable to support themselves. For example, poor house-holds in Jodha's study met 66-80 percent of their fuelrequirements from CPRs. Common areas also contribute a greatdeal of fodder, allowing poorer families to raise more livestockthan they would otherwise be able to support (Jodha 1986:1173). The Commons as a Safety Net and Employment Source Even where dependence is not as high, CPRs function as anirreplaceable safety net for the poor. When farm and financialassets are scarce, the commons can provide secondary incomeand sources of food and fuel for basic survival. Researchers inwestern Africa have found that common pool resources are of particular importance to the poor during seasonal foodshortages and times of crisis. According to one study , thepoorest households rely on \"bush\" sources to supply 20percent of their food requirements during the lean timebefore harvest, when food supplies are low. Wealthier familiesrelied on the bush for only two percent of their food duringthis period (Dei 1992:67). The dependence of poor households on the commons is typically highest after crop production has finished and whenother alternatives for wage labor are unavailable (Jodha1986:1177). Indeed, CPRs can generate significant self-employment opportunities, and often serve as an importantand flexible source of secondary income for poor households.Jodha found that collection activities alone provided 36-64 daysof work annually per worker in poor households in his studyarea (Jodha 1986:1175). In Haryana, India, collection of foodsand other products, stone quarrying, and livestock grazing incommon areas generate an annual average of 88 days ofemployment per household. Importantly , the numbers breakdown very differently by socio-economic class, with wagelaborers working an average of 213 days per year in thecommons, and higher-class households only 25 (Quereshi andKumar 1998:350). Gender also strongly influences reliance on the commons. Women head a disproportionate number of poor households,and their reliance on wild income is higher than men, who oftenhave more schooling and greater wage-earning capacity . Studiesshow that women are often the primary gatherers and sellers ofnon-timber products such as fruits, medicinals, and handicraftmaterials (Shackleton et al. 2001:583; Shackleton et al.2002:135; Shackleton 2005). The Commons in Decline A combination of factors, including privatization, agriculturalintensification, population growth, and ecosystem degradationhave caused common property areas to dwindle in size, quality ,and availability to the poor in much of the world (Beck andNesmith 2001:123). In some areas, common lands are convertedto private parcels as a form of land reform or decentralization,or to spur development. Or common property resources may beleased out to private enterprises in the form of fishing or timberconcessions. In either case, the poor may lose access to resourcesthey once relied on. Jodha estimates that in the areas covered by his study the extent of common lands has declined by 31 to 55 percent sinceAgriculture Household enterprise Transfers andremittances Livestock rearing Wage employment Resource 2.3 SOURCES OF INCOME FOR POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN JHABUA, INDIA 7%Agriculture Household enterprise Livestock rearing Wage employment Resource PM Page 4041the 1950s, mainly because of privatization through land reform (Jodha 1995:23). He estimates that in 1951 the average numberof persons per 10 hectares of CPRs ranged from 13 to 101; by1982, that number had risen to over 47,000 per 10 hectares insome villages. The increased pressure this has put on the remain-ing commons has led to overexploitation and a decline in thequality and quantity of services they yield (Jodha 1995:23).Degraded common lands undoubtedly make up a large part ofthe 75-130 million hectares of India's land that has been classedas \"wasteland\"\u2014land that is both unproductive and ecologicallydepleted (Chopra 2001:25, 29). Such declines in the ecosystem quality of public-domain lands are increasingly hard on rural livelihoods. A recent study inEthiopia found most of the commons there in a state of eitherexhaustion or stress. Depleted grazing lands there have led toethnic clashes and a decline in total livestock numbers, while thegrowing scarcity of woodfuel from common areas has forcedmore households to depend on purchased fuel (Kebede2002:133-134). (See Box 2.1.) Degradation from overuse is not inevitable, h owever , and examples of collective action to manage the commons aregrowing in number. In Caprivi, Namibia, good managementand sustainable harvesting techniques of palm fronds fromcommon areas have enabled local women to supplementhousehold incomes by selling woven palm baskets to tourists.As one of the few sources of cash income for women, themarket has grown from 70 producers in the 1980s to more than650 by the end of 2001, a jump that the resource has been ableto sustain thus far (Murphy and Suich 2004:8-9). In anotherexample, rural harvesters of marula fruits in Bushbuckridgedistrict of South Africa have planted marula trees in theirhome gardens and fields and selected for those with greater yields in the face of the dwindling number of marula trees inthe communal lands (Shackleton et al. 2003:12, 13). (For more examples of sustainable use of the commons by poor households, seeChapters 4 and 5.) Who Gets More Environmental Income: Rich or Poor? Environmental income is not only important to the poor. Richer families also make extensive use of income from ecosys-tem goods and services. (\"Rich\" here does not necessarily implyhigh income by developed-world standards, but a greaterrelative level of wealth and opportunity compared to lower-income households within the same community .) In fact,several recent studies have shown that the rich commonlyderive more environmental income, in absolute terms, than thepoor do (Cavendish 2000:1990-1991; Fisher 2004; Narain al. 2003:472). This generally reflects thefact that they have greater ability to exploit what ecosystemscan provide. For example, higher-income families may havemore livestock and can therefore make better use of forageresources in common areas, whereas a poor family's foragedemand may be more limited due to their smaller herd size. A study in the Jhabua district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh showed wealthier families using more fodderresources to feed their larger herds (Narain et al. 2005:5). Inaddition, the rich frequently have greater access to hired labor,transportation, credit, arable land, or other factors needed tomaximize harvest of natural products or agriculture and bringCHAPTER 2 ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE POOR Continues on page 44jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 41THE MILLENNIUM ECOSYSTEM ASSESSMENT (MA) was a four-year, international effort to document the contribu-tion of ecosystems to human well-being, assay the current stateof ecosystem health, and offer a prognosis for how the capacityof ecosystems to support human needs may change underdifferent management scenarios. The intent was to providedecision-makers scientifically credible information to helpthem manage ecosystems more sustainably while meetinghuman development goals. The MA was a remarkably broad-based effort. Completed in 2005, it involved over 1300 scientists from 95 countries. Itfound that humans have altered the structure and functioning ofthe world's ecosystems more substantially in the second half ofthe twentieth century than at any time in human history. As aresult, 15 of the 24 ecosystem services the MA assessed are nowbeing degraded or used unsustainably (MA 2005a:viii, 1, 6). This unsustainable use stems from the fact that humans often favor some kinds of ecosystem production\u2014such as the provi-sioning services of food and fiber production\u2014at the expense ofother services that ecosystems can render, such as biodiversity,water purification, or natural pest control. The MA showed thatsuch trade-offs among different ecosystem services are thenorm. Particularly over the past hundred years, human manage-ment of provisioning services (food, timber, water, and othercommodities) has degraded the ability of ecosystems to provideregulating services, such as flood control or pollination. Culturalservices such as recreation and the aesthetic and spiritualappreciation of nature have also suffered. At the same time, the findings of the MA have shed new light on the importance of ecosystems to the poor and how ecosys-tem degradation impairs the livelihoods of the poor. Poorpeople, particularly those in rural areas in developing countries,are more directly dependent on ecosystem services and morevulnerable when those services are degraded or lost (MA2005a:2-14). The MA findings document many examples of the human toll on ecosystems. Approximately 35 percent of mangroves havedisappeared in the last two decades. Twenty percent of theworld's coral reefs have been lost and an additional 20 percentare degraded. Water withdrawals from rivers and lakes havedoubled since 1960. Nitrogen flows to the environment havealso doubled, while phosphorous flows have tripled between1960 and 1990. Landings from inland and marine fisherieshave declined due to overexploitation. Fuelwood used forenergy is scarce in many parts of the world. Some 10-20percent of drylands are degraded (MA 2005a:2, 26, 31, 34).Ecosystem Degradation and the Poor The MA highlights the relationship between the poor andecosystem goods and services. While everyone is affected byecosystem degradation, the poor suffer the harmful effectsdisproportionately. In fact, the disparities between the poor andrich have grown in recent decades. For instance, despite globalincreases in the amount of food available per capita, over 800million people remain undernourished, and food production percapita has actually decreased in Sub-Saharan Africa. Whilewater availability has increased in many regions of the world,half of the urban population in Africa, Asia, Latin America, andthe Caribbean suffer from contaminated water and its burden ofdisease. Ecosystem degradation has very real human and finan-cial costs. The burning of 10 million hectares of Indonesia'sforests in 1997-8 resulted in additional health care costs ofUS$9.3 billion and affected some 20 million people (MA2005a:2, 13, 51, 57, 62). The poor have also suffered from loss of access to ecosystems through privatization of what were formerly common poolresources. Examples include inland and coastal fisheries,which the MA findings reveal to be in steep decline. Small-scale fisheries are of great value to the poor, providing aninexpensive source of protein and supplemental income.Increasingly, coastal areas that were once open fishing groundsare being converted for use in shrimp farming and other formsof aquaculture. The harvest from aquaculture ponds or cages istypically exported, and both the income and the protein bypassthe local poor. Countries where extensive conversion of coastalhabitats for aquaculture is taking place include Ecuador,Thailand, Vietnam, Honduras, Chile, Indonesia, thePhilippines, Bangladesh, and India (MA 2005b:25.13). The MA findings also confirm that the substantial degradation of ecosystems that is now occurring is a barrier to achieving theMillennium Development Goals. For example, the MA warnsthat meeting the goals of eradicating hunger and reducing childmortality by 2015 will be unattainable if ecosystems continueto be used unsustainably. Soil degradation and water scarcityare two important sources of risk to the production of agroe-cosystems, and thus to the food supply, particularly as it affectsthe poor. The MA makes it clear that failure to tackle thecurrent decline of ecosystem health will seriously erode effortsto reduce rural poverty (MA 2005a:61). /orn8flip For more information on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and its findings, see: http://www.maweb.org.BOX 2.1 FINDINGS OF THE MILLENNIUM ECOSYSTEM ASSESSMENT: HOW DO THE POOR FARE? 42jp8589 WRI.qxd Page 4243The table the MA's finding on ecosystem services.

In the Jhabua study , these factors allowed rich families to earn nearly five times as much environmentalincome\u2014from a combination of farming, livestock rearing,and collection of wild products\u2014as the poorest families. On the other hand, even if the rich capture greater environ-mental income, they tend not tobe as dependent on such incomeas are the poor. Environmentaldependency and poverty seem togo hand in hand. A 1999 study of12 Himalayan villages found that the poor relied on naturalresources for 23 percent oftheir income, compared to only 4 percent for the rich (Reddyand Chakravarty 1999:1145).In Botswana's Chobe region, the difference was even greater,with the poor depending on wildproducts from nearby commonproperty lands for half theirtotal income, while the richdepended far more on employ-ment income and remittances,deriving less than 20 percent of their income from the nearby commons. (See Figure 2.4.) This was in spite of the fact that rich families in Chobe earned four times as much actualincome as poor families from natural resources (Kerapeletsweand Lovett 2001:6-7). The poor and the rich also tend to use natural resources differently to derive income. The poor tend to pursue a varietyof different sources of environmental income, while the richoften concentrate on one or two that allow them to make useof their greater assets for agriculture or livestock rearing. Inthe Chobe example, three-fourths of the income that the richderive from the commons comes from livestock rearing, whilethe poor diversify their efforts, spending time in at least fivedifferent activities, from collecting wild foods to makingbaskets and carvings from natural materials. (See Figure 2.5.) The continued dependence of the poor on ecosystems for their livelihoods stems from several factors, but these generallyreduce to the fact that nature is their best\u2014and often only\u2014option. The poor often lack the education and social access tofind consistent wage labor. Without wage income, householdslack the cash to purchase fuel, food, and services like healthcare. To substitute, they use small-scale agriculture and otherforms of nature-based income, often collected from commonareas. When given options for other forms of employment, thepoor often reduce their dependence on environmental income. In any case, the clear implication of most detailed studies of environmental income is that increasing the productivity ofecosystems, and therefore the potential to derive more income,would benefit all income classes in rural areas, not just thepoor. Both the poor and the rich stand to gain more income,and rural economies more stability , if ecosystems are managedfor greater productivity . 44WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Livestock grazingWild fruits an d vegetables Crafts from CPR materials Collection of construction materialsFirewoo dLivestock grazing Firewoo dWild fruits and vegetablesCollection of construction from CPR materials Poorest 20% Richest 20% Source: Kerapeletswe and Lovett 2001FIGURE 2.5 POOR VS.

Agroecosystems The most important source of environmental income in theworld is agriculture\u2014the goods derived from agroecosystems.Agroecosystems differ from other types of ecosystems because ofthe high degree to which they have been modified by people.Large-scale agriculture, driven by expensive inputs and technol-ogy\u2014fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, tractors, and harvesters\u2014isresponsible for much of world food production and agriculturalexports. But small-scale agriculture\u2014the farming that the poorpursue\u2014is the silent giant that supports the great majority of therural residents in poor nations. This kind of farming looks much different than large-scale farming. While most farms in developed countries are owned by corporations and dominated by physical rather than humancapital, in the developing world farms are still largely family-owned and operated. Small-scale farming remains labor-intensive and often lacks access to irrigation, fertilizer, or otherinputs that raise productivity . The producer and consumer isfrequently the same household. Despite the successes of theGreen Revolution, this characterization still describes the major-ity of the agriculture practiced in the world today (FAO 2000b). Smallholder farmers\u2014those who own less than 5 hectares of land\u2014cultivate lands in several ways: home gardens andsmall orchards that largely produce subsistence goods forhome consumption; cultivation of commodity crops such ascotton or maize; and grazing of family-owned livestock. Thiscan occur on very small parcels\u2014sometimes on quite marginalland\u2014and is often intermixed with other land uses likeforestry . The goods which these small-scale \"farms\" producecan also be sold in local markets, sold to collectives thatcombine goods for resale, or even exported to other countries.Each of these modes of production plays a role in the house-hold economy of the poor. Perhaps the most common andimportant benefit of these farms is that, combined withlivestock, they meet a large portion of the nutritional require-ments of many poor households. Malawi, where small-scale farmers account for 70 percent of all farm production, provides a window onto the importanceof such farming. Nearly eight of ten Malawians farm their ownland\u2014most cultivating less than a hectare (Fisher 2004:136).Maize is the staple crop, with cassava, sorghum, groundnuts, andbeans also important. Nearly half of all households own chick-ens, and one-fifth own goats. Together these agricultural assetsprovide more than half of household income. Income fromforests contributes another 30 percent. Only 10 percent ofMalawi's population is engaged in wage employment, highlight-ing how critical environmental income\u2014and particularly farmincome\u2014is to survival (Dorward 2002:9-24).Understanding the role of small-scale agriculture in poor households requires an appreciation of the interplay betweenselling crops for cash and consuming them at home. A study of home gardens in the Bushbuckridge district in South Africa exemplifies this interplay and the substantialcontribution that home gardens often have in the livelihoods of the poor. In this district, households grow an average of four to five plant species on their residential plots.Households consume nearly three-quarters of the plants thatthey grow and sell the rest. The total cash value of all plantssold and consumed at home per year was US$266 per house-hold\u2014a sizable contribution to income in an area with fewemployment opportunities (High and Shackleton 2000:148, 154). (See Table 2.3.) Forests After agriculture, forests are probably the greatest generators ofenvironmental income for the poor. Rural communities are CHAPTER 2 ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE POOR Why is it that environmental income is so important to the house- hold economies of the poor? Environmental income comes from a variety of sources, each with a fairly low cost of investment. This allowspoor households to pursue several different income-generating activi-ties at once, diversifying their income sources and reducing their risk ifany one activity fails. Specializing in a particular commodity or trademight be the most profitable, but poor households often lack the incomebuffer to take the chance. For example, if a household produces onlymaize, and the market for maize falls, or a pest or drought damages thecrop, the family would lose its entire income. Or the household maysimply lack the means to invest in the equipment, land, or trainingneeded to specialize in a single trade or business. Diversification is the answer. A poor family may raise rice for sale and home consumption, harvest fish cultured in the rice paddies for protein,collect wild materials for construction use and fuel, pursue home craftssuch as basket making or wood carving for sale to tourists, and keepcattle for milk production and as a quickly saleable asset in time ofneed. All these are strategies for smoothing out the family-incomestream over time and over a variety of sources of risk, such as weather,illness, or market downturns (Ellis 1998:17, 18). An ecosystem, then, acts as a natural buffer to income shocks for a poor family (Campbell et al. 2002:102). Since it often provides some incomeeven after wage income or remittances fall, it is where the poor often turnto in times of duress. But dependence on an array of low-income nature-based activities, while safest from a survival point of view, is often not aroute to substantial wealth. For accumulating wealth, nature-basedactivities need to tap more lucrative markets, be supported withadequate financial, social, and physical infrastructure\u2014credit, roads,training, marketing cooperatives, and the like\u2014and be coupled with thedevelopment of a rural enterprise sector that gradually creates wageopportunities to supplement environmental income. NATURE AS A DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY Continues on page 47jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 4546IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT POOR FAMILIES IN rural forested areas would draw upon the nearby trees forincome from the use or sale of nontimber forest products(NTFPs) like wild fruits, construction materials, or medicinals.But the economic value of these forest products can becaptured by the urban poor as well, particularly those who haverecently migrated to the city. A study conducted between 1996 and 1999 in the outskirts of Riberalta, a rapidly growing city in northern Bolivia, showedthat households gain a significant proportion of their incomefrom the collection and processing of Brazil nuts and palmhearts. These peri-urban neighborhoods are peopled largely bypoor families, many of them recent immigrants from ruralareas. The study found that households benefited from NTFPsin two ways: some family members (men, mainly) go out to theforest for a few months each year to collect Brazil nuts andpalm hearts to sell to processors; other family members (mostlywomen) work in the processing plants in and around Riberaltawhere Brazil nuts are graded, shelled, washed, and packaged. Nearly 60 percent of the surveyed households participated in one form or another in the Brazil nut or palm heart industries(Stoian 2003:4, 11). The poorest income group was the most dependent on NTFP income, getting 47 percent of their incomefrom it. Even the better-off families derived more than a quarterof their income from NTFPs (Stoian 2003:12). Many recent immigrants were driven to the city in search of employment after the decline of the Bolivian rubber industryin the late 1980s. New arrivals found that their lack of educa-tion and formal training, as well as social stigmas, acted asbarriers to entry into most sections of the urban labor force.For these migrants, as well as other marginalized sectors ofthe population, the Brazil nut industry serves as the largestemployer because of its high demand for unskilled labor. For example, migrants with only primary school education orless relied on NTFPs for 60 percent of their income (Stoian2003:10, 14, 16). The dependence of the urban poor on forest-related income highlights the rural-urban continuum that exists in many nations,where environmental income continues to play an important rolein the income profile of poor households even when thesefamilies leave the countryside (Stoian 2003:10, 14, 16). /orn8flipBOX 2.2 BRAZIL NUTS AND PALM HEARTS: BRINGING FOREST LIVELIHOODS TO THE CITY 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000 0 20-40 40-60 60- 80 100Income QuintileIncome, in Bolivianos *NTFP Income Other Income *At the time of the survey (1998), 1 Boliviano was equivalent to US$0.19.

The productivityand variety of forest ecosystems, as well as their habitat value forgame species, make them important contributors to the localsubsistence and commercial economies. Substantial research corroborates the importance of forests to the world's poor. In 2004 the World Bank completed a reviewof studies on the income that forests provide to those who livein or near them. The review examined cases from 17 countrieson three continents, focusing especially on Africa. The resultswere striking: environmental income from forests was found tobe important at every income level and on every continent,providing an average of 22 percent of total income\u2014the equiv-alent of $678 per year (adjusted for purchasing power parity(PPP) worldwide)\u2014in the households examined (Vedeld et al.2004:28-29). ( See Table 2.4.) As many other studies have concluded, the Bank found that the most significant income from forests came from wild foods,fuel, fodder, and thatch grass. Timber and medicines were alsofound to be important to total income. Unfortunately , much of the economic value of forests to the poor is missed in the officialstate accounting of the forest economy (Mogaka et al. 2001:4). Woodfuels The poor rely overwhelmingly on woodfuels as their householdenergy source. In developing nations alone, some 2.4 billionpeople\u2014more than a third of the world population\u2014rely onwood or other biomass fuels for cooking and heating (IEA2002:26). For example, nearly all rural households in Kenya,Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia use wood for cooking,and over 90 percent of urban households in these countries usecharcoal imported from the countryside (IEA 2002:26). InIndia, 62 percent of rural households depend on woodfuels(Vadivelu 2004:5). Wood used as fuel is fundamentally important in the household economies of the rural poor. It is not only a sourceof energy in the home, but a supplemental source of cashincome through the collection, processing, and sale of firewoodand charcoal. Charcoal in particular, due to its high energycontent and easy portability , is an important income-producerand a sole source of employment for many . In Kenya alone, thecharcoal economy is estimated at about 23 billion Kenyanshillings per year\u2014on a par with tourism as an income gener-ator (Kantai 2002:16). Non-Timber Forest Products The poor have traditionally not been able to capture much ofthe income generated from the harvest and sale of timber.

For the poor to reap greater benefitsfrom timber production, forest ownership and governanceregimes would have to change substantially .But forests produce many other goods and services\u2014collec- tively known as \"nontimber forest products (NTFPs)\u2014that arecritical income sources for the poor. Typical NTFPs includevarious foods, fodder, fuel, medicines, and many othercollectibles\u2014literally every product derived from a forest besidestimber (Wickens 1991:4). (See Table 2.5.) The variety can be staggering. Forest dwellers in the Brazilian Amazon, for example,regularly sell some 220 NTFPs at Belem's daily open market\u2014140 of which are wild products, and the rest cultivated in theforest (Shanley et al. 2002, in Molnar et al. 2004:35). Ifharvested correctly , NTFPs can make not only a substantial, buta sustainable, contribution towards livelihoods. In addition totheir market value, many NTFPs have social, cultural, orreligious significance as well. The use of NTFPs is quite varied, and it is well documented that they provide a wide range of subsistence and cash incometo a large number of households in many nations (Neumann andHirsch 2000:53-55). On Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, forexample, the market value of palm thatch used or sold as roofingmaterial is estimated at US$137 million per year (Bye 1993, inMolnar et al. 2004:35). In India, NTFP production contributesabout 40 percent of total official forest revenues and 55 percentof forest-based employment. (Tewari and Campbell 1996:26). InBotswana, the government recently admitted the value ofNTFPs exceeds that of timber (Taylor 1996:76-77). As impressive as these national-scale estimates are, they tend to understate the importance of NTFPs to households.Since the values of NTFPs are generally difficult to calculate,they are often underestimated (Lampietti and Dixon:1995:1-2).This undervaluation causes decision-makers to assign a lowerpriority to intact forest ecosystems as an economic asset thanthey should. Fisheries and Reefs For those living near the coast, or near inland water bodies,fisheries are nearly always an important aspect of householdincome. Like forests, fisheries are generally accessible, in someform, by people of all income levels, making them a last refugefor many poor households. An estimated 250 million people indeveloping countries are directly dependent on small-scalefisheries for food and income. In Thailand, for example, 90percent of the nation's fishers are still small-scale operators(World Bank 2004:17). 48WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Ant (Moso) Bark (Cape Onionwood) Resin (Benzoin)Brazil Nuts Cardamom Woody Vine (Cat's Claw) Fruit (Allspice) Garcinia Fruit Hearts of Palm Marula Trees Mulberry Bark Pine Resin Rattan (African Rattan Palm) Rattan (Calamus) Roots Leaves (Silver Oak)Wood (Parasol Tree)TABLE 2.5 USES OF SELECTED NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS (NTFPS) Primary Use Bird food Bamboo mats and handicrafts Medicine Incense Food Food, medicine Medicine Spice Medicine Food Fruit, beer, livestock feed, medicine,woodcarvings Paper Turpentine Rattan furniture Rattan handicrafts and mats Medicine Rubber handicrafts Essential oils for perfume Cigarette wrappers Woodcarvings Woodcarvings Source: Ruiz-P\u00e9rez et al. 2004; Shackleton et al. 2000bLocationBanten, Indonesia Zhejiang, China Eastern Cape, South Africa North Sumatra, Indonesia Vaca D\u00edez and Iturralde, Bolivia Bac Kan, Vietnam Puerto Inca, Peru Puebla, Mexico Karnataka, India S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Bushbuckridge district, Sayaboury Luang Laos R\u00edo, Cuba Central Acre, Brazil East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia Madya Pradesh, India Coastal Kenya Mpigi, Uganda The average small-scale fisher in rural coastal Thailand earns probably half of the income of the average Thai citizen. He is from one of thealmost 50,000 households in Thailand fishing with a vessel that weighsless than 10 tons. He lives in one of the 2,500 rural fishing villagesaround the country, 80 percent of which are located beyond municipali-ties, without basic infrastructure such as roads and electricity (WorldBank 2004:17).SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES IN RURAL THAILANDjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:29 PM Page 4849The small-scale fishing that the poor do differs markedly from the industrial fishing of factory trawlers and long-linefishers. Small-scale fishing is usually a low-capital operationwith owner-operated vessels, such as those using cast nets andsmall traps. Many times it is carried out from small non-mecha-nized canoes or rafts, or from small motorized boats anddinghies crewed by one or a few people. But sometimes it isdone from the shore without even the use of a boat. InIndonesia, for example, half of the nation's 2 million oceanfishers use unmotorized canoes; another 25 percent use smallboats with outboard engines; 80 percent live below the nationalpoverty line (FAO 2000a:2-3). Marine fisheries often contribute enormously to the liveli- hoods of the coastal poor. In coastal communities studied inMozambique, fishing contributes 34-38 percent of cash income,with additional environmental income coming from the sale ofmollusks, seaweed, and sea cucumbers (Wilson et al. 2003:96).Likewise, families in coastal Tanzania supplement subsistenceagriculture and forestry with fishing, seaweed and shrimpfarming, and salt production (Bayer 2003:1). Households livingin coastal villages along Korangi Creek in Pakistan rely onmangroves as their primary source of woodfuel and animalfodder, and rely on the mangrove fisheries for both wage laborand food (Khalil 1999:9-10). For families too poor to own boatsin Indiranagar, India, labor on the fishing boats of othersprovides a crucial source of income (Rengasamy et al. 2003:128). Inland fisheries\u2014in lakes, rivers, streams, rice paddies, and fish ponds\u2014are just as important a resource for the poor asmarine fisheries. In the Lower Mekong River basin, for example,a recent study found that 40 million rural farmers\u2014many ofthem poor\u2014engage in seasonal fishing activities. In Laos, wherethe incidence of rural poverty is quite high, 70 percent of all farm households augment their family food supplies andincomes with fish (Sverdrup-Jensen 2002:8). These statistics make it clear that fisheries are a key\u2014and often overlooked\u2014aspect of food security for the poor. In EastAsia and in Africa, fish provide more than 50 percent of theanimal protein intake in the diet of 400 million people (WorldBank 2004:18). In Liberia, Ghana, and Cambodia, fish and fishproducts constitute 65 to 70 percent of animal protein consumed(FAO and UK DFID 2002:20, 21; UK DFID 2000:18). In areas of the world that support coral reefs, these systems also provide a crucial portion of people's livelihood. (See Table 2.6.) Reefs provide fish for daily consumption, shells and corals for use in house construction and for sale to tourists,and a variety of marine species for medicinal purposes(Rengasamy et al. 2003:130-133). Rural households in the FijiIslands\u2014a third of which are poor\u2014routinely subsist on fishand shellfish such as kaikoso clams they catch themselves onPhilippine coral reefs provide daily livelihoods for thousands of low- income fishers, but in recent years overexploitation and destructivefishing practices like the use of dynamite and cyanide have lowered reef productivity. A survey of 700 fishers conducted in 2000 in thePhilippines revealed that 89 percent have to feed their families fromtheir daily catch; 74 percent identified having enough to eat each dayas their most pressing concern; and 67 percent said the decreasing fishcatch was the most pressing problem in their community.

(See Chapter 5 for a complete case study of Fiji's fisheries.) In the Caribbean and parts of South East Asia, coral reefs play an important role in a growing ecotourismmarket, bringing money and jobs into these regions. Thecombined benefits of dive tourism, fisheries, and shorelineprotection provided by reefs bring an estimated net value ofUS$3.1-3.6 billion to the Caribbean region every year (Burkeand Maidens 2004:58). Many fisheries\u2014particularly marine fisheries\u2014are and conflictsbetween local small-scale fishers and commercial operationsare common. Often, poor communities operate at themargins, fishing what large-scale operators leave behind (Kuraet al. 2004:87-88). In Chad's Chari delta and along thewestern shore of Lake Chad (Nigeria), a comparative analysisfound that the poor have access only to marginalized fishinggrounds, while the more well-to-do have access to all waterbodies (B\u00e9n\u00e9 2003:960). Even where the poor do have access,they often lose out to richer fishers when competing directly ,due to inferior equipment. The Role of Livestock Livestock are an important and sometimes overlooked elementof the livelihood strategies of the poor. As much as 70 percentof the rural poor depend on livestock to some degree. Livestockholdings are diverse and include cattle, goats, sheep, pigs,poultry , horses, camels, yaks, and llamas. An estimated 600million poor people, including 150 million landless poor, ownlivestock (Delgado et al. 1999; IFAD et al. 2004:9,10; Thorntonet al. 2002). Livestock are a crucial source of financial capital for the rural poor. For many , livestock ownership is the only form ofsavings available. In fact, for pastoralists and often for poorwomen, livestock are the most important fungible asset they own. Livestock provide a critical reserve against emergenciesand decrease vulnerability to financial shocks from ill health,crop failures, and other risks. They yield direct benefits in theform of food, wool, or hides, and can raise farm productivityby providing manure and draught power (PPLPI 2003:1). In acomparative study of poor livestock keepers in Bolivia, India,and Kenya, households in all three countries ranked livestockabove business and housing as their best investment (Heffernanet al. 2002 in IFAD et al. 2004:14). In 40 percent of Kenya's districts, livestock represent more than a quarter of total household income (Thornton et al.2002:75). In rural Nepal, they contribute 9-14 percent ofproduction for home consumption, and are even more impor-tant as a source of cash income. For Nepal's isolated mountaincommunities, livestock are among the few items exchanged forcash, constituting nearly half of total farm cash income(Maltsoglou and Taniguchi 2004:24-25). Studies have foundthat livestock generally contribute significantly more to theincome stream of poor households\u2014particularly the incomecontrolled by women\u2014than to the incomes of those livingabove the poverty line (Thornton et al. 2002:75; Heffernan2001:60; Delgado et al. 1999). The benefits from livestock can even extend to those who don't own livestock\u2014often the poorest members of the commu-nity . Non-owners are sometimes able to obtain milk, dung forfuel, or help with ploughing of fields. These may be given freeof charge from livestock owners, or at greatly reduced prices(Shackleton et al. 2000b:53; Shackleton 2005). Perhaps not surprisingly , livestock figure prominently in the movement of households into and out of poverty . In a studyof household poverty dynamics in 20 communities in Kenya,researchers found that more than 40 percent of families thatescaped poverty did so by diversifying their farm income,primarily by acquiring livestock (Kristjanson et al. 2004:12).TABLE 2.6 NATURE-BASED LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES BY INCOME LEVEL ON AGATTTI ISLAND, INDIA Lower Middle Class Rs 15,000-60,000 (US$319-1,276) 50%Supplementary income or subsistence during monsoon Few treesGoats, chickensSmall wooden boat (thoni) with outboard engine Fishing rod and various netsPoor Below Rs 15,000 (<US$319) 10%Subsistence and survival No land or coconut trees No livestockCast netAnnual Income % of Population Reef Use Selected AssetsUpper Middle Class Rs 60,001-250,000 (US$1,277-5,319) 39%Collecting bait fish, octopus, etc. Land, coconut with outboard engineRich Above Rs 250,000 (>US$5,319) 1%Pay others to collect building materials and fish Land, coconut treesGoats, chickens, calves Cargo vessel (manju) Source: 5:30 PM Page 5051CHAPTER 2 ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE POOR When the poor have access to markets, livestock can serve as a source of collateral, giving households access to other forms ofcapital and opening pathways for further income diversification(IFAD et al. 2004:3). The role of livestock in rural communities extends signifi- cantly beyond their economic value. Most notably , livestockplay a prominent role in social and cultural relationships.Loans and gifts of livestock contribute to family and commu-nity ties and often play a central role in cultural traditions suchas weddings and funerals. Owning livestock can also bringbetter nutrition to some of the most vulnerable groups, includ-ing women and children (IFAD et al. 2004:19-20). Despite the benefits, livestock rearing is also risky for the poor. Production risks\u2014from harsh weather to predators to lackof proper veterinary care\u2014are greater among low-incomeproducers (IFAD et al. 2004:14). Loss of livestock holdings canhave a long-term impact on a family far beyond the value of theindividual animals, because herds generally take such a long timeto build up. Catastrophic losses from natural disasters or having livestock stolen can therefore have a devastating effect on familyfinances. Even intentional loss, such as use of livestock forfuneral feasts, can be hard on the poor. In western Kenya,slaughter of livestock for funerals has been identified as a majorcause of falling into poverty (Kristjanson et al. 2004:iv). The Social Benefits of Ecosystems Deriving income from the environment is clearly a powerfultool for improving the lives and livelihoods of individualfamilies, but it can also bring significant societal benefits bymaking the distribution of wealth in a community more equal.If environmental income is not counted, the income distribu-tion in rural communities is often significantly skewed, with alarge gap between rich and poor. Howev er, if environmental income is included in the income profile, the gap between richand poor shrinks somewhat (Vedeld et al. 2004:36-38; Jodha jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:30 PM Page 511986:1177). This supports the contention that ecosystem goods and services act as community assets, whose benefitsreach beyond the individual household level. By providing anincome source to those without other assets, ecosystemsmoderate and buffer the rural economy and increaseeconomic equity . This provides another rationale for soundmanagement of local ecosystems. The use of natural resources and especially their degrada- tion also has other implications for households and forcommunities. Rural communities are often bound together byshared professions based on nature\u2014fisher, pastoralist, orfarmer\u2014or their use of a specific set of forest resources. In otherwords, natural resources are often a binding element of commu- nities. Community-based resource management can increasethis bond, fostering community cohesion and strengthening the social safety net for poor community members. Conversely , degradation of resources can harm communi- ties and poor households by increasing the effort and timerequired to meet basic needs. Deforestation and scarce orpolluted water supplies can increase the amount of time requiredto collect adequate fuelwood and water for daily use. Sincewomen are usually charged with providing wood and water,longer collection times usually translate to less time to preparefood, care for young children, and help with agricultural activi-ties. In low-income households, this can translate into poorernutritional status and can harm the general household welfare(Kumar and Hotchkiss 1988:55-56). Often, a portion of the collecting burden falls on the children in a household. Greater collection times can reducethe chances that children, especially girls, will remain inschool. In Malawi, where more than 90 percent of householdsuse firewood as their main source of energy , children infuelwood-scarce districts are 10 to 15 percent less likely toattend secondary school (Nankhuni and Findeis 2003:9). (See Figure 2.6.) A study in Nepal found that educational attain- ment of girls in poor households dropped as fodder and wateravailability decreased, suggesting that the additional labor fellto school-age girls in the household (Cooke 1998:19). On theother hand, restoration of traditional forest enclosures in theShinyanga region of Tanzania has dramatically increasedforest cover in the district and reduced collection times forfuelwood by several hours per day , on average\u2014a directbenefit to poor families. (See Chapter 5 case study, Regenerating Woodlands in Tanzania: The HASHI Project.) These social and community benefits of nature point to how intact ecosystems can support many non-income aspectsof rural livelihoods, adding weight to the argument thatbetter ecosystem management is a crucial element of ruralpoverty reduction. Building on the Strength of Ecosystems As this chapter demonstrates, environmental income is critical tothe survival of the poor within the typical rural economy indeveloping countries. On average, income from small-scaleagriculture and the collection of wild products such as nontim-ber forest products together account for some two-thirds of thehousehold incomes of families in poverty . Without income fromecosystem goods and services, rural poverty would unquestion-ably be deeper and more widespread\u2014a lesson to remember asthe pace of ecosystem degradation picks up worldwide. But as important as environmental income is to the poor today , it is typically not used as a route out of poverty . Usually ,the poor use environmental income more as a support forcurrent levels of consumption or as a safety net to keep from 52WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Wood Scarcity In dex 16 (less scarce) 29 30 (more scarce) Male FemaleSecon dary School Enrollment ( Nankhuni and Findeis 2003FIGURE 2.6 WOOD FUEL SCARCITY AND SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IN MALAWI, 1998 Time spent collecting woodfuel is one factor that limits the social and educa- tional development of children\u2014particularly girls\u2014in impoverished areas.jp8589 PM Page 5253falling further into poverty . They generally do not have the means or empowerment to use environmental income as a toolfor true wealth creation. As Chapter 3 will show, behind thisfailure to capitalize on the potential of ecosystems for income isan array of governance failures. The challenge is to alter thisstate of affairs, increasing the access of the poor to local ecosys-tem potential and their capacity for managing this potentialsustainably and profitably , with viable models for turningnature's productivity into income. Essential to meeting this challenge is realizing that environ- mental income is not separate from but part and parcel oftoday's rural economies. It is intimately tied to other forms of income, such as wage labor and self-employment income. It istied also to the urban economy through remittances as well asthe inevitable reliance of cities on the environmental output ofecosystems. Helping the poor to increase their environmentalincome, then, must be seen as supporting rural economicgrowth more generally . It both widens and secures the range ofincome options available, and can support a transition tohigher-paying employment that carries the poor beyond thesubsistence level. /orn8flipCHAPTER 2 ECOSYSTEMS AND THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE POOR jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:30 PM Page 53The patterns and institutions of governance are the critical factors determining how effectively the poor can harness ecosystems for their livelihoods.jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:30 PM Page 54AN ABUNDANCE OF NATURAL RESOURCES DOES NOT necessarily translate into wealth for the poor. To make nature a source of prosperity forpoor communities requires supportive governance conditions: policies and laws thatprotect the rights of the poor, coupled with responsive institutions that promote theirinterests. Without these, the presence of high-value resources like timber, gold,diamonds, or oil can actually be detrimental to poor communities, providing a target forexploitation by outside business interests and politicians. Too often, the result is that mostof the revenues are appropriated by others, leaving the community\u2014and local ecosystems\u2014worse off than they were prior to \"development.\" Even where high-value resources are not present, the patterns and institutions of gover- nance are usually the critical factor determining how effectively the poor can harnessecosystems for their livelihoods. Where laws are biased against the poor and governmentpractices disenfranchise them, the potential for better management of ecosystems toalleviate poverty is greatly diminished. This chapter examines key governance conditions that influence whether nature becomes a source of wealth and prosperity for many , or merely a select few. Itfocuses on the three governance factors with the most concrete impacts on the poorand their capacity to derive environmental income: resource tenure and property rights; decentralization of resource management; and the rights to participation, information,and justice. CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OFGOVERNANCEjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:30 PM Page 55These factors revolve around the rights of the poor to physically access and control natural resources, and their right to be heardin decisions about how to utilize these natural resources. Resource Tenure and Property Rights: Access and Ownership A person or community's rights to land and other natural resources defines their natural resource tenure. Legally , tenure isa bundle of both rights and obligations: the rights to own, hold,manage, transfer, or exploit resources and land, but also theobligation not to use these in a way that harms others (Bruce1998a:1; FAO 2002:10). In other words, tenure defines property and what a person or group can do with it\u2014their property rights. However, tenure is not only a leg al concept but a complex social institution, often involving traditional practices andcustomary authorities as much as formal laws. It governs owner-ship and access to natural resources, which is the gateway to useand benefit from these resources. As such, tenure is at the heartof the poor's ability to derive income and subsistence fromecosystems\u2014to make them part of a sufficient and sustainablelivelihood. (See Box 3.1.) In many parts of the world today , resource tenure systems and property rights regimes are undergoing an important evolu-tion. Fundamental shifts are occurring in the way that peopleand institutions think about the ownership of land, water, forests,fisheries, and other natural assets\u2014about who controls theseassets, who benefits from them, and where the power to makedecisions about them is vested. Two countervailing global trends in the evolution of resource tenure are evident. One trend stems from globalization.The growing economic integration of nations and societies hasincreased the sphere of private property and private responsibil-ity , with government assuming a lesser role with respect to theprivate sector and civil society . This has important implicationsfor how public lands and natural resources\u2014often common poolresources\u2014are managed, with more power over resources trans-ferred to corporate interests through privatization or thegranting of resource concessions (Johnson et al. 2001). At the same time, there is a trend toward decentralization of natural resource management. Local and community-level insti-tutions have become more assertive in the management of localresources, and this decentralized approach also has importantimplications for resource tenure. Indigenous groups have, forexample, been more vigorous in pressing their ancestral claims tolands they inhabit but to which they lack formal title. These two trends are shaping\u2014and promise to profoundly transform\u2014the capacity of the poor to earn environmentalincome from natural resources. For example, as illustrated in astudy on the impact of globalization on the implementation ofcommunity-based natural resources management (CBNRM) inthe Philippines, these global trends have the potential to bothundermine and strengthen governance conditions that benefitthe poor (La Vi\u00f1a 2002:24). Growing economic integration through increased trade and the emergence of multilateralenvironmental agreements, such those as on climate change and biodiversity , pose both threats and opportunities for poorcommunities worldwide. The significance for the poor of changes in resource tenure systems and property rights systems is not limited to theireconomic impacts. For many rural communities, resource tenureis a central social institution that governs not only their relation-ship to the land and natural resources but also the relationshipsbetween families, between members of the community and thoseoutside it, and between villages, communities, and peoples.Therefore, changes in tenure and property regimes have implica-tions for the entire social fabric of rural communities. This is truefor all tenure and property systems relevant to natural resources,but is particularly evident in the evolution of land tenure. The Insecurity of the \"Landed Poor\" Most of the rural poor in developing countries have some accessto land on which they can collect forest products, graze animals,grow crops, gather medicinal plants, or in other ways benefitfrom nature. These \"landed poor\" typically remain poor notonly because their land holdings are small, but because theirrights to the land are weak, their tenure insecure (Bruce 2004:1). 56WORLD RESOURCES 2005 ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME AND THE POOR: CRITICAL GOVERNANCE QUESTIONS Resource Tenure: How do property rights enhance or restrict the ability of poor people to derive environmental income? In particular, what is therole of resource tenure in enabling the poor to transform nature into aneconomic asset? How crucial is security of land tenure to the poor's abilityto benefit from natural resources? How important to the poor are commu-nity-based forms of tenure? Decentralization: What effect do institutions such as national forestry or fishery departments, district governments, or village councils have on theability of the poor to access or sustain environmental income? What is therole of the state in natural resource management, and how does thetransition to decentralized and community-level institutions (such astribal structures, local levels of government, cooperatives, user groups, orwatershed committees) affect the poor? When is decentralization thesolution to poverty, and when does decentralization work against the poor? Participation, Information, and Justice: How does political disenfran- chisement prevent the poor from utilizing their natural endowments formore than mere subsistence livelihoods? Conversely, what is the role ofdemocratic rights in ensuring that poor people benefit from naturalresources? How can poor people use better access to information, publicparticipation through their representatives, and access to the courts whentheir rights are violated to increase their capacity to earn environmentalincome? What are the challenges of providing appropriate information,participation opportunities, and real judicial or administrative access topoor communities?jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:30 PM Page 5657CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE Insecure tenure translates to a lack of assurance that one's land or resource rights will be respected over time (Meinzen-Dick et al. 2002:1). In many countries of Southeast Asia, forexample, long-term forest dwellers such as indigenous peoplesand local farmers often have de facto access to forests, but their tenurial control over trees, timber, and the right to manage forestuses is often limited in scope and unrecognized in law (Lynchand Talbott 1995:29). For instance, the traditional system offorest tenure (called adat) recognized by many forest dwellers in Indonesia has often been ignored by the government, whichasserts legal ownership of all forest areas in spite of customary orhistoric uses (WRI et al. 2000:36-37). In addition, the ability of the rural poor to participate in political decisions that affect their livelihoods often is limited bythe power of other, more politically connected, parties with aninterest in the same resources. Government agencies, corpora-tions, large landowners, poor farmers, indigenous peoples, anddifferent ethnic or cultural groups frequently make overlappingand conflicting claims on the same set of natural resources.Unfortunately , unless the tenure rights of the poor are secure,they usually lose out in these conflicts over competing claims(Alden Wily 2004:5). While many forms of resource tenure are important, land tenure\u2014rights over the land itself\u2014is often the most fundamen-tal building block of prosperity for the poor (Deininger et al.2003:5). That is because land rights underpin most otherresource rights, with the exception of offshore marine resources.Without secure land tenure, it is difficult to conceive of the poor being able to generate wealth from nature. Tenure Security and Environmental Investment Security of tenure exerts tremendous influence on how land andresources are used. Secure tenure can be defined as the certaintythat a person's rights to continuous use of land or resources willbe recognized and protected against challenges from individualsor the state. This kind of certainty provides an incentive to makelong-term investments in maintaining or enhancing the produc-tivity of that property . For instance, a person with the right to usean agricultural field for decades or a lifetime may invest in anirrigation system whereas a farmer leasing a field for only a yearwill not (Bruce 1998a:2). When insecurity of tenure acts as a disincentive to long- term investments in soil conservation, irrigation, and the like,land quality can deteriorate and agricultural productivitysuffer. For this reason, tenure reform is frequently a componentof development projects aimed at enhancing food security andsustainable livelihoods for the rural poor. Tenure reform isdistinct from land reform in that it does not redistribute parcelsof land per se, but rather makes adjustments in the rights tohold and use land. Examples of land tenure reforms includestrengthening informal tenure rights by making them legallyenforceable and transforming state-issued permits for specificland uses into leases that provide more protection for users ofthe land (FAO 2002:20). Continues on page 59jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:30 PM Page 5758UNDERSTOOD BROADLY, \"TENURIAL natural r esources are synonymous with \"property rights.\" Tenure covers all the means by which individuals andcommunities gain legitimate access to and use of naturalresources. To know who has tenure over a natural resource is toidentify who owns the resource, who can use or extract it, whocan exclude others from having access to it, and who benefitsfrom exploiting it. As such, the details of how tenure is deter-mined and recognized\u2014particularly through national laws andpolicies\u2014greatly affects the rural poor, whose lives depend onaccess to ecosystems. Typical tenure rights and obligations include: The right to use the resource (the \"usufruct\" right) or control how it will be used The right to exclude others from unauthorized use The right to derive income from the resource The right to sell all or some of these rights to others, eitherpermanently, or for a limited time (such as through a lease) The right to pass these rights down to one's successors (theright of descendants to inherit land or resource rights) Protection from illegal expropriation of the resource An obligation not to use the land in a way that is harmful to others An obligation to surrender these rights through a lawfulaction, (e.g., in a case of insolvency, the rights are surren-dered to creditors; in the case of default on tax payments, therights are surrendered to the state) (FAO 2002:10) Resource tenure includes rights over land, but it encompasses other natural resources as well. Land tenure is the usual focusof public interest, but distinct tenure arrangements apply aswell to forest resources (Lynch and Talbot 1995), fisheries(Kinch 2003; Pereira 2000), mangroves et al.2004; Ayudhaya and Ross 1998), wildlife (Alinon 2002;Hasler 2002), and other natural resources. In a forest, tenuremight translate not just to the right to harvest timber but tothe ability to harvest fruit from certain trees, to collect fallenbranches for fire wood, or bamboo for building materials. Infisheries it might mean the right to fish certain waters,harvest certain species but not others, or fish at certain timesof the year. Resource tenure covers not only formal property rights recog- nized by the legal system and enforced by the government,such as land titles or forestry licenses. It also refers to tradi-tional practices\u2014often unwritten and informal\u2014throughwhich rural people secure access to natural resources. Officialdocuments issued by the government are not the only ways that tenure is recognized in rural areas. Evidence of long-termoccupation or of observance of customary law are other recog-nized ways of establishing tenure. Experience shows thatwhere states emphasize the use of formal processes andofficial documents to acknowledge resource tenure rights, itis likely that poor communities, particularly indigenouspeoples, will be disenfranchised (Lynch and Talbot 1995:7). Tenurial rights include but are not equivalent to ownership. The absence of full ownership over a natural resource does notpreclude the possibility of other tenure rights over a naturalresource (Schlager and Ostrom 1992:256). For example: The state may own the forests in its territory but recognize theright of occupants to utilize timber or non-timber resourcesthrough some kind of permitting system. Protected areas may be part of the public domain, but theright of indigenous peoples and other long-term occupants toinhabit these areas may be legally recognized. Coastal waters may be claimed by the state, but local fishersmay be granted rights over customary, near-shore fisheries./orn8flipBOX 3.1 UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF RESOURCE TENURE jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:30 PM Page 5859CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE This is true as well for tenure rights over forests, fisheries, and other natural resources where the benefits of good steward-ship can only be gained over time. For example, given theirlimited resources, it is unlikely that the poor would see a value ininvesting in sustainable forest management practices, includingreforestation, if their tenure over forests is restricted and theycan't count on reaping the benefits of such practices. Tenurereform, in this context, would require addressing these tenureinsecurities by providing longer time-frames for forest manage-ment agreements, or by recognizing the communal ownershiprights of groups who have long occupied forest lands. Thus, onestudy of joint forest management agreements in India\u2014agree-ments between local communities and the state allowing limitedlocal management and use rights on state forest lands\u2014notes anurgent need to first resolve the issue of tenure security to givethese community-state agreements a foundation for success(Reddy and Bandhii 2004:29). Security of tenure is important for poverty reduction because it allows poor people to grow more food, harvestproducts for consumption or trade, invest more in economically productive activities, or use property to obtain credit. Somestudies report that investment doubles on land where tenure isstrengthened (Feder 2002, cited in Deininger et al. 2003:8).Recent research also indicates that countries with equitable,efficient land tenure systems, ensuring property rights for bothwomen and men, tend to achieve faster, more sustainableeconomic development with high levels of food security , health,and welfare (FAO 2002:5; Deininger 2003:17-20). Case studies from Asia, Africa, and Latin America have also shown that tenure security affects people's long-term investmentsin modern management practices that can raise productivity ,such as agroforestry techniques, livestock feeding practices, orintegrated pest management (Meinzen-Dick et al. 2002:1).Failure to invest in agriculture, fisheries, and forest managementdue to tenure insecurity can greatly impede development goals.In Ethiopia, the nation's tenure regime changed radically in1975 as the government nationalized all rural land with theintent to distribute land rights more equitably . Unfortunately ,continued changes in tenure laws, a growing rural population,and insufficient land to meet demands, have led to markedlyinsecure land tenure for many . This has undermined investmentin agriculture, worked against food security , and contrib uted to land degradation (Kebede 2002:138-140). The Importance of Communal Tenure Property rights can be held by private entities or by the state, andby an individual or a group. Property rights experts generallyidentify four basic kinds of tenure or ownership (FAO 2002:8): Private, or owned by an individual, corporation, or institution; Communal, or owned in common by a defined group of individuals, such as a village, tribe, or commune; State, or owned by the government; Open access, or owned by no one. The term \"communal\" has been used to cover a plethora of ownership situations, ranging from resources that can be used byvirtually anyone (more accurately described as open-access) toresources that are used simultaneously or serially by multipleusers, such as land on which all community members havegrazing rights or traditional fishing grounds where they can fish.It also applies to tenure arrangements in which ownership isvested in the community , which in turn allocates land or otherresources among households for cultivation, resource extraction,and other uses. Communal tenure systems thus may encompassstrong household and individual rights to use a particularresource or parcel of land, often passed down by inheritancethrough a family . In fact, holding exclusive use-rights in a tradi-tional, community-based tenure system can be as secure asprivate, individually titled property rights in Western countries(Rukuni 1999:4). (See Figure 3.1.)

However, the fraction of forestunder community management varies widely by country. In Mexico, over 80percent of commercially harvested forests are controlled by the people wholive in and around them.

More recently , h owever, European colonial p owers introduced the western concept of private, individual property . In colonialAfrica, both the British and the French created enclaves ofindividually owned property in urban areas as well as whitesettler farms, but only cautiously expanded the concept ofindividually titled property to selected Africans (Bruce 2000:17).Among West African countries, individualized tenure oftenappeared in tandem with the introduction of cash crops forexport (Elbow et al. 1998:5). Contrary to the belief of some Western observers, commu- nally owned resources (which are a form of common poolresources) are not inevitably subject to overuse and destruction\u2014the so-called \"tragedy of the commons\" popularized by GarrettHardin in his scholarly article in 1968 (Hardin 1968). Hardin'sthesis\u2014that natural resources held in common will inevitably beoverused\u2014more accurately pertains to open-access resourcesrather than to communally owned and managed resources. Withopen-access resources, such as ocean fisheries in internationalwaters or state forests where the government presence is weak orabsent, all potential users have equal access to the resource andnone can be excluded. In contrast, in well-functioning commu-nal tenure situations, the community itself is able to excludeoutsiders from using the resource and to enforce norms ofbehavior\u2014such as fishing or grazing limits\u2014for its own members' resource use (Ostrom et al. 1999:278). Recent research has shown that community-based tenure systems can be quite compatible with sustainable resource useunder the right conditions. For instance, a study of twoGuatemalan communities, Las Cebollas and Moran, found thatwhen community members perceive a resource as both necessaryand scarce, they invest in efforts to protect it from overuse (Jensen2000:641). In Jordan, herder cooperatives with managementrights on their traditional pastures are achieving higher rangeproductivity than state-managed reserves, without requiringexpensive fencing and guarding (Ngaido and McCarthy 2004:1). The Duality of Emerging Tenure Systems In practice, property rights in many developing countries reflecta diversity of tenure regimes. Customary regimes based on localtraditions, institutions, and power structures such as chiefdomsand family lineages may exist alongside the formal legal tenuresystem sanctioned by the state. Customary tenure systems haveevolved and adapted over time to meet the needs of communitymembers, and they continue to do so in response to modern-daypressures (Elbow et al. 1998:10). This includes the introductionof more individualized property rights arrangements in tradi-tional communal arrangements. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:31 PM Page 60A rural community's customary tenure system is often composed of several different kinds of tenure, each of whichdefines different rights and responsibilities for the use of diverseresources. Clear individual or household rights are generallyallocated for more or less exclusive use of arable and residentialland, while group rights ma y prevail f or use of pastures, forests, mountain areas, waterways, and sacred areas (Rukuni 1999:2). But customary tenure systems today do not exist independ- ently . They inevitably live in relationship\u2014often uneasily\u2014withmodern state-sanctioned tenure systems. The upshot is that inmany parts of the developing world, land tenure systems exhibita dual nature\u2014that is, property rights that are partly individual-ized and formalized in legal statutes, and partly community-basedand grounded in customary practices (Elbow et al. 1998:16). For example, in many African countries\u2014including the Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, andTogo\u2014land markets based on individualized tenure havedeveloped in response to a perceived commercial potential. Forinstance, in Cote d'Ivoire, immigrants to forest areas \"buy\"land from the local population in order to produce cash crops(Elbow et al. 1998:10). Tenure systems are also evolving because of changing patterns in herding versus sedentary agriculture. In parts ofBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, tenure systems tradi-tionally have been based on overlapping rights to use land. Forexample, herders might leave their animals on croplands during the dry season, effectively exchanging the soil nutrientsin animal manure for the right to graze their animals on cropstubble, while sedentary farmers might grow crops on pastureland during the rainy season. Increasing ly, however, cultivators are expanding into herding, and herders into sedentary agricul-ture. This has led to a breakdown in traditional tenurearrangements, growing tensions between competing groups,and an apparent shift from overlapping rights to exclusiverights over particular land parcels (Elbow et al. 1998:10). The state frequently adds to these conflicts through changes in national land policies that weaken customary or community-basedtenure practices. In Niger, tenure reforms in the 1960s and 1970sabolished the system of \"tithe\" payments that tenant farmers paidto local chiefs under customary tenure practice and asserted stateownership over all lands. The intent was to give greater land rightsto tenant farmers. However, later refo rms in the 1980s reasserted the right of traditional chiefs to control land use by allocatingpasture and agricultural land. The confusion brought on by theseland policies has created conflicts between farmers, pastoralists,and customary chiefs and landowners, and has weakened tenuresecurity for all parties (Bruce et al. 1995:19-21.) The dual nature of land tenure arrangements persists whether national policies explicitly recognize customary tenuresystems, ignore them, or actively work to dismantle them.Attempts to completely overturn customary tenure systems andreplace them with formalized systems of purely individualproperty rights have rarely been effective, prompting a shift inapproach from replacement to adaptation (Bruce 1998b:81).For instance, in the case of forest land claimed by the state, thestate may grant individuals from a community the right tocollect medicinal plants or fallen branches for firewood, andlocal groups might have the right to plant trees, but the statemight reserve the right to approve any felling of trees and tocollect revenue from timber users (Meinzen-Dick et al. 2004:7).Joint forest management agreements between communities andstate governments in India often follow this pattern, recogniz-ing in law certain community use-rights but retaining for thestate many of the other prerogatives of property ownership,including ultimate title. The balance between the two components of dual tenure systems is dynamic and ever-shifting . In general, h owever, customary systems operate as the de facto allocators of land andnatural resources in rural areas, with the rules of such allocationincreasingly subject to modification by national policies andinstitutions and in response to changing economic conditions(Elbow et al. 1998:16-17). Grassroots Pressure for Effective, Equitable Tenure Reform Today there is mounting pressure for government tenure reform, a mark of the centrality and dynamism of the rural tenure issue.In part, rural populations themselves are responsible for thispressure, as land sits idle and grossly unequal land holdings 61CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR SUCCESSFUL COMMUNALMANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Why are some groups that use common pool resources able to prevent the \"tragedy of the commons\" while others are not? By examining thousandsof case studies, researchers have identified the following conditions ascrucial for successful community management of shared resources. 1. There is a clear definition of who has the right to use the resource and who does not, and clearly defined boundaries of the resource. 2. Users feel that their obligations for managing and maintaining the resource are fair in light of the benefits received. 3. Rules governing when and how the resource is used are adapted to local conditions. 4. Most individuals affected by the rules can participate in setting or changing them. 5. Use of the resource and compliance with rules is actively monitored by the users themselves or by parties accountable to the users. 6. People violating the rules are disciplined by the users or by parties accountable to them, with penalties imposed in accordance with theseriousness and context of the offense. 7. Local institutions are available to resolve conflicts quickly and at low cost.8. Government authorities recognize users' rights to devise their own management institutions and plans. Adapted from Ostrom 1990:90jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:31 PM uneasily with landlessness, poverty , and the hovering specter of hunger in many parts of the developing world. Additional impetus comes from research showing that unequal access to land and other productive assets is a definingfeature of persistent poverty (Riddell 2000). Peruvian economistHernando de Soto argues that the lack of a well-defined systemfor recording, transferring, and enforcing the property rights ofthe poor is a major source of continued poverty , since it does notallow the poor to make use of their assets for collateral and credit,thus barring them from productive investments (de Soto 2000). These and other findings have contributed to a growing consensus that establishing secure property rights and makingrural land markets work for poor farmers and rural producers isone of the keys to effective poverty reduction. In fact, de Sotogoes so far as to predict that the countries that achieve substantialeconomic progress over the next two decades will be those thathave developed strong property rights institutions (Riddell 2000). Against this backdrop, tenure reform has emerged as an essential component of a broader sociopolitical transition togreater democracy and decentralization in developingcountries. Governments are starting to recognize that custom-ary , community-based tenure systems are legal in their ownright. They are beginning to put these systems on an equal legalfooting with Western, individualized property rights (AldenWily et al. 2000). Tenure reform movements are active in allregions of the developing world, including Sub-Saharan Africa,Asia, Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe, withdozens of countries initiating major tenure-reform efforts in thepast decade. For example, Thailand has recently completed a major initiative to provide the country's rural population withaccess to modern land registration, deeds, and credit institutions(Riddell 2000). Mexico has undertaken reforms to strengthenland and credit markets and improve the access to land amongpoorer households (Carter 2003:52). Whether tenure reforms positively or adversely affect the poor depends on who designs and ultimately implements them.The extent to which the interests of the poor are represented andpromoted by national and local institutions\u2014both criticalplayers in enforcing tenure rights\u2014is key to ensuring that tenurereforms do in fact assist the poor. Decentralization: Can It Help the Poor? Across diverse economic and policy sectors, from health care andeducation to parks and wildlife management, decentralization isone of the most frequently pursued institutional reforms indeveloping countries today . Decentralization is a process by which a central government transfers some of its powers or functions to a lower level ofgovernment or to a local leader or institution. In the natural-resource sector, an example of decentralization might betransferring from central to local government the responsibilityfor managing a tract of forest land, including the right to collectsome of the income from sales of timber harvests in that forest.Or the central government might give a farmers group responsi-bility for managing an irrigation system, or grant a village TABLE 3.1 DECENTRALIZATION: WILL IT HELP THE POOR? Pros Promotes democracy because it provides better opportunities for local residents to participate in decision-making. Increases efficiency in delivery of public services; delegation of responsibility avoids bottlenecks and bureaucracy. Provides a chance for poor households to participate in local institutions and have their concerns recognized. Leads to higher quality of public services because of local accountabil- ity and sensitivity to local needs. Enhances social and economic development, which rely on local knowledge. Increases transparency, accountability, and the response-capacity of government institutions. Allows greater political representation for diverse political, ethnic, religious, and economic groups in decision-making. Increases political stability and national unity by allowing citizens to better control public programs at the local level.Cons Undermines democracy by empowering local elites, beyond the reach or concern of central government. Worsens delivery of service in the absence of effective controls and oversight. Local institutions mirror the anti-poor biases present at the state level. Quality of services deteriorates due to lack of local capacity and insufficient resources. Gains arising from participation by local people offset by increased corruption and inequalities among regions. Promises too much and overloads capacity of local governments. Creates new tensions or ignites dormant ethnic and religious rivalries.Weakens states because it can increase regional inequalities, lead to separatism, or undermine national financial governance.

Decentralization is being driven by powerful economic, political, and technological forces. International developmentagencies such as the World Bank have placed decentralization ina prominent position on their agendas, and nongovernmentalorganizations (NGOs) and governments alike have promoted theconcept, although often for different reasons. Advocates ofdecentralization cite the potential for greater efficiency , equity ,and accountability when decision-making is ,devolving power from central government means empoweringlocal institutions that can better discern how to manageresources and deliver services to meet the needs of local people.Modern communication options like the Internet, television, andmobile phones help make local people and organizations moreaware of their rights, more able to communicate and organize,and therefore more capable of asserting their rights. But are central governments really so eager to give up some of the powers they have traditionally wielded? In the 1980s andearly 1990s, decentralization emerged as a priority in an era ofeconomic and budget crises. Shifting responsibility for healthcare, education, parks, and other planning and service functionsto local governments offered opportunities to reduce centralgovernment budget deficits. Central governments are all toowilling to pass on to local and community institutions theresponsibility for managing resources and delivering serviceswithout providing them with necessary financial or technicalsupport. They tend to be much mor e reluctant, h owever, to give up their powers to collect and allocate user fees, fines, or otherrevenues (WRI et al. 2003:98). Areas with rich natural resource endowments tend to be geographically isolated and far from centers of political powerwhere the most momentous development decisions are made.Furthermore, central governments are often run by and forelites, and people from poor rural communities or ethnic minor-ity groups seldom occupy senior positions in the decision-makinglevels of bureaucracies (Sibanda 2000:3). ( See Table 3.1.) Not All Decentralization Is Created Equal Some decentralization advocates\u2014governments, donors, andNGOs\u2014view the poor as particular beneficiaries of decentraliza-tion. They envision reforms that make policies more useful to thepoor, and processes that encourage the involvement of the mostsocially disenfranchised people in natural resource decision-making\u2014those people who have the greatest stake in theoutcome of management decisions (Asante and Ayee 2004:3-6,21-22). These advocates point out that effectively implementingpoverty reduction strategies often requires specific local knowl-edge that is best found in local institutions, and that strengtheninglocal delivery capacity for services requires genuine devolution ofauthority to these institutions (Asante and Ayee 2004:5). Some countries have responded positively to these arguments. Bolivia, for example, made decentralization acrossseveral sectors part of a package of anti-poverty reforms in the 1990s (Pacheco 2004:85, 90). Most West African countries havealso declared local development a prime goal of their decen-tralization efforts (Ribot 2002:8). Despite its theoretical potential, the record of decentraliza- tion has been decidedly mixed. This is true both in general andwith respect to poverty reduction. In some instances, efforts todecentralize management of forests, land, water, and fisherieshave shown positive outcomes: rural citizens conserving theirnatural resources; local councils that are increasing revenuesfrom resource use; the poor more involved in local governanceinstitutions and reaping more monetary benefits from localresources; and local governments providing better basic services.One of the longest-standing cases of decentralized environmen-tal management with evident benefits to livelihoods is inKumaon, India. Since the 1930s, elected forest councils, calledvan panch ayats, have had the right to manage forest use, raising revenue from the sale of fodder and dead trees and enforcingregulations on forest use (Ribot 2004:22). Similarly , some wildlife co-management schemes in Africa have yielded improved local infrastructure such as roads andschools, while community forest management in Mexico that has come about through decentralization has enabled communities to build water networks, schools, and clinics jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:31 PM Page 6364WORLD RESOURCES 2005 (Shyamsundar et al. 2004: 9). In Ghana, devolution of power to district assemblies has improved provision of basic services andinfrastructure in rural areas through construction of morefeeder roads, clinics, public toilets, classrooms, and the like(Asante and Ayee 2004:8). Yet in most decentralization efforts to date, the intended benefits for local democracy and for the poor remain largelyunrealized, due to flawed implementation of the reforms. Thechoice of which institutions to empower with new managementor decision-making responsibilities, and the ways in which thoseinstitutions are held accountable to the people, have profoundimplications for the effectiveness of decentralization\u2014andwhether the benefits reach the poor (Ribot 2004:25). How Decentralization Can Harm the Poor Governance reforms that are truly empowering for the poor,responsive to their needs, and effective in reducing poverty arerare (Crook and Sverrisson 2001:iii). In a 2001 analysis of decen-tralization cases from about a dozen locations in Asia, Africa,and Latin America, only Brazil, Colombia, and the Indian statesof West Bengal and Karnataka showed good results in terms ofincreasing policy responsiveness to the poor, or reducing povertyand inequality (Crook and Sverrisson 2001:14-15). Most reforms in the name of decentralization come up short in two areas that are critical to bringing about benefits tolocal populations and the poor: they don't create accountable, representative local institutions, nor do they transfer meaningful powers to them (Ribot 2004:15). Such incomplete or partial decentralization undermines the potential benefits of gover-nance reforms, particularly for the poor. Decentralization without Accountability Often, powers over natural resources are handed over to aperson or body not elected by the people, and thus not whollyaccountable to them, such as a traditional chief, or to a civil-society organization such as a women's association, or to a\"user group\" such as a forestry cooperative, or a pastoralists'group. Such groups may help broaden grassroots participationin local decisions, but they speak for only a segment of thecitizenry . For example, Cameroon's community forest lawdevolves power to local forest-management committees. Whilethe law requires these groups to consult \"representatives\" of allsegments of the community , it is unclear by whom these repre-sentatives are chosen, and the results of the consultation arenot binding in forest management plans (Ribot 2004:35).Similarly , in Uganda, the wildlife authority created a commit-tee of beekeepers, but its mandate was so narrow that onlyinterested parties participated\u2014and these beekeepers thenexcluded other forest users from PM Page 6465Retention of Central Government Control Another common implementation flaw is to empower a districtoffice of the government or a local representative of the centralgovernment. Such an office or official is accountable only tocentral government authorities, not to the people in the town ormunicipality . Central governments frequently choose to transferpower to a local branch of the bureaucracy , rather than a locallyelected body , as a means of maintaining central control overnatural resources (Larson and Ribot 2004:6). In China, thecentral government devolved management of community forestsin name, but in practice has shifted greater power to the provin-cial level, and has implemented national-level policies thatoverride and often contradict local policies (He 2005). Lack of Power to Generate Revenue Even where local democratic institutions or bodies are chargedwith natural resource management, they are commonlyentrusted with duties that are circumscribed in scope, and rarelywith the power to generate revenue by setting fees or levyingfines. The central government often retains the most lucrativepowers\u2014such as the right to assess wildlife hunting fees orallocate revenue from a logging or mining concessions\u2014whilegranting rural communities or governments the less valuablerights to subsistence-scale harvesting, such as the collection offirewood or bamboo. Elite Dominance of Elections, Participation, and Decisions All too often, the fundamental differences in power between richand poor warp the decentralization process, allowing members ofelite, wealthier, more empowered groups to shape decentralizationto their own ends and derive most of its benefits (Ribot 2004:41).Decentralization then becomes largely a transfer of power fromnational to local elites. In Indonesia, for example, many of thebenefits of rural timber extraction during the Suharto era accruedto powerful business interests in Jakarta, the capital, and illegallogging was widespread. In the decentralization that followed thefall of the Suharto regime in 1998, a realignment of influenceoccurred, with district governments taking more control overmanaging timber extraction. Now the influence of local elites andbusiness interests predominates. Rather than cracking down onillegal logging, this has tended to perpetuate the cycle, often withsimilar inequities and environmental damage (McCarthy2002:879, 881-82; Djogo and Syaf 2003:9-13, 20-22). Elites can also slant the electoral process, giving them the upper hand in local governance, and, accordingly , in thedecisions made about natural resources by those institutions. Fairand competitive elections are a key means to make policies moreresponsive to the poor, and create a local government that isaccountable to local people (Crook and Sverrisson 2001:50). Butelites often have a disproportionate influence on which candi-dates will run for election\u2014candidates that may then bebeholden to their interests. Indeed, party politics are oftendominated by local elites.Parties, in turn, often run slates of party candidates, putting independent candidates at a disadvantage. When officials areelected from party slates rather than independently , researchsuggests that these officials have less accountability , in particularto the poorest citizens (Ribot 2004:27). In contrast, whenindependent candidates are given a fair shake, elections are morecompetitive, and the interests of the poor may be better served.Unfortunately , independent candidates are often barred fromlocal elections. In a 2001 assessment of decentralization in 14countries, only five (India, Mali, Mexico, Uganda, andZimbabwe) permitted independent candidates in local elections(Ribot 2004:27). Senegal shows the shortcomings, especially for poor popula- tions, of electoral systems that do not admit independentcandidates. In 1998 a new decentralized forestry law grantedrural communities and their councils various rights over forests,including the right to authorize or deny commercial productionof charcoal by the forest service and wealthy urban merchants\u2014a forest use rural communities had long opposed. Yet yearsafter the forestry law was enacted, the forest service continuedcharcoal production. Surprisingly , the forest service's charcoalextraction had the approval of rural council presidents, despitethe fact that almost everyone in the communities in the regionopposed it. Elected from a party slate, these council presidentswere beholden to the party , rather than the local popular will(Ribot 2004:27-29). Inadequate Participation by the Poor in Decentralized BodiesEven when decisions and policy-making are devolved to a bodymade up of independently elected local people, there are inher-ent biases against equal participation by the poor. Because oftheir greater confidence, literacy , or other advantages, the better-off members of a community tend to assume positions ofleadership in committees and councils. A study in West Bengal,India, showed that panchayat (village council) members from lower castes or tribes rarely spoke in meetings and, if they did,they tended to be ignored (Westergaard 1986 in Crook andSverrisson 2001:16). Moreover, the poorest members of the community are less able to shoulder the costs of participating in decentralizednatural resource management, including membership fees, timespent in meetings or monitoring forests for poachers, and provid-ing labor for maintenance of infrastructure such as irrigationsystems (Shyamsundar et al. 2004:10). In addition, the earliestparticipants in projects often have more voice and opportunity toshape outcomes; the poor, joining in later stages, if at all, are lessable to garner benefits (Ribot 2004:39). Shortcomings of \"User Committees\" Decentralized natural resource management often fosters thecreation of user committees or user groups, which have prolifer-ated in developing countries since the 1990s (Shyamsundar et al. 2004:5). Intended to give ordinary people a voice in localCHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE Continues on page 68jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:31 PM Page 6566COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (CBNRM) is one of the most important manifestations of truedecentralization as it relates to control of rural resources.CBNRM programs, if successful, can be models of localempowerment, imbuing communities with greater authorityover the use of natural resources. Under the right circum-stances, they can also bring important benefits to poor peopleand poor communities. Improved Livelihoods In many countries, community-based management of forestsand other natural resources has improved livelihoods for thepoor. The benefits of CBNRM can range from job creation tosubstantial management rights and long-term revenue-genera-tion. For instance, in Nepal, community management of forestshas created new jobs, including nursery staff and forest watch-ers, as well as wage labor for tree planting and weeding (Malla2000:41). Community forestry concessions along the bordersof the Mayan Biosphere reserve in Guatemala have generatedmore than 100,000 days of labor per year (Cortave 2004:26). Where high-value resources such as timber are involved, CBNRM can generate significant revenues. A large forestryproject in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh earns anestimated $125 million per year for the communities involved,through sales of sustainably harvested timber and non-timberforest products (Shilling and Osha 2003:13). Improved Resource Condition A crucial element of community-based management is its poten-tial to improve the condition of the resources being managed. TheKrui people of southwestern Sumatra have practiced a complexform of agroforestry for generations, planting a succession ofcrops that culminate in a full forest canopy. Their agroforestssupport about ten times more biodiversity than conventional palmplantations in the area, and have economic uses ranging fromresin tapping to timber sales (ASB 2001:1-2). In northeastern India, the Khasi School of Medicine and others are working to re-establish traditional laws and practices of forestmanagement to safeguard sacred groves of medicinal plants,which had been depleted under centralized management of theresource since the 1950s (Varshney 2003:46). In 1996 theGuatemalan government began awarding forest managementconcessions to settler communities living on the borders of thetwo million-hectare Mayan biosphere reserve in the lowland Pet\u00e9nregion. Satellite imagery indicates that the 388,000 hectaresunder community management show better forest cover thanadjacent areas (Molnar et al. 2004:19) .Development of Village Infrastructure In some communities, a portion of the revenues from community-based enterprises has been directed to investments in keyinfrastructure needs, such as the construction of schools andlibraries, development of drinking water and irrigation systems,and extension of electricity service (Malla 2000:42). Communitymanagement of land and water use in Gandhigram, Gujarat, hasincreased both the area and yield of lands under cultivation,despite three successive years of drought. The increase in incomehas gone toward village improvements, including fencing to keepout wild animals, construction and maintenance of irrigationstructures, tractor and equipment purchases, and to pay downvillage debt (Down to Earth 2002). In another example, themountain village of Lazoor, Iran, was one of a number of villagesgranted substantial control over their land and water resources bythe Iranian government in 1999. With technical support fromoutside experts, the community built an extensive irrigation anderosion-control infrastructure, increasing productivity andopening new lands to cultivation (WRI et al. 2003:183-184). Representation in Decision-Making Roles CBNRM is most successful at benefiting the poorest membersof the community when it empowers them to play a fulldecision-making role in resource management. One example ofa community-based enterprise featuring equitable participationcomes from the village of Deulgaon in Maharashtra State inIndia, where the community's forest-management committeeincludes representation by one male and one female memberfrom each household, and all decisions regarding forest use aremade by the general membership at its monthly meeting, ratherthan by an executive committee (Ghate 2003:9). CBNRM inTanzania has sometimes spurred significant social changewithin the community itself, such that villagers graduallybecome less deferential to existing leaders and eventually mayreplace underperforming managers who serve their own self-interest rather than the interests of the community as a whole(Alden Wily et al. 2000:44). In Lazoor, Iran\u2014mentioned above\u2014the land management program gave women a direct voice in priority-setting, with apositive impact on their confidence and role in broader villagedecision-making (WRI et al. 2003:184-185). In the MapelaneReserve on the northeast coast of South Africa, a partnershipbetween the local Sokhulu people and the government ParksBoard resulted in the regeneration of mussel beds that had beena source of bitter conflict. The co-management scheme thatemerged altered the community's role from illegal harvesters toresource managers. The Joint Mussel Management Committee,consisting of elected community members, park representatives,BOX 3.2 HOW COMMUNITY-BASED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CAN BENEFIT THE POORjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:31 PM Page 6667and university researchers, established management rules only after an extended process of experimentation and consultationwith Sokhulu harvesters (WRI et al. 2003:176-179). Reason for Caution CBNRM can suffer from the same flaws that threaten all forms ofdecentralized management. Devolving decision-making power tothe local level does not guarantee the poor a role in the process.An examination of Bolivia's effort to decentralize forest manage-ment found that the process did create new opportunities formarginalized groups to gain control of local resources andcapture more of the economic benefits. However, only the better-organized groups have thus far been able to capitalize on theprocess; elsewhere, decentralization has simply strengthened thelocal elites (Kaimowitz et al. 1999:13-14). Forest-user communities are often socially and politically diverse, with a range of different income levels represented (Malleson2001:18). Unless these distinctions are taken into account,CBNRM will often end up favoring the more powerful. When thegovernment of Laos introduced its land and forest allocationPolicy in the early 1990s, it meant to foster local control oversome of the country's agriculture and forest lands. However, thepolicy resulted in wealthier farmers reinforcing their rights to thebest land, while small farmers and landless households foundtheir access to both agricultural land and forest resources greatly reduced (Fujita and Phanvilay 2004:12). Gaps in access to information about resource rights can also cause community forestry programs to work against the peoplethey should support. In a blatant manipulation of the system in Cameroon, local elites in one region used community forestrylaws to gain management rights over forests in another region,taking advantage of communities that were not yet aware of howto use the forestry law to protect their rights (Smith 2005:14).Studies from Nepal, one of the first countries to make a seriousattempt to devolve forest management, show that lack of accessto information and elite capture of forest-user groups have cutmany of the poor out of benefits from community forestry(Neupane 2003:55-56, 58). Finally, high transaction costs and complicated application and management requirements can deter communities fromparticipating in CBNRM, or make it financially unsustainablefor them to do so. In Cameroon, the application procedure togain legal recognition of a community forest is lengthy andcentralized. The costs for communities are significant\u2014evenmore so because management rights are granted for only aten-year period. Due in large part to these difficulties, onlyseven official community forests were established from Page 6768WORLD RESOURCES 2005 resource management, user committees do draw citizens into the policy process and give them significant influence oversome programs. H owever, these committees aren't usually democratically elected, and they don't always benefit thepoorest members of society . They also tend to have a short life-span, which disadvantages poorer members of the communitywho need more time to develop the skills, confidence, andorganizational capacities to participate on an equal footing.The only situations in which poor people are consistently ableto wield influence in user committees is when the groupsconsist largely or entirely of poor people\u2014for example, gather-ers of non-timber forest products for subsistence use (Manor2004:188 in Ribot and Larson 2004). Project Bias Toward Wealthier Villages and Participants Government agencies, donors, and nonprofit groups engaged indecentralization of natural resources management often haveincentives to avoid poorer constituents and invest in wealthiergroups or villages with better skills or higher-quality landsneeded to make projects succeed. For example, managers of astate-funded watershed development program in the Indian stateof Madhya Pradesh tended to work with more prosperousfarmers in the valleys, where projects were more likely to gener-ate dramatic results, rather than engaging with poorer hill farmers (Baviskar 2004:30-31 in Ribot and Larson 2004).Similarly , selection for anti-poverty employment programs in theIndian state of Karnataka was based on information provided byvillage leaders\u2014who tended to be wealthier than other partici-pants\u2014resulting in the inclusion of many better-off families(Sivanna 1990:200 in Crook and Sverrisson 2001:20). Gender Inequalities in Decision-Making Women are typically among the poorest and most disadvan-taged groups in developing countries. It is no surprise that theytend to be under-represented in positions of authority in localgovernments, village committees, and other decentralizeddecision-making bodies to which powers over natural resourcesare increasingly being devolved. Husbands often do not liketheir wives to attend group activities, and traditional workingpatterns and government structures tend to favor men'sdominance in public decision-making. For example, in state-approved village forest management groups in India and Nepal,women are likely to be relegated to a peripheral role(Shyamsundar et al. 2004:92-93). In Bangladesh, an analysis of local elected governance bodies, known as Union Parishads, found that women tend tohead committees related to community welfare with little jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 6869influence over disbursement of resources, while men typically ran and served on committees clearly related to resourceallocation, like finance, agriculture, fisheries, livestock, andinfrastructure (Mukhopadhyay 2003:59). Women also have amuch smaller chance of becoming elected officials in localgovernment. A study of over 15,000 municipalities in 42countries found that only 8 percent of all local mayors arewomen (UCLG 2003). (See Figure 3.2.) When women are absent from decision- making, issues that affect them are more likely to be overlooked. The inequity of thissituation is all the more glaring in light of the fact that womenare often charged with responsibility for collecting and usingnatural resources such as water, fuelwood, and other resourcesfor the family's benefit. New Demands on the Poor Decentralization that transfers responsibility for managingservices and projects to local institutions and communitieswithout providing the financial resources needed to do so canend up creating extra burdens for the poor. For example, inMongolia, local governments were given new responsibilitiesfor winter preparedness and the cold-weather provisioning oflivestock herds, but no new financial resources to meet thisresponsibility . The result was massive livestock mortality during the brutal winters of 1999-2002, and loss of one-fifth of thenation's herd (Mearns 2004:137). In other cases, newly empow-ered local governments may enact new revenue-raisingmeasures that hurt the poor. In Malawi, local governments withnew decentralized responsibilities have established village-levelenterprise taxes that could stifle fledgling efforts of the ruralpoor to build their assets and diversity their incomes by startingsmall businesses (Ellis et al. 2003:1507-1508). Loss of Access to Natural Resources Privatization\u2014the transfer of public resources such as forests toprivate individuals and corporations\u2014is often done in the nameof decentralization. This transfer of management authorityexcludes the public from participation in decisions about theresource and often means the direct physical exclusion of peoplefrom the land or water as well, with the poor generally sufferingmost from such loss of access (Ribot 2004:52). Devolving power over local resources to communities or groups within those communities can also bring problems ofexclusion. For example, a community granted the power tomanage a tract of public forest might decide to contract with alogging company in one area of the forest to raise revenue. Inthe process, it may limit local people's collection of non-timberforest products in that section of the forest. This can imposeimmediate costs on poor households who depend on fuelwoodand other subsistence products gleaned from the forest(Shyamsundar et al. 2004:10, 95). Making Decentralization Work for the Poor Decentralization can be structured in ways that make it moreeffective and beneficial for the poor. Ensuring Democratic Accountability The best way to ensure that decision-makers are accountableto local people and decision-making reflects the interests oflocal people is to vest powers in elected authorities who arechosen through competitive local elections (Crook andSverrisson 2001:50). While it is often difficult to rein in thepolitical forces that stifle open elections, the benefits can besubstantial. For example, competitive local elections in WestBengal, India helped make policy more responsive to the poor, and in Colombia, competitively elected mayors\u2014challengers to the dominant party politics\u2014brought aboutbetter education, roads, and water supply (Crook andSverrisson 2001:15-16, 42). Special Measures Promoting the Interests of the Poor A central government can increase the chances of pro-poordecentralization by making an explicit commitment to promotethe interests of the poor at the local level and to ensure thatmarginal groups get a voice in public decisions (Ribot 2004:41).Elected local governments tend to have a poor record ofserving the interests of women, the poor, and other marginal-CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE 0 1 02 03 05 3.2 LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES OCCUPIED BY WOMEN Source: United Cities and Local Governments 2005jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 6970WORLD RESOURCES 2005 0 -30 (Less Voice) 30 -50 50 - 70 70 -100 (More Voice) No DataFIGURE 3.3: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, 2004 The voice and accountability scores assigned here are based on indicators of political and civil liberties extended to a countr y's citizens, as well as the independ- ence of the media, which plays an important role in monitoring governance performance. These scores reflect the extent to which citizens are able to participate in the political and decision-making processes, give voice to their concerns, and hold their government representatives account able. Source: Kaufmann et al. 2005 ized populations unless required to do so by the central govern- ment (Crook and Sverrisson 2001 in Ribot and Larson 2004: 6).Special measures are needed to ensure that decentralizationbenefits the poorest people and most vulnerable groups\u2014women, indigenous people, the landless, migrants, and minoritycastes. In 1978, for example, the government of West Bengalspecifically sought to increase the power of poor and landlesspeasants by devolving implementation of government programsto the village councils, and mobilizing poor peasants to partici-pate. As a result, 44 percent of those on village councils inBirbhum District are now small farm owners, sharecroppers, oragricultural laborers, and the benefits of government develop-ment programs are increasingly going to the poorer members ofthe community (Crook and Sverrisson 2001:15-16). KeralaState's approach in 1996 was to give 35-40 percent of the statebudget to local governance bodies for development planning,with detailed guidelines to make planning processes both partic-ipatory and equitable (Mukhopadhyay 2003:56). Compensating the Poor for Short-Term Costs Local institutions can find ways to compensate the poor for anyrights they lose when a new management scheme restricts theiraccess to a forest or other resource. For example, the commu-nity of San Antonio, Mexico, asked residents to forego cuttingpine trees for use as roofing shingles so that they could beharvested as lumber. In return, the local logging businesssupplied free tin roofing materials and lumber to residents(Shyamsundar et al. 2004:96).Community-Based Natural Resource Management One specific approach to pro-poor decentralization of environ-mental resources is community-based natural resourcemanagement (CBNRM). Central governments in many parts ofthe developing world have begun to shift toward CBNRM inrecognition of the limitations of centralized management and inresponse to the legitimate claims of indigenous groups and localcommunities to a share in the benefits of local resources.Worldwide, some 380 million hectares of forest land are nowowned by or reserved for local communities\u2014over half havingbeen legally transferred to local control within the last 15 years(White and Martin 2002:11). This transformation in forestownership and management began in Latin America in the late1970s, moved through Africa in the late 1990s, and spread morerecently to Asia. (See Box 3.2.) The Rights to Information, Participation, and Justice: The Importance of a Voice The democratic rights of the poor and their capacity to partici- pate in environmental decisions affecting their livelihoods arecentral to their ability to escape poverty . Yet despite their greaterreliance on natural resources to earn their livelihoods, the poorhave less say than their richer counterparts in how environmen-tal decisions are made. In much of the developing world the policies, practices, and institutions of political life serve to exclude a majority of citizensjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 7071from full participation in public decision-making\u2014especially the poor and socially marginalized. This is true even in many nationsthat are nominally democratic. Democratic governance is morethan merely casting a ballot in periodic elections. It meanshaving opportunities beyond the ballot box to make one's voiceheard, including participation in public hearings, review ofofficial documents, and involvement in official processes, such asthe preparation of environmental impact assessments. Fulldemocratic engagement also means having opportunities not justto consult on projects already slated for implementation but alsoto play a role in shaping the design of public policies, in agenda-setting and establishing priorities for public policy , and inmonitoring ongoing projects to ensure that they produce thebenefits originally anticipated. (See Figure 3.3.) These principles of democratic empowerment in the arena of environmental decisions were articulated over a decade ago atthe 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Principle 10 of theRio Declaration, adopted by 178 nations at the close of theEarth Summit, put forth a ground-breaking proposition: thatevery person should have access to information about theenvironment, opportunities to participate in decision-makingprocesses affecting the environment, and access to redress andremedy\u2014that is, access to justice\u2014to protect their rights toinformation and participation and to challenge decisions that donot take their interests into account. These three rights\u2014therights to information, participation, and redress\u2014are oftenreferred to as the Access Principles. (See Box 3.3.) In 2002, during the World Summit on Sustainable Development, governments reaffirmed their commitment toPrinciple 10 and the Access Principles. At the same time, acoalition of governments, civil society organizations, and inter-national institutions formed the Partnership for Principle 10 tohelp implement these principles at the national and local levels.Unfortunately , the record of most nations in conferring thesebasic rights is still far from perfect. A 2001 assessment of ninenations\u2014both rich and poor\u2014found a variety of systemicweaknesses. For example, many nations have improved their laws granting public access to government data and analysis,but implementation of these laws is weak. Information onwater or air quality that average citizens can understand anduse is often hard to find, and documents about the environmen-tal effects of development projects are frequently not madeavailable in a timely manner (Petkova et al. 2002:1-8). Even if information is made available, the public's ability to participate in resource-related decisions such as timberharvesting or the siting of mines is still limited. Although theprocess of preparing and publicly airing environmental impactassessments has greatly increased in the last two decades, thepublic's involvement still tends to be in the later stages, aftermany major decisions have already been made. And evenwhen public comment is invited, many people do not have thecapacity or time to take advantage of the opportunity .Performance on the Access Principles is weakest when it comesto access of ordinary citizens to redress. The ability of localpeople to appeal decisions they don't agree with is oftenconstrained by obstacles of cost, lack of clarity about proce-dures for appeal, and also the lack of \"standing\" as a legallyrecognized party with a legitimate interest in the case (WRI etal. 2003:48-61). These access deficits are not restricted to the poor, but the poor tend to suffer them more acutely . Indeed, most of theworld's poor are excluded from interacting fully within the polit-ical processes of their country\u2014and environmental decisions aredecidedly political in many cases. They are held back by lack ofeducation and literacy , by deficits of information and awareness,and by a lack of understanding of their rights and how toexercise them. Even where the poor are aware of their rights,other barriers may prevent them from becoming involved.People who are barely managing to eke out a subsistence liveli-hood often cannot afford the luxury of devoting time andresources to participation or even information-gathering. Andthey may be even less able to pursue a legal challenge todecisions with which they disagree, given the expense and timeburden. (See Figure 3.4.)CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLE 10 OF THE RIO DECLARATION \"Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, eachindividual shall have appropriate access to information concerning theenvironment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and theopportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shallfacilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by makinginformation widely available. Effective access to judicial and administra-tive proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.\" Adopted by 178 nations at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, June 1992MEASURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION, PARTICIPATION, AND JUSTICE How well are governments upholding the commitments they made at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to strengthen public participation in environmen-tal decision-making? Are they making sufficient effort to include the poor?Answering these questions requires assessing a nation's governanceperformance so that it can be tracked over time and compared with goodpractices in other nations. Since 2000, The Access Initiative (TAI), a global coalition of civil-society groups, has worked to insure this basic level ofgovernment accountability. Using a shared methodology, TAI coalitionmembers conduct national-level assessments of laws and practicesregarding public access to information, participation, and justice.

Continues on page 73jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 7172COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT offers local people the chance to participate directly in decisionsabout local ecosystems and to benefit economically from theirefforts. But in the real world, poor communities often do not initi-ate the large-scale resource development projects\u2014such asmines, oil and gas development, or major forest concessions\u2014thataccount for most natural resource wealth. More often, they arebystanders or second-class participants in these negotiations,inheriting the ecosystem costs of these projects with little gain. The practice of \"free, prior, and informed consent\"\u2014or FPIC\u2014is designed as an antidote to this state of affairs. FPIC consists ofgiving local people a formal role\u2014and some form of veto power\u2014inthe consultations and ultimate decisions about local developmentprojects. It is intended to secure the rights of indigenous peoplesand local communities: their rights to self-determination, to controlaccess to their land and natural resources, and to share in thebenefits when these are utilized by others. Many experts believethat without such informed consent on large projects, a commu-nity's land and resource rights are compromised. In fact, without the kind of substantive participation that FPIC mandates, the tenure security of rural communities is always atthe mercy of decisions made by others. It is well documentedthat such insecurity perpetuates poverty. In contrast, with thebargaining power that FPIC provisions bring them, communitiescan demand direct compensation for damages or a continuingshare of the profits of resource extraction. They can even requirethe backers of development to invest part of the profits fromthese ventures to meet community needs. In this respect, FPICis a tool for greater equity and a natural pathway to a co-manage-ment role for local communities in large development projects(Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 2005). FPIC is relevant when governments make regulatory decisions\u2014 for example, allowing logging in forests traditionally occupied byindigenous peoples, or displacing riverside communities in order toconstruct a large hydropower dam. It can also be incorporated intoinfrastructure planning\u2014from the building of roads that traversethrough ancestral domains, to tourism development decisions suchas providing access to sites considered sacred by tribal peoples. Itis equally important in making decisions about bioprospecting forgenetic resources as it is for making choices about locating majorenergy projects, from power plants to pipelines. To date, however,FPIC has been most relevant and critical in cases involving miningprojects in countries as diverse as Australia, Canada, Peru, and thePhilippines (Bass et. al. 2003:vii; Tebtebba 2002:7). The potential poverty impact of FPIC in decisions on extractive industries such as oil, gas, and mining is particularly relevantand contentious. In order for communities to reap greaterbenefits from such development, their rights to sustainable livelihoods must be protected. Rules enforcing these rights willnot only promote \"cleaner\" extraction, but also empower localcommunities to take the risks and share the benefits of futuredevelopment. Without FPIC, these projects may further theeconomic marginalization of peoples and communities that arealready poor and vulnerable. These projects often require involuntary resettlement and all the negative economic consequences such dislocation brings. AnFPIC requirement would enable affected people to negotiate morefavorable relocation terms, including legally binding provisions oncompensation, support for new housing, and the necessary infra-structure not only for shelter, but for livelihoods and education aswell. Requiring FPIC could even allow these people and commu-nities to negotiate fair, equitable, and enforceable terms ofrevenue- and other benefit- sharing. The inclusion of FPIC as alegal condition for financing, investment, or regulatory decisionscould become a critical means to make poverty alleviationprograms more sustainable (Goodland 2004; Kamijyo 2004). To date, countries like the Philippines (Congress of the Philippines 1997) and Australia (Commonwealth of Australia 1976: Sections66-78) have enacted laws requiring that FPIC be obtained by thegovernment for projects within the ancestral domains of indige-nous peoples. Internationally, the World Commission on Dams(WCD 2000:xxxiv-xxxv,98-112) and the Extractive IndustriesReview Summary: 2-3,Volume 2:29-33, 47-50; MacKay 2004) of the World Bank haverecommended the adoption of FPIC in making decisions aboutdams and oil, gas, and mining projects. In addition, FPIC as aprinciple has been acknowledged in the Convention on BiologicalDiversity, with regard to access to and benefit-sharing of geneticresources (Perrault 2004: 22; Casas 2004:2728). Putting the principles of free, prior, informed consent into practice remains a challenge. Important questions remain: How can we define \"free\" in practice? How far ahead does \"prior\"mean? What are the formal terms of \"informed consent\"? What is the role of customary law in FPIC? And what is the roleof official processes, such as public hearings or referenda? In a diverse community, how is consent given and who gives theconsent? Is a majority enough or is full consensus required? Is awritten, legally binding agreement necessary? How is FPIC verified? Does the government verify it or is oversightby an independent party necessary? In implementing FPIC, how do we ensure a balance between thestate, the general public interest, and affected community inter-ests, particularly in the distribution of benefits? /orn8flipBOX 3.3 EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES THROUGH FREE, PRIOR, AND INFORMED CONSENTjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 7273CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE The sections below detail some of the ways in which the poor are particularly affected by deficits in their rights to information,participation, and justice. Also discussed are some of the success-ful steps that have been taken to address these shortcomings. Access to Information Information for Livelihood ChoicesThe rural poor face a keen need for information directly relevantto their livelihoods\u2014information such as market prices fortheir crops, alternative cropping or pest control options, theavailability of government assistance or training programs,or opportunities for developing new products or markets forenvironmental goods, from local crafts to ecotourism.Agriculture-related information is often one of the mostimmediate needs, since small-scale agriculture is so importantto household incomes in rural areas. Information on currentcrop prices, fertilizer and pesticide costs, and the availability ofimproved seeds and low-cost improvements in farm technologycan help guide the purchases of farm inputs and equipment, or help farmers successfully obtain credit. Without information of this type, poor families find it harder to take advantage of new opportunities for generatingincome and increasing their assets. Numerous organizations,from multilateral agencies to local NGOs, are trying to improveaccess to livelihood-related information. One such effort is thefarmer field schools developed by the UN Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) as part of an Integrated Pest Managementproject in Indonesia. Using a participatory learning approachaimed at incorporating local knowledge and experience, thesefarmer field schools are yielding lessons that are being applied to information activities on sustainable livelihoods in other sectors,such as community forestry (Chapman et al. 2003:5). Information for Public Accountability Access to information on laws, mandated government services, and government expenses is fundamental for poorpeople to hold governments accountable for their performance.Unless citizens can find out what governments are doing andhow they spend their funds, governments have little incentive toimprove performance, deliver on their promises, or even providebasic services at adequate levels. In Bangalore, India, citizen groups conducted surveys of municipal government performance and used the information tocreate \"report cards\" on the quality and efficiency of servicessuch as water, transport, electricity , and police, and to press forreforms. In Rajasthan, India, citizen efforts to gain access toinformation on government spending and employment rolls ledto exposure of local corruption, initiation of corrective action,and prompted consideration of a national right-to-informationlaw. In Argentina, citizens can access a website\u2014audited by acoalition of 15 NGOs\u2014to find easily understandable informa-tion on public expenditures across a variety of governmentprograms (Narayan 2002:32). In Francophone Africa, cooperatively produced radio programming provides listeners of 48 rural radio stations in 10countries with access to information on laws, legal systems, andjustice. Developed during a workshop on law in Senegal, aninitial radio program featured lawyers from six West Africancountries and provided information on land rights, women's 0102030 Most Effective Least EffectivePoll: Name the Most Effective and Least Effective Institutions in your Community CBOs ReligiousNGOs Health Education PoliceMunicipality MinistriesPercent Naming Each InstitutionFIGURE 3.4 THE POOR'S PERCEPTION OF RURAL INSTITUTIONS In discussion groups held worldwide, poor people were asked to name the five institu-tions they considered most and leasteffective.

Following enthusias- tic listener response, the producers developed a series ofsubsequent broadcasts on related legal issues, such as divorce,inheritance, access to justice, and conflict resolution (Chapmanet al. 2003:22). Language Barriers to Information Access In many developing countries, language is the most importantvehicle for excluding the poor and socially marginalized groupsfrom access to information (Sibanda 2000:9-10). For the maturedemocracies of Europe, Asia, North America, and Oceania, thelanguage of government is an indigenous language or alanguage in which the vast majority of ordinary citizens arefluent. H owever, across the developing world, a significant proportion of the population typically does not use or under-stand the language of government, which often is a Europeanlanguage\u2014French, English, or Spanish\u2014imposed during the colonial era. It is expensive to produce multiple versions ofofficial documents in indigenous as well as colonial languages,and the process of designating which indigenous languages areto be used in official documents can aggravate existing ethnicrivalries. But the alternative is continued high costs in socialexclusion and political instability . (See Figure 3.5.) Choice of Information TechnologiesWhether the rural poor have adequate access to information forenvironmental decision-making is not only a function of thequality and quantity of information supplied. It also depends onwhether the delivery technologies are appropriate for the targetaudience. Different groups may have different information needsand preferences for information delivery , and efforts to increasethe poor's information access are most effective when theyinvolve these groups in decisions about the information technolo-gies to be used. For instance, in most developing countries radioand television remain much more widely accessible than theInternet. Technologies such as the wind-up radio make informa-tion dissemination possible in communities without electricity oraccess to batteries (Chapman et al. 2003:19-20). Nonetheless, experience with pilot efforts indicates that it is possible to reach large numbers of people in developingcountries with electronic sources of information. In thePhilippines, a pilot project in the barangays (townships) on the island of Mindanao is using modern communications technolo-gies to improve local access to information on topics such asagriculture, rural enterprise development, education, and health.The project features multipurpose community telecenters withtelephone and Internet access (Chapman et al. 2003:17-18). Thechallenge remains to apply these pilot approaches more widely inAfrica, Asia, and Latin America as well. Equitable Access to Information Despite new technological capacity for broad-based informationdissemination, evidence suggests that if access to information isnot universal, growing supplies of information may simply serveEnglish 33% Chinese 13%Other 8% Top 10 Languages, by Millions of SpeakersInternet Users, by Language SpokenInternet Content, by Language 1,213 EnglishBengaliFIGURE 3.5 ENGLISH DOMINATES THE INTERNET Despite the growing diversity of internet users, the majority of content on the Internet remains in English. Source: Global Reach 2005; Internet World 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 7475to exacerbate existing social, economic, and political inequalities. Historically , information on agriculture-based livelihoods indeveloping countries was viewed as a global public good thatshould be made available at no charge to all interested parties.More recently , donor agencies have emphasized private-sectorprovision of agricultural extension information, which caninvolve cost recovery and user fees that the poorest farmerscannot afford to pay (Chapman et al. 2003:vii). Involving thepoor in decisions about who should pay for information servicesand how the sustainability of information services can be ensuredis vital to ensuring the poor have access to such information. Demand-Driven, Location-Specific Information Rural producers in developing countries value locally generated,locally specific information much more than general informa-tion. Because farmers and fishers are unlikely to adopt newpractices without substantial discussion of local examples,improved access to information is most effective when the infor-mation is focused on local conditions and local processing andmarketing systems. Modern communications technologies suchas the Internet and teleconferencing can enable rural farmersand fishers to discuss specific local problems with technicalspecialists based outside their area. In India, the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation is using innovative information technologies in community-managed \"e-villages\" to respond to the information needs oflocal groups. For example, weather forecasts and information onwave height are being routed to fishers in the village ofVeerampattinam. Such initiatives can also stimulate two-wayinformation flow between villages and researchers, so thatfarmers and fishers can contribute their specialized knowledge toenrich national and international information systems(Chapman et al. 2003:19). Inclusion of Women and Socially Marginalized GroupsIn Swaminathan's e-villages, information centers are runmainly by semi-literate women and by students, with the aim of empowering them through their roles as informationmanagers. By specifically targeting women and marginalizedgroups in knowledge management, initiatives to enhance thepoor's access to information can also promote social equity(Chapman et al. 2003:19). Access to Participation Decision-Making About Livelihood Choices Direct involvement in institutional processes that affect theirlivelihoods, such as determining the course of agriculturalresearch, is crucial for poor farmers. Often, there is no route fortheir input, but that does not have to be so. The West AfricanRice Development Agency uses participatory methods to involvefarmers in selecting which new rice varieties should be devel-oped, thus giving poor farmers an opportunity to shareinformation on their preferences and needs with rice breeders (Chapman et al. 2003:20). Participation in Broader Policy Processes In many poor countries, poor people have participated inbroader development initiatives dealing with poverty andpoverty reduction. Citizen participation has been part of theprocess of crafting national poverty-reduction strategies inseveral countries, such as Bolivia, Kenya, and Uganda. The poorhave also participated in creating citywide strategies for povertyreduction in approximately 80 cities around the world, includingCali, Colombia; Johannesburg, South Africa; Kampala,Uganda; and Haiphong, Vietnam (Narayan 2002:46, 70). Citizen involvement is a central element in so-called \"participatory poverty assessments\"\u2014an important tool toinform national policies and budgets. In several countries, partic-ipatory approaches to poverty assessments provided insights thathad not been obvious from official survey data. In Uganda, forexample, citizen participation led to increased investment inwater supply and more flexible budget allocations allowingdistricts to respond to local needs. In Vietnam, people's partici-pation led to the targeting of urban as well as rural poverty , stepsto address the ethnic and gender dimensions of poverty , and thepiloting of \"citizen report cards\" on the delivery of basic services(Narayan 2002:38). Participation in Planning and Budgeting Pioneered by the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, participatorybudgeting processes enable the poor to have more say in howgovernment resources are distributed. In participatory budget-ing, citizen meetings generate information about people'spriorities for government budget allocations, which are thenaggregated into neighborhood-level priorities. In Brazil, morethan $260 million was allocated between 1996 and 1998 toprojects selected by participants in citizen meetings, the vastmajority of which addressed needs in poorer, underserveddistricts. As of 2003, some 180 municipalities in Brazil wereengaged in some form of participatory budgeting processes(Serageldin et al. 2003:8-9). Inclusion of Women and Marginalized Groups In many countries, remedying deep, long-standing socialinequality necessarily entails enacting laws requiring the inclu-sion of previously excluded groups. One example of such aninitiative comes from Bolivia, where the Law on PopularParticipation provides for the participation of indigenouspeople's organizations in municipal decision-making. Under thislaw, which is meant to improve local governance and aidpoverty-reduction efforts, \"community vigilance committees\"are empowered to investigate municipal decisions. These citizencommittees even have the power to halt the distribution ofcentral government funds to local governments if they deter-mine that planning and expenditures are not in line withcommunity demands (Narayan 2002:42-43). In India, it took aCHAPTER 3 ROLE OF GOVERNANCEjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 7576WORLD RESOURCES 2005 constitutional amendment mandating that women must make up at least a third of the councilors in panchayats (village-level councils) to create real opportunities for women's voices to beheard in municipal leadership. Access to Justice Research shows that the poor are less likely to access the legalsystem to secure or enforce their rights to use natural resources.A study of seven countries in Africa and Asia found that poorcommunities are often reluctant to pursue legal claims based ontheir environmental grievances. In general, economically disad-vantaged groups lacked familiarity with legal institutions as wellas the necessary financial resources to use legal remedies effec-tively (Boyle and Anderson 1996, cited in ESRC/GECP2001:18). Intimidation by local elites and government officialscan also make the poor and others of low social status hesitantto assert their right to live in an environment adequate for theirhealth and well-being. For the poor who lack formal, legallyrecognized tenure to their land and natural resources, the threatof retribution is especially chilling. Securing and Enforcing Property Rights Clearly defined property rights, and confidence that theserights can be efficiently defended against interlopers, arefundamental to governance systems built on the rule of law. Asmentioned earlier, appropriate property rights regimes are alsocentral to encouraging the poor to invest in their land or inresource management in ways that bring economic develop-ment and poverty r eduction. H owever, in many developing economies, corruption, excessive regulation, and complicatedproperty registration procedures significantly burden citizens,especially the poor. In Guayaquil, Ecuador, for example, it has been three decades since the passage of land reform laws, and most house-holds are aware of their property rights and the importance ofsecuring title to land. But the majority of these poor householdsare incapable of navigating the legal labyrinth\u2014including longdelays and high costs\u2014surrounding the land titling process. Intheory , the process costs about $350, or as much as three monthsof a typical worker's salary . In practice, the actual cost is closerto $750\u2014a prohibitive sum for most poor families (Moser2004:42-44). A similar situation exists in Peru, where land regis-tration processes to secure property rights requires land holdersto engage with 14 different agencies involved in conferring asingle title (Narayan 2002:54). In several countries, poor people's associations and cooperatives are working with local authorities and financialinstitutions to address the need for secure land tenure rightsand housing. In Mumbai, India, a slum-dwellers' organizationhas been able to acquire land, housing, and basic infrastructureservices for its members. In the Philippines, a scavengers'association whose members live on a 15-hectare municipaldump in Quezon City has helped mobilize member savings toacquire legal rights to land through land purchase. And inGuatemala, 50,000 squatters have formed cooperatives, acquired land through legal means, and are now repaying long-term loans ( Narayan 2002:66). Meanwhile, Ghana's land- registration law specifically provides for registration ofcustomary land rights, and pilot projects are now underway to build capacity among traditional-land administrators toimprove record-keeping and land registries (Bruce 2005). Procedural Injustice The poor typically are most affected by procedural injustices inthe legal and court systems. For instance, the poor are least ableto afford the costs imposed by long delays in court proceedings.Also, the poor are more likely to be disadvantaged by languagebarriers in the legal system, such as court documents orhearings in languages not widely spoken by the rural poor(Girishankar et al. 2002:289). Mechanisms for Alternative Dispute Resolution For poor people living in remote rural areas, the existence ofdecentralized local processes for resolving disputes may make thedifference in their ability to secure or enforce their rights.However, if such decentralized alternativ es are poorly executed, they can end up disadvantaging the poor by reinforcing thedominance of local elites and incorporating local norms thatdiscriminate against women, children, and other socially margin-alized groups PropertyFIGURE 3.6 BARRIERS BUSINESS Source: World Bank 2005 jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 7677Fair Permitting and Licensing A key element of access to economic justice for the poor is theability to obtain permits and licenses for small business enter-prises via processes that are transparent, fair, and efficient. Thestate of affairs in many developing countries departs considerablyfrom this norm. In Zimbabwe, for instance, red tape and expen-sive licensing fees constrain the ability of poor communities tolaunch small businesses based on wildlife tourism or otherproducts and services. Registration of a tourist company inZimbabwe takes more than a year and costs about US$14,000 toobtain needed certificates and guarantees (Narayan 2002:55). In Lima, Peru, registering a small garment workshop employing a single owner-operator takes on average 289 daysand costs in excess of US$1,200, or more than 30 times themonthly minimum wage. In Indonesia, the official license feesfor registering a small business are about US$400, but the actual costs often are typically triple that amount (Narayan2002:54-55). (See Figure 3.6.)Fortunately , some state and local governments are starting to make it easier for small entrepreneurs to secure their rights tooperate. In Bali, one municipality introduced \"one-stop shops\"for business licenses and permits. This has not only helpedbusinesses obtain licenses more efficiently but has alsoaugmented government tax revenues by 75 percent. In India thegovernment of the state of Gujarat removed the requirementthat gum collectors\u2014virtually all of them poor women\u2014mustsell gum at artificially low prices to a handful of government-selected buyers (Narayan 2002:56). As the numerous examples cited above show, progress in empowering the poor in their rights to information, participa-tion, and justice can be made. Such progress is central togiving the poor the political and business tools to take advan-tage of their nature-based assets and to participate in ruralcommerce that leads to sustainable economic progress\u2014theroute out of poverty . /orn8flip CHAPTER 3 THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCEjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 77Empowering the poor with resource rights can enable them to manage ecosystems better and significantly increase their environmental income. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 78THE WEALTH OF NATURE, IN THE FORM OF ENVIRONMENTAL income, is already a key component of rural livelihoods for both the rich and poor. But thereis great potential for this component to grow, given the right conditions, and contribute tohigher household incomes that lessen poverty . The first condition is an acceptance thatbetter management of ecosystems can increase their productivity\u2014immediately and overthe long term. And, since the wealth of nature flows directly from the productivity ofecosystems, better management brings the potential for greater environmental income. The second condition is that the access to and control of nature shifts so that the rural poor can both see the advantages of good ecosystem management and claim the benefitsfrom it, overcoming the obstacles of disenfranchisement that have kept them economicallyand politically marginalized. In this chapter we explore both these conditions\u2014prudent management of ecosystems and governance that empowers the poor to profit from it. We consider the questions: Whatdo we mean by better ecosystem management? What is its potential for poverty reduction?And what governance changes are required to route environmental income to the poor? CHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPSTO GREATERENVIRONMENTALINCOME jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 7980WORLD RESOURCES 2005 In addition, we examine the factors besides governance and eco-friendly practices that support the evolution of environmen-tal income for poverty reduction. These revolve around the needto find successful models to commercialize ecosystem goods andservices, coping with such constraints as marketing, transporta-tion, and the need to capture greater value from nature-basedenterprises than the poor often do. In addition, we consider thepotential for \"payment for environmental services\" (paymentsfor preserving the functions of ecosystems, such as water supplyor carbon storage) to contribute to the portfolio of income-generating enterprises based on nature that the poor can tap. In examining these factors, we put forth four steps to gener- ate greater environmental income for the rural poor. MORE INCOME THROUGH BETTER ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT Healthy ecosystems work at peak productivity; degraded ecosystems produce less, particularly of the forest products,forage, clean water, crops, and bushmeat on which the poortend to rely . In fact, degradation of ecosystem functions\u2014inthe form of nutrient-depleted soils, overgrazed pastureland,logged-over and fragmented forests, and overfished lakes andcoastal waters\u2014has become a serious impediment to the liveli- hoods of the poor. As the findings of the recently concluded Millennium Ecosystem Assessment show, ecosystem decline is widespread.The global drop in ecosystem health not only undermines thenatural resource base that anchors a substantial fraction of theglobal economy but erodes the planet's life-support systems moregenerally (MA 2005a:1-24). The most immediate victims of thisdecline are the poor, whose household economies, as shown inChapter 2, depend heavily on ecosystem goods and services. Thepressures on ecosystems are particularly intense on manycommon property lands and fisheries\u2014the most importantsource of environmental income for the rural poor. Examples aremany and distributed on every continent and sea: denuded hillsin western India; exhausted forests in Madagascar and Haiti;and depleted catches off Indonesia, Jamaica, or Fiji are just a fewof the many instances where overuse and abuse of ecosystemsdirectly impacts the poor. Better Management Requires an Ecosystem Approach But ecosystem decline is not inevitable. Ecosystems are resilient and can be sustained through practices that accommodate their1 jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 8081inherent biological limits, recognizing that ecosystems are not simple production factories but living systems built on complexrelationships among species and physical factors such as water,temperature, and nutrient availability . Practices that respectand preserve how ecosystems function are the building blocksof what in the past five years has come to be known as an ecosystem approach to natural resource management\u2014that is, management that centers itself around the sustainable andequitable use of ecosystems. In this chapter, when we refer to\"better ecosystem management,\" we mean adopting an ecosys-tem approach. (See Figure 4.1.) In practice, \"better ecosystem management\" often trans- lates to fairly simple principles, particularly in the context of theecosystems that the poor use most frequently . For example, itmay mean more moderate harvest levels of forest products,forage, or other vegetation, so that the ecosystem can retain itsmacrostructure, and so that watersheds maintain their ability toabsorb rainwater and retain it as soil moisture. It may involveadopting different treatment of livestock, cultivation methodsthat reduce erosion, or cropping patterns that minimize deple-tion of soil nutrients. Where ecosystems have already degradedsubstantially , it may require a period of non-use and restoration,such as a closed fishing season or a logging or grazing ban. Or itmay demand direct revegetation through tree-planting. In allcases, the effectiveness of such measures will be greater whenthey are actively supported by community members who seethemselves as benefiting on a fair and equal basis in the short andmedium terms. In this sense, an ecosystem approach is as muchpeople-centered as it is ecosystem-focused. Income Benefits of Better Management When rural farmers, forest users, and fishers adopt more sustain-able practices, considerable income benefits can follow. A recentstudy of four low-income farming villages in arid western Indiaillustrates the potential for higher agricultural income. All fourvillages had participated in government-supported projects from1995 to 2001 to better manage their degraded watersheds\u2014partof a nationwide program known as Watershed Development.They used a variety of water and soil conservation techniques,such as check dams and contour tilling, as well as tree planting torevegetate denuded slopes. The idea was to capture theoccasional but intense monsoon rains, preserving them as soilmoisture, rather than letting them run off and erode the soil(Reddy et al. 2004:303-306). The success of these measures from an ecosystem stand- point showed clearly in the recovery of groundwater levels, withthe water table in local wells rising an average of 25 percent inspite of several years of scant rainfall. From this increase in soilmoisture flowed other benefits. The amount of land underirrigation increased. Grass forage increased as well in mostvillages, including forage on common property areas, which,prior to the watershed treatments, had been too degraded toproduce useable fodder. Crop yields rose significantly , both onCHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME Value of Intact vs. Converte d Ecosystems 050010001500 Intact mangroves Shrimp farmin gTraditional forest use Unsustainable timber harvest Mangrove Ecosystem, ThailandTropical Forest, CambodiaNet Present Value ( dollar per hectare)FIGURE 4.1 MAINTAINING THE VALUE OF NATURE Source: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005bValue of Intact vs.Converted Ecosystems FOUR STEPS TO GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME FOR THE RURAL POOR 1. Manage Ecosystems Better for Higher Productivity Improve the stewardship of ecosystems by adopting an ecosystemapproach to management\u2014recognizing the complexity of ecosystemsand living within their limits. Good stewardship brings higher produc-tivity, which is the foundation of a sustainable income stream. 2. Get the Governance Right to Insure Access to Environmental Income Confer legally recognized resource rights (such as individual or commu-nal title, or binding co-management agreements). Where possible,decentralize ecosystem management to the local level (community-basednatural resource management), while providing for regional or nationalcoordination of local management plans. Empower the poor throughaccess to information, participation, and justice. Create local institutionsthat represent their interests and accommodate their special needs. 3. Commercialize Ecosystem Goods and Services to Turn Resource Rights and Good Stewardship Into IncomeImprove the marketing and transport of nature-based goods produced bythe poor. Make credit available for ecosystem-based enterprises. Capturegreater value from the commodity chain. Partner with the private sector.Take care to keep successful commercial activities sustainable. 4. Tap New Sources of Environmental Income Such as \"Payments for Environmental Services\"Make the newly developing market of payments for environmentalservices more pro-poor by expanding the array of eligible activities andpayment schemes. Look upon ecosystem income as a portfolio of manydifferent income sources. Diversify this portfolio to reduce risk andenhance the bottom line. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 rice yields up 15-44 percent; peanut yields up 16-81 percent. Village land became morevaluable too, because it was in better condition and had moreagricultural potential (Reddy et al. 2004:308-312, 318). With higher productivity , household incomes grew. Income from all sources\u2014agriculture, livestock, and wageemployment\u2014increased from 50 to over 100 percent fromtheir levels before the watershed rehabilitation. Theseincreases, in turn, are reflected in higher spending on educa-tion and medical care. The benefits from adopting moresustainable watershed practices also extended beyond income.The availability of drinking water went up in all the surveyedvillages and the time spent fetching water decreased\u2014as muchas 80 percent in one village\u2014a major benefit for women (Reddy et al. 2004:310, 313, 321). (See Figure 4.2.) Likewise, indigenous communities in the Philippines' mountainous Kalinga province have revived traditional irriga-tion and forest-management techniques that protect localwatersheds. Using a combination of reforestation, agroforestryplantings, environment-friendly irrigation, and fish productionwithin active rice paddies, Kalinga families were able to greatlyincrease agricultural production and raise incomes. They haverepaired over 90 traditional irrigation systems to sustainablysupply their rice terraces, while on the watershed slopes individ-ual families maintain and protect their own agroforest plantings.Between 1990 and 1996, the combination of watershed protec-tion and good irrigation management raised annual incomes forover 1,000 poor families in seven indigenous communities by anaverage of 27 percent, all while maintaining over 80 percent ofthe original high-biodiversity forest cover (Southey 2004:1-2; UNHousing Rights Programme 2005:154). Similar stories of income gains can be told for communities that have improved their management of local forest ecosystems,fisheries, or grasslands. In the Himalayan village of Waiga, villagersbanned grazing and burning on the grasslands above the commu-nity in 1995, and planted 1500 alders. Over the next few yearsgrassland recovery raised fodder production sevenfold\u2014enough forall local livestock plus a surplus for sale\u2014while the returning treecover provided leaf litter for agriculture and stopped gully erosionin the steeply sloped terrain (Munsiari 2003:5, 15-19). In Fiji, over 100 coastal villages have designated local tabu zones in nearshore waters where fishing and shellfish collectionis banned to promote recovery of the marine life that forms acentral element in local livelihoods and culture. Robust recoveryin these local protected zones has spilled over into adjacentfishing areas, increasing the village marine harvest. In threevillages where economic evaluations have been conducted,income from marine resources\u2014typically half of all householdincome\u2014increased 35-43 percent from 1997, when the tabu zones were established, to 2003. (For details, see Chapter 5 case study, \"Village by Village: Recovering Fiji's Coastal Fisheries.\") In each of these instances, villagers have pursued more ecosystem-friendly practices because they visibly supported theirresource-based livelihoods, boosting both their direct use ofecosystem goods and their cash incomes. These examples andmany others clearly make the case that better ecosystemmanagement pays off at both a household and a village level. This is good news for rural economies in general. But how effective is this increase in environmental income at reducingvillage-level poverty? Unfortunately , evidence shows that thebenefits of ecosystem improvements are often skewed towardhigher income brackets. With more land, trees, cattle, or capitalto invest in the increased farming potential of their recoveredlands, the rich tend to capture more of the income bonus thathealthier ecosystems provide (Reddy et al. 2004:318). But poor families certainly do benefit also, for example by greater availability of wage employment, and greater ability toPRINCIPLES OF AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH The goal of an ecosystem approach to natural resource management is to foster the sustainable use of ecosystems and the equitable distribu-tion of their benefits. An ecosystem approach is successful if it preservesor increases the capacity of an ecosystem to produce the desired benefitsin the future, and increases the capacity of society to fairly apportionbenefits and costs. Manage Within Natural Limits Recognize the complex functioning of ecosystems and respect theirbiological thresholds. Conserve ecosystem structure in order to maintainecosystem productivity. Manage for the Long Term Optimize ecosystem productivity\u2014and benefits\u2014over generations, notyears. With care, managing for long-term productivity can be compati-ble with significant short-term gains. Manage at Both the Micro and Macro Scales Respect ecosystem processes at the micro level, but see them in the largerframe of landscapes. Decentralize management to the local level whenpossible. But recognize that ecosystems are interconnected and interac-tive, and exist on many scales. Local management efforts must be linkedand harmonized at the larger scale so they do not work at cross-purposes. Account for the True Value of Ecosystems Include the full array of ecosystem goods and services when assigningeconomic value, not just the commodity value of extracted goods. Make Trade-Offs Clear Recognize that ecosystem management will involve trade-offs, since notevery good or service can be maximized at the same time. Make trade-offs transparent so that costs can be shared equitably. Involve All Stakeholders in Decisions Be inclusive when making major management decisions, involving allstakeholders to foster equity and inspire active participation in thestewardship of ecosystems. Integrate social information with economicand environmental information in the decision-making process.Acknowledge that human modification ecosystems is not stewardship.jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 822 83meet their subsistence needs for firewood, fish, and the like. This provides a maintenance level of ecosystem support and greaterincome resilience for hard times. But it may not provide enoughsupport to take a firm step out of poverty . For that, governancechanges that free up access to ecosystems and promote informa-tion and market support to the poor are needed. GETTING THE GOVERNANCE RIGHT: EMPOWERING THE POOR TO PROFIT FROM NATURE As described in Chapter 3, lack of access\u2014physical, political, and financial\u2014is a critical roadblock to the ability of the poor touse ecosystems for poverty reduction. Bringing pro-poor gover-nance to the management of ecosystems begins by removing thisroadblock through improvements in tenure security , devolutionof authority over nature to more local levels where the poorreside, and empowerment of the poor through information,participation, and the power of redress. The net effect of theseactions is to secure the resource rights of the poor and give themthe tools to exercise these rights responsibly and equitably . Securing Property and Resource Rights Through Tenure Reform Addressing the need for greater tenure security so that the poor can tap ecosystems and invest in their good stewardship is a toppriority . It requires reform of the formal tenure regimes thatcurrently make it hard for the poor to exercise property rightsover land and resources. Interest in tenure reform has grownsignificantly in recent years as acceptance of the central role oftenure security in poverty reduction has spread. When wellthought-out and appropriately implemented, tenure reform canproduce considerable benefits for the poor. The most importantis an acknowledgement by the state that traditional tenurearrangements, including communal tenure, are legitimate andlegally enforceable. Recognition of Traditional Rights Untitled, customary tenure remains the predominant form oftenure in many rural areas of the developing world. The persist-ence of untitled occupancy\u2014the situation of many poor familieswho live on land they do not hold formal title to\u2014is a commonchallenge for tenure-reform efforts. Experience shows that recog- FIGURE 4.2 EFFECTS OF WATERSHED RESTORATION ON WATER AVAILABILITY AND TIME SPENT FETCHING DRINKING WATER Mallapuram 10.5 11.9 13% S.

The deal shows the importance and difficulty of negotiat-ing land tenure amidst differing land uses and user groups. The setting is the Gran Chaco, an isolated, biodiverse region where the pre-Hispanic Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1o people have sustainably farmedand hunted the parched, inhospitable land for centuries. In recentdecades large-scale cattle ranching and commercial soybean,sunflower, and cotton farming have encroached upon traditionalindigenous territory, damaging the land through deforestation andsoil degradation. Lacking tenure rights over the public lands theylived on and utilized, the Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1o were unable to preventthese incursions. Negotiations in the 1990s between Bolivia's government and the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Izozog (CABI), a grassroots indigenousorganization representing the Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1o, resulted in twolandmark agreements. The first preserved 3.4 million hectares ofuninhabited Gran Chaco forest and scrub as a national park,designated in 1995. The second will grant the Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1otitle to 1.5 million hectares of land adjacent to the park as acommunally owned indigenous territory. For the Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1o, the outcome was a pragmatic compro- mise. On the one hand, they relinquished any ownership claim tothe land encompassed by the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco NationalPark (KINP), now area dry tropicalforest (Winer 2003:181). On the other, the 10,000-strongcommunity, which lives in 23 villages scattered along the ParapetRiver, will own the sole right to exploit the land and forests of theirtitled territory\u2014a major step towards safeguarding their livelihoodsand future survival (CABI 2004:1-2). The Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1o also negotiated a major influence over the park. The KINP is now the only national park in the Americas co-administered by an indigenous organization and a nationalgovernment. Moreover, the group won the right to pursue sustain-able activities, such as ecotourism and fishing, in some parkareas, while closing the entire area to new settlers (CABI 2004:1). CABI's successful land rights campaign was pursued in partner- ship with the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society(WCS), which was anxious to protect the Gran Chaco's abundantand often rare wildlife, WCS expertise, CABI submitted a successful proposalfor a co-managed national park in 1995. To ensure communitybuy-in, the park proposal was reviewed in community meetings. Toallay livelihood concerns, the border was determined in such a way as to minimize conflict\u2014excluding from the park areas utilized bycommunities or occupied by third parties (Noss 2005). In 1997, CABI presented a demand for a Tierra Comunitaria de Or\u00edgen (TCO)\u2014designated indigenous territory\u2014under Bolivia'snew agrarian reform law. The government approved the request,while retaining ownership rights to underground minerals andawarding water rights to the local municipal government. By April2005, 300,000 hectares of land had been titled. When theprocess is complete, 1.5 million hectares of formerly public landwill be owned by CABI, as the indigenous people's legal represen-tative, with the remainder of the 1.9 million hectares in private,nonindigenous ownership (Noss 2005). While the new land rights afforded the Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1o are clearly conditional, they offer significant potential to boost food and liveli-hood security. A revitalization of traditional production systems isalready underway, with women villagers experimenting with theproduction of mesquite flour and fish meal for sale in the Isosocommunities. Plant-based shampoo and honey are also beingcommercially developed for sale in Santa Cruz, the regionalcapital. These activities are managed by CABI's women's organi-zation, CIMCI, whose goals are to empower women, promotetraditional culture, improve food availability and nutrition and,ultimately, boost indigenous incomes (Winer 2001:13). CABI hasalso sought peccary and tegu lizard skins (Noss 2005). According to a recent report on the land deals by an the independ- ent consultant, the TCO, by increasing livelihood security, willenable the Guaran\u00ed-Izoce\u00f1o to \"retain their identity as an indige-nous tribe of lowland Bolivia while building stronger, and moreequitable, economic links with the expanding market-driveneconomy of Santa Cruz\" (Winer 2001:12). The conditional nature of the tribe's land rights, however, is underlined by the presence of the 1,900-mile Bolivia-Brazilpipeline, which bisects both the Kaa-Iya National Park and theTCO. The pipeline was approved before either the park orindigenous territory were created, and the government retainsrights to energy resources in the area (Roach 2004:12). As aconsequence, Bolivia's government has granted further gas andoil exploration concessions in both the KINP and the indige-nous territory, although energy companies would be required towork with CABI to mitigate their social and environmentalimpacts. A trust fund contributed by the existing pipelinecompanies, following an agreement with indigenous organiza-tions, including CABI, made up 43 percent of the park's budgetbetween 1998 and 2003 (Noss 2005). /orn8flipBOX 4.1 NEGOTIATING INDIGENOUS TENURE RIGHTS IN BOLIVIAjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 8485nizing and integrating such customary tenure into formal state tenure regimes is a key feature of successful reform. This mayrequire greater flexibility about what is considered legitimate proofof \"ownership\" so that oral as well as written records of occupa-tion or access to communal lands are accepted. (See Table 4.1.) In Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda, new tenure laws simply recognize land held under customary tenure as fullylegally tenured \"as is.\" This includes using certification processesbased on verbal endorsements (Mozambique), as well as usingcommunity-administered land recording and titling processes(Tanzania). In Eritrea, customary tenure has been recognized inthe form of lifetime-use agreements, although they cannot be passed down to family members (Alden Wily and Mbaya2001:15-18). Other countries are slowly bridging between communal tenure and more individualized land rights. (See Box 4.1.) The key is that new individualized rights must be compatiblewith customary practices, so that they do not create or perpet-uate a parallel tenure system that can give rise to conflictingclaims later on. Simple and unambiguous procedures forrecording land sales and transfers can also help avoid tenuredisputes as customary systems interface with modern landmarkets and land uses (Deininger 2003:52-54). Traditional rights to resources also extend beyond land rights per se into water rights, the use of fisheries, and pastoralrights. These too can be made more secure through formalrecognition and delineation by the state. For example, thegovernment of Fiji formally recognizes \"customary fishingrights areas\" where villagers have traditionally fished andcollected shellfish. These nearshore zones, known locally as qoliqolis, have been surveyed and accurately mapped, with the records maintained by the nation's Native FisheriesCommission. Based on these designations, the state FisheriesDepartment has begun granting local communities the right todraw up their own management plans for qoliqolis with the aim of restoring these fisheries as a community asset. It is important to recognize that increasing security of tenure for the poor does not always require gaining full title orprivate ownership of land or resources (Deininger 2003:39). Inthe case of common-property resources like state forests orfisheries, increased tenure security often takes the form of thelegally sanctioned use of these resources, including the right toexclude others and manage the resource for optimum benefit. Asin the Fiji example above, the key to increased security is that thephysical extent of the land or resource, the exact limits of theuse, the permissible forms of management, and the limits on thestate's ability to modify or terminate the arrangement are speci-fied and agreed to in a legally binding agreement. This kind ofunambiguous and enforceable use-right is often a central featureof successful community-based natural resource managementprojects meant to extend ecosystem access to the poor. Reduced Transaction Costs and Other Benefits High transaction costs\u2014the costs of doing business, both inmoney and time\u2014have traditionally been an important obsta-cle to the poor in acquiring or disposing of land. Effective legaland land information systems typically form the core ofsuccessful tenure reform, thereby lowering property transactionCHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME TABLE 4.1 RECENT LEGAL REFORMS STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY FOREST TENURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Country Year Enacted Key Features of Reform Bolivia 1996 Ancestral rights of community groups have precedence over forest concessions. Subsequent laws have strengthened community rights. Brazil 1988 Cons titution recognizes ancestral rights over land areas that indigenous groups and former slave communities traditionally occupied.

Colombia 1991 Constitution of 1991 recognizes and outlines a framework for collective territorial rights for indige- nous groups and Afro-Colombian traditional communities.

This can help the poor access and manage land andresources as more flexible assets. Other benefits can come from successful tenure reform as well. One is a decentralization of the bureaucracy that adminis-ters tenure and resolves resource and land disputes. When thegovernment machinery for administering tenure rights movescloser to the small rural landowner, it increases the landowner'saccess to land registration and taxing authorities, as well as legalproceedings involving land disputes. Decentralization of tenureadministration has been particularly dramatic in Tanzania andUganda, with community-based mechanisms for resolvingproperty rights-related disputes appearing in countries, aswell as Mozambique (Alden Wily and Mbaya 2001:14 -18, 46). Improved security of tenure has also, in many instances, fueled the development of more dynamic land markets inpoorer communities. In such cases, poorer households canbenefit through greater access to productive land if they havesufficient access to capital. Evidence from Mexico, forexample, indicates that policy reforms of the early 1990s thatopened up both land and credit markets enhanced access toland among poorer households with adequate access tocapital, but not poorer families in general (Carter 2003:52). Higher Rural Incomes Greater security of tenure, especially when coupled with accessto credit, can help poor farmers in developing countries investmore in their land, thereby improving agricultural productivityand raising farm income. In Thailand, evaluation of a 20-yearinitiative begun in 1987 to provide the country's rural popula-tions with access to modern land registration and creditinstitutions revealed that midway through the effort, ruralincomes, major investments, and use of formal credit is muchhigher among farmers with titled land than for those yet to beincluded in the program (Riddell2000:10). In China, experimentalland policy reforms granting clearownership rights to village-basedcooperatives for communal manage-ment of mountainous forest landsenabled villagers in Jiangsu and otherprovinces to create large, successfulorchards (Bruce et al. 1995). Ingeneral, successful tenure reformcreates both the perception of greatersecurity and the reality of moreenforceable rights\u2014both importantelements in the willingness and abilityof the poor to invest their time andresources in expanding their environ-mental income. (See Figure 4.3.)The Dangers of Ineffective Tenure Reform Reforming something as central to wealth creation as a nation'stenure system is by no means easy . Even though moderntenure-reform efforts rarely attempt major land redistribution,they are still politically perilous, with vested interests oftenreluctant to change the status quo. Unfortunately , whenchanges to tenure systems are incomplete or poorly executed,the poor can end up worse off rather than better. Therefore,in designing tenure reforms, policymakers must be careful toavoid the following: Failure to recognize important land uses and users.Poorly designed attempts to increase security of tenure forsome can end up reducing the security of others. Forexample, land titling and registration projects may overlookrights to important land uses, such as the right to gather non-timber forest products or to obtain water. These uses are mostoften exercised by women and the poor. If these rights arenot legally recognized as part of the land registration process,they may be effectively destroyed (FAO 2002a:20). Land grabs by urban elites. In some instances, city-based government and business elites have made dramaticattempts at land grabbing through the process of shiftingland out of customary tenure systems and into statutorytenure systems. This can take the form of government-granted concessions on indigenously held land over whichthe state claims ownership. Or it may simply be landpurchases by the elite from those who hold land undercustomary tenure arrangements. Some countries, such asCameroon, have initiated policies that appear to encourageland speculation, favoring privileged individuals with accessto knowledge, influence, and money (Elbow et al. 1998:5). 100 100 100 100 100181 172204217323433 100 0100200300400500 Thailand 1988Brazil 1996Thailand 1988Honduras 1996 Land Value Investment Cre ditPercentUntitle d Land Titled Land Thailand 1988Honduras 1996FIGURE 4.3 EFFECT OF LAND TITLING ON LAND AND CREDIT Source: Deininger 2003jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 8687Exclusion of women. Women make up the majority of the world's agricultural producers, but they are usually the last tobe included in land and tenure reform efforts. Traditionally ,women in Africa and other parts of the developing world haveonly had access to land tenure through their husbands, fathers,or other male relatives. Registration of land in the name ofmale relatives precludes women from obtaining property rightsat a time when women's access to land for cultivation is becom-ing increasingly important for AIDS widows and other femaleheads of households (Carter 2003:49). Inadequate procedures for documenting communalrights. The lack of appropriate procedures for expeditious, cost-effective documentation of untitled communal propertyrights can compromise the effectiveness of tenure reform.For instance, the government of Bolivia enacted legislationrecognizing indigenous land rights in 1996; because ofcomplicated and costly documentation procedures, h owever, by 1999 only 10 percent of eligible territories had receivedtitles (White and Martin 2002:16). Conditionality and other constraints to land markets.Many new tenure laws do nothing to remove constraints andlimitations that have long hampered land markets in develop-ing countries. For example, none of the recent spate of Africantenure legislation removes long-standing requirements tooccupy and use agricultural land in order to maintain tenure(Alden Wily and Mbaya 2001:14 ). Agricultural use may notalways be the best use of ecosystems, either economically or ecologically . For example, conversion to wildlife habitat may bea better use of some lands with high tourist potential, orconversion to other commercial purposes. Flexibility in landuse may increase the value of the land assets of the poor, whileconditions on use reduce the economic potential of the land. Poor-Friendly Decentralization: Community- Based Natural Resource Management Improving the tenure security of the poor and their ability to exercise property rights is only one step in the legal, economic,and political empowerment of poor families. A second impor-tant step is devolving management authority over ecosystems tolocal institutions that are more accessible to the poor. As detailed in Chapter 3, decentralization that actually works for the poor is more the exception than the rule. Itrequires, at a minimum, that local institutions\u2014whether they beofficial government institutions like village councils or informalinstitutions such as user groups, cooperatives, or watershedcommittees\u2014are formed on democratic principles of represen-tation, meaning that they are accountable to their low-incomeconstituents. But this alone is not usually enough to overcome thestructural bias against the poor in local institutions. Specialefforts to include the poor are generally required. These canrange from reserving gender-based or income-based slots in localinstitutions to insure participation; arranging for special outreachCHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 8788WORLD RESOURCES 2005 and training for members of these institutions; creating rules to insure equitable distribution of local benefits to low-incomehouseholds; and using participatory rural appraisals and othersurvey techniques to help local institutions catalogue andquantify community needs and the potential trade-offs for anyset of management actions. Of course, this is all predicated onthe assumption that the state has granted these local institutionssome actual authority over local resources\u2014something that isstill far from common. Pro-Poor Decentralization: An Example When these minimum requirements come together\u2014truedevolution of authority , local accountability , and an effort toacknowledge the special needs of the poor\u2014the outlines of localempowerment can begin to take shape. Uganda provides aninstructive example of democratic decentralization that is bothecosystem-friendly and serves the interests of the nation's low-income fishers. Until the late 1990s, management of fishing inLake Victoria, Lake Albert, and other inland lakes was theprovince entirely of the central government. A government pushfor decentralization and the creation of new fishery rules led tothe formation in 2003 of Beach Management Units (BMUs)\u2014local institutions charged with regulating fishing along specificstretches of the lake and shore. Each BMU is headed by acommittee with 9 to 15 democratically elected members from each of four different stakeholder groups: 30 percent boatowners, 30 percent fishing crew members, 10 percent fishmongers, and 30 percent other stakeholders. In this way wagelaborers, merchants, and other low-income families associatedwith local fishing can participate in the committee along withwealthier boat owners. To address gender disparities, BMUs areencouraged to have women make up 30 percent of the commit-tee \"whenever possible\" (Waldman et al. 2005:65-68). The duties of the BMUs cover the daily management of the local fishery: issuing fishing permits and limiting the size ofthe fishing fleet, registering fishing gear, and working with thegovernment Fisheries Department to enforce regulationsagainst illegal fishing practices. The BMUs also collect fishingdata to help guide their management decisions. The localcommittees are allowed to keep 25 percent of money generatedfrom licenses and landing fees to fund their operations(Waldman et al. 2005:65-68). Results of the decentralization have been encouraging so far. The BMUs report better control over illegal fishing andimproved working relations with central government authorities.The fishing statistics that BMUs have collected have broughtgreater local awareness to the need to reduce fishing pressureand fish more sustainably . On Lake PM Page 8889three non-fishing zones designed to protect known nursery areas and thus maintain the fish stock. The committees report volun-tary reductions in the use of illegal fishing gears, indicating achange in attitudes of the fishing community . It is too early to tellif these improvements in management have translated into moreincome for local fishers, but anecdotal reports of better dailycatches are starting to come in. Women are also beginning tochange their role. Local culture discourages women from joiningfishing crews, but some women have started fishing from theshore; a few women have even become boat owners, hiring mento crew their boats (Waldman et al. 2005:65-68). The Benefits of CBNRM Uganda's Beach Management Units are just one example of thebroad potential for community-based natural resource manage-ment (CBNRM)\u2014one of the most progressive and potentiallypoor-friendly manifestations of decentralization. This kind ofdevolution of management authority over state-owned resourceshas the potential to be both inclusive enough to involve the poorand effective enough to generate increases in environmentalincome. Well-functioning community management arrange-ments have shown benefits in all three of the key areashighlighted in this chapter: household income, local empower-ment, and ecosystem condition (Shyamsundar et al. 2004:7-13). Income Benefits Income benefits come from a variety of sources, including greateraccess to wage employment as well as to local subsistence goodslike bushmeat and forest products (Shyamsundar et al. 2004:9).For example, community forestry arrangements often give rise toforest-related enterprises that can provide substantial localemployment; revenue-sharing with the government from timbersales and the like; and greater control over sources of woodfueland other forest goods in daily use. The same is true of devolvingwildlife management to local communities. When the Namibiangovernment in the late 1990s transferred to rural communitiesthe authority to manage wildlife in certain demarked zones calledconservancies, it included the right to regulate the substantialtourist trade in these zones and the right to harvest a modicum ofbushmeat as well. Conservancy-related activities have createdsome 3800 jobs that did not exist before the decentralization tookplace; entrance fees and trophy-hunting fees have generatedpublic funds for schools and other public investments, and evenfor cash payouts to conservancy members. Local incomes haverisen substantially as a result. (See the Chapter 5 case study, \"Nature in Local Hands: The Case for Namibia's Conservancies.\") Local EmpowermentSome of the most significant benefits of community manage-ment are in the area of empowerment. Shifting substantialmanagement control over ecosystems to communities gives thema voice where often they had none. It often restores traditionalrights\u2014such as water use rights, forest collection rights, orfishing rights\u2014that may have been lost as modern states central-ized their authority . While these political and legal benefits are enormous, the shift in resource control also exerts a substantialpsychological effect on communities that may be even moreimportant, particularly for the poor. This manifests as a newsense of pride and control over one's life, as well as greater confi-dence in dealing with others outside the community and withgovernment authorities. This empowerment dividend is oftenaugmented as local community members gradually develop theaccounting, monitoring, planning, and dispute-resolution skillsthat good resource management demands (Shyamsundar et al.2004:11). The benefits of such new personal and group skillsspill over into domains well beyond resource management. Ecosystem Benefits There is also evidence that community-based resource manage-ment can create incentives that foster good ecosystemmanagement and contribute to conservation goals as well aseconomic development. Experiences in Africa, India, and Nepaldemonstrate that community forestry management can result inhealthier forests and improved tree cover (Shyamsundar et al.2004:13). A notable example is the HASHI program in theShinyanga district of Tanzania. With help from the centralgovernment, over 800 villages have revived a traditional conser-vation practice of creating \"enclosures\" that foster regrowth ofthe once-abundant forest by controlling grazing and harvestingwithin the enclosed area. Management decisions about the enclosures are entirely a local matter controlled by village councils. So far, creating tradi-tional enclosures through the HASHI program has reforestedsome 350,000 hectares of overgrazed and barren land.Economic benefits distributed to villagers\u2014in the form of fodder,fuel wood, medicinal plants, and greater water availability\u2014havemade the HASHI program a popular success. The combinationof income and ecosystem benefits made the HASHI program a finalist for the UN's Equator Prize in 2002, recognizing it asprime example of the conjunction of poverty reduction andconservation. (See the Chapter 5 case study, \"Regenerating Woodlands: Tanzania's HASHI Project.\") Similar ecosystem improvements have also been documented in cases where wildlife management has beendevolved to the local level. Wildlife censuses associated with theSelous Conservation Program in Tanzania showed increasedanimal numbers, and wildlife populations have reboundedimpressively in Namibia's conservancy areas as poaching hasfallen and conflicts with livestock have been reduced(Shyamsundar et al. 2004:12). Keeping Community-Based Management Pro-Poor These successes show the potential for community-based management to empower and enrich local communities andstill manage ecosystems well. But CBNRM is no panacea, andCHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 8990WORLD RESOURCES 2005 it is by no means always pro-poor. Both the power and benefits associated with community management tend to be directedtoward higher income classes unless specific accommodationsare made. In pursuing pro-poor CBNRM, communities,governments, and NGOs must keep in mind several points: Accounting for the Costs of CBNRM Community management of ecosystems sometimes entailssubstantial costs that must be accounted for and minimized.One of the major costs of many community-managementschemes is the short-term loss of the use of a resource to allowit to recover or to keep its use within sustainable levels(Shyamsundar et al. 2004:10). This \"opportunity cost\" maymanifest as a restriction in the use of common areas for grazingor firewood collection, or a limit on how many game animalsor fish can be harvested\u2014restrictions that inevitably fallhardest on the poor. The loss is usually temporary\u2014a typicalgrazing ban to restore a denuded watershed slope might last forthree years. In addition, if the ban is successful, the long-termbenefit from the closure will soon exceed the short-term costs.Nonetheless, the short-term costs can impact poor familiesconsiderably in the interim and are a frequent source of dissat-isfaction (Kerr 2002a:1397). For example, in a study of villages participating in water- shed restoration projects in western India (part of India'sWatershed Development program), nearly a fifth of the landlessresidents reported that the restoration projects harmed theirinterests because they could not graze their sheep on thecommons due to grazing bans (Kerr 2002a:1396). Women toocomplained of their loss of access to common lands, which theyused to collect grasses for brooms, tamarind pods, and tenduleaves\u2014some of the few income sources that they controlledindependent of their husbands (Kerr 2002a:1395-97). This and other studies show that without a mechanism to compensate the poor for their short-term losses, achieving goodecosystem management and maximum benefit to the poor maybe antagonistic goals, at least in the initial stages of ecosystemrecovery . Offering wage labor to try to offset the income loss isone common way to avoid this trade-off. For example, watershedrestoration may require seasonal labor for several years to buildcheck dams, plant trees, install fencing, create ponds, or recontourcroplands to retain water. However, this will only provideadequate support if the poor are hired preferentially for such jobsand the labor persists for as long as their access to resources isrestricted. In the study of watershed restoration in western India,for example, wage labor, while helpful, was not sufficient to makeup for loss of access to grazing on common lands (Kerr2002a:1388, 1395-1396; Shyamsundar et al. 2004:17-18). Other approaches to reducing short-term costs or providing compensation may also be useful. Staging the restoration ofcommon areas so that they are not all closed at once, but inrotation, is one strategy to reduce the burden on the poor.Another approach is to provide extra services specifically to poorfamilies, such as training in skills that open other employmentoptions, or establishing credit or savings groups to help them manage household resources better and make investments inland (Kerr 2002a:1391-92). Assuring Equity in Benefits Sharing As has been stressed above, richer families in a rural communityusually hold a structural advantage in capturing the benefitsfrom good ecosystem management. For example, watershedrestoration in arid climates will clearly advantage those withmore land, especially if these are low-lying lands where thegroundwater captured by the restoration is likely to accumulatemost. Likewise, owners of large boats with more efficient gearwill be able to harvest more of a healthy fish stock than thepoorest fishers paddling small piroques. Even when local resource management projects try to make poverty reduction a goal, thisnatural advantage often intervenes (Kerr 2002a:1388-9, 1398;Kumar 2002:763). Given the structural advantages of the rich, developing mechanisms to share benefits and costs equitably among allcommunity members must be a priority when communitiesbegin local management of common resources. But findingacceptable recipes for benefit-sharing is notoriously difficult.Successful attempts often require analyzing the benefits carefullyso that they can be apportioned not just on the basis of thequantity of water, fish, or forest products produced, but on theeconomic value of these benefits. The village of Sukhomajri in the Indian state of Haryana offers one famous example of the successful sharing of benefits.Watershed restoration there in the 1970s produced the samebenefits seen in other successful restoration projects: revegetatedupper slopes produced more fodder and more surface water inlow-lying areas that could be used for irrigation and otherincome-producing activities. The innovation came in giving each family an equal share of the water that collected in the village's new catchmentponds, with the option to use it or sell it to others if theywished. Landless families could thus sell their water to farmerswith greater need for irrigation, turning their share to cash, aswell as benefiting from wage labor that might result from moreirrigated crops. Each family also received equal shares ofthe watershed's valuable bhabhar grass, which they could similarly use or sell. This arrangement resulted in considerableincreases in household income throughout the community . By1998, 70 percent of village households were earning Rs month (US$47) (Agarwal and Narain 1999:14-17; Kerr2002a:1390; Kerr , there is no easy formula for benefit-sharing arrangements, which are highly specific to both the resourcesbeing managed and the social structure of the community .In some instances, the resource is highly divisible andmarketable, such as the harvest of high-priced medicinals, andsharing may be straightforward. Or community benefits maycome in the form of access fees from tourists, timber revenues, orother income that can be split among community members. Injp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:32 PM Page 9091Namibian conservancies, for example, revenues from tourist access, campgrounds, and the sale of game hunting licenses toforeigners generate income that in some instances has beenturned into a cash payout to each conservancy household\u2014aneasy way to assure equal treatment (US AID 2004:13). But in other instances, easy division may be impossible. For example, in many restored watersheds the increase in water willnot result in accumulation of surface water in ponds where sharescan be calculated. Instead, extra water may manifest as moregroundwater, which is legally the property of the land owner fromwhose well it is pumped to the surface. This makes the commu-nity benefit difficult to calculate and hard to tap by poor familieswithout land or wells. Addressing this would require an arrange-ment where groundwater is considered community property nomatter where it is pumped, with users paying a fee to the commu-nity to tap it (Kerr 2002a:1391-1392, 1399). Another approach to community equity is to grant special arrangements just to the lowest income families. For example,one Indian village in Maharashtra state granted to the village'slandless residents exclusive fishing rights in a run-off pond thatthe community had built (Kerr 2002a:1391-1392, 1399).Likewise, low-income families could be allowed special areas tofish, extra harvest or grazing periods, or an extra share of theresource being managed. In all cases, this requires a progressiveview of benefits and a careful definition of user rights that isformalized and accepted by the community . Acknowledging the Limits of Participation There is a growing consensus that communities can establishfunctioning institutions capable of managing local resources,and that these institutions\u2014from village councils to user groups\u2014can function through community participation, makingreal the promise of local devolution. But there is also the realiza-tion that community processes are rarely egalitarian. Except inrare instances, communities are not homogeneous, and naturallybreak into various interest groups, making equity a challenge.Often, these are based along class, ethnic, and gender lines, withwomen and the poor usually being the least powerful of thesegroups (Kellert et al. 2000:705; Shyamsundar et al. 2004:16-17,19; Kerr 2002a:1388-1389; Kumar 2002:765-766). A scene several years ago from a village meeting about a new watershed restoration project in the Indian state ofKarnataka illustrates the problem. At the front of the room satthe wealthiest landholders, who owned fertile, irrigated land inthe valley bottom. Behind them sat middle-income farmers withless-desirable but still good land. In the back stood poor familieswith the least fertile land at the top of the watershed. Thelandless hung around the periphery; no women were present(Fernandez 2003:6-7). In situations such as these, assuring true participation for the poor requires considerable institution-building so thatmechanisms of inclusion can gradually work against ingrainedsocial patterns. For example, one NGO in Maharashtra statethat helps villages undertake watershed restoration programsinsists on a consensus-based approach to all decisions about thewatershed and spends a good deal of time facilitating suchdecisions and building the social basis necessary to foster them(Kerr et al. 2002:16, 34). Although it is more unwieldy than amajority vote, this approach offers an organic way to make surethe interests of the landless minority are not simply swept aside. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 9192WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Another method that has proven effective in some situa- tions is to encourage the poor to form a separate affinity groupor self-help group\u2014such as a credit or savings association\u2014where they can discuss common concerns, develop skills such asbookkeeping and management of common funds, and come tocommon negotiating positions. One or more members of suchself-help groups can then act as an official representative on thewatershed committee or other local authority charged withmanaging the natural resource in question, insuring that thepoor have an official voice and at least a modicum of represen-tation. In Karnataka, such arrangements have, for example,resulted in better recognition of the need to provide forage tothe landless during the watershed regeneration process(Fernandez 2003:5-10). Often, these self-help and affinity groups have a high proportion of women. This points up the fact that achievingreal participation of the poor inevitably means making specialefforts to bring women, who head up many of the pooresthouseholds, into a greater decision-making role. Overcominggender bias is particularly important in natural resourcemanagement because of the role women play in generatingenvironmental income and their place in managing the house-hold economy . They are usually the front-line users of naturalresources on a day-to-day basis. Unfortunately , there is abundant evidence that even when women are given places on village committees, theyoften are treated as tokens rather than full members, withtheir voices being lost among the male majority or their votessimply a proxy for their husbands' opinions. Techniques toincrease the influence of women include requiring parity\u2014orclose to it\u2014of representation on such committees, as well asdeliberate scheduling of meetings to accommodate women'sdomestic and child-care responsibilities. Including women intechnical training about managing the resource in question is also important to insure parity in skill levels and reinforcethe idea of women as co-managers rather than dependents(Kerr 2002a:1398). Nongovernmental organizations are frequently essential partners in helping communities devise decision-makingprocesses that include the poor. Local NGOs often provideboth technical help with the task of resource management,but also capacity-building in group dynamics and conflictresolution, as well as administrative capabilities such asbookkeeping, budgeting, keeping records, filing reports, andinteracting with government officials. In Karnataka, the NGOMYRADA provides a series of 14 training modules for the useof local self-help groups covering topics such as crafting acommon vision, developing internal rules and regulations,resolving conflicts, and maintaining proper books (Fernandez2003:6). As with MYRADA, the involvement of local NGOscan be the catalyst for innovations in local governance that helpthe community reach beyond its traditional social hierarchy torecognize the need for greater equity in benefits-sharing (Kerr2002a:1390-1392). Such groups can also bring isolated ruralcommunities into contact with networks of similar communi- ties to share experiences, as well as with a wider globalcommunity of ideas and funding that may offer new resourcesand partnerships (WRI et al. 2003:71-88). While communities can look to civil-society groups for new approaches to local governance, they often need to revisittraditional community institutions as well. Customary sourcesof authority such as chiefs or village elders are frequently key players in helping communities to organize around thegoal of local management. In many cases, community actioncould not proceed without at least the tacit blessing of thetraditional leaders. In some instances, these traditional institutions have acted in parallel with democratic institutions such as village councils,creating a synergy between new and old that has been key to the success of the management effort. In Fiji, it was theencouragement of the local district chief that led to the firstexperimentation with community management of a localfishery and the establishment of the no-fishing zone thathelped rejuvenate it. In Tanzania's HASHI project, protectedforest enclosures are officially managed by the local villagecouncils, but the councils are guided by the villages' customaryCouncil of Elders and informed by traditional village assem-blies called Dagashida. While traditional institutions generally engender the community's respect and buy-in to local management regimes,they can also be obstacles to equity and equal participation ifthey simply reinforce entrenched power arrangements or providea route for powerful families to monopolize the benefits stream(Shyamsundar et al. 2004:7). A Continuing Role for the State The goal of devolving control over natural resource manage-ment from the national level to the local level is to give localresidents a stake in management, thus increasing its effective-ness and equity . But the state still plays an essential role inhelping such local management to succeed. For example, it isthe state that must put in place the policy and legal frameworkto allow local management to take place at all. In addition, thestate has a special responsibility to look beyond the level ofcommunity management to make sure that broader environ-mental standards are upheld and management efforts arecoordinated. The state can also help local management tobecome a source of substantial income through training andcapacity building, as well as deploying its more traditionaleconomic development tools of transport, marketing, andcredit assistance. More specifically , the state has an importantrole in eight areas: 1. Defining the legal space for local management. Without official state recognition, local management regimescan never be secure. This usually requires altering the frame-work of national laws that define the state's role in resourcejp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 92CO-MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCES IN SAMOA In 1995 the Fisheries Division of Samoa developed a co-management policy for the nation's small-scale coastal fisheries. It began to work withfishing communities to develop Village Fisheries Management Plans,providing villages with any technical assistance they needed to developthe plans. Provided the rules proposed in the management plans wereconsistent with national law, the government would help the communitiesmake them legally binding by issuing them as by-laws. Once approved,the by-laws were disseminated via radio. Within the first two years of implementing the co-management policy, the Fisheries Division had helped 44 communities adopt FisheriesManagement Plans. These plans all contained elements of sound ecosys-tem management. For example, all of the plans banned the use ofdynamite (a destructive fishing practice), 86 percent established localmarine protected areas, and 75 percent set mesh size limits on fishingnets to reduce the accidental capture of juvenile fish. The governmentimplemented the program gradually, providing extension services toroughly 10 new villages per year. Extension officers would first meet withthe community; if it was interested, the officers would convene a commu-nity assembly to negotiate the co-management arrangement, includingthe various duties and obligations of the state and the community.Satisfaction with the program was generally high. An internal review in2000 found that 86 percent of the villages were implementing manage-ment plans at or above average competency (King and Fa'asili1999:138-140; World Bank 2004:42) COMMUNITY-BASED FISHERY MANAGEMENT IN SAMOA Management Technique % of Villages Adopting Banning the use of chemicals and dynamite to kill fish 100 Banning the use of traditional plant-derived fish poisons 100Establishing small protected areas in which fishing is banned 86Enforcement of limits on the size of mesh nets 75Banning the dumping of rubbish in lagoon waters 71Placing controls or limits on the number of fish fences or traps <10Offering prayers for the safe-keeping of the marine environment <10 93ownership and management. Many nations have made significant progress in crafting new forestry , wildlife, andfishery laws that specifically sanction local managementregimes. In South Africa, for example, the 1998 MarineLiving Resources Act included a provision recognizing thelegitimacy of managing local fisheries for subsistence use(WRI et al. 2003:180). In Africa alone, more than 30countries have passed new forest laws since 1990 thatmandate varying levels of decentralization and new oppor-tunities for local participation in management (Shyamsundaret al. 2004:20). H owever, interpreting these laws and estab- lishing the limits of local management authority are ongoingchallenges that demand continued state attention and exper-imentation. This includes not only the details abouttechnical management itself, but also such institutionalquestions as the structure of local management committees.The state, for instance, may play a progressive role byencouraging gender balance on such committees. 2. Granting resource tenure. As stated earlier, tenure is a central requirement for real access and control of resources.As it defines the parameters of local control, perhaps thestate's most important contribution is to clearly establish theresource rights of communities in a legally unambiguousmanner. This allows communities to make firm managementplans and financial commitments without fear of disenfran-chisement. It gives them the legal basis to seek redress throughthe courts if they feel their resource rights have been violated.This access to redress is essential to the exercise of trueauthority , and lack of this right is a frequent bugaboo of localmanagement efforts. 3. Requiring community consent. One way that the state can safeguard local community management rights is toinsist on a requirement of free, prior, and informed consent(FPIC) by the community whenever large-scale economicprojects like mining, energy extraction, or major timberharvests are proposed nearby . Planning for such projectsoften excludes effective community participation andconflicts with local priorities. FPIC is both a principle anda process that some governments and international institu-tions are beginning to incorporate into their policies. As aprinciple, FPIC is the right of local communities andindigenous peoples to participate meaningfully , throughconsent procedures, in decisions about how the land theyoccupy and the natural resources they depend on are to beutilized. As a process, FPIC enables rural communities\u2014who are often politically weak\u2014to present their concernsto those proposing large-scale projects, whether they arefrom the government or the private sector. Its intent is topromote equal bargaining power among all parties andshield communities from coercion, threat, or manipulation.Without this shield, experience shows that poor communi-ties often lose control of local resources. (See Box 3.3.)4. Creating local-state co-management partnerships. In many cases, local management is best pursued as apartnership between the community and the state. Co-management regimes, as these partnerships are called, allowthe state to contribute its expertise in some areas whiledevolving substantial control over most day-to-day manage-ment. Co-management regimes have become common infisheries, where communities may not have the capability totake on some essential tasks such as fisheries research andstock assessment, or to manage an entire fishery . But they areCHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME Source: King and Fa'asili 1999: FAO 2002b Continues page 96jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 9394A COFFEE DRINKER IN SAN FRANCISCO has little chance of ever meeting the small-scale farmer inNicaragua who may have raised the original coffee beans. Butif the coffee drinker has bought \"Fair Trade\" beans, he or shehas made a conscious effort to support the coffee producer witha fair wage. Goods that are certified as \"Fair Trade\" are priceda little higher than the market rate, with the premium routed tothe small rural producer in the form of a slightly higher profit.The Fair Trade concept aims to bring small farmers a fair pricefor their products and to support sustainable and sociallyresponsible production methods (FLO 2004:3-8). Fair Trade isthus one of the more benign faces of globalization, with thepotential to connect poor rural producers with global markets. Besides coffee, Fair Trade items include tea, cocoa, sugar, honey, bananas, fresh fruit and vegetables, dried fruit, fruitjuices, rice, wine, nuts and oilseeds, cut flowers, ornamentalplants, cotton, and a variety of handmade crafts\u2014but coffeeremains the core of the Fair Trade system (FLO 2005; Young2003:6). Fair Trade certification\u2014where producer cooperativescommit to a series of labor and environmental practices andsocial equity goals\u2014began in 1988, when Mexican and Dutchtrading partners launched the Max Havelaar Fair Trade certifi-cation, sponsored by the Max Havelaar Foundation in theNetherlands. In 1997, the growing family of Fair Trade organi-zations formed an umbrella organization, Fairtrade LabelingOrganizations International (FLO), which standardized labelingand certification procedures. In 2004 there were some 400organizations and more than 800,000 producers certifiedunder the FLO umbrella (FLO 2005). Fair Trade producers can earn more than double the conven- tional market price for their beans. The 2004 price for FairTrade Robusta coffee was set by the FLO at a minimum ofUS$1.01 per pound, with an additional $0.15 premium fororganic coffee. This compares to prices on the conventionalmarket that averaged US$0.40 per pound (FLO 2004:11;Bacon 2005:505). This can translate into a significant incomeboost for farmers. In Chiapas, Mexico, farmers in one coffeecooperative have reported 100-200 percent growth in incomein recent years due to Fair Trade sales (Taylor 2002:19-23). Direct gains in income are critical for small farmers, but some of the less visible benefits of Fair Trade can be even moreimportant for producers in the long term. Members of the LaSelva cooperative in Chiapas, Mexico, cite the importance ofthe \"apprenticeship in commercialization\" they have gainedfrom working directly with buyers and learning about potentialmarkets (Murray et al. 2003:12). Other important benefitsinclude greater access to credit, broader networks of contacts, and technical training and information exchanges that helpfarmers produce higher-quality coffee (Taylor et al. 2002:20). Finally, Fair Trade and shade-grown coffee can significantly reduce the vulnerability of small farmers, impacting livelihoodsecurity in ways that are often overlooked. A typical shadecoffee farm consists of a mixed plantation that can producefruit, firewood, timber, and other products in addition to coffee.This allows families to be less dependent upon a single crop,and provides resources that can be used directly or sold forcash. Studies in Guatemala and Peru suggest that these non-coffee products can provide as much as 25 percent of the totalvalue earned on a small farm (Rice 2001 in Valencia 2001:2).Fair Trade cooperatives also offer a set price for a crop\u2014thisgives farmers the ability to plan ahead, a rare luxury (Murray etal. 2003:7). A survey of Nicaraguan farmers found that farmersparticipating in Fair Trade and other alternative markets werefour times less likely to feel at risk of losing their land due tolow coffee prices (Bacon 2005:506). Fair Trade coffee production also has important environmental benefits. While Fair Trade cooperatives do not require theirmembers to raise shade-grown coffee, they encourage it alongwith organic production methods. Most training and financingare linked to sustainable production methods, and organiccoffee can earn an additional price premium (Taylor 2002:3-4). The Samyukta Vikas Cooperative: A Fair-Trade Success While coffee is the focus of much Fair Trade commerce, villagers near Darjeeling, India, have concentrated on tea.Residents of three remote hill villages located on a former teaplantation are now successfully exporting organic Darjeeling tea to U.S. consumers. The new tea enterprise has helped thevillages of Harsing, Yankhoo, and Dabaipani become economi-cally self-sufficient. Tea income has allowed residents toconstruct a community drinking water supply, and the villagersare developing plans to add ginger, cardamom, and oranges totheir organic exports. Life for the villages' 483 families, all of Nepali descent, has improved significantly in just eight short years. Since the teaestate they inhabit was abandoned in 1952, the isolatedcommunities had survived on subsistence farming, cultivatingmaize, millet, and vegetables, and keeping a few cattle, goats,and chickens\u2014almost all for domestic consumption.

Their soil's high acidity, the result of intensive tea cultivation, led tovery low productivity. Local deforestation had also contributedto soil erosion, landslides, and the loss of forest products(RCDC 1996:5-7). Most families lived a precarious existence, surviving on less than 12,000 rupees per year (US$275). A 1996 survey by alocal development NGO, the Darjeeling Ladenla Road Prerna(RCDC), reported that the villagers \"have very low self-esteemand display an attitude of despair.\" When asked their views ondevelopment priorities for their communities, 30 percentreplied \"no idea\" (RCDC 1996:4). All this changed in 1997 when RCDC persuaded the villagers to form the Samyukta Vikas Cooperative and use their own resourcesto improve their livelihoods. Three community members werechosen as \"animators\" and trained by RCDC in participatorydecision-making and co-op management. These three explainedwhat they had learned to households across the scatteredhamlets. The villagers then voted to establish a cooperative ofthree levels, with farmer families as the bottom tier, electedhamlet committees as the middle tier, and an elected board, with members from every village, as the highest decision-makingauthority (Down to Earth 2004:44). The board's first actions wereto set up a milk cooperative and a small credit union throughwhich villagers could sell milk and borrow small sums at far lessinterest than charged by middlemen (TPI 1999). Once the cooperative was functioning, RCDC linked the villagers with Tea Promoters of India (TPI), a Calcutta-based,family-owned company that manages four organic tea gardens,all run according to Fair Trade standards. During a series ofnegotiations, the cooperative board voted that all memberswould convert to organic farming, while TPI undertook to buythe villagers' tea supply, distribute grasses used for soil rehabil-itation to the farmers, and train them in organic techniquesincluding composting, pruning, and use of natural pesticides.The company also supplied 4,800 tea saplings at a 50 percentdiscount (TPI 1999:1-2). Tea-leaf production from the villages has grown steadily since the first collection for TPI in May 1998. Tea collectors areselected from the community by each hamlet committee, andpaid a wage by TPI. Other co-op members transport the leavesto TPI's nearest tea garden, where they are processed andblended for export (Down to Earth 2004:44). Samyukta Vikas Cooperative is the first non-plantation, cooper- ative tea supplier established in Darjeeling. Since 1999,organic English Breakfast, Earl Grey, and green tea sourcedfrom its family-owned plots has been exported by Tea Promotersof India to the Fair Trade company Equal Exchange, based inMassachusetts. From there it is sold to food co-ops, healthstores, churches, restaurants, and cafes around the UnitedStates. TPI, Equal Exchange, and Dritwelt Partners, a Europeancertification organization, jointly bore the cost of the interna-tional organic certification process for the Samyukta VikasCooperative's tea supply. In 2004, Tea Promoters of Indiaprovided more than eight tons of tea to Equal Exchange (nearly140,000 boxes), 10 percent of which came from the SamyuktaVikas Cooperative (Howard 2005). While it remains a small-scale enterprise, the successful collab- oration between community-owned farms in Darjeeling, localFair Trade exporters, and overseas Fair Trade importers demon-strates one route by which global markets, when combined withfair prices and local governance over use of natural resources,can benefit poor producers in developing nations. /orn8flipjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 9596WORLD RESOURCES 2005 also common in forests, such as India's Joint Forestry Management agreements, where communities are grantedlimited management and use rights on state forest lands. Thechallenge for co-management regimes is to assure that thestate cedes sufficient rights and authority to local communi-ties but does not abandon them, leaving the communitieswithout proper support. 5. Accounting for the scale challenge. Inherent in the management of ecosystems is the problem of scale.Ecosystems can exist simultaneously at different scales, froma forest block in a single watershed to interconnected foresttracts extending a thousand kilometers. Sustaining ecosys-tems requires keeping in mind the interconnections betweenthese scales, from micro to macro. Forest management in one community's watershed may affect downstreamcommunities and adjacent forests. Local communitiescannot be expected to manage well at this macroscale, andthus the state retains an essential role here. This meanshelping to coordinate management plans in adjacentcommunities\u2014and across the nation\u2014so that they do not conflict or overemphasize a single kind of use (Shyamsundar et al. 2004:20). The state also has anoversight responsibility to make sure that local managementaligns with national environmental laws, and even withinternational treaties such as the Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). 6. Monitoring and enforcement. Good ecosystem manage- ment relies on keeping harvest activities, tourist use, orother impacts within the ecosystem's tolerances. This inturn demands an attempt to monitor the state of the ecosys-tem or the intensity of the impacts so that managementdecisions can reflect conditions on the ground. It alsodemands enforcement of the community's harvest or userules and the prevention of illegal logging, fishing, or otherencroachment on the resource. Communities can oftendevelop monitoring and enforcement capabilities, and, infact, this is one area of group participation that can becomea source of empowerment, as community members developscientific skills or volunteer as forest guards or gamewardens. But for transboundary monitoring or enforcement jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 963 97actions where large-scale poaching or illegal activity is involved, the state can usefully intervene with personnel orfunds or both. 7. Capacity-building and networking. Developing the management acumen required to effectively manage afishery , game population, ecotourism trade, or forest conces-sion takes time and training. While NGOs can help withmuch of this capacity-building and training, the state\u2014as arepository of skills and budget in these areas\u2014clearly has apart to play . The state, as overseer and coordinator, also hasa natural role in helping communities share lessons andskills. It can also help communities participate in largerinternational networking efforts and partnerships, such asUNDP's Equator Initiative, which brings together govern-ments, NGOs, businesses, and local communities to identifyand support examples of sustainable community resourcemanagement that increases rural incomes. 8. Supporting communities with transportation, credit, and market regulation. If one of the prime goals of local management is to increase income from the communityresource, then the state can help by fulfilling its traditional roleof supporting economic development by assisting localcommunities to develop their transportation and marketinginfrastructure. Without an outlet to viable markets and theknowledge and funding to create demand, local communitieswill not be able to maximize their gain and reward goodmanagement practices. At the same time, the state must do itspart to insure that competitive markets exist for the productsof rural enterprise. That means regulating markets to avoidthe price-fixing and monopoly control of resource marketsthat frequently occurs in poor nations. When the state supports communities by playing these roles well, it can greatly increase the chances for successful local manage-ment. In turn, the state can look forward to significant returns onits investment in the form of better management results, highertax revenues, reduced resource conflicts, and smaller outlays formonitoring and enforcement (Shyamsundar et al. 2004:13-14). COMMERCIALIZING ECOSYSTEM GOODS AND SERVICES Success at managing ecosystems can bring the poor higher agricultural yields, more fodder, and higher fish catches. Successat creating local institutions that serve the poor can bring a fairerdistribution of this enhanced productivity . But these steps alonedo not necessarily bring wealth. They may enrich the householddiet and stabilize daily subsistence, but they do not assure thekind of cash income that aids the transition out of poverty . Thatusually requires successful commerce. Success at commercializ-ing ecosystem goods and services often marks the difference between using nature as a low-income livelihood support andmaking it a substantial source of cash and a path to the accumu-lation of economic assets (Marshall et al. 2003:128, 135-136;Neumann and Hirsch 2000:43). There are several importantelements to successful commercialization: Provide Marketing Assistance Product processing, marketing, transport, and sales are the mainaspects of commercialization. While emphasis is often placed onthe process of production itself\u2014the farming, fishing, or collec-tion of wild products\u2014the importance of the commercializationprocess is sometimes under-appreciated. That's unfortunate,because commercialization factors are the most frequent obsta-cles to higher cash income from ecosystems. A recent study inMexico and Bolivia found that marketing and sales\u2014notproduction issues\u2014were the main constraints to successfullyturning nontimber forest products like resins, basket-weavingmaterials, honey , bamboo, and bark into successful commercialproducts (Marshall et al. 2003:130, 135). These constraints manifest in a variety of ways. Rural farmers and fishers may lack a way to get their productsefficiently to market. Forest collectors may not know how toeffectively price their product, may lack information on how toimprove their product's quality or consumer acceptability , andmay not know how to build demand in specialty markets inurban areas or among tourists. Guides or others serving theecotourist market may lack contacts, experience, or languageskills to market their unique services. It is not surprising thatresearch suggests an urgent need for better business planning,market analysis, and market development if rural ecosystemusers are to find commercial success (Marshall et al. 2003:135). To a certain extent, sheer lack of information on current market conditions and trends contributes to lack of marketingpower. New information services can help with this. In Ugandaa coalition of NGOs, government agencies, and private compa-nies operates FOODNET , a regional network that collectsweekly or daily price information on commodities. Rural farmersaccess the information through radio broadcasts, the Internet,and cell phones. The service, which reaches seven million peopleweekly , prevents middlemen from manipulating prices to under-cut producers. Farmers estimate that the service has raised theirreturn on products by 5-15 percent (WRI 2005). But the problem goes deeper as well\u2014to a lack of training in business planning. NGOs and state extension services can beimportant partners in providing the training and technical supportto meet these planning and marketing needs. For example,Mexico's PROCYMAF program, cofinanced by the governmentand the World Bank, offers training to community enterprises inforest management as well as marketing information for wood andnonwood products. The program has financed over 60 marketingstudies and 10-12 pilot projects to test the viability of nontimberforest product enterprises (Scherr et al. 2003:50, 57).CHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 9798WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Understand the Limitations of Transportation Rural areas are notoriously difficult to reach. Roads and rail links are usually scarce, often in disrepair, andfrequently impassable. This puts transportation highon the list of critical factors determining the commer-cial viability of ecosystem goods and services that therural poor may wish to market. In the remote Iquitosregion of Peru, for example, transportation costs areoften the deciding factor in what is marketed(Neumann and Hirsch 2000:51-52). Fresh fruits, vegetables, fish, milk, and other perish- able items are particularly subject to the limitations oftransport infrastructure. In Nigeria's Niger River deltaregion, marketing of the African or Bush Pear (Dacryodes edulis) \u2014a nutritious and valuable fruit much in demand\u2014is held back by impassable roads during therainy season, just when the pear is bearing most heavily(Adewusi 2004:144). Likewise, a market analysis of palmfruits harvested in the one of Brazil's Extractive Reservesfound that it was only profitable to market those fruitspicked within 114 km of a market\u2014about 3.5 days traveltime. Beyond that, it was too slow and too costly to beworth the effort (Neumann and Hirsch 2000:52). Of course, the need to provide efficient rural transportation goes well beyond its importance tobuilding markets for ecosystem goods. It is a basicrequirement for rural development more broadly .Studies show that transportation deficits and bottle-necks are an obstacle to economic growth. Theconnection of roads to poverty reduction is also well-understood. A recent study shows that living close toa highway decreases a household's chance of beingpoor by 17 percent and increases its access to work by32 percent (Manasseh and Chopra 2004). Nonetheless,providing adequate rural transportation has been aconstant challenge for national and local governments due tothe high costs of transport infrastructure, and it is likely thatgetting products to market will remain a lingering problem forpoor producers. Make Credit Available One of the most frequently cited constraints to commercializingenvironmental goods is a lack of financial services such as loansor credit. Credit is simply unavailable in many rural settings,handicapping the ability of the poor to use their environmentalassets. By one estimate, 500 million economically active poorfamilies have no access to credit or other financial services.Without access to credit, the poor must rely on their own savingsto capitalize their enterprises, but these are frequently inade-quate to fully exploit their economic opportunities (Marshall etal. 2003:135; IFAD 2004:9).Considerable strides have been made in recent years in providing new credit channels for the poor, from informalsavings clubs to more formal Grameen-type microfinance banks.These have dispelled the myth that the poor are not creditwor-thy or are unable to save (Morduch and Haley 2002:2-3). But thedimensions of the credit problem require continued progress inextending microfinance to diverse rural communities. Onepromising strategy involves taking advantage of the fact that thepoor have already formed thousands of self-help groups andsaving clubs to address their own finance needs. Linking thesegroups with traditional banks would allow the banks to extendtheir services to a ready-made clientele with a history of enter-prise and saving. In turn, these small groups of poor householdswould then become connected to the larger financial market andcould draw on its business expertise (IFAD 2004:15). Other more traditional strategies will be needed as well if credit availability is to rise substantially . These include strength-Farm Factory Exporter Importer Factory RetailCoffee trees take 3-4 years to bear fruit after plantin g. On most small farms, coffee is picked from the tree by han d.

Capture Greater Value Increasing the economic return that the poor realize from nature-based products is an important element in any strategy to usenature for poverty reduction. Many of the goods that the poorproduce or obtain from nature yield low prices relative to the laborinvolved. Changing this involves action at three different levels. Improve Production and Processing The first level of creating value is improving production orprocessing efficiency so that the same labor yields more or ahigher-quality product. An important aspect of this is improvingthe storage and handling of products to reduce losses andimprove quality . A high rate of post-harvest losses is typical forsmall producers. In Ethiopia, post-harvest grain losses fromspoilage, insects, and rodents rob grain producers of 5-26percent of their harvest (Gabriel and Hundie 2004:4). Losses ofmilk in Tanzania total some 60 million liters per year, worth overUS$14 million (FAO 2005). Reducing losses involves a concertedeffort to educate small-scale producers about good productionhygiene and the use of low-cost technologies for storage andshipment. For example, FAO is currently helping to implementmilk-hygiene programs for small producers in East Africa, and toexplore the adoption of an inexpensive milk preservation systemcalled the lacto-peroxidase system to extend shelf-life of small-producer milk (ILRI 2003:6). Paying more attention to factors like appearance, packag- ing, or labeling, particularly for export or tourist markets, canalso raise the value of products. State extension agents or NGOtechnical assistance can frequently help. In one example, smallfarmer cooperatives in Nicaragua have worked with the U.S.Agency for International Development and the Thanksgiving Coffee Company to build \"cupping labs\" to taste their coffeeafter processing. Thanks to the labs, the Nicaraguan farmershave begun garnering international awards for coffee quality andare successfully reaching specialty markets in Europe and theUnited States (Bacon 2002:i-iii; USAID 2004:1). Cooperatives Raise Marketing Power The poor frequently capture only a small percentage of thevalue of the ecosystem products they sell, while middlemenand retailers higher up the commodity chain often capture amuch greater share. Middlemen perform valuable services by transporting products to wider markets and tapping intodistribution chains to which the poor have no access. But theyare also key actors in keeping producer profits low. Forexample, small-scale coffee farmers capture, on average, only4.5 percent of the retail price of coffee sold in U.S. supermar-kets (Gresser and Tickell 2002:21). In Senegal, an analysis ofthe charcoal commodity chain likewise found that the profit of a typical woodcutter at the base of the chain is less than 4 percent of the profit that an urban charcoal wholesaler earns(Ribot 1998:318). (See Figure 4.4.) A common way for rural producers to increase their market power and avoid middlemen is to form cooperatives or market-ing groups. These groups can help poor producers receive bettermarket information, increase their prices, and expand theirmarkets. They also provide a natural forum for training,networking, and sometimes for management of the resourcebeing marketed. In Nam Pheng village in northern Laos,villagers formed a marketing group in 1998 to coordinate theirharvest of bitter bamboo and cardamom and to try to increasethe price received at market. The marketing group collects thevillagers' individual harvests, sells them on a large scale totraders, and delivers 85-90 percent of the final sale price tovillagers (Morris 2002:4-5). The effectiveness of the group was immediately apparent when, shortly after forming, they were able to raise the local priceof cardamom from 500 Lao Kip per kilogram to 35,000 Kip.Although the price has since dropped to 14,000 Kip, it is still wellabove what villagers got when they marketed on an individualbasis. The 10-15 percent of the sale price that the marketinggroup keeps goes into a community investment fund that hassupported a new school and an improved water supply , as well asproviding loans for a number of households. The marketinggroup has ventured into management by setting regulations forwhen and how much to harvest, and also providing training incollection techniques. Decisions are made jointly by the market-ing group members, which include virtually all households in thevillage (Morris 2002:4-5). (See Figure 4.5.) In Mexico, the Union de Ejidos de la Selva, a peasant organization, has helped organize small coffee producers inChiapas state into an effective marketing force. The unioncollaborates with 1,250 families in 42 communities to ensure theadoption of better soil-management and environmentalCHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME Influence of Village Marketing Grou p In Nam Pheng, Laos 2002 price: 14,000 kip/kg Initial price: 500 kip/kgLocal Price of Car damom (Ki p/kg) 1996 1998 2000 2002Marketin g Group Forme d 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,000FIGURE 4.5 MARKETING GROUPS RAISE PROFITS Source: Morris 2002jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 99100WORLD RESOURCES 2005 practices, including certified organic techniques that limit erosion and water pollution. The union has partnered with a civilsociety organization called the Vinculo y Dessarrollo to create achain of five up-scale coffee shops in Mexico City\u2014the Caf\u00e9 de laSelva\u2014that serves the organic coffee produced by the Union de laSelva farmers. By controlling the entire vertical chain of coffeeproduction, the Union de Ejidos de la Selva has been able tocapture the full urban consumer value of coffee and use it toimprove farmer income and self-sufficiency (Samperio 2002). Use New Commercial Models A third tactic for increasing commercial payoff is to make useof new models of commercialization, such as organic certifi-cation or the Fair Trade movement. These specializedmarkets, in which consumers purchase an item (often at apremium) in order to further social, environmental, and healthgoals, have continued to grow year by year. Although they donot account for a large percentage of total sales of anycommodity , these markets can offer several advantages. TheFair Trade movement, for example, is targeted to supportsmall rural producers, with the explicit goal of providing a fairwage for growing or crafting export items such as coffee, tea,bananas, or any of a number of handicrafts. It essentially amplifies the idea of a typical cooperative or marketing groupto the global level, offering low-income producers a route tohigh-value international sales they would otherwise have littlechance of obtaining. (See Box 4.2.) The markets for certified organic food, sustainably harvested lumber, and sustainably caught seafood also offerpotential for low-income rural producers. Certification offersconsumers a guarantee\u2014through inspections or other verifica-tion methods\u2014that a given product has met certain standards inits growth, harvesting, or processing. The kinds of small-scaleproduction that the poor engage in often lend themselves toorganic or sustainable methods. Many small coffee producers,for example, follow organic practices by default. But certification offers challenges to the poor. The most significant is meeting the cost and technical requirements of certi-fication. For example, fishery certification by the MarineStewardship Council requires a time-consuming and expensiveevaluation of the harvest levels and equipment used by fishers;forest certification similarly requires a verified forest managementplan. For the poor to be able to participate, their certificationcosts will need to be reduced or subsidized by donors, NGO CAPITALIZING ON THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE POOR Although they suffer some obvious disadvantages, small rural producers also hold some competitive advantages that can help them successfullycommercialize their ecosystem assets. Exploiting these advantagesincreases their economic leverage. Control of commercially valuable forest resources, land, orfishing rights. Poor households and communities with well-established resource tenure are sometimes in a position to parley this into commer-cial opportunities. This is especially true for those communities withinreasonable proximity of expanding centers of domestic or industrialdemand, such as inland cities far from commercial ports. Constraints onthe private sector's ability to meet wood demand in India, for example,have motivated more than a dozen companies to partner with ruralfarmers to grow trees on the farmers' lands (Mayers and Vermeulen2002:45; Scherr et al. 2002:4-5). Lower cost structure for some products. For communities or farmers with excess labor or land not currently under crops, there may be littleopportunity cost for growing trees or establishing low-tech aquacultureponds. These operations may have lower costs than large-scale planta-tions or high-tech fish-raising enterprises run by outside businessinterests. Agroforestry systems, for example, may offer lower costs fortree production because trees are produced jointly with crops andlivestock. For products like wood fuel and charcoal, transportation costseven from rural communities may be lower than importing thesecommodities from international markets (Scherr et al. 2002:4-5). Sole providers of some products. Because of their access to ecosys- tems and their traditional knowledge, poor households may be in thebest position to supply some niche markets, such as for medicinal plants, exotic fruits, or traditionally made handicrafts or art objects.They may also be in the best position to sell to \"socially responsible\"markets, which may value the fact that their products come from smallcommunity enterprises rather than factory farms or plantations (Scherret al. 2002:4-5). Ability to compete in domestic markets for some products. Low- income producers may not always be able to be competitive ininternational trade, but they can frequently compete effectively indomestic markets. This is particularly true for certain products that donot offer high margins, such as \"commodity grade\" wood used forfencing, storage structures, crop and tree supports, or packing crates.Larger international producers typically do not compete in these marketswith cheaper domestic products, which small-scale farmers can in manycases supply by growing trees in agroforestry schemes or wood lots(Scherr et al. 2002:4-5). Better monitoring and enforcement abilities. Local people may have greater ability than outside companies to prevent illegal logging orfishing. This may mean they are in a better position to assure the qualityof certified wood or fish products (Scherr et al. 2002:4-5). In general, low-income communities will find it easier to compete in commercial markets where there is less competition with large-scaleproducers, where there are few substitutes for their goods, where their lowlabor and start-up costs give them a lower overall cost structure, and wheretheir deficits in transport are minimized.jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 100101partners, or the state. Innovations in the certification process to make it more inclusive can also help. One forest certificationorganization has experimented with videotaping communitymembers as they describe their management and implementa-tion plans, rather than making them submit a written plan(Shanley et al. 2002:296). Another difficulty for the poor is that forest or organic certi- fications generally focus on the land where the timber or crop isgrown, guaranteeing certain practices\u2014such as absence of pesti-cide use for a specified number of years\u2014on these lands. Forthose with secure ownership of land and resources, this may befine. But many nontimber forest products are collected oncommon lands or by the landless, so guarantees about a givenparcel of land cannot be made. In this case, certification mayhave to be modified so that it focuses on the training andpractices of the harvesters themselves, with certification residingwith a harvester association rather than with a land parcel(Shanley et al. 2002:296-298). Partner with the Private Sector It is hard to imagine successfully commercializing ecosystemgoods and services without substantial participation of theprivate sector. The capital, facilities, know-how, and marketsthat businesses command make them strong potential investorsand partners for nature-based enterprises of the poor. InSouthwestern Ghana, the Swiss Lumber Company has enteredinto contracts with rural farmers to grow hardwoods ondegraded lands, where they will not compete with agriculture. The company provides a lump-sum down payment, a 20-50percent share (depending on the size of the down payment) ofthe timber at harvest, and an annual land rent. In return, SwissLumber\u2014which does not own timber lands or have access togovernment timber concessions in the area\u2014gets first option tobuy the timber at market prices when the trees are ready forharvest (Mayers and Vermeulen 2002:141). As the Swiss Lumber example shows, the business relationships that can develop between rural residents andcompanies can be beneficial to both. For poor households,benefits can include a more consistent income stream andaccess to credit, training, business planning, and marketing.One of the biggest benefits is that poor households can sharethe risks of a business venture rather than assume all the riskson their own (Mayers and Vermeulen 2002:viii, 97-101). The obvious benefits to companies are access to raw resources such as timber, fish, nontimber forest products, orscenic sights and experiences for tourism. The poor alsocomprise a low-cost labor force for management tasks like treepruning, growing of specialized crops, or hand-collection ofwild fruits. In addition, despite their limited means, poorhouseholds can provide a substantial consumer pool for theproducts and services that companies sell. Targeting sales to thesizable consumer group at the \"bottom of the pyramid\" is astrategy that many companies are beginning to explore, andbuilding brand recognition and engagement with ruralcommunities is a first step to this end. (See Box 4.3.) Continues on page 104jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 101THE 4 BILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN RELATIVE POVERTY are a potentially huge market. In the aggregate, their purchas-ing power is substantial, even if their individual means arelimited. Increasingly, innovative companies are finding ways toserve these customers\u2014meeting their basic needs and empow-ering them through access to information, access to credit,expanded consumer choice, and other benefits. These are notphilanthropic endeavors; they are market-driven and intendedto be profitable. Indeed, to be sustainable and scalable, theymust be profitable. The hallmark of these private-sectorapproaches to poverty is close attention to the real needs andsocial and environmental circumstances of the intendedcustomers. In many cases, new products or services are co-created with the communities for which they are intended. An example of these poor-focused business models is the e- Choupal system deployed in rural farming areas in several Indianstates by ITC, one of India's leading private companies withinterests in agribusiness, packaged foods, and a range of otherproducts. The e-Choupal system was designed to address ineffi-ciencies in grain purchasing in the government-mandatedmarketplaces known as mandis . In the mandi system, traders who act as purchasing agents for buyers control market informa-tion and are well-positioned to exploit both farmers and buyersthrough practices that sustain system-wide inefficiencies.Farmers have only an approximate idea of price trends and haveto accept the price offered them at auctions on the day theybring their grain to market (Annamalai and Rao 2003:1, 8-9). The approach of ITC has been to place computers with Internet access in farming villages, carefully selecting a respected localfarmer as its host. Each e-Choupal ( choupal means gatheringplace in Hindi) is located so that it can serve 6-10 villages, or about 600 farmers. An e-Choupal costs between US$3,000and $6,000 to set up, and about US$100 per year to maintain.Using the system costs farmers nothing, but the host farmer,called a sanchalak, incurs some operating costs and is obligated by a public oath to serve the entire community. The sanchalak benefits from increased prestige and a commission paid for alle-Choupal transactions (Annamalai and Rao 2003:1, 11). Farmers can use the computer to access daily closing prices on local mandis , as well as to track global price trends or find information about new farming techniques. They also use the e-Choupal to order seeds, fertilizer, and consumer goods from ITCor its partners, at prices lower than those available from villagetraders. At harvest time, ITC offers to buy crops directly from anyfarmer at the previous day's market closing price; if the farmeraccepts, he transports his crop to an ITC processing center, wherethe crop is weighed electronically and assessed for quality. Thefarmer is then paid for the crop and given a transport fee. In thisway, the e-Choupal Compared to the mandi system, farmers benefit from more accurate weighing, faster processing time, prompt payment,and access to a wide range of price and market information.Farmers selling directly to ITC through an e-Choupal typicallyreceive a price about US$6 per ton higher for their crops, aswell as lower prices for inputs and other goods, and a sense BOX 4.3 SERVING THE POOR PROFITABLY: A PRIVATE-SECTOR APPROACH TO POVERTY Choupal)Costs (Rs/metric tonne)Trans portation Bagging and Weighing Labor Costs Handling and Transit Losses Commission No Transaction CostsREDUCED TRANSACTION COSTS UNDER 102of empowerment. At the same time, ITC benefits from net procurement costs that are about 2.5 percent lower (it savesthe commission fee and part of the transport costs it wouldotherwise pay to traders who serve as its buying agents at the mandi ) and it has more direct control over the quality of what it buys. The e-Choupal system also provides direct access to the farmer and to information about conditions on the ground, allowing thecompany to improve its planning and build relationships withfarmers that increase its security of supply. The companyreports that it recovers its equipment costs from an e-Choupalin the first year of operation and that the venture as a whole isprofitable. As of late 2004, e-Choupal services reached morethan 3.5 million farmers in over 30,000 villages, and thesystem is expanding rapidly (e-Choupal 2005). What began as an effort to re-engineer the procurement process for cropping systems has also created a highly profitable distri-bution and product-design channel for the company\u2014ane-commerce platform that is also a low-cost fulfillment systemfocused on the needs of rural India. Advocates for the e-Choupal system say that it has acted as a catalyst for ruraltransformation, helping to alleviate isolation, create more trans- parency for farmers, and improve their productivity andincomes. The increased system efficiencies and potential forimproving crop quality also contribute to making Indian agricul-ture more competitive. Although many farmers are happy with the e-Choupal system, not everyone has benefited from it. Since its success drawsbusiness away from the traditional mandis, many of the workers at the mandi exchanges have been severely affected. Laborers who used to weigh and bag the produce at the mandis have suffered from the drop in volume. Vendors at the informalbazaars that grew up around the mandis have also lost business as traffic has been diverted to the new ITC processing facilities.In the long run, these workers may be reemployed at the ITCexchanges, but in the short term many traditional mandi players have lost income (Annamalai and Rao 2003:25-26). In spite of these transition costs, the e-Choupal experience and others like it are building confidence that private-sector actionscan contribute substantially both to poverty alleviation and tosustainable commercialization of ecosystem services. /orn8flip jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 103104WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Engaging with rural communities can also help compa- nies meet demand for specialized products such as certifiedlumber or organic foods. In 1990 the U.S. company Smith andHawken faced growing consumer demand for sustainablyharvested tropical hardwoods such as mahogany for furnitureand other high-end home furnishings. In response, it helped campesino forestry groups in northern Honduras\u2014community organizations of 5-50 members that manage state forestsunder use agreements with the government\u2014attain certifica-tion for their mahogany and other hardwoods. The campesino groups are now using the publicity they have received toexpand the market for less well-known woods (Mayers andVermeulen 2002:147). Arrangements like the ones undertaken by Swiss Lumber and Smith and Hawken to contract with rural farmers tosupply trees are perhaps the most common arrangementsbetween poor households and natural resource companies.These \"outgrower\" schemes are programs where timbercompanies pay small farmers to plant trees on their own (orsometimes communal) land in order to ensure a reliable supplyof timber in the future. The schemes, which can be found inmany countries on every continent, vary widely by companyand by country . In some, the company provides seedlings,access to credit, technical help in planting and caring for thetrees, and even the construction of roads for harvest. In othercases, the arrangements are more sparse, with no finance andlittle other than seedlings and an offer to buy the trees atmarket price (Mayers and Vermeulen 2002:140-154). The poverty-reduction potential of outgrower schemes varies, but can be sizable. In the South African province ofKwaZulu Natal, some 10,000 farmers\u2014more than half of themwomen\u2014participate in the outgrower programs of the Sappi andMondi paper companies. With materials supplied by the compa-nies, the farmers grow eucalyptus trees on their small plots of afew hectares. Sappi and Mondi agree to purchase the plantationwood after 6-7 years for their pulp mills. Studies have shown thatparticipating in these outgrower programs contributes 12-45percent of the income needed for a household to remain abovethe \"abject poverty line,\" so outgrower programs can be impor-tant sources of stability in some rural economies (Scherr et al2003: 51; Mayers and Vermeulen 2002:143). For companies, outgrower programs can benefit the corporate image as well as securing the timber or pulp supplyfor the future. In Brazil, pulp-and-paper company Klabinworks with timber outgrowers in a variety of joint ventures thathave generated annual income for farmers ranging fromUS$76 to $217 per hectare. Klabin's stated reasons for runningits outgrower program include the need to maintain a goodcompany image. The company also tries to gets its outgrowerscertified as sustainable timber producers in order to supply thedemand from local furniture companies that want certifiedwood. Klabin has guaranteed 10 years of timber supply tothese small furniture companies, which it hopes its outgrowerswill provide (Mayers and Vermeulen 2002:143).Despite the promise of such programs, nature-based investments in poor communities are not necessarily easy forcompanies or communities, and are by no means alwayssuccessful. The history of such partnerships shows manymissteps, reflecting the difficult circumstances of poor house-holds that push them to seek quick returns at low risk, anddemands investments of training and trust-building. Forexample, several outgrower programs in India were plaguedwith inconsistent participation by poor families. Free seedlingsoffered by the companies were often neglected; loan and creditdeals were too complicated and cumbersome to be attractive;and participants often abandoned the programs when theylearned they could find better prices on the open market thanthe prices offered by the companies (Mayers and Vermeulen2002:v, 45-52). For both companies and communities, partnerships sometimes have high transaction costs, and take negotiationand continued care to succeed. In addition, coping withgovernment regulations can be confusing and time-consuming.Experience shows that it is important for both sides to enter anoutgrower agreement with realistic expectations about theincome potential and the responsibilities of each side. Outsidelegal advice, perhaps provided by an NGO, can help poorfamilies clarify contracts, while a system of arbitration set upahead of time can help resolve disputes. It takes energy andgood faith to deal with these complexities, but where there iswillingness on both sides, the local income gains and corporatebenefits can be substantial (Mayers and 5:33 PM Page 1044 105CHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME Keep Sustainability in Mind Success in commercializing an ecosystem good or service creates its own problems. If a poor household or a rural communityfinds a winning formula for production, marketing, and deliveryof a nature-based product, the temptation will be to push theformula to its limits to increase sales and income. This can easilylead to overexploitation of the type that typically degradesecosystems. Reconciling the desire to maximize income with theneed to sustain ecosystems so that they remain productive assetsis one of the inherent challenges of using environmental incomefor poverty reduction (Neumann and Hirsch 2000:102). Succeeding Too Well An example of the dangers of succeeding too well with market-ing a natural product can be found in Bolivia, where oneindigenous community worked hard to commercialize the sale ofstring bags made of natural sisal fiber they collected andprocessed from the wild. They developed a low-cost marketingmodel to get their bags to customers in Europe, who paid ahandsome price. As this enterprise began to succeed, localwomen involved in bag-making saw their purchasing powerincrease markedly . This, in turn, encouraged them to rely moreon making sisal bags for income, abandoning other lower-profitactivities such as subsistence agriculture. As economic relianceon sisal bags spiraled upward, pressure on native sisal plantsgrew, depleting local sisal sources around the community , andeventually forcing locals to lower their harvest to a more sustain-able level (Shanley et al. 2002:279). Many other examples of the potential for unsustainability can be found. African bushmeat hunting, for example, hasreduced the population of primates like chimpanzees, whose lowreproductive rates make them especially vulnerable to overhar-vest. The use of cyanide by poor fishers in Indonesia and thePhilippines to catch prized fish for sale to high-end restaurantshas decimated many coral reefs (Barber and Pratt 1997:10-21).In Southern Africa, the expanding market for handmade basketshas put pressure on some 30 indigenous plant species used forfiber and another 22 used for dyes. In western Zimbabwe, oneweaving club that began with 20 members in 1986 hadexpanded to 500 by 1988. This is all the more remarkable giventhat handmade basket-making had only begun as a commercialenterprise in the 1970s as an economic development project inBotswana (Neumann and Hirsch 2000:102-103, 107). In these examples, activities which, when pursued on a limited basis, might not harm the resource are pushed to unsus-tainability by sheer expansion of the scope of the activity . Butthere are other contributors to unsustainable commerce too. Insome cases poor harvesting techniques or agricultural practicesexacerbate the situation. Some harvesters of African mbare palm leaves\u2014one source of basket-making fiber\u2014engage in wholesalecutting of the palms, which kills them. A sustainable alternativeis to simply cull individual leaves, which permits the palm tocontinue growing (Neumann and Hirsch 2000:103-104).Governance Matters Governance factors such as tenure\u2014or lack or it\u2014also play arole. Sometimes when a new market appears for a nontraditionalproduct, there may not be a well-defined system of customarypractices surrounding ownership and use of the product, and theresource essentially becomes an open-access resource subject tono practical controls on its use. Ecotourism can even fall into thiscategory sometimes. In other instances, there may be well-defined customary or legal property rights over a valuablemedicinal, fruit, or other resource, but it may break down as themarket for the product\u2014and its value\u2014increases, leading topoaching. This emphasizes the important role of enforcement\u2014through custom or law\u2014in complementing well-definedresource tenure as foundations for viable commerce (Neumannand Hirsch 2000:105-106). Diversity is Sustainable Ultimately , the question of sustainability boils down to aquestion of ecosystem capacities and trade-offs. How muchdisturbance can an ecosystem tolerate and still remain healthy?What opportunities for environmental income are lost as otheropportunities are emphasized? And perhaps most importantly ,what is the best strategy to optimize environmental incomewithout compromising ecosystem integrity? The answer to this last question is not simple, but the idea of diversification of activities and income streams is oneapproach that many analysts have put forward. A mix ofcommercial uses of nature, including agriculture, agroforestry ,collection of nontimber forest products, and commercial fishingmay yield greater ecological resilience, at least at a landscapelevel. It may also offer greater economic stability for ruraleconomies. From a household perspective, a portfolio of differ-ent products and activities will minimize risks for poor families.Neither a monoculture nor a monocommercial approach toenvironmental income is likely to give the best results (Chater2003:3-4; May 1992:4; Scherr et al. 2003:22). AUGMENTING NATURE'S INCOME STREAM: PAYMENT FORENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES When the poor engage in good ecosystem stewardship, they create the conditions for higher productivity and greater directenvironmental income for themselves. But they also safeguardecosystem services whose benefits extend beyond their immedi-ate surroundings. By maintaining a healthy forest cover, forexample, they are helping to preserve watershed services likeflood control, continuous water supply , and erosion control thatlandowners downstream will benefit from. In the past, theseservices have been considered \"public goods\" and available forfree, but in recent years it has become clear that many of these Continues on page 107jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 105PROGRAMS THAT PAY LANDHOLDERS TO MAINTAIN ecosystem services like storing carbon, maintaining stablewater flow, or preserving scenic landscapes for tourism haveburgeoned in the last decade. Most of these \"payment forenvironmental service\" (PES) programs don't do a good job ofreaching the poor, even though poor households are oftenactive environmental stewards. A small but growing number ofprojects show that this does not always have to be the case.Two PES programs in particular\u2014in the Cauca Valley ofColombia and in Chiapas, Mexico\u2014demonstrate how PES canyield benefits for poor communities. Cauca Valley, Colombia In the late 1980s, private farmers initiated a voluntary system ofpayment for water use in the Cauca Valley, Colombia. Thepayment system was designed to improve the livelihoods of theupland poor as part of a strategy for sustainable watershedmanagement. The uplands of the Desbaratado Watershed in theCauca Valley were inhabited by poor farmers. Seventy-twopercent lacked sanitary facilities and 83 percent had no electric-ity, but most held titles to their land (Echavarr\u00eda 2002:6). Overgrazing and deforestation on the slopes of the watershed had led to erratic stream flows and destructive seasonal flood-ing in the lower basin, the effects of which were being felt bylandowners downstream. These landowners consisted mainly ofwealthy sugarcane growers who had invested in costly farmingtechnologies, including laser leveling and undergrounddrainage and irrigation systems (Echavarr\u00eda 2002:7). With thethreat of continually escalating costs to protect their invest-ment, the farmers became interested in regulating the streamflow by restoring and improving management of the lands in theupper watershed. They subsequently organized into twelveWater User Associations and instituted voluntary user fees tofinance upland watershed management. The Water User Associations came to the conclusion that the surest route to achieving long-term land-use change in theupper watershed was to improve the livelihoods of the landusers. With the aid of the government, planners met withupland communities to identify community priorities for devel-opment. The result of these meetings was a series of programswith wide-ranging social benefits, including: A \"social program,\" providing education and skills training; A \"production program,\" which includes building home gardensto improve diets and earnings, as well as reforestationand crop-planting projects;An \"infrastructure program,\" which focuses on improvingsanitary and drinking water facilities, building roads, andconstructing erosion control structures (Echavarr\u00eda 2002:7). From 1995 to 2000, an estimated US$1.5 million was invested in the upper watershed\u2014all from the water fees assessed by theWater User Associations (Echavarr\u00eda 2002:5). So far, the environ-mental commitment of downstream users has remained strong,and upland projects have continued even in the face of armedguerilla activity in the region. Considering the length of the project,this suggests that benefits on both sides have been worthwhile. Chiapas, Mexico: Scolel T\u00e9 The Scolel T\u00e9 project in Chiapas, Mexico, represents one of the firstefforts to make the international market for carbon storage benefitpoor communities. Companies interested in offsetting their green-house gas emissions can purchase carbon credits from a localorganization, Fondo BioClim\u00e1tico, with 2003:1). The largest buyerthus far has been the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile,which purchased over 13,000 tons of credits to offset some of theemissions from professional auto racing (IUCN 2003:1). Farmers who join the Scolel T\u00e9 scheme must draw up a manage- ment plan for their land and agree, to the extent possible, tomaintain the trees on their land over the long-term. FondoBioClim\u00e1tico provides technical support and training to partici-pants in managing their land (Phillips et al. 2002:8). Scolel T\u00e9is more than a strict reforestation program. It also allows partici-pants to plant \"live fences,\" shade-grown coffee plantations, andmixed agroforestry plantations. In addition to the PES paymentthey receive, farmers can make money on regulated sales oftimber as well as non-timber products. They also commonly plantfood crops under the trees until the canopy closes over (IUCN2003:1). Because of this variety of income sources, the programis more attractive to farmers. Since it began in 1996, Scolel T\u00e9 has gained more than 700 participants in 40 communities. In 2002, sales of carbon creditsat US$12 per ton amounted to $180,000, translating into$120,000 distributed am ong the participants (IUCN 2003:1). The project has also enabled farmers to penetrate markets insustainable timber, organic coffee, and other agroforestryproducts. For many, access to these valuable markets has beenthe more important route to greater income (Rosa et al. 2003:27).The project has generated positive environmental benefits locallyas well. Plantings on denuded hillsides are helping to reduce erosion and improve soil quality. /orn8flipBOX 4.4 PAYING THE POOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 106107CHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME ecosystem services have a quantifiable economic value. If people downstream are being regularly flooded, the ability of the intactforest to moderate stream flows and lessen the flood risk will beworth something to them, and they may be willing to pay theupstream forest owners to preserve and protect this service\u2014oreven to restore it. In the last decade or so, markets based on this kind of inter- change\u2014called payment for environmental services (PES)\u2014have begun to develop worldwide. (See Table 4.2.) The most common environmental services marketed so far have beenassociated with forests and fall into four categories: watershedservices like those described above, carbon storage, biodiversityconservation, and preservation of landscape beauty . Since thepoor are the stewards of many rural ecosystems, it makes sensethat they should be able to tap these payments for environmen-tal services (PES) as an additional source of environmentalincome\u2014another element of their \"nature portfolio.\" In a fewcases, they have been successful in doing so. But for the mostpart, the markets for environmental services, which are still intheir infancy , do not yet serve the poor well. Deals involving PES range in scale from local to interna- tional and are undertaken by a range of actors, including privatecompanies, NGOs, communities, and state governments. Privatebusinesses that depend on natural resources are sometimeswilling to pay for protection of ecosystems, usually followingsigns that a resource is threatened or already in decline. In one promising example in Colombia's Cauca Valley , downstreamsugarcane growers hurt by flooding paid upland communities\u2014predominantly poor\u2014to change their land managementpractices to protect the watershed. This evened out the watersupply on the valley sugarcane farms and reduced crop damages,while bringing public benefits\u2014clean water supply , sanitation,and other economic development projects\u2014to the uplandcommunities. (See Box 4.4.) Payments for preserving biodiversity and landscape beauty often come from conservation NGOs or local businessesinvolved in ecotourism. For example, Rainforest Expeditions, aprivate company in southeastern Peru, signed a 20-year agree-ment with the local Infierno community , splitting profits andmanagement of the business in return for preservation andaccess to the forest and wildlife on the community's lands(Landell-Mills and Porras 2002:166). Governments often act as originators or participants in PES schemes. In 1996 the Costa Rican government became aleader in PES when it established the first national program todispense payments to farmers willing to maintain or restoreforest ecosystems and their services. The program payslandowners to reforest their lands or conserve forest lands theyalready own, rather than convert them to pasture. By 2004,more than 450,000 hectares were included in the program, andTABLE 4.2 PAYMENTS FOR ENVIROMENTAL SERVICES Locale Costa Rica Pimampiro, Ecuador Cauca Valley, ColumbiaKerala, India Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa,Tanzania, Zimbabwe Scholel T\u00e9, Chiapas, MexicoValue to Community More than US$100 million disbursed under 10-15 year contracts with over 450,000 ha enrolled in program.

The government has used a number ofstrategies to finance payments, including a national fuel tax,international sales of carbon credits, payments from privateutilities and industry , and funding from the World Bank andGEF (Rosa et al. 2003:16). In Brazil, the government took a different approach in the state of Acre, where it had set aside large extractive reserves forindigenous rubber tappers. To preserve the economic viability ofthe extractive reserves, it directly subsidized the rubber tappingindustry , with the subsidy amounting to an indirect PES programto maintain the natural forest cover of the reserves. In Colombia,the government is experimenting with a regulatory approach,requiring hydroelectric utility companies to transfer a percentageof their earnings to support good land management in upstreamcommunities, thus reducing reservoir siltation and preservingwater flows (Tognetti 2001:17). The Challenges of Pro-Poor PES Despite the theoretical potential for PES programs to benefit therural poor, many current programs present serious obstacles tothe inclusion of poor households. This reflects the fact that PESprograms were originally designed primarily to meet conserva-tion goals rather than support the livelihoods of the poor. TheCosta Rican program, for example, grew out of the ForestryDepartment, and its structure favored larger and wealthierlandowners (Rosa et al. 2003:16-19). A survey in one CostaRican watershed found that while all of the large landholders(owning more than 80 ha) were participating in the program,only one third of small landholders (owning less than 10 ha) hadsigned up (Miranda et al. 2003:21-22) The obstacles to including the poor in PES programs mirror many of the problems holding them back from other forms ofenvironmental income. The Costa Rican case, which has been oneof the most thoroughly studied, has faced several of these: Tenure and formal titles. Secure property rights are one of the foundations of a PES program. Land ownership is almostalways used to identify who should rightfully receivepayments. That leaves those without secure tenure\u2014particu-larly the landless\u2014unable to benefit unless some specialprovision is made, or unless benefits are distributed to largercommunity associations that can then attempt an equitabledistribution. In Costa Rica's original PES program, forexample, only titled land holders could participate, whichblocked many poor farmers. As PES programs mature andthe market for environmental services builds, this mayprovide governments yet another incentive to improve tenuresecurity for the rural poor. In the interim, h owever, a growing PES program could make things worse for the untenuredpoor if it makes rural lands more attractive to\u2014and moreliable to be snapped up by\u2014large landowners.Restrictions on land uses. PES guidelines may bar grazing or other traditional forest uses that seem to conflict with theenvironmental services that the program is paying for. Withoutaccess to these or other replacement activities, poor familieswill not be able to afford to participate in PES programs. CostaRica's program did not allow farmers to graze cattle orpractice agroforestry on any lands enrolled in the program, yetthe PES payments were not sufficient to serve as a primaryincome source. This left many small farmers no choice but toopt out. In 2002 the government amended its program toallow agroforestry activities (Rosa et al. 2003:20). High transaction costs. The costs of applying for a PES program, drawing up a contract, and monitoring perform-ance can become a considerable burden on poor families.Applicants for the Costa Rican PES program have reportedspending large amounts of time and money obtaining andWORLD RESOURCES 2005 jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 108109certifying documents, paying for land management studies, and having quarterly visits from a forest manager. Thegovernment has committed to reducing these costs substan-tially and has also moved to allow groups of small farmers tojoin the PES program collectively , thereby spreading thecosts over a larger group (Miranda et al. 2003:29-32; Pagiola2002:43-44). Lack of credit and start-up funds. Changing farming and other land-use practices or reforesting pastures to comply withPES requirements often requires a significant investment innew material, training, and lost income during the transitionperiod. Covering these costs is difficult for poor families, whotypically lack credit and cash savings. Costa Rica has tried toaddress this by front-loading payments to farmers, sending halfof the total payments (normally dispersed over five or ten years)within the first year of joining the program (Pagiola 2003:11). In spite of these obstacles, there is considerable hope that PES programs can be modified to make them work for the poor.The policy attention around PES programs in many nationshas shifted to identifying reforms needed to increase theirpotential for poverty reduction. Costa Rica, for example, hasstriven in the past few years to modify its program so that itserves the poor better. It is no coincidence that many of thegovernance changes advocated in this chapter as pro-poor, suchas establishing secure tenure and promoting community-basedinstitutions that can collectively bargain for and represent theinterests of the poor, are the same governance changes neces-sary to make PES programs better at poverty reduction. Even in their current imperfect form, PES programs have managed to deliver some important benefits to low-incomeparticipants. Many times these are related more to social organ-ization and skills training than the monetary payment. Forexample, small farmers in Costa Rica's PES program cite thetechnical training provided in the program as valuable enough tojustify participation, even if the payments themselves are notlarge. The formation of local organizations to help small farmerstake advantage of these schemes has also produced lasting gainsin social capital, with the rural poor becoming more willing todemand compensation and ownership rights for naturalresources (Rosa et al. 2003:23-26). Participation in PES programs can also open doors to other sources of environmental income. The small farmers involved inthe Scolel T\u00e9 carbon sequestration scheme did not earn largesums from the environmental-service payments themselves.However, the project enabled farmers to penetrate markets in sustainable timber, organic coffee, and other agroforestryproducts (Rosa et al. 2003:27). At their best, PES schemes offer a way to serve conservation goals while they add to the income profile of poor families andbuild social capital in poor communities. In contrast to the estab-lishment of parks, which in many cases relies on excluding ruralresidents, the PES approach is more inclusive and based on apositive role for rural communities in ecosystem management (Rosa et al. 2003:13). Like other forms of environmental income,PES by itself is not likely to allow poor families to escape poverty ,but it can become an important contributor to livelihood securitydue to the regularity of the payments and the incentive theyprovide to manage sustainably . BEYOND ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME In this chapter, we have explored a bottom-up approach togenerating environmental income by the poor. We have empha-sized that better ecosystem management and a realignment oflocal resource governance to empower the poor can lead tosignificant increases in their household incomes. It is a strategygrounded in the belief that rural poverty reduction can beginwith nature\u2014the resource and employment base that alreadysupports rural livelihoods. At the same time, we realize that poverty reduction depends on many factors beyond our discussion in this chapter. Forexample, we have emphasized that good ecosystem managementcombined with effective commercialization of nature-basedproducts helps reduce income risks for low-income families. Butpoor families face risks other than inadequate or uneven income,such as the risk of catastrophic loss from natural disasters orhealth shocks. Without mitigating these risks as well\u2014throughinterventions such as crop insurance and access to better healthcare\u2014the poor will not find a stable economic foundation inspite of good stewardship of their ecosystem assets. Likewise, access to technology is another important factor we have only lightly touched on. Many examples show thatinnovations in technology and management practices have thepotential to increase environmental income substantially , butthere are considerable barriers to adoption of such innovations.For example, researchers in Brazil have found that a combina-tion of planting legumes to enrich pasture soils and usingsolar-powered electric fences to better control where cattle grazeon a given pasture could allow smallholders to sustainablydouble milk production and triple the carrying capacity of theirland, bringing a marked increase in profits. But lack of creditand training, distance from markets, and lack of politicalcommitment to extension programs means that few Brazilianfarmers are likely to benefit from these innovations. Under thepresent economic incentives, poor farmers are likely to continuewith their usual practices (Chater 2003:3). This brings up the larger point that rural enterprises, although they may be physically remote, are connected to thenational economy\u2014and increasingly to the global economy\u2014and therefore subject to macroeconomic and governancepolicies originating far from the village level. (See Box 4.5.) Without pro-poor policy changes at these higher levels, theability of the poor to deploy their ecosystem resources forgreater income will be greatly attenuated. For example, nationalfisheries ministries typically concentrate their attention and CHAPTER 4 FOUR STEPS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 109110WORLD RESOURCES 2005 budgets on industrial fisheries, ignoring the small-scale fisheries that the poor rely on. Without changing this dynamic, the poorwill find their attempts at better ecosystem managementfrustrated by official inattention. Likewise, without high-levelaction to make credit and other financial services available forsmall rural enterprises, the poor will find it hard to capitalize ontheir governance and management successes. On the other hand, this chapter shows that governments can create a foundation for greater environmental income byproviding incentives for nature-based enterprises, empoweringthe poor by granting legally binding resource rights, andfostering responsive local institutions. In fact, as the casestudies in Chapter 5 show, a high-level political commitmentto expanding environmental income through local empower-ment is crucial to scaling up village-level successes. When thishappens, region-wide improvements in management practiceand governance can occur that provide the poor a first step ineconomic advancement. /orn8flip jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 110THE CURRENT WAVE OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION has lifted many people out of poverty and enhanced human welfare.But the benefits of globalization have not yet reached far enough: overthree billion people still live impoverished lives, and the fields, fisheries,forests, and waterways they depend on are increasingly at risk. As the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment points out, the transfor- mation of ecosystems over the past five decades dwarfs thecumulative impact over the preceding centuries. This degradationis undercutting rural livelihoods (MA 2005:2). Half of all jobsworldwide depend on agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Yet agricul-tural subsidies and other import restrictions in developed countriesmake it difficult for developing country farmers to compete on theworld market (WTO 2003:10, 22). Improving this situation will require better and smarter globaliza- tion. Ultimately, a sophisticated market economy is the onlymechanism capable of generating lasting prosperity. Market-basedapproaches, where informed by socially and environmentallyresponsible public policy, have also been effective in forgingsolutions to some environmental problems. Emissions trading hasbeen successful in reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, andtradable fishing quotas have reduced over-fishing (Aulisi al. 2004:92; Ellerman et al. 2000:315; NRC1999:192). Innovative approaches are being used to assign value,and hence to protect, \"ecosystem services\"\u2014from crops andfisheries to water filtration and flood prevention. All of these needto happen in ways that rural people can participate in and benefitfrom\u2014which will only happen if they have a degree of control overthe process and the ecosystem \"assets.\" The public equity markets steer billions of dollars every day to compa- nies and projects around the world. While often inadvertent, thisallocation of capital all too often hastens the loss of forests, fisheries,and watersheds, and underwrites the build-up of greenhouse gases inthe atmosphere. To counter this trend, many private banks havecommitted to the \"Equator Principles,\" which incorporate social andenvironmental criteria in investment decision-making. Major corpora-tions are investing in environmentally cleaner technology becausethey are convinced it will increase their profits and make them moreinternationally competitive. In the energy sector, the InternationalEnergy Agency estimates that US$16 trillion will be required forglobal infrastructure investment over the next twenty-five years (IEA2004:383). Redirecting this massive capital flow to clean energy andtransport systems could reduce poverty, increase security, and stabi-lize greenhouse gas emissions. To be pro-poor, investors and borrowers need to incorporate environ- mental sustainability in their activities. The developers of power, oil,gas, and mining projects will need to do a better job of managingrisks to human health, as well as damage to rivers, fisheries, and other ecosystems. Borrowers from the Equator banks may have todrop or change their plans to meet environmental standards, as wasdone in many of ABN AMRO's projects last year. However, whilesteering private investment in pro-poor directions is critical, it cannotachieve the desired outcome where bad governance is pervasive. Private investment in hydrocarbons and other extractive industries has sometimes been associated with corruption, environmentaldegradation, social dislocation, and impoverishment. Changing thiswill require more transparency, public participation, and accounta-bility. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),launched by the British government, is already proving successful.Royal Dutch Shell and BP have agreed to disclose detailed paymentinformation on their oil operations in Nigeria and Azerbaijan, respec-tively. Investors representing over US$7 trillion have endorsed EITI,and civil-society organizations are using EITI as an instrument forgovernment accountability. Endorsement of EITI by G-8 nations andoil-producing countries would make a decisive difference to the livesof the poor who live in the 60 countries that depend on oil, gas, andmining revenues (Soros 2005:43). Economic globalization has led to a host of technologies that can aid efficient market functioning, promote sound governance ofnatural resources, and protect the interests of the poor. Low-costenvironmental data collection using remote sensing and high-resolution satellite mapping is one example. Tracking andmonitoring devices are helping to reduce over-exploitation offisheries. In Malaysia conservationists use satellite transmitters tokeep count of elephants (WWF 2005). Rural Indian farmers withhigh-speed Internet receive online updates about market pricesand weather, making them more competitive (Annamalai and Rao2003:1). Increasingly low-cost and accessible technologies arebeginning to measure trends in deforestation, soil erosion, andclimate change. India, China, and Brazil have launched their ownsatellites, and are sharing data with other developing countries.Hopefully, it will not be long before existing databases\u2014includingpoverty maps and maps of ecosystem services\u2014can be overlaidroutinely on the sites of proposed mining operations, timberharvests, or industrial plants to identify how these developmentsmight affect poor families in the region. A smarter approach to economic globalization can work when the poor are empowered through access to information, participation, andjustice, and when they have legally recognized resource rights thatallow them to manage, sell, rent, and invest in ecosystem services. Bypartnering with the private sector to make credit available for ecosys-tem-based enterprises, and by improving the marketing and transportof goods produced, the poor can gain income and benefit from thewider marketplace that globalization affords. /orn8flipBOX 4.5 GLOBALIZATION, GOVERNANCE, AND POVERTY 111jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:33 PM Page 111Each situation faced by the rural poor is unique, but the desire for better lives\u2014materially, culturally, and spiritually\u2014 is universal.jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 112TURNINGNATURALASSETS INTO WEALTH In World Resources 2005 we have argued that environmental income is the wealth of the poor, with the potential to provide not just subsistence but a path out of poverty if the right gover-nance conditions p revail. In many communities, this argument is borne out every day , in on-the-ground, village-level experience. he five case studies in this chapter come from far-flung parts of the world\u2014communities in different physical environments and with different histories and cultural values. In each case, apoor rural community shows us how it has learned to restore and manage its local ecosystemsfor greater production, and how it has turned these natural assets into higher household income.But the heart of these stories is how communities have tried to meet the challenge of democraticgovernance. These cases are testaments to the difficulty and rewards of pursuing community-based natural resource management that is inclusive of the poor. Finally , these studies remindus that each situation faced by the rural poor is unique, but that the desire for better lives\u2014materially , culturally , and spiritually\u2014is universal.

Namibia's establishment of conservancies is among the most successful efforts by developing nations to decentralizenatural resource management and simultaneously combatpoverty . In fact, it is one of the largest-scale demonstrations ofso-called \"community-based natural resource management\"(CBNRM) and the state-sanctioned of localcommunities. Most conservancies are run by elected committeesof local people, to whom the government devolves user rightsover wildlife within the conservancy boundaries. Technical assistance in managing the conservancy is provided by govern-ment officials and local and international nongovernmentalorganizations (NGOs). In late 2004, 31 conservancies wereoperating on 7.8 million hectares of desert, savannah, andwoodlands occupied by 98,000 people. Fifty more were in devel-opment (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:iv). Still in their infancy , Namibia's conservancies have their critics and remain to date imperfect vehicles of local democracyand poverty alleviation. Their active membership can be limited,for example, and wildlife user rights are vested in committees, not directly in village households. Yet they have already deliveredclear benefits for both wildlife and people. Zebra, oryx, kudu,and springbok populations are rebounding in many locations,and cash, jobs, and game meat are flowing to communities. Lesstangible but equally important gains include the strengthening oflocal institutions and governance, women's empowerment, andgreater community cohesion. A New Idea for Wildlife Management Namibia is a strikingly beautiful country of desert dunes,woodland savannah, open plains, and river valleys. Its small butgrowing population of 1.8 million people is highly dependenton natural resources for food and livelihoods. Large areas,primarily in the wildlife-rich plains of the north, are commu-nally managed by more than a dozen different ethnic tribes. In the apartheid era, when Namibia was governed by South Africa, game animals were declared protected, state-owned assets\u2014a policy that discouraged those who inhabitedcommunal areas from joining in conservation efforts (WWF andRossing Foundation 2004:29). By the early 1980s ecosystemswere rapidly deteriorating in the north, with rampant poachingThe Case for Namibia's ConservanciesNATURE IN LOCAL HANDS HEN NAMIBIA GAINED INDEPENDENCE IN 1990, TEENAGER PASCOLENA FLORR Y WAS herding goats in the country's dry , desolate northern savannah. Her job, unpaid and dangerous, was to protect her parents' livestock from preying jackals and leopards. She saw wildlife as the enemy , and many of the other indigenous inhabitantsof Namibia's rural communal lands shared her view. Wildlife poaching was commonplace. Fifteen years later, 31-year-old Pascolena's life and outlook are very different. She has built a previously undreamed-of career in tourism and is the first black Namibian to be appointed manager of a guest lodge. Her village, and hundreds of others, have directly benefited from government efforts to devolveWjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 114115NATURE IN LOCAL HANDS of elephant ivory and rhino horn and severe over-use of drought-prone land. Populations of Namibia's world-renownedwildlife, including the desert elephant, endangered black rhino,zebra, lion, impala, and oryx, plummeted. In the mid-1980s an innovative anti-poaching program devel- oped by Namibian conservationist Garth Owen-Smith provided anearly template for community-based conservation. He won the trustof traditional leaders in the Kunene region, who agreed to appointlocal people as community game guards and work with local NGOsto promote an increased sense of stewardship over wildlife (Long2001:6). Meanwhile, Namibia's Nature Conservation Department(now the Ministry of Environment and T ourism, or MET) had devolved wildlife user rights to white-owned freehold farms. Privatefarm owners were allowed to sustainably utilize animals for gamemeat, trophy hunting, and tourism (Weaver 2004). Following independence, these two models formed the basis of government action to extend the same kinds of userights that farm owners had enjoyed to those who lived oncommunal lands. The Nature Conservation Act of 1996enabled the establishment of conservancies\u2014legally gazettedareas within the state's communal lands\u2014through Namibia'sCommunity Based Natural Resource Management Programme.Within the communal areas the state devolved limited wildliferights to conservancy committees. These included rights to thehunting, capture, culling, and sale of \"huntable game\" (oryx,springbok, kudu, warthog, buffalo, and bushpig) and the right toapply to MET for permits to use quotas of protected game fortrophy hunting (Long 2004:33). To qualify , communities applying had to define the conservancy's boundary , elect a representative conservancycommittee, negotiate a legal constitution, prove the committee'sability to manage funds, and produce an acceptable plan forequitable distribution of wildlife-related benefits (Long 2004:33).Once approved, registered conservancies acquire the rights to a sustainable wildlife quotaset by the ministry . The animals can either besold to trophy hunting companies or huntedand consumed by the community . As legalentities, conservancies can also enter intocontracts with private-sector tourism operators. The first four conservancies were legally recognized in 1998. By October 2004, there were31, with 31,000 registered members spread acrosssix geographic regions. Conservancy committeeshad also set up 18 joint-venture agreements withprivate safari hunting and tour operators (WWFand Rossing Foundation 2004:iv) This rapid expansion can be traced to a combination of factors. Government leadershipand community enthusiasm were the primeingredients. But an equally crucial factor was astrong commitment from support organiza-tions. Collectively known as NACSO\u2014theNational Association of CBNRM Support Organisations\u2014these included the University of Namibia and12 national NGOs. The biggest support NGO, Integrated RuralDevelopment and Nature Conservation (IRDNC), works with 40conservancies in the wildlife-rich northern regions of Kuneneand Caprivi, codirected by Garth Owen-Smith and Dr.Margaret Jacobsohn. \"Local people decide themselves if they want to form a conservancy . No pressure is put on anyone,\" says Dr.Jacobsohn. \"Our experience is that a small group of peoplehear about the opportunities conservancies offer\u2014on theradio, from MET neighboring 'task force,' driving their communitytowards conservancy formation\" (Jacobsohn 2004). In 2004, total benefits flowing to conservancy communities, including employment income, cash from tourist fees and leases, and in-kindbenefits like game meat, reached N$14.1 million (US$2.5 million). Conservancy-related activities, including tourism, have provided 547full-time and 3,250 part-time jobs since 1998. Women's livelihoods and status have improved. Women fill almost 3,000of the new part-time jobs, and more than half the full-time posts. Theymake up 50 percent of conservancy members, constitute 30 percent ofconservancy committee members, and chair three conservancies. Seven of the program's 12 support NGOs are now black-led (comparedwith none in 1995). In 2003, conservancies and CBNRM support enterprises contributed anestimated N$79 million (US$9.6 million) to Namibia's Net National Income,and this contribution is expected to rise rapidly in the years ahead. IN BRIEF: CONSERVANCY BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE Source: WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:v-vijp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 115116WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Some communities go it alone, while others seek help from ministry officials or a NACSO organization to holdpublic meetings, write a constitution, elect managementcommittees, and consult households living within proposedconservancy borders. Not all resident adults need to sign upfor a conservancy to be approved, but many communitymeetings are held in an effort to draw in all stakeholders. \" Atsome point,\" says Dr Jacobsohn, \"MET officials or the supportNGO, if there is one, try to verify on the ground that there ismajority support for the conservancy\" (Jacobsohn 2004). Theentire process takes two to three years (WWF and RossingFoundation 2004:30). While the success of Namibia's conservancies is depend- ent on local peoples' enthusiasm and commitment, themovement has also been significantly bankrolled by interna-tional donors. By late 2004, the development agencies of theUnited States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and theNetherlands, as well as the World Bank and the EuropeanUnion, had spent N$464 million on the effort to build anational community-based natural resource managementprogram (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:17). By 2004 this investment had begun to show strong economic results. Five of the longest-running conservancies\u2014Torra, Uibasen, Nyae Nyae, Marienfluss, and more are on track to becomeso in 2005 (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:v). Conservancy Winners: Wildlife, Communities, Women Wildlife Renaissance Perhaps the most striking benefits of Namibia's experiment in people-led natural resource management are to wildlife.Populations of elephant, zebra, oryx, and springbok have risenseveral fold in many conservancies as poaching and illegalhunting has fallen. Northwest Namibia now boasts the world'slargest free-roaming population of black rhino, while game inthe large Nyae Nyae Conservancy have increased six-foldsince 1995. In Caprivi's eastern floodplains, seasonal migra-tions of game between Botswana and Namibia have resumedfor the first time since the early 1970s (WWF and RossingFoundation 2004:v) Income and jobs from tourism, lucrative sport hunting of trophy animals, and community hunting quotas havecombined to make wildlife more attractive to communities asa managed resource than as a poaching prospect. To attractwildlife, and reduce conflict with humans, improved manage-ment techniques have also included new water holes forelephants, protection of domestic and livestock water sourcesfrom elephants, and land-use zoning to separate designatedwildlife habitat from village and cropping areas (Long 2001:9)In some areas, including the Nyae Nyae, Uukwaluudhi, andSalambala Conservancies, game animals have also been successfully reintroduced (Barnes 2004:4). According to Chris Weaver, director of the Windhoek-based WWF-LIFE conservancy program, which funds several NACSOgroups, these gains indicate \"a massive shift in the attitudes ofcommunal area residents towards wildlife. The strong embrace-ment of the conservancy movement demonstrates a willingnessand desire to incorporate wildlife into rural livelihoods, as they arenow viewed as an asset to livelihoods\" (Weaver 2004). Namibia's conservancies have significantly altered the country's land-use landscape\u2014to the benefit of biodiversity .Eighteen registered conservancies sit alongside or betweennational parks or protected game reserves. This facilitates thesafe, seasonal movement of wildlife between parks and communal lands and adds an extra 55,192 km 2of compatible land use to Namibia's protected area network of 114,080 km2. Conservancies have also successfully adapted their traditionalland-use pattern of subsistence activities\u2014such as livestockgrazing and dryland farming\u2014to incorporate new tourismopportunities. Many , for example, have set aside large,dedicated wildlife areas for tourism and for sport or communityhunting (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:iv).Indonesia suffers the world's largest annual loss of forest cover. Namibia's best-known conservancy is wildlife-rich Torra, which borders the celebrated Skeleton Coast Park. Registered in 1998, it covers352,000 hectares of plains and rugged mountains in southern Kunene. Benefits for the mixed community of Riemvasmakkers, Damaras, Herero,and Owambo, who live in the conservancy include cash payouts, jobs,game meat, and livestock protection measures such as new waterpoints and electric fencing. Elderly residents have also receivedChristmas packages, including hats, scarves, socks, and blankets(Long 2001:16-17, Baker 2003:2). The conservancy currently earns N$750,000 a year and has taken inenough revenue to cover its own running costs since 2000 (Long et al.2004:19). In January 2003, Torra's conservancy committee distributedN$630 in cash (US$73) to every conservancy member over 18. Thisamounted to approximately half of the average annual income inconservancy households (USAID 2005:3). Torra Conservancy has generated considerable income\u2014about N$1.5million as of October 2003\u2014from ecotourism, trophy hunting, andsales of live game. Ecotourism activities include Damaraland Camp, aluxury lodge staffed entirely by local tribespeople. Damaraland Campis a joint venture between Torra's conservancy committee and privatetour operator Wilderness Safaris (Vaughan et al. 2004:2). In 2004 Torra Conservancy won the Equator Initiative Prize awarded bythe United Nations Development Programme for outstanding communityprojects that reduce poverty through sustainable use of biodiversity.TORRA CONSERVANCY: EQUATOR INITIATIVE 2004 AWARD WINNERjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 116117Reducing Poverty, Empowering People Benefits for human populations are also clear-cut, although they vary among conservancies. Over 95,000 Namibians havereceived benefits of some kind since 1998, according to theUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID),a funder and supporter of the conservancy effort (USAID2005:1). These benefits include jobs, training, game meat, cashdividends, and social benefits such as school improvements orwater supply maintenance funded by conservancy revenue(WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:43). In 2004 total income from the CBNRM program nation- wide reached N$14.1 million, up from N$1.1 million in 1998. Ofthis, N$7.25 million was distributed across communities in theform of cash dividends and social programs, with the rest earnedby individual households through wages from conservancy-related jobs and enterprises. Tourist lodges, camps, guideservices, and related businesses such as handicraft locals full-time and 3,250 part-time. In all, 18conservancies received substantial cash income, averaging N$217,046 in 2004 (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:v,43). Community hunting quotas provide another important direct benefit. Game meat distribution has proved highlypopular with communities, providing both prized meat and asense of community autonomy (Long 2001:9). In each conservancy , once revenues are being generated (often within two years of registration), the membership andcommittee choose how to spend the conservancy's income anddistribute benefits. Some opt for cash payouts to members orhouseholds. In January 2003, for example, Torra gave eachadult conservancy member the equivalent of US$73. Othersfund services such as school classrooms, new water pumps, ordiesel fuel for operating pumps (USAID 2005:3). A 2002 World Bank study of 1192 households in Caprivi and Kunene found benefits spread equitably across conservancymembers. In Kunene the researchers recorded a healthy 29percent increase in per capita income due to the combined direct and indirect effects of community-basednatural resource management, and that did notinclude non-financial benefits such as bush meat(Bandyopadhyay et al. 2004:16,13). These findingssuggest Namibia's conservancies are starting to playa significant role in fighting rural poverty . Positive Gender Agenda Conservancies are also having a major impact onwomen's empowerment and well-being. By 2004,women made up half of all conservancy members,and three in ten management committee members.They had also captured the majority of new jobsgenerated, boosting both their income and socialstatus. At luxury Damaraland Camp in TorraConservancy , for example, over 75 percent ofemployees are women (Florry 2004). \"These are local people who would never have found jobs anywhere else,\" says Pascolena Florry , whose ownhorizons expanded dramatically as she worked her wayup from waitressing to camp manager. \"The conser-vancy has given them training and skills and increased 010020003000400050006000 1995 1998 2004Number of Environmen t and Tourism (aerial census ) FIGURE 1 WILDLIFE RECOVERY IN NYAE NYAE CONSERVANCY jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 117118their self esteem and sense of worth.\" Before tourism developed, she recalls, opportunities for paid work were almost nonexistent. \"Igrew up in a small village. The goats were our only income andthere was no one to protect them from wild animals, so that is whatI used to do. Life is better now. My family has more money , we areable to do more things\" (Florry 2004). Empowerment The shift in power to local communities, after decades ofcentralized power, has also produced intangible benefits.Foremost among these are a greater decision-making role forcitizens, a deepened sense of community , and growing pride inwildlife recovery and conservancy success. The process of managing a new democratic institution has empowered those taking part, and given them new skills.Officials from the NGOs and MET train and mentor newlyelected committee members on priority setting, decision-making, and conflict mediation (USAID 2005:5). Inhigh-membership conservancies such as village house-holds are also very involved in decision-making. \"Peopleunderstand that this is an opportunity that was not there previ-ously . They feel conservancies give them power over how totake care of the animals...and a chance for a better future,\"says Paula Adams, Torra's community liaison officer. \"Theyattend our meetings and tell us they want to build more touristcamps. If something is happening that's against the conser-vancy's interests, they report it. For example, if a farm's waterpipes are damaged by elephants, they tell us, so we can go andfix it\" (Adams 2004). Citizens also come up with solutions and priorities that inform the Torra committee's actions. When problem animals became anissue, with lions killing livestock, local farmers requested a new,secure breeding station rather than cash compensation. Theconservancy is now building one. A 2002 household survey 0481216 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004Million Namibian DollarsMeat and Other Non-Wage Benefits Wage Income to Households Cash Income to Conservancy Committees FIGURE 2 CONSERVANCY BENEFITS, 1994-2004jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 118119NATURE IN LOCAL HANDS revealed that members \"wanted to see a healthy community with healthy people,\" says Adams. The conservancy responded by start-ing HIV/AIDS workshops and distributing leaflets and condoms. Active members across Namibia's conservancies also play a hands-on role in natural resource management. They collect andanalyze wildlife population data, using a simple, standardizedrecording system, and conservancy committees apply thefindings to management activities. This people-led monitoringhas been so successful that it is now being introduced in nationalparks and protected areas in Zambia, Mozambique, andBotswana (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:vi). Conservancy Failings Despite their well-documented benefits, h owever, Namibia's conservancies remain a work in progress. Three issues, in partic-ular, are raising concerns within the government, donor, andNGO communities. The first is that the ad hoc manner inwhich some conservancies distribute their benefits does notalways favor the poorest households. The second is that limitedparticipation in conservancies is hampering genuine local gover-nance and empowerment. The third is that the recovery ofwildlife populations has increased the number of natural preda-tors of the livestock upon which many conservancy householdsdepend. A deeper, more structural problem is the limited natureof local rights, with conservancy residents denied full propertyor tenure rights. Despite periodic discussion of land reform,ownership of all communal lands is retained by the govern-ment, in a holdover from colonial times.Limits to Poverty Alleviation Every conservancy must produce a plan for equitably distribut-ing benefits before it is registered by the government. In theory ,the Ministry of Environment and Tourism could de-register aconservancy that violated this policy . But in practice, there is noblueprint for what constitutes \"equitable\" sharing of benefits,leaving conservancies to go their own way . Some specificallytarget poorer, more vulnerable households; others do not.Some spend revenue on social services such as school equip-ment or water supply maintenance, others on cash payouts.Some only distribute benefits to registered conservancymembers, others to all households. To promote self-governance, NACSO support organisa- tions encourage communities to set their own priorities. ChrisWeaver, WWF-LIFE program director, acknowledges this cancreate teething problems. \"In some cases there has been a push-pull between wealthier households, who own livestock, and willhave to give up grazing land for wildlife management, andpoorer households who will benefit a lot more from conservancy-generated cash handouts than better-off households.\" He insists,however, that communities must run their own affairs if conser- vancies are to succeed long-term. \"We don't prescribe. Webelieve the committees should make their own mistakes, learnfrom them, and adjust the next year\" (Weaver 2004). This laissez faire approach, h owever, was criticized by an international panel of social scientists that in March 2004 urgedNamibia's government to ensure benefits were targeted to the TABLE 1 CONSERVANCY INCOME BREAKDOWN, 2003 Sources of Cash and In-Kind Income to Conservancies and Their Members, By Percentage Community-based tourism enterprises and campsites 36%Joint venture tourism 27% Trophy hunting 17%Thatching grass sales sales 4%Game meat distribution 3%Game game Page 119120poor. On the basis of an intensive three-year study covering eight conservancies, known as the WILD report, they recommendedthat the Ministry of Environment and Tourism: give conservancies strict guidelines on equitable distribution encourage them to target benefits to pre-identified groups ofpoor people help committees review whether their existing conservancymembership provided a fair basis for benefit distribution adopt a \"pro-poor\" national tourism policy , focusing onconservancy-based developments that \"contribute directly topoverty reduction, enhanced livelihood security , and socialempowerment\" (Long 2004:xvii). Limits to Local Governance A second major challenge facing Namibia's conservancies istheir democratic deficit. Many local people do not registerthemselves as conservancy members or vote for committeemembers. Although typically a majority of in-boundary adultsjoin up, the WILD report identified several conservancies witha minority membership. A 2002 survey of a thousand house-holds in seven conservancies found that only 34 percentidentified themselves as \"conservancy participants\"(Bandyopadhyay et al. 2004:15). In addition, the 1996 legislation originating conservancies vests legal ownership rights over wildlife in managementcommittees, not directly in the conservancy membership.Conservancy committees are elected by the membership andhence are clearly meant to be directly accountable to conser-vancy members, but there is no legal obligation for thisenshrined at the national level (Long 2004:35). Limited participation in a conservancy's membership and activities can contribute to other problems, such as slow distri-bution of cash and meat to resident families. Even flagship Torra Conservancy did not make any cash payouts to membersuntil January 2003, three years after it became financiallyindependent (Baker 2003:1). In some conservancies there is also evidence that more highly educated community members disproportionatelycontrol management committees. Field researchers for theWILD project, working in eight conservancies in Caprivi andKunene, also found that people employed in conservancy-based tourism tended to come from wealthier local families(Long 2004:17). On the other hand, the 2002 World Bankresearch team found no evidence that social elites were captur-ing a bigger slice of benefits than other community members.\"In Caprivi there was some evidence that poor householdsbenefited more than richer ones, whereas in Kunene we foundthat benefit distribution was poverty-neutral, with everybodybenefiting equally ,\" said Kirk Hamilton, lead economist at theWorld Bank Environment Department (Hamilton 2004). According to Margaret Jacobsohn, high-handed behavior by wealthier residents has mainly been a problem duringconservancy development. \"In one area, an elite group blockeda conservancy for two years until a locally constituted DisputeResolution Committee helped resolve the situation. A conser-vancy has since been registered, with a democratically electedcommittee that represents the whole community .\" Whileacknowledging that the conservancy movement is \"a long wayfrom perfect democracy ,\" Jacobsohn remains optimistic. \"Thetechnical support providers\u2014NGOs and government\u2014areconstantly adjusting to ensure that as much power as possible isdevolved to the local, household level. It's an evolutionaryprocess, improving year by year\" (Jacobsohn 2004). Some government officials have argued that every adult resident should automatically receive conservancy member-ship. But NACSO organizations have resisted, arguing thatcommunity-based management will only work if citizens accept jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 120121responsibilities as well as rights (Jacobsohn 2004). Nevertheless, expert criticism of the limits to community participation isgrowing. The 2004 WILD report, submitted to the Ministry ofEnvironment and Tourism, argued that higher membershiplevels were essential to increase pressure on committees to actcompetently , distribute benefits efficiently and equitably , andtake actions approved by a majority of residents. While praising the conservancies' achievements, the WILD report bluntly concluded that \"the extent to whichrural people will continue to support conservancies...depends on them gaining a stronger voice in local decision-making. The requirement now is to shift attention tosupporting local capacity to address improved participation,and, in so doing, develop a more inclusive approach toplanning that specifically addresses issues of livelihoodsecurity and diversification at household level, particularlyfor poorer groups\" (Long 2004:9, 12). Sensitive to such criticisms, NACSO and the Ministry of Environment and Tourism have drawn up plans to strengthenparticipatory democracy across conservancies. Performanceindicators, to help residents and support organisations measurecommittee performance and hold management committees toaccount, are also in the works. \"Getting more involvement fromthe community membership and more transparency in how aconservancy operates will be a key focus over the next fiveyears,\" asserts Chris Weaver. Practical proposals includedelegating decision-making down to the village level instead ofconservancy committees, increasing information flow byposting regular financial and other bulletins in public locations,and making annual committee meetings more transparent(Weaver 2004). Wildlife-People Conflict While tourism based on the attraction of Namibia's majesticwild animals has brought undisputed benefits, the recovery ofwildlife populations is not without trade-offs. Livestock inKunene, and crops in Caprivi, are still the main breadwinnersfor many conservancy households. Tension is growing in someareas as cattle, goats, and crops succumb in increasing numbersto predators or marauding elephants. In Caprivi, for example,average crop losses equal 20 percent of local households'average annual income. Research suggests that poorer familiessuffer the most, which undermines the anti-poverty efforts ofconservancies. It also encourages illegal, low-level wildlifepoaching for food, a pr oblem especially prevalent among poorer households (Long 2004:xxi). Although the Ministry of Environment and Tourism acknowledges rising human-wildlife conflicts, it has no policyon how institutions should deal with the problem. In 2003IRDNC (a support NGO) took action by successfully piloting acompensation scheme in four Kunene and Caprivi conservan-cies for households that had lost livestock to predators. In 2005the compensation schemes will be extended to cover elephant-induced crop damage in some conservancies (Jacobsohn 2004).A related problem, likely to get more urgent as wildlife numbers rise, is lack of land tenure. Unlike white-ownedfreehold farms, conservancies cannot bar outsiders from bring-ing their animals to graze on communal lands within theirboundaries, even though this causes pressure on resources usedby local wildlife and livestock. In Torra, for example, theconservancy committee zoned land for wildlife and tourism useand developed internal rules to regulate grazing access on thisland. But livestock farmers from outside the conservancysimply ignored these rules, and continued to assert their openaccess grazing rights (Long 2004:148). The conservancy's lackof full property rights prevents it from legally excluding them. Practice Makes Perfect: Sustaining and Reforming Namibia's Conservancies The very success of Namibia's community-based natural resource management program is producing enormous,some say unrealistic, expectations for the future. With anestimated 100,000 people actively supporting the registrationof 40-50 new conservancies, one in every nine Namibiansmay soon live in a communal area conservancy (WWF andRossing Foundation 2004:iv). Namibia's government isanxious to use this expanding network of citizen-led localgovernance institutions as a broad vehicle for rural develop-ment in a poor nation. In 2001 new legislation made provision for community- run forests, managed by community bodies (includingconservancies) with ownership rights over forest products. In2003 new freshwater fisheries laws allowed community institu-tions, including conservancies, to assume management of localfisheries (WWF and Rossing Foundation 2004:13). The govern-ment is also encouraging conservancies to diversify into including HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 121122WORLD RESOURCES 2005 But some NGOs caution that conservancies should not take on responsibility for implementing government programsor move too far from their original conservation objectives. AsChris Weaver sees it, \"Conservancies were developed as aconservation initiative with spin-off benefits for development.They are contributing significantly to national income, butthey are not going to solve all the poverty or rural developmentproblems of Namibia\" (Weaver 2004). Conservancies also remain far from self-sufficient, with most still dependent on donor support. Of the more than 40established and fledgling conservancies that IRDNC assists,only two are self-financing, although a majority are expectedto be independent or earning significant income by 2010.While joint-venture tourism and sport hunting offer the bestrevenue-generating opportunities, they still provide a minorityof jobs in most conservancies. Experts see a strong need todiversify livelihood options, especially among poor families, toavoid over-reliance on tourist income (WWF and RossingFoundation 2004:44-45). At the political level, pressure is also growing on govern- ment ministers to institute land reforms that will increase thesecurity and long-term viability of conservancies by grantingtenure to residents of communal lands. The WILD reportrecommended to Namibia's government that securingcommunity tenure over conservancies was \"a necessary stepin strengthening conservancies' rights and authority withrespect to resource use and allocation.\" Such rights wereneeded, the authors argued, to give conservancy committeeslegal grounds for excluding outside livestock herds which weredepleting conservancy resources and revenues (Long2004:157). New regional Communal Land Boards, to beestablished under the Communal Lands Act 2003, may provide a vehicle for land reform, as both conservancies and tradi- tional authorities will appoint representatives alongside thoseof various government departments. The boards will beresponsible for granting land-use leases, but their full respon-sibilities and the influence that conservancies may wield onthem are yet to become clear (Long 2004:157). To address all these challenges and expectations, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, USAID, and WWFlaunched a new five-year plan in October 2004 that aims tomake most conservancies self-sustaining, with a broader ruraldevelopment role, by 2009. Chris Weaver summarizes theapproach as \"an expanded conservation strategy with add-onbenefits for development.\" Conservancies will be encouraged toexpand beyond tourism and wildlife use into forestry , fisheries,Decentralization Can Bring Benefits. Devolving power over wildlife management to the local level can increase the local stake in goodmanagement, bringing benefits to both wildlife and local economies. Thesuccess of Namibia's decentralization effort was aided by grounding itfirmly in law\u2014the 1996 Nature Conservation Act\u2014and through theactive promotion by government, donors, and NGOs. Conservation Benefits Follow Livelihood Benefits. Conservancies gain broad support and community compliance when they demonstrate aconnection with greater income. Benefits to wildlife, in the form ofreduced poaching, follow quickly. A combination of short-term commu-nity benefits such as bush meat and cash payouts may be necessary aslonger term development gains such as better infrastructure and a morediverse local economy slowly manifest. Targeting the Poor Takes Work. Conservancies have a fairly good record in terms of the equity of benefits distribution. But many need help inmore directly targeting benefits to the poor. Performance indicators anddistribution guidelines for conservancy committees may help. Tenure Remains a Challenge. Devolution of user rights to wildlife may not be enough to sustainably manage conservancies over the long termor to maximize poverty reduction. Granting conservancies fuller tenurerights would give them the ability to better control access to conservancylands, more effectively manage grazing pressures, and reduce conflicts. Direct Accountability Needed. Conservancies can capitalize on their proven record and increase their broadbased support by making localconservancy committees more fully accountable and working to giveconservancy members a stronger voice in decisions. Increasing theproportion of local community members that identify themselves asconservancy members is one important element of long-term viability. Mature Institutions Take Time. Building the technical and governing capacity of local institutions such as conservancy committees takes timeand requires steady financial and technical support. Local NGOsspecially constituted to play this support role can play a vital part ininstitution-building, and in helping to construct and execute a workablebusiness model for conservancy enterprises.LEARNING 5:34 PM Page 122123water management, and sustainable farming, and to use the income gained to invest in other enterprises such as smallsupport businesses. In six short years, Namibia's conservancies have developed from a hopeful experiment to the cornerstone of governmentplans to reform the management of the country's unique naturalresource base. For local support NGOs, howev er, the central focus for the next five years will be on improving conservancygovernance and participation. On the front line in Kunene, Dr. Jacobsohn is clear that financial self-sufficiency alone will not guarantee long-termsuccess for the conservancy movement. \"Earning income is not thehardest part. It is learning to run a local institution effectively andefficiently that is the biggest challenge. We are requiring remoterural dwellers, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers, tomanage not just wildlife, but also staff, an office, and a vehicle. Weare asking them to stick to a constitution, be transparent, commu-nicate with members\u2014do everything that managing a democraticinstitution involves. These are the conditions towards whichNGOs are aiming so that we are no longer required.\" /orn8flip jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:34 PM Page 123124 which has funded 145 projects in 24 districts, successfully mobilizing villagers to regenerate land through tree-plantingand wa ter and soil conservation (D'Souza and Lobo 2004:3). One of the program's more dramatic success stories is Darewadi village, in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra's mostdrought-prone district. As recently as 1996, the main villageand its twelve hamlets were on the verge of desertification.Scarce rainfall supported only 3-4 months of agriculturalactivity a year, forcing villagers to migrate in search ofseasonal work for the rest of the year. Today , farm-basedemployment is available 9-10 months of the year, and agricul-tural wages have doubled. More crop varieties are now growndue to extensive new irrigation, and the value of cultivatedland has quadrupled (WOTR 2002:4). Before the watershed was regenerated, Darewadi's 921 residents depended on water deliveries from a tanker truck fromApril to July . Yet in summer 2004 the village was tanker-free,despite receiving only 350 mm of rain in 2003\u2014100 mm lessthan its annual average (WOTR 2005). Inhabitants have also gained in less tangible ways from the self-organization that has driven their village's revival. Theyhave learned new skills and found new social cohesion. TheDarewadi project and similar experiments are not perfect: therole of women can be limited, and landless people may not share equally in the benefits. Nevertheless, Darewadi'sundoubted success provides one encouraging model for people-led sustainable development in arid regions, where many of theworld's poor live. Pioneering People-Led Watershed Management In the 1980's, the Indian government shifted its approach to watershed management in drought-afflicted rural areas.Traditional bureaucratic, top-down projects had often failed dueto lack of consultation with or buy-in from local people. In aneffort to increase success rates, the government began to encour-age programs based on smaller, people-led projects. Amongthese was the Indo-German Watershed Development Program,launched in 1992. Co-founded by Father Hermann Bacher, a Jesuit priest, the IGWDP is funded by the German government through theGerman Agency for Technical Cooperation and the GermanBank for Reconstruction. It is implemented by an independent,state-wide NGO, the Watershed Organization Trust (WOTR), inIn Darewadi VillageMORE WATER, MORE WEALTH IN DROUGHT-PLAGUED MAHARASHTRA, GOOD WATER MANAGEMENT IS A MATTER OF LIFE and death. Small-scale farmers in the Indian state are dependent on infrequent rainfall to maintain their fields, livestock, and f orest- based livelihoods. During the dry season, drinking water is so scarce that supplies are trucked into thousands of villages (D'Souz a and Lobo 2004:2). In recent years, development initiatives in the region have focused on village-led wa tershed management activities , aimed at conserving natural resources and improving livelihoods. Among these is the Indo-German Watershed Development Program (IGWDP),Ijp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM Page 124125partnership with the Indian government's National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). The program funds village-based, participatory watershed development projects, with communities chosen for their lowrainfall, geographical position\u2014generally within primary watercatchment areas\u2014and social composition. Villages where a fewfamilies dominate land ownership are disqualified on thegrounds that such power imbalances would deter consensus ondeveloping local land to the benefit of all. To qualify , villagesmust agree to temporary bans on tree-cutting and grazing onland designated for regeneration. They must also contribute freelabor\u2014a common rural practice known as shramdan \u2014to cover at least 15-20 percent of project costs (D'Souza and Lobo2004:4; Lobo and D'Souza 2003:9). Capacity-building is the program's first priority . In each community , a Village Watershed Committee of local residents isnominated, usually by the village assembly , to make and imple-ment decisions. Villagers also work on a pilot project, learningwater and soil conservation techniques, with WOTR or anotherlocal NGO providing training, technical organizational, andfinancial support. After 12 to 18 months, NABARD assumesproject oversight, funding scaled-up watershed activitiesdesigned by and delivered through the village committee, againwith local NGO support (Lobo and D'Souza 2003:6, 15). By late 2004, the Indo-German Watershed Development Program had spent US$21.9 million funding projects on165,439 hectares of land, occupied by some 190,000 people(D'Souza and Lobo 2004:3). After 12 years of first-hand \"a proven poverty reduction,augmentation of water resources, livelihood diversification,enhancing well-being, building social capital, and widening thedecision-making and opportunity space for women\" (D'Souzaand Lobo 2004:2). A Path Out of Poverty Many of these benefits are apparent in Darewadi, a formerlyimpoverished and despairing community that now generatesyear-round employment for a majority of inhabitants. Back in 1995, with farm work in short supply , Darewadi's 131 households were losing many men to far-flung seasonal workas sugarcane cutters or building laborers. Those who remainedoften herded sheep, further depleting grazing lands and drainingthe low water table. The village and its satellite hamlets weresurrounded by barren hills, and women walked miles to fetchwater and fuelwood. When Father Bacher visited at that time, heconcluded that if rejuvenation were possible in Darewadi, itwould be possible in any watershed (WOTR 2002:1). The Darewadi watershed covers 1,535 hectares. Two-thirds is privately owned; the rest is made up of common lands ownedby the Maharashtra state government's Forest Department(WOTR 2002:1). WOTR's first task was to overcome the mistrust of many villagers, especially sheep and goat farmers,including many poorer families, who feared that grazing bans onregenerating land would cut down the available fodder, harmingtheir already fragile livelihoods. Through a series of villagemeetings, the NGO explained how the temporary bans wouldallow trees to grow, eventually yielding more fodder and morewater for crops. A compromise was eventually agreed in the village assem- bly , or gram sabha, whereby land closure would proceed in phases as the conservation and planting work progressed and any viola-tors of the ban would pay a fine to the community . It was not aneasy compromise to reach, but the villagers were encouraged bythe prospect of increased income within a comparatively shortperiod. In addition, most livestock owners are also farmers, andtherefore not solely dependent on grazing for income. Anotherinducement to try the restoration plan came in the form oftechnical assistance from WOTR, which offered loans and train-ing to livestock owners who wanted to switch from sheep andgoats to high-yield milk cows (Lobo 2005c). Once the villagers had accepted the restoration scheme, WOTR helped them take the necessary official steps to gain statepermission and structure the project's management. First theyhelped the community negotiate a Joint Forest Managementagreement with the state Forest Department, legally grantinglocal people the right to work on the state-owned common landssurrounding Darewadi and to own the agricultural producegrown on these lands (Lobo 2005c). Without attention to thisquestion of land use and tenure on state forest lands, a regener-ation plan covering the entire watershed would not have beenpossible, nor would it have been economically attractive enoughto gain village support.MORE WATER, MORE WEALTH jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM Page 125Next, the gram sabha nominated 24 people to the Village Watershed Committee, which became the registered projectauthority , legally responsible for managing funds and overseeingdevelopment activities. The watershed committee includedrepresentatives from all social groups\u2014including landlesspeople and seven women\u2014and from every corner of thescattered community (WOTR 2002:2-3). This was essential,according to Lobo, to create an effective, trusted communityinstitution that could rule by consensus. \"What makes ourparticipatory approach work...is involving all stakeholders inarriving at negotiated outcomes that are beneficial or accept-able to all\"(Lobo 2005a). Members of the Village Watershed Committee were assigned tasks by the village assembly . Responsibilities includedmonitoring grazing bans, organizing paid and voluntary labor-ers, supervising work and wages, maintaining records, andimposing fines on villagers who broke agreed project rules.Committee members were unpaid, trained by WOTR, and heldaccountable for fulfilling their duties by the gram sabha (Lobo and D'Souza 2003:14-15). They also negotiated with local stake-holders, including the landless, on the specific areas of land tobe set aside for phased grazing bans and regeneration. Whenconflicts arose, they were settled by the committee, sometimesassisted by Forest Department officials, with WOTR taking aback seat (Lobo 2005c). The Rewards of Regeneration Five years of regeneration activities followed, including treeand grassland planting and sustainable crop cultivation. Soiland water conservation measures to nurture the regeneratingland included the construction of simple water harvesting andirrigation systems such as hillside contour trenches andrainwater-harvesting dams. The work was carried out by villagers themselves, follow- ing training by WOTR field staff in simple conservation-basedagricultural practices and management techniques such as landmeasurement and record-keeping. Wherever possible, theNGO worked with landowning couples, to boost women'sconfidence and involvement in andLobo 2004:5). Darewadi landowners also mentored byfarmers who had already successfully implemented watershedconservation measures in neighboring villages. Villagersdonated 17 percent of total labor costs and earned wages foradditional project-related work over and above their shramdan (WOTR 2002:2). The Darewadi project's costs were substantial, totaling 8.7 million rupees when the value of voluntary labor isfactored in (WOTR 2002:2). By 2001 the results were appar-ent. Barren hills and common lands covering 395 hectares hadbeen planted with trees and grasses, with a 65 percent survivalrate (D'Souza and Lobo 2004:6). Land under irrigationincreased from 197 to 342 hectares, with maize, wheat, andvegetables among successful new crops. Grass fodder forlivestock increased 170 percent as a result of the soil and 0100200300400500600700800900 1995 1996 1997 199 8 1999 2000-7-6-5-4-3-2-10 Aquifer Levels (meters below ground)Rainfall Aquifer Levels Source: Watershed Organization Trust 2005.

( SeeFigure 1 and Tables 1 and 2 .) In response to the grazing bans, many poorer households had sold their sheep and goats. Since the restrictions were liftedin 2001, h owever, livestock numbers ha ve rebounded. More plentiful fodder has also enabled villagers to raise morevaluable hybrid cows with high milk production. Higher-yieldcrops, milk sales, increased wages, and more days of availablework have resulted in a fivefold hike in the village's agriculturalincome ( see Figure 2 ). Signs of increased household wealth and well-being include the arrival of kitchen gardens and individ-ual latrines, as well as televisions, bicycles, and motorcycles. \"Our village has changed totally ,\" says Ramaji B. Phad, a Darewadi sheep owner. \"The hills are now covered with treeswhich we planted at the beginning. The water in wells and theground water level have increased. The average income of thefarmer has increased. People are now able to eat good food likewheat, rice, and dhal\" (WOTR 2002:5). Despite three years of drought since IGWDP funding ended in 2001, the project's benefits are continuing, testifyingto the effectiveness of the regeneration and the VillageWatershed Committee. The local water table has continued torise, as have supplies of livestock fodder and the volume of landunder irrigation. The availability of agricultural work andwage levels have held steady . In early 2005, 11 villagersacquired telephones (Lobo 2005c). The transition to self-sufficiency in 2001 was eased by the IGWDP returning to the community the cash equivalent of 50percent of the value of the village's voluntary labor. Thecommunity deposited the money in a maintenance fund forwatershed management activities. Contributions from villagersand penalties charged for rule-breaking are also used to top upthe fund, and WOTR continues to provide village businesseswith microfinance support (Lobo 2005b). Perhaps most important for the long term are the links that villagers have built up with local government officials.With a new sense of confidence based on their record ofachievement, they can now leverage these contacts to seek more development funding. \"Before we would not talk in frontof outsiders,\" explains Chimaji Kondaji, deputy chairman ofDarewadi's Village Watershed Committee. \"[Since the project]we get good cooperation from government departments, whowe now approach with ease\" (Lobo 2005b). Improving Women's Lot The increased availability of wells, subsistence crops, andfodder has reduced women's household labor significantly inDarewadi. Women are typically the chief providers of theirfamilies' water, food, fodder, and fuel needs. Women alsoearned cash as project laborers and have benefited fromdrudgery-reducing assets made possible by increased incomes,such as kitchen gardens and household toilets (Lobo andD'Souza 2003:16). However, as wo rk on watershed activities is almost year- round, compared with the seasonal nature of farming duties,many women now work longer hours than before the project.According to Crispino Lobo, \"women accept this load becauseit gives them additional income, which enables them to sendtheir children to school.\" Becoming breadwinners, he says, also\"enhances their status at home.\" Empowering women, h owever, has proved more difficult than improving their material well-being. Faced with tradi-tional rural attitudes about women's subservient roles, theWatershed Organization Trust has taken a soft approach.While strongly urging village assemblies to elect women toVillage Watershed Committees, they have not insisted on a50:50 ratio (D'Souza and Lobo 2004:11). As a result, womengenerally number no more than one-third of WatershedCommittee members in IGWDP projects (Lobo 2005a). To encourage greater self-confidence and independence, WOTR also trains village women in record-keeping andorganizational skills, and encourages them to form savings andcredit groups.

Thelandless are unable to take advantage of improved soil andwater conditions to plant more crops and vegetables. Thosewho own only a few sheep or goats may suffer disproportion-ately from grazing bans imposed on common lands. At theother end of the social scale, by the WOTR's own admission,jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM Page 128MORE WATER, WEALTH Cash Crops Cere als Oil Seed Pulses Ve getables Milk Tot alThousand (befo ration) (afte r ration) Source: Watershed Organization Trust 2005.1996 (before watershed regeneration 2001 (after watershed regenerationThousand Rupees 129farmers with the most land have benefited disproportionatelyin Darewadi and other IGWDP project villages from newconsumer items such as televisions, radios, motorcycles, andcooking utensils (D'Souza and Lobo 2004:10). On the positive side, work on watershed projects can provide sustained wages for poor villagers with no livestock orcrops. Families that earn enough to save can then lease, or evenbuy , small plots of arable land and pull themselves one rung upthe economic ladder (Lobo 2005a). In Darewadi, new agricultural work opportunities and the doubling of hourly wages for such labor have proven a big boonfor poor families (Lobo 2005c). (See Table 1.) In the mid-1990s, two-thirds of households migrated each year in search of liveli-hoods. Today , people who had moved away are returning. Infact, additional farm laborers are now being drawn from nearbyvillages to work the new acres of cultivable land (D'Souza andLobo 2004:11). In another positive sign for poorer families, sheep and goat ownership has increased since 2001 as villagers benefit from theremoval of grazing bans and increased fodder supplies (Lobo2005c). \"People do not have to go outside looking for work nowand do not have to starve,\" says Mrs. Zumbarbai M. Borade, alandless Darewadi lot project\" (WOTR 2002:6). The Challenge of Equity Nevertheless, Darewadi provides a microcosm of the difficul-ties facing Indian authorities and NGOs in trying to ensure FIGURE 2 AGRICULTURAL INCOME, DAREWADI VILLAGE jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM Page 129130WORLD RESOURCES 2005 that the benefits of development are equally shared. The issue of equity\u2014particularly between landowners and thelandless\u2014is perhaps the trickiest problem facing the IGWPand other efforts like it, as they expand their activities acrossrural India's drylands. Dr. John Kerr, of the Department of Community , Agriculture, Recreation and Resource Studies at Michigan StateUniversity , led a research team that explored the impact ofIndian watershed development projects run by IGWDP andother agencies in the Indian states of Maharashtra and AndhraPradesh. Published in 2002, their report concluded that \"by theirnature, area development programs offer benefits to landowners,with landless people benefiting indirectly , either through periph-eral program activities or trickle-down effects. In fact, watershedprojects can actually make women and landless people worse offby restricting their access to resources that contribute to theirlivelihoods\" (Kerr et al. 2002:xi). The report, based on surveys conducted before Darewadi began its regeneration program, praised IGWDP projects forcombating soil erosion and raising water levels, and for theirparticipatory philosophy . \"I was really impressed by the IGWDP'sapproach of consensus-based decision making,\" recalled Kerr.\"Other programs typically require a two-thirds majority and thismakes it easy to gang up on poor minorities. The IGWDP worksto avoid this\" (Kerr 2005). Nevertheless, his report noted that somevillagers interviewed had complained of reduced access tocommon lands for fuel and fodder (Kerr et al. 2002:75). For his part, Lobo acknowledges that in rural India \"the poorest normally do not benefit (at least relative to the better offfarmers) from watershed development programs where landholdings are greatly skewed, where social and power relation-ships are greatly inequitable and discriminatory , and where theirconcerns, interests, and involvement are ignored in projectimplementation.\" Such circumstances, he emphasizes, do notapply to Darewadi (Lobo 2005b). Addressing these tricky questions of equity and land distri- bution will require actions on both a local and national scale.Recognizing the benefits of people-led rural development, theIndian Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development estab-lished common guidelines in 2000 for village-based developmentthat would promote equitable distribution of benefits and allowimplementing organizations such as NGOs a year to buildcapacity among local citizens to manage projects themselves(Kerr et al. 2002:80-81). To date, the impact of these broad guidelines has not been measured and analyzed (Lobo 2005b). Yet only if effectivemeans can be found to implement them on the ground\u2014tailoredto the particular needs and social circumstances of eachregion\u2014will the experience of Darewadi's citizens be enjoyed ona wider scale. /orn8flip Restoration Can Revitalize Watersheds and Communities. Village- based restoration projects can be an effective route to restoring vitalwatershed functions and increasing the productivity of local ecosystems.In turn, this can increase farm income and make available more fodderand forest products that directly benefit village livelihoods and build thelocal economy. Consensus-Building Is Key to Community Effort. To be effective, watershed restoration requires participation from a wide array of familiesfrom across the social spectrum. The Darewadi experience shows thatgenerating consensus among these social groups is not only possible,but also the most practical way to avoid conflicts and promote fairness.If decision-making is based on simple majority (or supermajority) rule, itcan easily end up marginalizing the concerns of the poor. Nongovernmental Organizations Provide Crucial Support. NGOs such as the Watershed Organisation Trust can play both a catalytic andcapacity-building role in participatory watershed restoration programs.Experience shows that watershed programs without such an NGO partnerdo not stand the same chance of success. In Darewadi, WOTR's interven-tion helped empower, organize, and educate the community, and providedtechnical help and financial instruments such as microcredit programsto help the community turn increased environmental income into finan-cial strength. Unequal Access to Land Blocks Equal Distribution of Benefits. The most lucrative benefits of watershed restoration\u2014such as greateraccess to irrigation\u2014generally accrue to landowners. The landless mayalso benefit substantially through greater access to wage income andsubsistence products from restored common lands, but these benefitstend to be secondary or indirect benefits. Mechanisms such as savingclubs that increase the ability of the poor to lease or purchase privateagricultural land, or directly access the products of common lands, canhelp correct this imbalance of assets. Development of such supportservices must be a central feature of watershed project design if aidingthe poorest is a serious goal. Forging Links with Government Brings Future Benefits. Perhaps one of the most valuable long-term benefits of Darewadi's watershedmanagement program is the ties it has formed between the communityand the local political system and development agencies. Villagers feelthey have a new visibility and credibility with state officials, whichmeans that they stand a better chance in the future of benefiting fromstate-funded economic development programs. LEARNING FROM DAREWADI'S WATERSHED whose success was recog- nized by the UN Development Programme with an EquatorInitiative prize in 2002, is run and mainly funded by theTanzanian government. But its striking success stems from therich ecological knowledge and strong traditional institutions ofthe agro-pastoralist Sukuma people who live in the region. By 2004, 18 years into the project, at least 350,000 hectares of ngitili (the Sukuma term for enclosures) had been restored or created in 833 villages, encompassing a population of 2.8 million(Barrow and Mlenge 2004:1; Barrow 2005b). Benefits of therestoration include higher household incomes, better diets, andgreater livelihood security for families in the region. Nature hasbenefited too, with a big increase in tree, shrub, grass, and herbvarieties, as well as bird and mammal species (Monela et al2004:3-4). Table 1 summarizes these wide-ranging benefits. It isdrawn from an in-depth study of HASHI's impacts on locallivelihoods commissioned by the Tanzanian government and theWorld Conservation Union (IUCN). People, Trees, and Livelihoods: A Short History of the HASHI Project Shinyanga is one of Tanzania's poorest regions, its low hills and plains characterized by long dry summers with only 700 mm ofrainfall a year on average. As its woods were cleared from the 1920s onward, land and soil became over-used and degraded, causing asharp decline in the natural goods on which the Sukuma people haddepended for centuries. Women spent more time collecting formerlyplentiful fuel wood; grasses to feed livestock became scarcer, as didtraditionally harvested wild fruit and medicinal plants. The region's ecological problems were compounded by a booming human population and by the Sukuma's extensiveland-use needs. Nine in ten of Shinyanga's households live bysmall-scale farming, with families dependent on cropland andlivestock pasture for both subsistence farming and cash cropssuch as cotton, tobacco, and rice (Monela et al. 2004:21-22).Since cattle are highly valued as a liquid asset, many householdsalso kept livestock herds too large for their land to sustain, andburning of woodland to create pasture was common practice. By the 1970s Shinyanga was under severe ecological strain, its people feeling the consequences in the form of falling incomesand lost livelihoods (Monela et al. 2004:12-13). Early attempts atreforestation launched by Tanzania's government, the WorldBank, and other agencies largely failed to stem the loss of indige-nous woodland and its impact on communities. Top-down,bureaucratic management of projects meant that villagers hadlittle involvement or stake in the success of these efforts. Duringthe 1970s, the socialist government of President Julius Nyererealso adopted laws that increased communal ownership of ruralTanzania's HASHI ProjectREGENERATING WOODLANDS NTIL RECENTLY , THE SHINYANGA REGION JUST SOUTH OF LAKE VICTORIA WAS nick-named the Desert of Tanzania. Its once-abundant woodland had been stripped away over decades, first to eradicate the disease-carrying tsetse fly , then to create cropland and make space for a growing population (Monela et al. 2004:14). Now the acac ia and miombo trees are returning, courtesy of the HASHI project, a major restoration effort based on the traditional practice of rest or- ing vegetation in protected enclosures or ngitili .Ujp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM Page 131132WORLD RESOURCES 2005 land and encouraged people to live in discrete villages where services could be better provided\u2014aprocess called \"villagization.\" Individual ngitili enclosures, which many villagers had carefullysustained for food, fodder, fuelwood, andmedicines, were no longer encouraged. Indeed,many ngitili were destroyed during the period, as the villagization process undermined traditionalinstitutions and practices (Monela et al. 2004:102). In 1986, Tanzania's government shifted tactics dramatically and launched the people-centered, community-based Shinyanga SoilConservation Programme, known simply asHASHI \"Hifadhi ArdhiShinyanga\"). The impetus came from PresidentNyerere himself, who declared Shinyanga the\"Desert of Tanzania\" after touring the region. By1987, HASHI was operational and by 1989 it hadattracted additional, long-term support from theNorwegian Development Assistance Agency . The Revival of Ngitili The project's innovative efforts to improve rural livelihoods arebased on reviving \" ngitili ,\" an indigenous natural resource management system (Barrow and Mlenge 2004:1).Traditionally , ngitili were used to provide forage for livestock\u2014 especially oxen\u2014at the end of the dry season when villagersplough their land. Vegetation and trees are nurtured on fallowlands during the wet season so that livestock fodder supplies areavailable for dry months. There are two types of ngitili : enclosures owned by individ- uals or families, and communal enclosures owned and managedin common. Both were originally developed by the Sukuma inresponse to acute animal feed shortages caused by droughts, theloss of grazing land to crops, and declining land productivity(Barrow and Mlenge 2003:6). The HASHI project's approach to ngitili revival was to work with local people, first to identify areas requiring urgentland restoration, and then to restore them according to custom-ary practice. Field officers, employed by the Division of Forestryand Beekeeping in the Ministry of Natural Resources andTourism, worked closely with both district government staff andvillage government authorities\u2014the lowest accountable bodiesin Tanzania's government (Barrow 2005b). Technical guidance and information was also provided by the Nairobi-based International Center for Research in Agro-Forestry (ICRAF), which had researched ngitili restoration. ICRAF studies documented appropriate vegetation andmanagement practices, and noted the important role played bytraditional knowledge and local institutions in successful landmanagement (Barrow 2005e). In many villages, HASHI field officers used residual natural seed and root stock to restore ngitili enclosures. In others, activetree planting (first of exotic species, later of the indigenous tree species preferred by local people) was carried out, especiallyaround homesteads. Some of the restored ngitili dated back to pre-villagization days. Others were newly created by farmers andvillages. In addition to restoring ngitili , villagers were encour- aged to plant trees around homesteads (particularly fruit andshade trees), field boundaries, and farm perimeters. This helpedimprove soil fertility and provide firewood, and had the sidebenefit of helping farmers to stake out and formalize their landrights within villages (Barrow 2005c). A range of tools were used to educate and empower villagers. These included video, theater, newsletters, andworkshops to demonstrate firsthand the links between soilconservation, forest restoration, and livelihood security .Participatory rural appraisal methods helped villagers to identifylocal natural resource problems and agree on solutions (Kaale etal. 2003:13-14). Farmers and villagers received training in howto get the most out of their ngitili . For example, they learned which indigenous species were best suited to enrich farms soils orcreate dense boundary plantings. Armed with this powerful combination of traditional and scientific knowledge, villages across Shinyanga gradually revital-ized the institution of ngitili and broadened its use from simple soil and fodder conservation to production of a wide range ofwoodland goods and services. Products such as timber, fodder,fuelwood, medicinal herbs, wild fruits, honey , and edible insectsenhanced livelihoods and provided a vital safety net during dryseasons and droughts (Barrow and Mlenge 2003:1). In the early years, restoration efforts proceeded gradually as cautious farmers and communities assessed the benefits andrights which ngitili regeneration produced. By the early 1990s, with the project's effectiveness beyond doubt, restoration effortsspread rapidly through the region. In 1986, about 600 hectares jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM enclosures existed in Shinyanga. A survey of 172 sample villages in the late 1990s revealed 18,607 ngitili (284 communal, the rest owned by households) covering roughly 78,122 hectares (Kaale et al. 2003:8, Barrow andMlenge 2004:1). Extrapolating from these figures, projectmanagers estimate that more than 350,000 hectares of land inShinyanga were in use as ngitili , with nine in ten inhabitants of Shinyanga's 833 villages enjoying access to ngitili goods and services (Barrow 2005b). Wendelen Mlenge, longtime manager of the HASHI project (recently renamed the Natural Forest Resources and AgroforestryCenter) has closely observed its success. The enthusiasm andcommitment with which communities have embraced ngitili restoration demonstrates, she says, how \"a traditional naturalresource management system can [be adapted to] needs\" (Barrow and Mlenge It Work: Traditional and Local Institutions HASHI's empowering approach was unusual among 1980s rural development programs, but critical to its success.Promoting ngitili as the vehicle for land restoration increased local people's ownership over naturalresources and their capacity and will tomanage them. Likewise, allowing tradi-tional Sukuma institutions and villagegovernments to oversee restoration effortshelped to ensure their region-wide success.While elected village governmentsofficially manage communal ngitili , and also decide disputes regarding individuallyowned ngitili , in practice traditional institu- tions have played an equally important rolein most villages (Kaale et al. 2003:14-16;Monela et al. 2004:98). For example, while each village sets its own rules on ngitili restoration and management, most use traditional commu- nity guards known as Sungusungu andcommunity assemblies known as Dagashidato enforce them. The Dagashida is led bythe Council of Elders which decides whatsanctions to impose on individuals caughtbreaking ngitili management rules, for example by grazing livestock on land setaside for regeneration (Monela et al.2004:98-99). HASHI field officers have worked to build the capacity and effectiveness of bothofficial and traditional governance institu-tions. Elected village governments, forexample, are increasingly using their powersto approve by-laws that legally enshrine the conservation of local ngitili . Such by-laws, once ratified at the district level, are recog- nized as legitimate by the national government (Barrow andMlenge 2003:9, Barrow 2005c). A 2003 study funded by the World Conservation Union concluded that this twin-track approach had paid off.\"Traditional groupings, such as Dagashida and Sungusunguhave complemented, rather than conflicted with village govern-ment. The blending of the traditional and modern has clearlybeen an important factor in the success of the restoration\"(Kaale et al. 2003:21). Despite popular support, h owever, decisions over where to situate ngitili and what rules should govern them are not always democratic. While many communities establish communalenclosures through the village assembly\u2014in which every regis-tered adult can vote\u2014others are chosen arbitrarily by villagegovernments without public consultation (Monela et al. 2004:8).\"There is no single way of establishing ngitili and some are more democratic than others,\" explains Professor Gerald Monela ofthe Department of Forest Economics at Tanzania's SokoineUniversity of Agriculture. In general, he says, devolution ofdecision-making to village institutions has clearly increased localresponsibility for natural resource management and promotedthe success of ngitili conservation in Shinyanga (Monela 2005).

Paying Dividends to People Of the more than 350,000 hectares of land now occupied by restored or newly established ngitili , roughly half is owned by groups and half by individuals. Communal enclosures average164 hectares in size, while individual plots average 2.3 hectares(Kaale et al. 2003:9; Barrow and Mlenge 2004:1). While the impressive speed of ngitili -based reforestation has been apparent for several years, its impact on people's liveli-hoods and income has only recently been quantified. A majorstudy by a ten-person task force, launched by the Tanzaniangovernment and IUCN in 2004 and directed by Prof. Monela,combined detailed field research among 240 households in 12villages with market surveys and other data analysis to quantifythe HASHI project's benefits (Monela 2005). The task force estimated the cash value of benefits from ngitili in Shinyanga at US$14 per person per month\u2014signifi- cantly higher than the average monthly spending per person inrural Tanzania, of US$8.50 (Monela et al 2004:6). Of the 16natural products commonly harvested from ngitili , fuelwood, timber, and medicinal plants were found to be of greatesteconomic value to households. Other valuable outputs includedfodder, thatch-grass for roofing, and wild foods such as bushmeat, fruit, vegetables, and honey (Monela et al. 2004:54-56).(See Table 2.) In surveyed villages, up to 64 percent of households reported that they were better off due to the benefits derived from ngitili . The task force, headed by Professor Monela, concluded that ngitili restoration \"demonstrates the importance of tree-based natural resources to the economies of local people\" and offers \"asignificant income source to supplement agriculture to diversifylivelihoods in Shinyanga region\" (Monela et al. 2004:7,16). The study also documented the ripple effect of these economic benefits in people's lives. Maintaining ngitili has enabled some villagers\u2014mainly through sales of timber andother wood products\u2014to pay school fees, purchase new farmequipment, and hire agricultural labor. Income generated bycommunal ngitili has been used to build classrooms, village offices, and healthcare centers. One farmer, 'Jim' of Sesekovillage, reported how he had been able to send his son to secondary school and his daughter to university in Dar esSalaam. \"My ngitili assists me ...I fatten my cattle there and therefore they fetch a good price. Then I use the money toeducate my children\" (Monela et al. 2004:91). The new abundance of fruits, vegetables, and edible insects has also improved local health, while easy access to thatchedgrass has improved housing. Raised water tables due to soilconservation have increased water supplies within villages. The study also confirms that villagers, particularly women, are saving considerable time by no longer having towalk long distances for fuelwood, fodder, and thatch.(See Table 1.) This frees men and women to concentrate on other income-generating activities while also fosteringimproved child care and school attendance (Monela et al2004:108). \"I now only spend 20 minutes collecting fuel wood.In the past I spent 2-4 hours,\" reported one Sukuma womanwho harvests branches from the family ngitili (Barrow and Mlenge 2004:2). According to Edmund Barrow, Coordinator of Forest and Dryland Conservation and Social Policy at IUCN's EasternAfrica office, the task force findings \"demonstrate that naturalresource assets are significantly more important in terms oflivelihood security and economic benefits than is generallyassumed.\" There are useful lessons to be drawn, he argues,both by Tanzania's government and other comparablecountries. \" At a time when conservation is increasingly beingasked to justify itself in the context of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, the HASHI e xperience offers detailed insights into the reasons for considering biodiversity conserva-tion as a key component of livelihood security and povertyreduction\" 2005b; Barrow PM 134135The Conservation Dividend Not only are the restored woodlands important economic assets but, as Table 1 highlights, they are also fostering richer habitatsand the recovery of a variety of species. The task force found152 species of trees, shrubs, and climbers in restored ngitili , where recently scrubby wasteland had stood. Small- andmedium-sized mammals such as hyenas, wild pigs, deer, hare,and rabbits are also returning, and the task force recorded 145 bird species that had become locally rare or extinct(Monela et al. 2004:3-5). The returning wildlife has also created problems, with some villages suffering considerable crop damage. Growing hyenapopulations, for example, are taking a toll on liv estock. H owever, the costs of wildlife damage, which average US$63 per family peryear, are greatly outweighed by the economic gains from ngitili in most villages (Monela et al. 2004:58-61, 67; Barrow 2005c). Unequal Distribution of Benefits Not everyone is benefiting equally from ngitili restoration, however . Land use patterns in the region are strongly influencedby Sukuma traditions, with women control-ling low-income crops while men controlhigher-earning livestock and cash crops. Thetask force found this culture persisting with ngitili restoration, with married women rarely owning individual ngitili or having a meaningful say in their management(Monela et al 2004: 92). On the other hand,all women have access to communal ngitili ,a right and resource which has helped themacquire essential household needs such asfuelwood, thatch, and food, and to save timeon chores. \"Women are better off as a resultof ngitili revival, despite patriarchal systems, due to their increased access to forestproducts,\" argues Professor Monela, the taskforce chairman (Monela 2005). Better-off households are also capturing a bigger slice of benefits from reforestationmeasures than poorer families. The task forcereported that differences in land and cattleownership were the most obvious indicatorsregarding the scale of benefits reaped, andnoted that well-off people were buyingadditional land from poorer households, thusexacerbating local inequity (Monela et al.2004:92-93). At the other end of the scale,the poorest households cannot afford individ-ual ngitili , although they are entitled to harvest products from communal enclosures,sometimes for a fee.One impoverished woman, from Mwamnemha village, explained her predicament to a task force researcher: \"I do nothave a ngitili because I do not have money , nor cattle to allow me to buy land. I therefore purchase some of my needs from ngitili . If I want to purchase grass for thatching I have to pay 200shillings [US$ 0.20] per bundle. If I want land for cultivation, Ihave to rent a piece for 12,000 shillings per acre. I am sometimesgiven these products free of charge, but this is very rare\"(Monela et al. 2004:92). Despite such problems, there have also been improve- ments for the poorest. The task force found that ngitili were being \"used as one of the strategies through which somecommunities indirectly cushion the vulnerability of householdsclassified as poor...those of the elderly , widows, and house-holds with no assets.\" Most communities surveyed includedfamilies with no cattle as those in need of help, even if they hadsome land. The task force reported that each village theyvisited either lent oxen to plough the fields of cattle-less house-holds, or allowed these households free use of products fromcommunal ngitili . In the village of Seseko, poor households TABLE 2 MONEY GROWS ON TREES: VALUE OF NGITILI PRODUCTS USED BY HOUSEHOLDS IN BUKOMBE DISTRICT, SHINYANGA, Product Timber Fuel woodsPolesWithiesWaterHoneyBush plantsThatching materialsFodderVegetablesFruitsCarpentryPotteryTotal Economic Value, Per Household, Per YearPercent of Households Using Product in Surveyed Villages 59 6429362114 7 3636 7 36 7 294314 7Average Household Value, Per Year (Domestic Use and Sales), Page 135136were required to reciprocate by feeding the neighbors who plowed their fields (Monela et al. 2004:95). Acknowledging the benefits gap between richer and poorer households, the task force warned that additional strategieswould be required to prevent social conflicts from erupting andto ensure the long-term sustainability of ngitili . In particular, its report concludes, local institutions should make every effort to\"enable people to hold on to land resources so that they canmaintain ngitili and enjoy its products\" (Monela et al. 2004:110). A Fragile Future? The HASHI project is clearly a success story , drawing attentionfar beyond Shinyanga's borders. Yet several demographic andland-use trends threaten the continued expansion of ngitili as a cornerstone of natural resource management in Tanzania.These include (Monela et al. 2004:103-4,107):Scarcity of land and insecurity of tenure; Rapidly growing human and livestock populations, which aredriving a surge in demand for resources from the still-recover-ing landscape; Damage to livestock and crops caused by growing wildlifepopulations; in some areas, this threatens to outweigh thebenefits gained from ngitili ; Growing, unregulated sales of individually owned ngitili . The government-commissioned task force identified population increase as a particular concern, pointing out that sofar \"there are not clear indications that the restoration [of ] is sustainable\" (Monela et al. 2004:107). Shinyanga's populationrose from 1.77 million in 1988 to 2.8 million in 2002, and contin-ues to grow by 2.9 percent a year (Monela et al. 2004: 21). As aresult, fathers are increasingly dividing their ngitili plots between sons, reducing the size and productivity of the plots. Farmers inWigelekeko village in the Maswa District of Shinyanga personifies the success of ngitili -based conservation efforts. By the mid-1980s, overgraz- ing and land clearance for cotton fields had resulted in dry-seasonshortages of wood products, fodder, and water for the 408 households. With HASHI guidance, the village set aside 157 hectares of degraded land. To enhance regeneration, grazing and tree-cutting was banned inthe communal ngitili for five years, and villagers grazed their cattle only in individually owned ngitili . When the ban ended, the communal enclo- sure was carpeted with thriving trees and shrubs. The village government and HASHI field officers then devised a simple management system including controlled collection of firewood throughtree pruning, and limited dry-season grazing. Farmers were allowed togrow food crops in small patches, but with strict soil conservationmeasures. Protection of the communal ngitili was carried out through Sungusungu and communally agreed village by-laws. In 1997 the villagers decided to expand the enclosure by 20 ha in order to build a small reservoir to store water for domestic and livestock use. Eachhousehold contributed US$4 to build the dam, which was completed in1998. A year later, the reservoir was providing water continuously, with thevalue of its domestic water supply estimated at US$26,500 a year. Waterfor livestock contributes even more value\u2014an estimated US$92,500 peryear for sustaining about 1900 cattle. In 2000 fishing was introduced inthe reservoir, further contributing to local livelihood security. A Wigelekeko water users group now manages the dam and, with the village assembly's approval, sells excess water to outsiders. In 2001 suchsales raised US$250 for community development. To reduce demand onthe community ngitili , two-thirds of villagers have also planted trees on their farms, averaging 100 saplings per hectare. Source: Kaale et al. 136137REGENERATING WOODLANDS Maswa district, for example, reported in 2004 that the shrinking size of their individually owned ngitili had forced them to graze only the neediest animals during the critical dry season. In addition, there are no constraints on landowners wishing to sell their individually owned ngitili , although, because of the village land title system, it is very difficult to sell private land tosomeone from outside your community . New owners are free tofell the trees and develop the land as they see fit. The somewhat ambiguous tenure situation of ngitili is also a significant concern. Despite popular enthusiasm, the establish-ment of new ngitili is often limited by tenure insecurity\u2014or theperception of insecurity . Although ngitili are formally recorded and registered by village governments, their tenure statusremains unclear under Tanzanian law. Villages commonly holda village title deed to all the land within village borders, whilehouseholds receive a subsidiary title to their privately ownedfarmland with the village assembly's approval. The remainingland is designated as communal village land, under the manage-ment of the village government (Barrow 2005c, d). These communal lands can be used for communal ngitili , but it is not always clear what basis the designation of a village ngitili has in law, and therefore what property rights pertain. For example, village governments and assemblies aresometimes wary of officially designating ngitili as \"protected areas,\" because they fear the state may appropriate these landsand manage them as public lands at the district or nationallevels (Barrow 2005d). Tenure issues can interfere with establishing ngitili on private land as well. Private landowners who don't have securerights to their land are sometimes reluctant to establish orexpand ngitili for fear of triggering disputes within the commu- nity . In some cases, concerted efforts by villagers and localgovernment institutions have overcome tenure problems, withboundary surveys made in order to obtain legally watertightcommunal and individual land title deeds (Kaale et al.2003:16). Nevertheless, as pressure on land grows due to risinghuman and livestock populations, land tenure disputes,trespassing on ngitili , and conflicts over grazing rights are all likely to increase. Designating in law the specific ownership and use-rights that pertain to communal ngitili within the overall system of village-owned land could help address the tenure problem,according to Edmund Barrow. Formally recognizing individualand family-owned ngitili under Tanzanian law as a separate land management category would also help. Closing theseloopholes would help ensure that ngitili continue to play a significant and expanding role in villagers' livelihood strategiesand income (Barrow 2005c). Despite these challenges, the multiple benefits of forest restoration are increasingly recognized by Tanzania's govern-ment. Since the HASHI pr oject began, new legislation\u2014 including the National Land Policy of 1997, the Land Act of 1999,and Village Act of 1999\u2014has supported the formal establish-ment of ngitili and has begun to address the thorny issue of land tenure (Kaale et al. 2003:16). In 1998 Tanzania revised itsforest policy , which now emphasizes participatory managementof and decentralized control over woodlands, and stronglysupports ngitili . Enriching the Benefits Stream According to Professor Monela's task force, the Tanzaniangovernment can take several additional steps to improve theeconomic benefits from ngitili and thus their anti-poverty impact (Monela et al. 2004:10). These include:Modern and Traditional Institutions Can Be Compatible. Traditional institutions can act as effective vehicles for reducing povertythrough environmental regeneration. In Shinyanga, these institutionsmeshed successfully with the more modern institutions of the popularlyelected village councils. Both are necessary for the continued success of ngitili restoration. Local Knowledge Helps Decentralization Succeed. Devolving responsibility for land management to local communities and institu-tions is often more effective than imposing centralized, top-downsolutions. Local or indigenous knowledge of natural resources and tradi-tional institutions and practices can be an invaluable resource, lendingcrucial site-specific information for management, and improvingcommunity buy-in and compliance with management rules. Only whenthe HASHI project embraced a more participatory and empowering strat-egy did ngitili restoration begin to spread quickly. Restored Ecosystems Generate Substantial Benefits. Regenerating local ecosystems can deliver significant improvements in livelihoodsecurity to rural families dependent on natural resources. Ngitili benefits, both subsistence products and cash income, have yielded an increase infamily assets and nutrition, as well as generating income for publicbenefits such as classrooms and health clinics. In this way ngitili restoration has contributed directly to achievement of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, improving household incomes, education, andhealth, while restoring biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. Inequitable Distribution of Benefits Hurts the Poor. Inequitable power relations between men and women and rich and poor can slant thebenefits of ngitili restoration away from those who most need them. Without active intervention, the greater productivity that ngitili restora- tion brings will benefit those with more land and assets such aslivestock, simply perpetuating existing inequities and wasting some ofthe potential of ngitili for poverty reduction. Insecure Tenure Discourages Regeneration. Insecurity of tenure can restrain the willingness of both communities and individuals to under-take ngitili restoration and to sustainably manage these enclosures. Clearly acknowledging in national law the secure tenure of both privateand communal ngitili will help insure the future RESOURCES 2005 Support Better Ngitili Management The state can provide technical help and targeted researchspecifically aimed at raising ngitili productivity . For example, it could help improve fodder productivity by introducing morenutritive and productive tree, shrub, and grass species. And it canresearch the best methods and timing of cutting and pruning ngitili trees to maximize production. Monitor Ngitili Trends and Facilitate Lesson-Sharing The state is in a unique position to offer certain kinds of supportthat require a national rather than local perspective. Forexample, using satellite imagery the state could track nationwidechanges in land use and biodiversity related to ngitili restoration to help HASHI officials understand the macroscale impact oftheir activities and better target their aid. The state can alsomount a national effort to document ngitili -related benefits and innovations, helping communities to share their successes andlearn from others through public education campaigns andknowledge networks. Expand Markets for Ngitili Products Increasing the income stream from ngitilis will help sustain Shinyanga's land-use renaissance by making ngitilis even more essential to local livelihoods. One of the most effective ways todo this is to expand the markets for ngitili products. The statecan help by supporting small-scale processing plants to diversify and add value to ngitili products (by making timber into furni- ture, for example); by removing burdensome regulations andother barriers to ngitili expansion and the establishment of local enterprises based on ngitili products; and by helping households access local and regional markets for their ngitili products by providing relevant and timely market information. How Tanzania's government responds to these and other challenges facing the ngitili restoration movement, remains to be seen. What is not in dispute is a strong national commitmentto consolidate the successes of ngitili restoration and the benefits it has brought in Shinyanga, and to replicate these,wherever possible, across Tanzania's drylands/orn8flip This case study was authored by Polly Ghazi, with the collaboration and guidance of Edmund Barrow, Prof. Gerald Monela, and Wendelen Mlenge.Polly Ghazi is a freelance journalist based in London.

For many fore st- dependent people, illegal logging short-circuits this control, robbing them of traditional forest uses and income. But some communities in Indonesia have found a way to fight back to preserve their forest livelihoods. With training in the use of video c ameras and film-editing techniques, they have begun to document illegal logging incidents, using the footage to gain media coverage and to lobby for action against corrupt forest practices.S The video training, provided by a pair of environmental NGOs (nongovernmental organizations), has created a networkof empowered citizens based in illegal logging hotspots in 15regions across the archipelago\u2014including Sumatra, Java,Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and West Papua. Some have already puttheir newfound skills to impressive and effective use, with mediaand public airings of their films forcing the closure of illegaloperations and promoting alternative livelihoods such asbamboo cultivation and fish farming (see examples below). \"One of the propaganda arguments put out by logging companies is that there are no alternative livelihoods for forestcommunities,\" says Arbi Valentinus of Telapak, an IndonesianNGO that shares responsibility for the video training program.\"In fact it is illegal logging that is disturbing and destroying tradi-tional livelihoods such as mixed crop farming and cultivatingrattan, honey , bamboo and herbs used in traditional medicines.Better enforcement against illegal logging helps to secure locallivelihoods, reduce corruption, and break communities' depend-ency on the timber barons\" (Valentinus 2004) Combating the Rise of Illegal Logging More than 50 million people inhabit Indonesia's rainforests,many pursuing traditional livelihoods including small-plotfarming, bamboo harvesting, and fruit and honey collection. Inaddition to income, forests typically provide a variety of subsis-tence foods, materials, and spiritual and social values. In recent decades, these forests have been increasingly plundered forvaluable hardwood that is smuggled overseas, often with thecomplicity of corrupt officials. Much of this illegal timber findsits way to China, Malaysia, and Singapore on its way to supplyWestern furniture markets (Schroeder-Wildberg and Carius2003:24-33; EIA/Telapak 2002:12-15). Since the fall of former Indonesian President Suharto in 1997, illegal logging and its impact on poor rural forest-dwellershas become a major issue for Indonesia's government, its Westerntrading partners, and its evolving civil society and media. In part,this reflects the fact that nongovernmental organizations andjournalists are now able to comment critically on governmentpolicy with less fear of repression. While bureaucratic corruptionremains widespread, the Indonesian government at all levels hasbecome more responsive to public scrutiny and civil-societypressure (Anderson and Hidayat 2004:12). Against this backdrop, two prominent NGOs\u2014the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), based in the UnitedKingdom and the United States, and Telapak, based inIndonesia\u2014began an innovative program to train community-based NGOs to document and disseminate evidence of criminallogging activity in their forests. The project was funded by theUK Department for International Development (DfID) under itsMulti Stakeholder Forestry Program, which funds efforts toincrease poor forest-dwellers' influence on forest policymaking.Empowering Indonesian Communities To Fight Illegal LoggingBEARING WITNESS jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM Page 139140WORLD RESOURCES 2005 The project was based on the premise that the timber industry offers only short-term benefits to a small minority ofIndonesians, and that forest loss means that livelihood alterna-tives for forest dwellers are dwindling fast, especially for the ruralpoor (MFP 2000:5; Anderson and Hid ayat 2004:12). \"Every year, two million hectares of forest disappear, eroding the liveli-hoods of as many as one million people,\" says David Brown, aforest economist with DfID. \"Meanwhile, only 200,000 peopleare employed in that segment of the Indonesian log felling andprocessing industry that operates illegally . Slowing downIndonesia's illegal logging industry will make the forest-linkedlivelihoods of Indonesians more secure\" (Brown 2004). During the four-and-a-half-year project (2000-2004), Telapak and EIA trained over 300 civil-society representativesfrom 70 NGO and community groups. Participants were trainedin basic camera and video skills, and 13 sets of surveillance anddocumentation equipment were distributed nationwide as acommunal resource. In addition, nine local NGOs were trainedin advanced film editing and given computers and softwareediting facilities. They now serve as regional resource centers forcommunity activists working to fight deforestation and promotesustainable alternative livelihoods. In 2004 some of these regionalNGO partners organized their own media training sessions toexpand the video network and pass on their video skills to othercommunities. Total cost of the project was about US$2.3 million. In setting up the video training, inclusiveness and diversity among the trainees were important guiding principles.Participants represented human rights and women's groups as wellas local and regional NGOs working specifically on forestry issues.In each region, attendees were chosen by a local NGO, which inturn was chosen by Telapak. \"The groups we trained ranged frominformal community groups with a local dignitary as their head toorganized NGOs with 15 staff,\" explained Dave Currey , EIA director. \"We tried to be as inclusive as possible, to encouragethose taking part to see illegal logging from a wide social andeconomic perspective and to encourage networking between civilsociety groups operating in the same communities. Corruptionand intimidation in Indonesia's forests, for example, affects thewhole of community life, so you can't discuss illegal loggingwithout talking about human rights, the judicial system, and localgovernance. We were not prescriptive in how participants usedtheir training. They knew the local conditions and decidedthemselves how to best use the skills they learned\" (Currey 2004). Praised for Effectiveness Independent consultants who evaluated the video trainingproject at its completion in 2004 judged it a success. They found jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:35 PM Page 140141BEARING WITNESS that NGOs and community groups had used their videos and photographs \"to inform and influence local and provincialdecision-makers,\" while campaigns these groups had triggeredwith their work had \"helped stop the destruction of forests onwhich poor people depend\" (Anderson and Hid ayat 2004:10). Specifically , their publicity and advocacy efforts had helpedprotect rural communities against illegal logging in Sorong (WestPapua), Makassar Lampung, Jambi, and Central Java. The success of the project reached beyond just prevention of illegal encroachment and logging. It also helped support callsfor granting communities more management authority overlocal forests. The independent evaluators found that photos andvideos, including interviews with villagers, had helped persuadeauthorities in several provinces of the rights and managementabilities of local communities, and aided local groups in theirefforts to secure more favorable forest tenure and managementrights (Anderson and Hidayat 2004:13). The trainees themselves seemed satisfied with their accom- plishments. In a questionnaire, 11 of 13 activists trained by EIAand Telapak reported that their subsequent campaigns \"had hada direct impact at the village level.\" One of the benefits wasgreater activism and solidarity within and among communitiesaround the issue of forest use. In several cases, a group of villageshad agreed to work together to protect their local forest fromillegal logging.\" A film tells a story better than a printed campaign, it reaches more people,\" commented Rama Astraatmaja, of Java-based ARuPA, one of the biggest NGOs to receive the videotraining. \"Many homes in Indonesian villages these days havevideo recorders. Our films tell villagers stories about people withsimilar situations from other villages. This is something they donot usually see from TV which creates a solidarity feeling amongthem. Showing film [about illegal logging or non-timber liveli-hoods] always sparks a discussion. They start to talk about whatthey have seen, and they...see that the problem is real, and itneeds a real solution\" (Astraatmaja 2004). Awareness-raising and campaigning by partner NGOs also reaped success on a larger scale. Nine NGOs reported \"a directimpact at district level\"\u2014for example, through the introductionof new local government regulations to protect forest areas andlimit access to logging companies. Seven reported success at theprovincial level, with achievements including the creation byprovincial governments of special teams to combat illegal logging.The independent evaluation also identified specific links betweenEIA/Telapak's empowerment of local communities and efforts toachieve more sustainable nationwide forestry policies, with infor-mation on illegal logging feeding into the development of anational forest strategy (Anderson and Hid ayat 2004:24). Unintended Consequences? While the video vigilance enabled by the project has clearly beeneffective, activism against illegal logging may also have someunintended consequences. For example, some Indonesian civilsociety groups are worried that the government, pressed to makesome response to illegal logging, may target small-scale commu-nity-based loggers, as opposed to larger operations with deeperpolitical and business ties. Some of these small-scale operatorsclaim indigenous rights to forest resources, but their harvest isstill considered illegal. For this reason, the wider discussion aboutillegal logging at a national level has incorporated debate aboutindigenous rights and tenure (Ander son and Hid ayat 2004:3; Astraatmaja 2005; Currey 2005). In addition, while by far the biggest slice of income from illegal logging is taken by middlemen and timber traders, manypoor villagers working on illegal logging crews have benefitedfrom the income it brings. Although the work is often dangerous,it may be more economically attractive than other more sustain-able activities\u2014at least for the short time that marketable treesIndonesia suffers the world's largest annual loss of forest cover. Ministry of Forestry officials estimate that more than 43 million hectares have been degraded, with an average annual deforestationrate of 2.8 million hectares from 1998 to 2002 (Kaban 2005). An estimated 70 percent of Indonesia's timber exports are illegal, costing the country US$3.7 billion a year in lost revenue (Saparjadi 2003). Middlemen capture most of the profit from illegal logging. Members ofillegal logging gangs, often poor forest-dwellers, receive a mere $2.20per m 3of wood. Timber brokers receive $160 per m3. But Singapore- based exporters of sawn Indonesian hardwood charge US$800 per m3 to ship to Western markets 2002:28). ILLEGAL LOGGING, LOST LIVELIHOODS jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/9/05 1:27 PM Page 141142WORLD RESOURCES 2005 are still available. In 2000, as many as 300 illegal sawmills were estimated to be active in Central Kalimantan alone, giving someidea of the size of the temporary logging economy in that region(Casson 2000:16). In the midst of a logging boom, the web ofpeople drawing income from the logging effort\u2014which includesa variety of jobs from felling, to transport, to milling\u2014may reachwell into rural communities (McCarthy 2002:876). Workingagainst illegal logging, then, may cut income for some. On the other hand, Dave Currey of the Environmental Investigation Agency maintains that any loss of income fromshutting down illegal logging pales by comparison to the loss oflivelihoods that such illegal operations cause over the longerterm. The bigger picture issue, he says, \"is that illegal logging iscausing widespread poverty\u2014as the DfID Multi-StakeholderProgram explicitly recognizes\" (Currey 2004). The Fruits of Vigilance Examples of successful forest protection efforts by Indonesiancommunity groups and NGOs, assisted by EIA/Telapak surveil-lance training and equipment, include: CENTRAL JAVA LOCAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE GROUP: ARuPA Made up of 14 former forestry students turned environmentalactivists, ARuPA now acts as a resource hub for forest-basedactivists across Central Java and has itself trained members of 20NGOs to document environmental crime and mismanagement. Using the skills gained through EIA/Telapak training, ARuPA 's members documented illegal logging in Java's forestsby a government-owned complaints about Perhutani's disregard forforest dwellers' rights and were shown to local civil society groups and decision-makers. In 2002, ARuPA 's efforts contributed to therevoking of Perhutani's Forest Stewardship (FSC) international assessor, whichimpacted the company's market among Western furniture buyers.Subsequent attempts by the company to regain certification andlost business have failed (Astraatmaja 2004). ARuPA also uses film to highlight successful examples of alternative, decentralized, sustainable forest-based livelihoods,including community-based forestry management and a Javancommunity's initiative to plant bamboo after local pine planta-tions had been clear-cut. \"Bamboo forest protects communitiesfrom flooding, landslides, and drought\u2014environmental servicesthat could not be provided by the pine forest,\" says ARuPAspokesman Rama Astraatmaja. After negotiating an informalagreement with the local timber company official, villagersplanted bamboo, preserving water supplies for their rice fieldsand contributing to the village economy by selling bamboo poles. CENTRAL KALIMANTAN LOCAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE GROUP: DAUN Daun, a regional NGO, against deforestation Puting National Park, whose endangeredspecies include clouded leopards, sun bears, and orangutans.Daun's members have used their media training to build publicawareness of the destructive impact of illegal logging by showingphotographic and video evidence to communities, and thenexplaining the connection with lost livelihoods. One film distrib-uted among riverside communities living on the park's fringesdocumented how a local village had successfully developedsmall-scale fish farming as a sustainable alternative to illegallogging operations. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 GROUP: LPMA LPMA has produced educational videos both documenting the destructive impact of illegal logging in protected forest in theMeratus area of South Kalimantan, and promoting honeycollecting as an alternative way of generating income. The filmshave been shown to forest communities and to local politicianswith the aim (not yet realized) of generating financial support toexpand commercial honey collecting. SUMATRA LOCAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE GROUP: ULAYAT Ulayat, a Sumatran environmental group, documented illegal Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park by Semaku JayaSakti, a company owned by the district government. After itscompelling visual evidence prompted provincial and nationalmedia stories, the park manager sued the logging company , andits director was forced to resign. Ul ayat's campaigning also resulted in the Kaur district government creating a forest regula-tion enabling action against illegal logging. RIAU LOCAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE GROUP: HAKIKI Hakiki, a regional NGO, documented and publicized evidencethat Diamond Raya Timber, a logging concession holder in RiauProvince, Sumatra, was logging outside its approved harvestingarea. Hakiki then worked with the Riau provincial governmentto establish the Community Anti-Illegal Logging Network,whose members include provincial authorities, law enforcementofficials, NGOs, and three district governments. /orn8flip The Power of Public Disclosure. Public disclosure is a powerful tool to motivate action at the local and national scales. Video is a relativelyeasy route to public exposure, attracting media attention at modest costand with modest training. An Educational Tool for Alternative Livelihoods. Video documenta- tion does not have to concentrate on infractions only, but can bringpositive messages of alternative livelihood options. A Tool for Community Empowerment. Use of video or other media tools can empower communities through access to information, which inturn promotes public dialog, shared values, and community activism. Civil Society Groups are Key. Local community groups are often ideally placed to undertake video surveillance and to deploy thefootage locally and to media. Diversity among these groups helpscreate a more effective network. National and International NGOs are Important Catalysts. Larger NGOs are well-placed for capacity-building: administering video andmedia training, and helping to establish a national network for village-level logging surveillance. Adverse Consequences for the Poor. Targeting illegal logging may benefit forest livelihoods in the long term, but may impose short-termhardships on some community members, particularly the poor, who are dependent on this employment. Supporting communities in the devel-opment of income alternatives is important to counterbalance short-termincome loss.ILLEGAL LOGGING, LOST LIVELIHOODS jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:36 PM Page 143144commercial fishing and larger local subsistence harvests have left most of Fiji's coastal waters overfished, sometimes heavily so.Rural Fijians, who constitute half of Fiji's population of nearly900,000, have been hurt. Most of these villagers still lead a tradi-tional subsistence-based livelihood, communally drawing onlocal marine resources for at least part of their daily protein andincome. In the past, the abundance of the marine catch meant amoderate level of affluence and food security . With thatabundance gone, the pressure on village economies hasmounted, leaving 30-35 percent of rural households in Fiji belowthe official poverty line. But Fijians are fighting back, village by village, linked by a network of communities that carefully regulate the use of theircoastal waters, slowly restoring their productivity . Although these locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are an innovation of the last decade, they call on a rich tradition of village managementof ocean resources. In this new incarnation, traditional localconservation practices are blended with modern methods ofmonitoring and energized by the full participation of membersof the community , who design and implement the marinemanagement plans. The goal is to bolster local incomes andtraditions by replenishing local waters\u2014a grassroots approach torural development.Ucunivanua was the site of the first locally managed marine area in Fiji, and its results have been dramatic. Sincelocal management began seven years ago, the kaikoso clam has once again become abundant, and village incomes have risensignificantly . The Ucunivanua project set aside the usualmind-set that only experts know best and that developmentoccurs only when planned by governments. Instead, it let theultimate choices\u2014the decisions that determine a project'ssuccess or failure\u2014rest with the people most dependent on theresources for their livelihoods. The success in Ucunivanua hasled to the adoption of LMMAs throughout Fiji, et al. 2001). Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) Pacific island communities have long practiced traditionalmethods of preserving their valuable food sources, such asimposing seasonal bans and temporary no-take areas. Thesemethods have been based on a system of community marinetenure\u2014the right to own or control an inshore area\u2014that hasbeen informally recognized by villagers and local chiefs. Fiji'sRecovering Fiji's Coastal FisheriesVILLAGE BY VILLAGE N THE EARLY 1990s, RESIDENTS OF UCUNIVANUA VILLAGE, ON THE EASTERN COAST OF Fiji's largest island, realized that the marine resources they depended on were becoming scarce. Village elders remembered when a woman could collect several bags of large kaikoso clams\u2014a food staple and important source of income\u2014in just a few hours. By the 1990s, h owever, a w oman could spend all day on the mudflats and come home with only half a bag of small clams. The decline of Ucunivanua's marine heritage reflects a larger pattern of depletion repeated throughout the Fiji islands. A combination of greaterIjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:36 PM Page 144145VILLAGE BY VILLAGE long-established system of local marine tenure consists of qoliqolis, or tradi- tional fishing grounds that are underthe control of the communitiesadjacent to them. Qoliqolis have some legal recognition and are officiallyreferred to as \"customary fishing rightsareas.\" They are accurately mapped,delineated, and bound by survey lines,with records maintained by the NativeFisheries Commission. There are 385 marine and 25 freshwater qoliqolis in Fiji. The resources from these providelivelihoods for approximately 300,000people living in coastal villages. Traditionally , management of qoliqolis included temporary closures of these fishing zones, limitations onthe number of fishers or the amountof fish they could harvest, restrictionson using certain fishing practices, andthe imposition of a tabu, or prohibi- tion, on fishing for certain species. Inaddition, sacred fishing grounds wererecognized by communities, and temporary moratoria onfishing were sometimes imposed as part of traditionalceremonies. For example, a 100-day tabu on using certain fishing areas was often declared as a token of respect when ahigh chief died. When the tabu ended, villagers harvested fish again and held a large feast to end the mourning period. Today, many communities maintain such customary practices, with varying levels of compliance. Chiefs are applyingthis customary tabu concept to more practical ends\u2014to protect spawning or overexploited areas and to increase fish stocks\u2014with mounting interest and success. They are linking theirtraditional practices with modern techniques\u2014assessing fishstocks, measuring potential no-take zones, monitoring the tabu area\u2014to establish locally managed marine areas. Communities set aside at least part of an LMMA as a restricted area, typically 10-15 percent of the village's fishingwaters, in order to allow habitat and resources to recover fromfishing pressure. The location and size of the tabu area is determined by members of the community , depending onhow much they feel they can close and still meet their needs.The community may also choose a spot that is easy to police,and not necessarily a rich fishing area. Technical experts mayoffer their advice to the community on optimal placement ofthe tabu area, but ultimately the community itself has the final say about location. Thus an LMMA is significantlydifferent from a marine reserve or marine protected area. In a marine protected area, a central body , often a nationalgovernment, makes all decisions, often from afar and withlittle or no local input.Ucunivanua: One Village's Experiment The kaikoso antiquate) a clam found in shallow mudflats and seagrass beds, is the clan totem of the people ofUcunivanua\u2014the community's symbolic animal. It is also a foodstaple and primary source of income, along with agriculturalcrops and other marine resources such as octopus. To preservethe kaikoso, residents of Ucunivanua began working in the 1990s with the University of the South Pacific (USP) in Suva, Fiji(Tawake et al. 2001). This collaboration began when the son ofthe high chief of Verata, the district in which Ucunivanua islocated, studied land management at USP and asked his teach-ers there to help address some of the problems in his village. At the end of two years of workshops and training in environmental education and community planning, the commu-nity decided to set up a 24-hectare tabu area on the mudflat and seagrass bed directly in front of the Ucunivanua village as anexperiment. The hope was that as the clam population recoveredin the tabu area, more clam larvae would settle in adjacent fishing areas as well, eventually leading to increased clamharvests in these areas\u2014something called a seeding effect. The village chose a group of 20 men and women to be on the tabu area management team. From the outset of the planning process, advisors from USP had requested that theteam include equal numbers of adult men, women, and youth\u2014an unusual step in traditional Fijian culture. The tabu area management team staked out the boundaries of the proposedprotected area. The team then worked with the paramount chiefand elders of the village to hold a traditional ceremony declar-ing the area tabu for three years. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:36 PM Page 145146WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Here is where modern technique fused with traditional village values. The scientific experts from USP taught teammembers the skills of monitoring and the basic ideas ofsampling and statistics. The team learned how to lay linetransects and to sample the clam population at 10-meter inter-vals along the 500-meter transect line, then record their results and analyze them with simple statistics. Using these skills, theteam established a baseline of clam populations in the tabu area and in adjacent sites down current. Those baseline calcu-lations were then o be used for comparison with the results ofthe annual monitoring to follow. In effect, the communitylearned how to conduct a scientific experiment to see if alocally managed marine area strategy would lead to increasedresource yields and better conservation. Monitoring data gathered by the team in 1997 and 2004 indicate the dimensions of the experiment's success. Thenumber of clams increased dramatically in both the tabu and adjacent harvest areas. (See Figure 1.) At the start of the project, it was extremely rare to find a clam bigger than 5 cmin diameter. Today , the Ucunivanua community routinelyfinds clams in the tabu area that are over 8 cm in size. Because of its success, the Ucunivanua tabu area, which was initially intended to be closed to fishing and collection for just threeyears, has been extended indefinitely (Tawake andAalbersberg 2003). Expanding the LMMA Benefit The district chief early on in the process had asked that theproject include the entire district and not just Ucunivanua. Afteronly one year of local monitoring and reporting at districtmeetings, the clear benefits of the LMMA strategy atUcunivanua became apparent to other villages in the Veratadistrict, and they began setting up tabu areas. Sawa villagers, for example, imposed a tabu on a mangrove island. By counting the \"active\" holes in the mangroves, they found that the numbers ofthe mangrove lobster Thalassina anomala increased by roughly 250 percent annually , with a spillover effect of roughly 120percent outside the tabu area. As these results were reported in the local media, villages throughout Fiji facing declines in their inshore fisheryapproached USP for help in setting up locally managed marineareas in their qoliqoli . In Nacamaki village on the island of Gau, one year after creating a tabu area the community harvested approximately eight tons of their food totem, therabbitfish, in one week. This bounty was enough to provide afeast for the entire island\u201420 villages in three districts, totalingroughly 6,000 people. While this catch coincided with the high season for rabbit- fish, Nacamaki had not seen such abundance in a long time. A68-year old woman recalled that the last time she saw so manyrabbitfish was when she gave birth to her second son 47 yearsearlier. A testimonial from the Nacamaki village chief illus-trates the enthusiasm for LMMA work that has spreadthroughout Fiji: \"The LMMA work that these young guys fromUSP are doing has changed the attitude of my people toconserve and sustainably manage our resources for our kids. Inrecognizing this change, our ancestors have released the bless-ing to us by reviving this tradition.\"Size Class (cm) 1997 2004 1997 2004 < 2.5 0 3502 1 5322.5 - 3.5 5 1546 7 6223.5 - 4.5 12 935 14 3854.5 - 5.5 13 570 9 221> 5.5 8 530 1 91Tabu Area Adjacent Harvest SiteNUMBER OF CLAMS (PER 50 M3) Tabu Area, 2004 2.52.5-3.53.5-4.54.5-5.5> Clam Size Class (cm)Number of Clams per 50 m3 Adjacent Harvest Site, 2004 0100200300400500600700 < 2.52.5-3.53.5-4.54.5-5.5> 5.5 Clam Size Class (cm)Number of Clams per 50 m3FIGURE 1 TRENDS IN CLAM Page 146147National and International Collaboration A concurrent step for advocates of LMMAs\u2014both the technical experts and traditional practitioners\u2014was to work together, firstwithin Fiji and then across Asia and the Pacific, to spread theprinciples and techniques of locally managed conservation ofmarine resources. The Fiji LMMA Network (FLMMA) The residents and researchers in Ucunivanua were not the onlyones in Fiji exploring local solutions to diminishing marineresources in the 1990s. In Cuvu district on the Coral Coast,along a southern stretch of Viti Levu (Fiji's largest island),community members were working with the Foundation for thePeoples of the South Pacific (now Partners in CommunityDevelopment Fiji) on techniques for setting aside and restoringdegraded coral reefs. And in Ono, in the island group ofKadavu, villagers were working with the World Wildlife Fund'sSouth Pacific Programme to find ways to protect and manageblue holes (large deep holes in the middle of a reef). Each ofthese projects was testing variations of the basic LMMA strategyto see if it could contribute to conservation and local livelihoodsunder differing conditions. Team members from these three projects\u2014Ucunivanua, Cuvu, and Ono\u2014joined in 2001 to form the Fiji LMMANetwork (FLMMA), to serve as a forum in which communities with LMMA projects could share methods and results. With thehelp of the respective project teams, the community members inthe network presented the results of their monitoring to fisherypolicy makers of the Fijian government. While surprised at firstto be given scientific findings by villagers, the governmentrepresentatives grew excited about the idea of adopting Fijiancustoms to the management of marine resources. The nationalgovernment has formally adopted the LMMA approach andhas designated a division of the Fisheries Department topromote inshore conservation and to work with FLMMA. WithFLMMA 's assistance, the Fisheries Department has been taskedto conduct resource assessments of all of Fiji's qoliqolis and to help develop management plans. The participatory model used by FLMMA has had additional effects at a national level. The Ministry of FijianAffairs uses FLMMA 's participatory approach for its CommunityCapacity Building project, which identifies and develops actionplans to deal with village problems. Fifteen Fisheries Departmentextension officers were trained in the network's participatorytechniques during a community workshop in June 2002.Members of five government agencies (Fisheries, Fijian Affairs,Environment, Tourism, and the Native Land Trust Board) haveformally joined the network to date. Local primary and second-ary schools are encouraged to create displays related to LMMAwork and even take part in monitoring exercises. Under current law the Fijian government holds title to the qoliqolis , as it does all marine waters. Now, as a direct result of FLMMA 's work with local communities, there hasbeen growing pressure for the government to return legalownership of the country's inshore fishing areas (410 qoliqolis in total, equaling roughly 31,000 square kilometers of coastal VILLAGE BY VILLAGEjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:36 PM Page 147148WORLD RESOURCES 2005 waters) to their traditional owners\u2014local chiefs. Legislation to do so is now being considered by Fiji's parliament. If the lawis enacted, the high chief of an area would hold legal title onbehalf of the community , but management decisions would bebased on the views of community elders and the needs of theresource users. Locally , villages have reported that their LMMA experience has given them a greater sense of cohesion and a sharpenedability to identify and address other community problems.Ucunivanua, for example, has raised funds to address twoproblems they had talked about for years: bringing electricity tothe village and working with the central government to build asea-wall to protect their sacred burial ground. In addition,having a successful resource-management plan enables commu-nities to better negotiate with industry and government. Forexample, when a Coral Coast hotel asked permission of the qoliqoli owners to build a jetty , the community used the oppor- tunity to ask the hotel, in turn, to improve its sewage treatment,since improved reef water quality was a major goal in thevillage's coastal management plan. Because some parts of Fiji are days of boat travel away from the capital of Suva, efforts to decentralize operations andextend LMMA work to these remote areas were initiated in2004. This is being done through the establishment and trainingof Qoliqoli Management Support Teams, composed of provin- cial government workers, overseas volunteers, and communitymembers trained in LMMA techniques. Community workshopsare conducted jointly with experienced LMMA members untilthe local team is able to work on its own.This approach has worked well in Kadavu, Fiji's fourth largest island with 33 qoliqolis . During 2004 the Qoliqoli Management Support Team under the leadership of the Roko(governor) was able to set up LMMAs in most of the 30 qoliqo- listhat did not have one. The Fisheries Department has indicated a keen interest in formalizing this model for allprovinces in Fiji, with hopes that the process will be well on itsway by the end of 2005. To date, nearly 60 LMMAs involving 125 communities with tabu areas have been declared in Fiji, covering about 20 percent of the country's inshore fishery . They may designatereefs only or include grass areas and mangroves as well. It isimportant to keep in mind that the primary reason for theseclosures is to recover the subsistence and artisanal value of thefishery rather than to restore marine biodiversity , although thatis certainly an important side benefit. In their initial planningfor an LMMA, communities invariably express the need togenerate greater local income, and see a restored fishery as oneof the best ways to achieve this. Government also understandsthat the recovery of the fishery can improve village life andperhaps reduce urban migration. Beyond Fiji: The LMMA Network The locally managed marine area approach spread within Fijiand other nations in the Asia-Pacific region through the creationof the LMMA Network, which now has members in Indonesia,Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, the Philippines, Palau,and Pohnpei. The network provides a forum for project teamsfrom these nations to share their experiences as they try to deter-mine the right conditions for LMMAs to work. The network is guided by a group of country LMMA leaders who manage on behalf of local project leaders. Thecountry leaders meet periodically and often include localproject representatives. They also arrange inter-country visits,Typically, a Locally Managed Marine Area evolves along a well-tested trajectory, with the following steps: Community discussions on goals and expectations Two-day action-planning workshop Community/district adoption of management plan Three-day biological monitoring workshop for projects with newlyadopted management plan that can include a no-take zone orrestrictions on gears and fishing methods Monitoring in each community within three months of managementplan adoption Training in socioeconomic monitoring (usually once biologicalmonitoring is well in place) Actual socioeconomic monitoring in sites where training has taken place Support visits to each site at least every six months Country- or region-wide meetings to discuss how project teams canwork together and how adaptive management can be done at thenational levelTHE FIJI LMMA NETWORK IN ACTION jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:36 PM Page 148149VILLAGE BY VILLAGE such as a 1999 meeting of local representatives from the West Papuan island of Biak, the Solomon Islands, and Fiji. Everythree years there is a network-wide gathering that includescommunity members from each site. The Process Once a community in Fiji makes its interest in local marinemanagement known, FLMMA and various partner organiza-tions determine which will be the lead agency , and discussionsare held with the community to ensure that the goals of allparties are clear and in harmony . Sometimes the initial planningand education process takes up to a year. FLMMA teams then offer assistance in three types of workshops: action planning, biological monitoring, and socio-economic monitoring. The action-planning workshops areadapted from Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) methodsand include sessions on mapping the village, understandinghistorical trends, and analyzing who the local stakeholders are.These sessions serve the dual purpose of exploring resource-management issues and instilling community members with theconfidence that they have the capacity to solve their ownproblems. The workshops then focus on biological and socioeco-nomic factors such as identification of resource use, threats tolocal resources, and the root causes of these threats. Finally , thecommunity develops a community action plan, designating whatwill be done and by whom. While the establishment of a tabuarea is usually a central part of a LMMA, the action plan also contains ways to addressother issues faced by the community , such as lack of incomesources, poor awareness of environmental issues, pollution,and sometimes declining community cohesiveness. Socio-economic monitoring tests whether thesebroader problems are being addressed. There is also ongoing assistance to communities to help them carry out theirplans and meet new needs that might arise,such as marking protected area boundaries,publishing LMMA rules, and training fishwardens to protect against poaching. A key element of success has been the teamwork approach that unites traditionalvalues and modern science. Villageworkshops are facilitated by governmentrepresentatives, NGOs, experiencedoutside community members, and the localuniversity . Questions often arise regardingfisheries regulations, traditional fishingrights, marine biology , pollution, andexperiences in other communities. Havinga mixed team not only ensures that properattention is given to each of these issues,but also develops trust and transfers skillsamong facilitators.Sustainability and Costs The estimated cost for the initial suite of community workshopsis about $3,000 per site in the first year, $1,000 in the secondyear, and $500 per year thereafter. The FLMMA has estab-lished 71 sites at a cost of approximately $400,000 in outsidefunding. Many of the costs of FLMMA 's work, includingworkshops, monitoring equipment, and buoys for marking off tabu areas, have been met with funding channeled through local NGOs supported by the U.S.-based Packard andMacArthur Foundations. Most community management plans also include an income-generating aspect. As part of the conservation initiativein Verata, a bioprospecting arrangement was set up with apharmaceutical company in which the community was paidlicensing fees for samples of medicinal plants and marine inver-tebrates collected in their district. Efforts have been made toensure that best practice in bioprospecting as outlined by theConvention on Biological Diversity was followed. These activi-ties earned $30,000, which the community put toward a trustfund to sustain their local fisheries work. At another site, a hotel pays $2 to a community trust fund for each scuba diver that utilizes the village's protected area. Thisprovides an income of roughly $1,000 per year. Another village is\"planting\" artificial live rock in its tabuarea to sell to exporters for the aquarium trade after marine life has colonized it. A companymakes the artificial live-rock substrate, brings it to the village, andassists in placing it on the reef. Local people need only scrape therock clean of algae occasionally . Within a year the companyharvests the rock with local help. The potential return to thecommunity is $4,000 a year. These sums are not large, but are suffi-cient to maintain LMMA work once it is established. 0102030405060708090100 Ucuniv anua Kumi Votu a Villages With Established Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs)Weekly Income (FJD$)1997 2000 2003FIGURE 2 HOUSEHOLD INCOME FROM SALES OF MARINE FIJI Source: Aalbersberg and Tawake 2005jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:36 PM Page 149150WORLD RESOURCES 2005 In addition, communities are able to charge more for the annual fishing licenses they sell to outsiders. One of the initialLMMA actions in Verata in 1997 was to put a moratorium onissuing such licenses, of which 60 costing $500 each had beengiven the previous year. In 2003 chiefs agreed to sell a singlelicense for $30,000. Customary practice allows qoliqoli owners to permit outsiders to enter for a specific purpose such asfishing or live-rock harvest. Although issued by the FisheriesDepartment, the license must be signed by the local chief (Veitayaki, Aalbersberg, and Tawake 2003). A successful LMMA is, in effect, an alternative income source. The increase in fishery resources not only improvesnutrition but also raises household income from market sales. (See Figure 2.) Marine resources, on average, make up more than 50 percent of the household income for these villages, andraise these households far above the median income level ofF$4000 a year in Fiji. FLMMA has been recognized with two international awards for its work: the United Nations 2002 Equator InitiativeAward for $30,000, and the 2004 Whitley People andEnvironment Award of \u00a330,000. The funds from these awardswere established as trust funds administered by FLMMA tosustain its work. Today FLMMA is a registered charitable trust in Fiji. Challenges As successful as many of the LMMAs in Fiji have been inincreasing fishery resources, improving habitat, generatingincome, and promoting community cohesion, there are stillproblems. Ironically , one is a direct result of the LMMA success:due to higher numbers of fish and other desirable species,outside fishers are drawn to the site to harvest. In addition, non-Fijians continue to fish in the tabu areas, as they are either unaware of the tabu or do not respect it. In response, FLMMA has supported the training of community members as fishwardens, granting them legal power to apprehend offenders. A deeper challenge involves working within the social framework in Fiji. Traditional culture does not usually allow forwomen to be a part of decision-making. This has proven to be adisadvantage, for in Fiji women are often the ones most involvedin collecting inshore marine resources and have unique knowl-edge about them. In Verata, for example, only the women knew how to locate and accurately count the kaikoso . Although women typically collect seafood for the community , the men make the decisionsregarding the management of such activities. Continued successof the LMMA movement will require addressing this incon-gruity . A gender program has recently been introduced in whichmeetings discussing the progress of the action plan are also heldwith a local women's group. It is also difficult for young peopleto participate in decision-making under the traditional societalnorms, as they may not have a say among the meeting of elders. The Way Forward In response to the challenge of poaching in tabu areas, commu- nities are taking a variety of actions, including installing buoysand signs to mark boundaries and having fish wardens trained by the Fisheries Department. Most communities locate their tabu areas in plain sight of the village, but others with more distantareas need boats and trained fish wardens empowered to arrestSmall-Scale Projects Can Influence National and International Policy. The success of the early projects at Ucunivanua, Cuvu, and Ono was persuasive. The Fijian government subsequently adopted the LMMAmethodology in the national Fisheries Department, while other govern-ment departments have applied the program's participatorymanagement techniques. Through the LMMA network, the benefits oflocal marine management have spread throughout the Pacific region\u2014a demonstration of how community-based ecosystem management canbe scaled up for greater poverty reduction. Success in Marine Conservation Can Promote Broad Economic Growth. As well as conserving marine resources for village consumption, the LMMAs at Ucunivanua and other villages have generated incomethrough commercial sales, bioprospecting, and tourism, demonstratingthat ecosystem management can be the first step to broadening thesources of wealth in a rural community. In addition to gaining economicbenefits, the villagers participating in local marine management havelearned management skills that they have applied to other problemsfacing the village. Traditional Management Methods Can Be Fused With Modern Expertise. At Ucunivanua, marine specialists from the University of the South Pacific worked with villagers, and within village traditions, toteach the skills needed for siting a tabu area, measuring it, monitoring it, and assessing its recovery. Experts provided the how-to skills, butvillagers had the final word on what should be done within the frameworkof their goals and values. Traditional Social Norms Can Impede Genuine Participation. For generations, Fijian culture has excluded women and young people fromcentral roles in decision-making, which is traditionally dominated bymale elders. Thus, despite a concerted effort to involve the entire village,not all community members participate equally in the Ucunivanua LMMA.A locally managed marine area may have to operate within traditionalnorms to gain acceptance yet promote participatory equality in ways thatchallenge those traditional values. Success Can Bring New Problems. The very success of local marine management\u2014the restoration of fish stocks\u2014has attracted outsidefishers to LMMA sites and brought new threats to village resources. Thecapacity to monitor and protect a tabu area requires new capacities from village members, who must take on enforcement duties as fish wardens,battling encroachment through both public education and legal means. LEARNING FROM FIJI'S LOCAL MARINE MANAGEMENTjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 5:36 PM Page 150151VILLAGE BY VILLAGE outsiders coming into their village waters. Usually a boat with a fish warden and other community members will simplyapproach an encroaching boat and tell it to leave. On occasion,they have apprehended people and confiscated boat and gear. Another option to protect against encroachment is to gazette protected areas, legally delineating them as no-fishingzones. This would allow police to patrol the area and makearrests. To date, only two of the FLMMA-inspired tabu areas have chosen the gazetting route. FLMMA has had meetings withthe national government to clarify the steps in the gazettingprocess and has written this up in the local language. The Fiji LMMA approach has broadened beyond just helping villages establish tabu areas and protect them from outsiders. Its participatory techniques and co-managementmethods are proving to be effective in improving local gover-nance in general and the delivery of government services. Inorder to maintain the momentum of this work, FLMMA iscontinually identifying and addressing needs as they arise andconducting participatory workshops to help local communities toaddress new challenges. As FLMMA emphasizes the need to involve all sectors of the community in a project, the inequitable representation ofgender and youth needs to be further explored. Efforts areunderway to find the best methods for mainstreaming womenand youth into projects without violating traditional societalnorms. In some communities, youths are encouraged to monitorthe LMMAs or develop plays with environmental themes forpresentation on special village occasions or at workshops.Women may be involved in waste management, such ascomposting or monitoring of the marine areas in which theyglean or fish. Holding separate women's meetings has inspired women to participate and discuss issues in a way that they wouldnot when men are present. Having the voices of women heard atthe decision-making level of coastal management, h owever, continues to be a challenge. LMMA implementation in Fiji has led to increased resources and a corresponding reduction of poverty in ruralcommunities that depend on marine resources. Equally impor-tant, the LMMA process has improved community solidarity aswell as regional and national policy . The challenge now is tosustain the LMMA movement and decentralize it as it spreadsthroughout Fiji and other parts of the Pacific . /orn8flip This case study was authored by Bill Aalbersberg, Alifereti Tawake, and Toni Parras.

We have presented numerous examples of how community-scale projects haveimproved the livelihoods of the poor by enabling them to manage fisheries, forests, and commonlands for income and sustainability . But the rural village economy we have focused on exists within a national and international frame- work of economic, legal, and political policies. This special section deals with innovations in povertypolicies at these larger scales. In the past five years, two developments have raised hopes thatnational governments and multilateral institutions can be mobilized to address world poverty: theestablishment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the crafting of national Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRSPs). In this section we explore how the concepts of environ- mental income and pro-poor environmental governance apply to these efforts. A key link betweenMDG and PRSP processes and the world's poor is the environment. The central question is: Do theMillennium Development Goals and the current crop of Poverty Reduction Strategies incorporatethe environment and governance as central features in fighting poverty? And if not, how can theybe made to incorporate these themes? SPECIAL SECTION MAKING THE MDGs AND PRSPs WORK FOR THE POOR AND THE ENVIRONMENTGLOBALDEVELOPMENTPOLICIES jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 153154WORLD RESOURCES 2005 THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS A Break from the Past In September 2000, the largest-ever gathering of world leaders adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration. The corner-stone of the Millennium Declaration is a global agenda of eightdevelopment goals, known as the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs), for cutting world poverty in half by 2015. The MDGshave been described as \"the most broadly supported, comprehen-sive, and specific poverty reduction targets the world has everestablished\" and the \"fulcrum\" on which international develop-ment policy pivots (UN Millennium Project 2005:2-4). In many ways, the MDGs represent an innovative approach to ending poverty worldwide. They constitute a break withbusiness-as-usual in the formulation of international develop-ment policy and the delivery of development aid. The MDGsaddress extreme poverty in many dimensions, including hunger,disease, and lack of adequate shelter, while also committingnations to take action to promote gender equality , education, andenvironmental sustainability . (See Table 1.) The Goals condense and refocus the as-yet-unrealized anti-poverty commitments ofthe past several decades into an action-oriented agenda. Perhaps the most important contribution of the MDGs is their infusion of accountability into the global campaign againstpoverty . The establishment of quantified, time-bound targetsand measurable indicators creates a benchmark for trackingprogress in reaching the Goals. The requirement for countries toproduce periodic MDG progress reports introduces a modicumof transparency that has been conspicuously absent from manyinternational processes. If these innovative aspects of the MDGs propel them to ultimate success by 2015, the world will look quite different thanit might otherwise have looked, given the disappointing develop-ment trajectory of the 1990s. Reaching the MDGs and theirassociated development targets would mean lifting 500 million ofthe world's people out of extreme poverty , liberating 300 millionfrom the suffering of hunger, and providing 350 millionadditional people with a reliable, sustainable source of safedrinking water (UN Millennium Project 2005:1). How is the world faring with efforts to attain the MDGs? The results so far have been mixed. In early 2005, the findingsof several monitoring studies were published as part of a five-year stock-taking of MDG progress. These reports generallyportray a spotty track record that differs by global region andacross the various Goals. With respect to halving incomepoverty (MDG-1), one study noted that East Asia had alreadyachieved the Goal, and South Asia is on target, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, most countries are in danger of falling farshort (IMF and World Bank 2005:2). Another report concludedthat much of the sub-Saharan region\u2014faced with continuinghunger and malnourishment as well as high levels of child andmaternal mortality\u2014is seriously off track for reaching most ofthe Goals. Even in Asia, where progress has been most rapid, hundreds of millions of people still live in extreme poverty .Other global regions\u2014such as Latin America, North Africaand the Middle East, and the transitional economies of theformer Soviet Union\u2014have mixed records, with slow or noprogress on some of the Goals (UN Millennium Project2005:15). (See Figure 1. ) For Environment and Governance, More of the Same Despite the innovative aspects of the MDG approach, the treat- ment of the environment and governance in the MDGs harkensback to old, outmoded ways of thinking. The environment isseen as an add-on rather than the essential foundation of allhuman well-being and economic production. From an opera-tional perspective, environmental sustainability is more of anafterthought than a cross-cutting concept that provides a point oforientation for all of the MDGs. The seventh of the eight MDGs commits nations to \"ensure environmental sustainability ,\" but this vaguely worded goal doeslittle to focus the attention of the world on the central role of theenvironment in supporting pro-poor economic growth. Ascurrently stated, Millennium Development Goal 7 (MDG-7)may actually be doing more harm than good by making it diffi-cult for nations to perceive, much less act on, crucially importantlinks between poverty reduction and environmental sustainabil-ity . Many believe that environmental issues have in fact lostground in international development circles in the past decadeor so, precisely because of the difficulty in pinning down theconcept of environmental sustainability in a way that govern-ments can understand and put to use in decision-making. In itscurrent construction, MDG-7 only exacerbates this dilemma. Focused on the Wrong Nature To track progress toward reaching MDG-7 on environmentalsustainability , the MDG framework establishes three global targets and eight global indicators . Unfortunately , these targets and indicators fail to capture the aspects of the environment thatexert the most powerful impacts on the lives of the poor or thatshow the most promise for ending extreme poverty . Target 9, the first of the three MDG environmental targets, calls for countries to \"integrate the principles of sustainabledevelopment into country policies and programs and reverse theloss of environmental resources.\" Accompanying this rathervague, general statement are five quantitative indicators. (See Table 2.) One of these (Indicator 29: Proportion of population using solid fuels) is directly relevant to how the poor use theenvironment. But the other Target 9 indicators fail to shed muchlight on aspects of environmental sustainability that matter mostto the poor. Instead, some of the current indicators track issuesof global environmental concern, such as per capita carbonjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 154155MAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORK dioxide emissions and consumption of ozone-depleting chemi- cals. Others touch on issues of importance to the poor, such asland area covered by forests and land area set aside to protectbiodiversity , but do not measure directly the ability of the poorto access key ecosystems as a source of environmental incomeand sustainable livelihoods or to protect the ecosystems on whichthey depend from depredation and damage by outside interestsand powerful elites. Targets 10 and 11, the second and third MDG environmen- tal targets, commit nations to \"halve by 2015 the proportion ofpeople without sustainable access to safe drinking water andsanitation\" and to \"have achieved by 2020 a significant improve-ment in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers.\" Thesetargets and their accompanying indicators are more directly pro-poor, but they too fall short when it comes to establishing broadmarkers for progress based on an explicit recognition of ecosys- tem integrity as the touchstone for sustainability . For instance,under Target 10, countries should focus not just on the numbersof people hooked up to water and sanitation services, but also onthe need for integrated water resource planning and policies thattake account of a wide range of other considerations. Theseinclude water demand, water supply , and water quality issues, aswell as water-project impacts on other community objectives andon environmental management goals. Other suitable indicatorscould focus on governance issues that relate to the poor's accessto water, such as the reliability of water service or the pricing ofwater service relative to income. At the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the international community created additionaltargets related to environmental sustainability , sometimesTABLE 1 THE MILLENIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women Goal 4: Reduce child mortality Goal 5: Improve maternal health Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability Goal 8: Develop a global partner- ship for development Target 1: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 per day Target 2: Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger Target 3: Ensure that by 2015 children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling Target 4: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of educa- tion no later than 2015 Target 5: Reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate Target 6 : Reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio Target 7: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS Target 8: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases Target 9: Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs, and reverse the loss of environmental resources Target 10: Halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation Target 11: Have achieved by 2020 a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers Target 12: Develop further an open, rule-based, predictable, nondiscriminatory trading system (includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction\u2014both nationally and internationally) Target 13: Address the special needs of the Least Developed Countries (includes tariff- and quota-free access for Least Developed Countries' exports, enhanced program of debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries [HIPCs] and cancellation of official bilateral debt, and more generous official development assistance for countries committed to poverty reduction) Target 14: Address the special needs of landlocked developing countries and small island developing states (through the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and 22nd General Assembly provisions) Target 15: Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries through national and international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term Target 16: In cooperation with developing countries, develop and implement strategies for decent and productive work for youth Target 17: In cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to affordable drugs in developing countries Target 18: In cooperation with the private sector, make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications technologies Source: United Nations 2000ajp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0 Percent of Population Below $1/Day, 1990Percent of Population Below $1/Day, 2001Regions Countries POVERTY HAS DECREASED SINCE 1990Uganda Mali SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA SOUTH ASIA EAST ASIANiger CambodiaBurkina Faso Viet NamMoldovaSierra Leone El SalvadorPOVERTY HAS INCREASED SINCE 1990 PakistanGhana 156WORLD RESOURCES 2005 FIGURE 1 PROGRESS TOWARD MDG-1: HALVE EXTREME POVERTY BY 2015 This graph shows changes in poverty from 1990 to 2001.

Selected outlying countriesand regions are identified. Source: World Bank 2005referred to as \"MDG-Plus\" targets. (See Table 3.) These targets specifically incorporate pro-poor elements related to sustainablemanagement and use of ecosystems, such as application of theecosystem approach in conserving biodiversity as well asmaintaining or restoring fish stocks to levels that can supportsustainable yields. Realizing that the MDG targets were broad in their outlines, the MDG framers encouraged countries to modify theglobal MDG-7 targets to suit their local conditions, as well asto establish new, country-specific targets and indicators. Arecent UNDP review shows that about half the 100 reportingcountries have set one or more MDG-7 targets that modify oradd to the global targets (UNDP 2005a:3). For example, several nations have set specific goals for maintaining or increasingforest cover, or expanding the network of protected areas forbiodiversity conservation. But despite these worthy efforts, countries are not, for the most part, paying sufficient attention to developing and reporting on a broad set of targets and indicators that wouldaccurately gauge their progress toward the goal of MDG-7 ofensuring environmental sustainability . UNDP's analysis of MDG-7 implementation suggests that environmentalmonitoring and reporting are not being undertaken systemati-cally .

But at the same time, many countries have not drawn on existing data from other environment-related efforts, such asNational Strategies for Sustainable Development, State ofthe Environment Reports, and National Biodiversity ActionPlans (UNDP 2005b:5). Getting the Targets and Indicators Right One of the most important innovations of the MDG approachis its ability to make governments more accountable for theirperformance in improving human well-being. By stating goalsand measuring progress in clear, straightforward language, theMDGs make it easy for civil-society groups to evaluate progresstoward human development goals and to issue a public \"reportcard\" on a government's success or failure. Unfortunately ,the lack of clear, comprehensive targets and indicators formeasuring the capacity of ecosystems to provide sustainableenvironmental income for the poor means that the \"accountabil-ity effect\" of the MDG approach is not yet applicable to theworld's environmental goals. Until the environmental frameworkof the MDGs is fixed, short-run progress towards the other goalsis at risk of being unsustainable. Realigning the MDG framework to correct its environmen- tal shortcomings begins with an acceptance of ecosystems as thekey to environmental income, the most direct way that natureaffects the poor. This realignment should be guided by the recentfindings of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a four-yearstudy conducted by more than 1,300 scientists from 95 countriesto ascertain the consequences of ecosystem change for humanwell-being (MA 2005a). The scientists determined that in allregions, and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, the condition and management of ecosystems is a \"dominant factor\" affectingthe chances of success in fighting poverty . They concluded thatthe degradation of ecosystems is already a \"significant barrier\"to achieving the MDGs. In fact, many of the regions facing thebiggest hurdles in reaching the MDGs coincide with thoseexperiencing significant ecosystem degradation (MA 2005a:18). Reconceptualizing Target 9 Reframing MDG-7 requires that the wording of Target 9\u2014notto mention its conceptual underpinnings\u2014should make clear theimportance of ecosystems to the poor, and be grounded in anappreciation of the central role of healthy , well-functioningecosystems in ensuring sustainability . The current wording of Target 9 has two quite distinct pieces: Target 9: (1) \"Integrate the principles of sustainable devel- opment into country policies and programs and (2) reversethe loss of environmental resources.\" Both pieces need to be treated separately and reworded. In addition, another component needs to be added to Target 9 tocapture the importance of natural resource access to the poor. (See Table 4 for a summary of suggested changes in the wordingand indicators of Target 9, as discussed below.) 1. Focus on ecosystem capacity Let's first deal with the second half of Target 9: \"reverse the lossof environmental resources.\" Conceptually , this is the mostBiodiversity Fisheries WaterChemical PollutionTABLE 3 ADDITIONAL TARGETS AGREED TO AT THE WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Encourage by 2010 the application of the ecosystem approach (Paragraph 30) Establish representative marine protected area networks by 2012 (Paragraph 32) Achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of loss of biodiversity (Paragraph 44) Maintain or restore fish stocks to a level that canproduce a sustainable yield by 2015 (Paragraph 31) Develop integrated water resources management andwater efficiency plans by 2005 (Paragraph 26) By 2020, minimize significant adverse effects onhuman health and the environment associated withthe production and use of toxic chemicals, via use oftransparent, science-based risk assessment and riskmanagement procedures, and taking account of theprecautionary principle (Paragraph 23) Source: United Nations 2002, Johannesburg Plan of Implementation MAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORKjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 157158WORLD RESOURCES 2005 important section of the target. To refocus this section of the target on ecosystems\u2014the primary \"environmental resources\"used by the poor\u2014the current wording should be replaced withthe following: \"maintain or restore the capacity of ecosys- tems to provide critical ecosystem services.\" As the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment demonstrates, humans have changed ecosystems extensively over the past 50years. Most ecosystem services are being used unsustainably ,and the capacity of ecosystems to deliver these services is beingpersistently eroded. This growing pressure on ecosystems riskssudden, potentially irreversible changes, such as the collapse offisheries or the creation of \"dead zones\" in coastal waters. Also,because the costs of the damage are borne disproportionately bythe poor, ecosystem degradation contributes to inequities acrosssocial and ethnic groups and is sometimes the principal factorbehind poverty and social conflict (MA 2005a:17). Environmental sustainability , then, is defined by maintain- ing the ability of ecosystems to deliver the ecosystem servicesthat rich and poor depend on. Some degree of tradeoff betweendifferent kinds of ecosystem services is inevitable as humanpopulations expand and as poor people around the world aspireto higher standards of living. H owever, the key is to ensure that these tradeoffs are managed in ways that preserve the overallintegrity of ecosystems and their capacity to provide the fullrange of services valued by humans. 2. Reconceptualize Target 9 indicators Indicators for a realigned MDG Target 9 should be focusedaround those aspects of ecosystem function and integrity that bearmost directly on the livelihoods of the poor. For example, the ruralpoor in developing countries rely on common pool resources togenerate significant amounts of environmental income as animportant component of their livelihoods. At least some of the indicators for MDG Target 9 should capture this. Potential indica-tors that would reflect the state of common pool resources and theassociated income opportunities they afford include: extent and condition of communal fisheries (coastal and inland); extent and condition of forested areas held in common; watershed conditions on communally held lands (e.g., vegetativecover and water availability , including groundwater trends). Cambodia provides an example of good practice here. Officials were thinking along these lines when they created their ownMDG-7 targets and indicators, which track communally heldresources of direct importance to the rural poor (UNDP2005c:6). Their indicators include: the proportion of fishing lots released to local communities(targeted to reach 60 percent by 2015, up from 56 percent in1998), and the number of community-based fisheries (targeted to reach 589in 2015, up from 264 in 2000). In addition to tracking common pool resources, Target 9 indica- tors should acknowledge the reliance poor households place onsmall-scale farming. Relevant indicators would include: soil fertility (such as nutrient availability or percentage oforganic matter in top soil; land degradation (such as salinization; waterlogging; soil loss). 3. Include all institutions; add targets and time-tables As currently worded, the first half of Target 9 states: \"IntegrateTABLE 4 SUGGESTED REWORDING OF MDG-7, TARGET 9 Targets Target 9 (original wording).

In other words, this section of Target 9 should beworded: \"Integrate the principles of sustainable develop- ment into local, national, and international policies andprograms.\" MDG-7 commits institutions at all levels of gover- nance to make environmental sustainability a reality on theground, and the wording of Target 9 should clearly reflect this.All such institutions, and not just national-level ones, should beaccountable for their performance in this respect, and shouldreport regularly on their progress. In addition, the general intent of this target needs to be translated into specific, time-framed actions that can bemonitored from year to year. Revamping Target 9 to make thiselement verifiable and time-bound is crucial to the ability ofcivil society to hold government accountable and exert pressurefor improved performance. 4. Add a target that ensures resource access Target 9, as currently worded, does not capture the importanceof access\u2014both physical access to resources as well as access toinformation and participation in environmental decision-making\u2014to the livelihoods of the poor. The importance ofaccess, manifest in secure tenure and community-level institu-tions that are poor-friendly , is one of the principal conclusionsof Chapter 3. When we say that the MDGs should better reflectthe importance of environmental governance to the poor, this isthe governance we mean. The \"sustainability\" that MDG-7 ismeant to ensure is only meaningful if the poor share \"environ-mental access\"\u2014the combination of physical access and environmental empowerment. This kind of environmentalaccess is the basis of equity in the use of ecosystems\u2014certainlyone of the components of sustainability . Target 9 cannot really accommodate these concepts; they should be captured in a separate Governance Target that couldread: \"Ensure the poor access to environmental resources and decision-making.\" Such a target would be directed at institutions of governance at all levels: national, sub-national,and international.Indicators for this target should revolve around: tenure (proportion of rural households with secure tenure tothe resources on which their livelihoods are based), access to environmental information (proportion of ruralhouseholds with access to official information, such as exten-sion services on ecosystem-based agricultural management),and participation in local environmental decisions (indicators ofpro-poor decentralization of decision-making on environmen-tal management). Monitoring and developing indicators of environmental gover- nance is still a relatively new field, and such indicators might haveto be adjusted for each nation. H owever, Cambodia again offers an example of best practice. Officials have set targets and indicatorsencompassing rural tenure, including an overall target of increas-ing the proportion of the population in both urban and rural areaswith access to land security , as well as increasing the percentage of land parcels having titles in both urban and rural areas from 15 percent in 2000 to 65 percent in 2015 (UNDP 2005c:6).MAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORK jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 159160WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Encouraging Environment and Governance as Cross-Cutting Themes Environment and governance must be used as screens and points of orientation for all the other Goals, not just MDG-7. TheMDGs are designed to be a collection of interdependent goalsthat must be pursued in concert with one another. Integratedstrategies featuring interventions that advance multiple goals andtargets simultaneously will have faster, deeper, more cost-effective,and more lasting impact on human well-being than sequentialmeasures addressing individual goals in isola tion. H owever, all too often, governments operate as if the goals were separate,independent entities, resulting in little coordination or coopera-tion between various ministries and agencies whose actions bearimportantly on the likelihood of reaching MDG targets by 2015. To be effective, MDG-7 on ensuring environmental sustain- ability must prompt us to raise questions about how strategies andactivities under each of the other goals affect the environment andthe long-term capacity of ecosystems to provide the fundamentalservices required for human survival and well-being. Governmentsand institutions that fail to recognize this reality and act upon it areat high risk that the investments and reforms they advocate forreaching one goal are likely to undermine efforts to reach another goal. Nowhere is this more true than in the case of the environ-mental assets of the poor and the potential for environmentalincome to contribute to poverty reduction. An integrated approach to meeting the MDG targets should be focused on improved management of ecosystems andtheir capacity to sustainably deliver multiple types of ecosystemservices (MA 2005b:19.2). A goal-by-goal analysis of the impli-cations of ecosystem conditions for achieving the 2015 MDGtargets indicates that most of them depend directly on ecosystemservices, including the targets on poverty , hunger, gender equal-ity , child mortality , disease, and sustainable development.Moreover, multiple MDGs depend on the same ecosystemservices (MA 2005b:19.4-5). To reach all the MDGs simultaneously , it is crucially important to look carefully across the board at the requiredinvestments in ecosystem services (that is, the continued capacityof ecosystems to provide provisioning, supporting, and regulat-ing services) and the necessary governance reforms andinstitutional capacity-building. For instance, interventions toreach MDG Target 1 on eradicating extreme poverty must fullyexplore and integrate the role that ecosystems and their servicescan play in improving livelihoods. Similarly , efforts to reach TABLE 5 SOME EXAMPLES OF COUNTRY/CONTEXT-SPECIFIC MDG-7 TARGETS Global Target 9 Forest cover Protected areas Energy and climate change Pollution Source: UNDP 2005bModified or New Targets Maintain at least 60% of the country under forest cover in perpetuity (Bhutan) Maintain forest cover at 60% (2000 level) through 2015 (Cambodia) Increase forest cover from 8.2% in 2000 to 9.0% in 2015 (Mongolia) Increase afforestation rate from 27% to 35% by 2040 (Romania) Increase forest cover from 11.9 million ha in 2000 to 12.8 million ha in 2015 (Senegal) Increase forest cover by 115,000 ha between 2002 and 2006 (Tunisia) Extend forest cover to 43% by 2010 (Vietnam Nam) Increase ratio of protected territories from 34.9% in 1990 to 35.9% in 2015 (Bulgaria) Maintain 23 protected areas (3.3m ha, 1993) and 6 forest-protected areas (1.35m ha) through 2015 (Cambodia) Increase proportion of areas covered by natural protectorates to 25% by 2015 (Egypt) Protected areas and reserves to cover 10.8% of the national territory (Gabon) Increase area protected to maintain biological diversity from 0.2% in 1990 to 1.9% in 2015 (Kyrgyzstan) Increase land area protected to maintain biological diversity from 13.2% in 2000 to 30% in 2015 (Mongolia) Increase proportion of protected land area from 2.56% in 1990 to 19% by 2015 (Romania) Increase area protected for biological diversity from 8% in 1990 to 12% in 2015 (Senegal) Expand network of national and biosphere reserves and national parks to 10.4% of overall territory (Ukraine) Reduce CO 2emissions against 1988 baseline in fulfillment of Kyoto Protocol obligations (Bulgaria) Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8% of CO 2equivalent between 2008 and 2012 (Romania) Increase use of renewable energy in electricity generation from 29% in 1999 to 33.6% in 2015 (Slovenia) Increase share of renewable energy to 8% of commercial primary energy by 2011 (Thailand) Decrease total discharge of major pollutants by 10% between 2000 and 2005 (China) Stabilize ambient air pollution from stationary and mobile sources by 2015 (Ukraine) Attain national standards in air and water pollution by 2005 (Vietnam)jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 160161MDG Target 2 on ending hunger need to be based on an ecosys- tem-focused analysis of how to most effectively maintain andimprove soil fertility , water quality and supply , plant geneticresources, watershed management, and so forth. To date, howev er, such assessments have rarely been under- taken in national and international planning for the MDGs. TheIMF and World Bank have proposed a five-point agenda foraccelerating progress toward the MDGs from which improvedenvironmental management is conspicuously absent (IMF andWorld Bank 2005:3) Since this agenda was developed withparticular reference to Sub-Saharan Africa\u2014where ecosystemdegradation is a principal constraint to lasting poverty reduc-tion\u2014the omission seems all the more glaring. Investments in ecosystem services can produce synergistic effects across several targets: for instance, investments in water-shed protection can provide multiple benefits in terms of safedrinking water, reduction of waterborne diseases, and floodprotection (MA 2005b:19.39). Improved energy services will bea necessary input for reaching most of the MDGs, and a switchto modern, clean fuels and improved cookstove technology willproduce multiple dividends related to improved indoor airquality , better child and maternal health, empowerment ofwomen, and environmental sustainability (MA 2005b:19.40-41). At the same time, some tradeoffs will be necessary , and it is vital to weigh these with reference to environmental and gover-nance considerations. Although the UN Millennium Project isnotable for devoting considerable attention to the role of environ-mental management in meeting the MDGs, its recommendationsfor reaching the 2015 targets stop short of fully integratingecosystems as a cross-cutting orientation. For instance, rapidscale-up of MDG-based investments is a focal point for theserecommendations, but they contain no discussion of the need toconsider trade-offs in critical areas such as infrastructure develop-ment (UN Millennium Project 2005:31-35). One constraint to a cross-cutting, ecosystems-based approach to reaching the MDGs is the inadequacy of environ-mental monitoring systems in many parts of the developing world.Documenting and assessing progress toward the 2015 targets andthe sustainability of critical ecosystem functioning may requirestrengthening of monitoring systems for soil fertility , hydrologicalservices (water filtration, aquifer recharging, flood prevention),maintenance of biodiversity , climate regulation, and other keyecosystem services (MA 2005b:19.3). Indicators should reflect howlocal people value ecosystems, including for food, medicines,cultural purposes, and other uses. Most importantly , indicatorsneed to better capture the impact of extracting a particular bundleof services from an ecosystem on its resilience and capacity toprovide future services. Investments in measuring, monitoring, andmapping poverty and ecosystem services will give policymakers atlocal and national levels access to indicators reflecting the linkagesbetween poverty and the environment, which can be used to shapepro-poor growth strategies. The slow progress that countries and institutions have made on integrating sustainability into their operations is an indicationnot of an idea whose time has passed, but rather of the deep structural changes that it requires. In the context of the MDGs,this means that rich countries and international institutions needto lead by example. New and increased long-term financingmechanisms are needed to strengthen environmental capacitiesand support integrated, ecosystem-based implementation of theMDGs in developing countries. Countries will likely see fasterprogress on targets aimed at areas such as hunger, water, andsanitation that respond more directly to increased financial andtechnical inputs (Clemens et al. 2004:26). The experiencesgained in these areas of quick response will be an importantfoundation for longer-term efforts to design and implementnational sustainable development strategies. POVERTY MAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORKjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 161POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGIES (PRSPs) Also in Need of an Environmental Overhaul Countries seeking debt relief and concessional loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mustprepare a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)\u2014adocument detailing the nation's philosophy and plan for achiev-ing substantive cuts in national poverty . PRSPs have alsoemerged as a principal policy instrument and process for direct-ing aid from developed countries and international agencies tohelp developing countries implement the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Unfortunately , like the Millennium Development Goals, the PRSP process suffers from critical shortcomings when it comesto acknowledging the central role of ecosystems in the lives ofthe poor, and their potential to reduce rural poverty . Among thecurrent crop of PRSPs, the strategies of most countries fall short of a full commitment to better ecosystem management that benefits the poor. Maximizing environmental income opportunities for the poor requires that PRSPs and other formal poverty-reduction plans recognize the importance of theirenvironmental assets, and embody an ecosystem-based perspec-tive to ensure long-term sustainability of rural livelihoods. A New Approach to Development? PRSPs were established in 1999 by the World Bank and IMF asa response to the shortcomings of their earlier developmentapproach centered on \"structural adjustment\"\u2014an approachthat made lending contingent on adoption of certain macroeco-nomic policies that would change the nation's basic economicstructure and prime it for growth. Unfortunately , in manycountries following the structural adjustment approach, thepromised growth either did not appear or did not result in suffi-cient poverty alleviation. In fact, in many cases, the approachexacerbated existing inequalities, creating a \"crisis of legitimacy\"surrounding the lending approach of major development institu-tions by the mid-1990s (Reed 2004:7). The intent behind PRSPs was to replace the approach in which the World Bank and IMF attempted to mold a nation'sdevelopment policies along fixed lines as a condition for lending.Instead, the PRSP approach would let countries decide forthemselves which development policies to pursue, so long as thepolicies were aimed at achieving significant, broad-based reduc-tions in poverty and also emphasized governance reforms,including increased transparency and accountability of govern-ment decision-making (Oksanen and Mersmann 2003:126). Six years after their adoption by the World Bank and IMF , PRSPs are now in transition from the preparation stageto implementation. About 70 countries are expected toeventually prepare PRSPs (Levinsohn 2003:2); as of 2004, 53PRSPs had been produced, including 39 full PRSPs and 14 preliminary versions (Boj\u00f6 et al. 2004:5). Besides heavilyindebted and aid-dependent countries, other countries havealso chosen to prepare PRSPs, including many CentralEuropean countries as well as middle-income countries likeBrazil (Driscoll and Evans 2004a:3). PRSPs are becoming increasingly important in shaping the planning, policy , and budget priorities of developing countries,as well as in directing the aid flows from richer countries. ThePRSP process is credited with focusing the attention of govern-ments and donor agencies on poverty reduction as a central,priority concern rather than a special, marginal activity(Driscoll and Evans 2004b:3). In addition, PRSPs represent amore \"upstream\" approach to development aid, that is, anapproach that redirects donor assistance from specific, discreteprojects towards integrated support for sector-wide plans andeven general budget support. Already , in eight Africancountries, up to one-fifth of aid flow is now for general budgetsupport (Chiche and Hervio 2004 in Driscoll and Evans2004b:5). PRSPs are also intended to draw increased attentionto the non-income dimensions of poverty , such as empower-ment of poor and marginalized communities, as well asaddressing gender disparities (Levinsohn 2003:3). 162WORLD RESOURCES 2005 The World Bank has set out five core principles underpinning the develop- ment and implementation of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs): Country-driven and country-owned. PRSPs should involve broad-based participation by civil society and the private sector at all stages, includ-ing formulation, implementation, and outcome-based monitoring. Results-oriented. PRSPs should focus on outcomes that will benefit the poor. Comprehensive. PRSPs should recognize the multidimensional nature of poverty and the scope of actions needed to effectively reduce poverty. Partnership-oriented. PRSPs should involve the coordinated participa- tion of development partners, including bilateral and multilateralagencies and nongovernmental organizations. Based on medium- and long-term perspectives. PRSPs should recog- nize that sustained poverty reduction will require action over the mediumand long terms as well as in the short run. The Bank also specifies four key areas of content for PRSPs: 1. Macroeconomic and structural policies to support sustainable growth in which the poor participate. 2. Improvements in governance, including public-sector financial management.3. Appropriate sectoral policies and programs.4. Realistic costing and appropriate levels of funding for major programs.CORE PRINCIPLES AND KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PRSP APPROACH jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 PRSP Approach Faring? PRSPs improve on the previous, structural adjustment approach of the World Bank and IMF in several important respects. For one,developing-country governments are the principal architects oftheir own development strategies. They are ostensibly free todecide for themselves how to use external aid flows, which intheory should increase national ownership of the plans and lessenthe potential for problems caused by lack of country buy-in.PRSPs are also intended to be subject to continual revision andimprovement over the years, serving as an umbrella for coordinat-ing the efforts of various agencies in different economic and socialsectors. In addition, the PRSP process was designed to promoteincreased transparency by governments and internationalagencies alike, as well as to feature meaningful involvement by civilsociety in the choice of development priorities (Reed 2004:8). How well is the PRSP approach working in practice? The reviews are decidedly mixed. Assessments have been undertakenby many different actors, including the World Bank and IMFthemselves. The consensus seems to be that PRSP processes havesomewhat increased transparency , helped sharpen the focus oninvestments and institutions designed to reduce poverty , andprovided greater opportunities for civil-society input and partic-ipation in some countries (Reed 2004:9). Some evidenceindicates increased expenditures on health, education, and trans-port (as a percentage of GDP) in PRSP countries (OED2004:30), and some assessments point to PRSPs as a catalyst forimprovements in public financial management (World Bank andIMF 2003:28,32-33). However, PRSPs have also been heavily criticized for shortcomings inherent in the PRSP approach as well asproblems with how the process has actually unfolded in devel- oping countries. Critics say that PRSPs have helped providegeneral budget support to poor countries without adequatecommitments from these countries to specific poverty reduc-tion outcomes, identification of the populations who willbenefit from proposed anti-poverty programs, and provisionsfor monitoring and evaluation of expected outcomes (Reed2004:9). Others note that, since PRSPs are prerequisites fordebt relief and concessional lending, countries have strongincentives to tell donors what they think the donors want tohear rather than what the country is truly committed to doingto help reduce poverty (Tharakan and MacDonald 2004:7). Inaddition, the initial crop of PRSPs was not very clear aboutpriorities or costs for anti-poverty measures (World Bank andIMF 2003:15,42). Mainstreaming\" the Environment in PRSPs: The Unfulfilled Promise Another important criticism of PRSPs has been their failure to adequately \"mainstream\" environmental issues, that is, toaccount for the role of resource access and environmentalmanagement in the lives of the poor, and their potential contri-bution to poverty reduction programs. Several studies haveassessed the extent to which PRSPs integrate poverty-environ-ment relationships\u2014in general or in specific sectors, such asforestry , biodiversity , and water. In most of these assessments, thetexts of PRSPs were analyzed and scores were assigned toindicate whether key issues were mentioned in the PRSP textand how fully these issues were analyzed or discussed. Within the Environment Department of the World Bank, ateam of analysts has conducted several studies of environmen-tal mainstreaming in PRSPs (Boj\u00f6 and Reddy 2002, 2003a,2003b; Boj\u00f6 et al. 2004). Based on textual analysis of all available PRSPs, the authors found that the extent of environ-mental mainstreaming varies widely , with final versions ofPRSPs tending to reflect better mainstreaming than initial (so-called interim) versions. They also concluded that issues relatedto the environmental health targets of the MDGs (safe drink-ing water and sanitation) receive more attention in PRSPs thando issues of natural resources management. A separate study of forest-related issues in 36 PRSPs (full andinterim) found that treatment of forest issues was generally weak.Especially lacking was analysis of causal links between povertyand forest resources, as well as the role of natural resources andecosystem services in determining human well-being. Given theseshortcomings, the PRSPs analyzed included surprisingly manyforest-related policies and programs in their agendas for action,most of which were apparently drawn from pre-existing nationalforest strategies and plans. For example, the PRSPs of Malawiand Mozambique were particularly strong in integrating forest-MAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORK \"jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 163WORLD RESOURCES 2005 sector activities based on national forest planning processes (Oksanen and Mersmann 2003:123,136-7). (See Figure 2.) Assessment of the mainstreaming of biodiversity-relatedthemes in 15 PRSPs found that while declines in biodiversitywere analyzed in 12 of the strategies, only one PRSP (Zambia)developed a policy prescription that integrated biodiversityconservation and poverty reduction. Most of the PRSPsanalyzed called for efforts to diversify agricultural species, but only two PRSPs (Ethiopia and Mozambique) mentioned using different varieties of agricultural crops (Bindraban et al. 2004:19, 21). This is an important distinction, since usingdiverse varieties of the same crop species is a key strategy forreducing agricultural risk by improving disease resistance andenhancing tolerance of harsh environmental conditions. A study of water issues in 10 PRSPs concluded that theseissues were inadequately and inconsistently incorporated inPRSPs, especially with respect to integrating the need forclose links between strategies for developing additional water-supply and sanitation infrastructure and strategies formanaging water resources for productive uses by the poor,including agriculture, small-scale fishing, and small industry(Slaymaker and Newborne 2004:1-2). Such weaknesses in integrating environmental issues into PRSPs seem to be more often a genuine oversight rather than the resultof conscious priority-setting. In a study by the World BankEnvironment Department, many PRSPs that scored low forattention to environmental issues were produced by countrieswhere the poverty-environment linkage is strong\u2014places withheavy dependence on natural resources for rural livelihoods,high levels of traditional fuel use, or low levels of access to safewater and sanitation (Boj\u00f6 and Reddy 2003b:14). This finding is supported by experiences from the field. For example, reports from Nigeria indicate that environmentalconcerns were barely mentioned in initial drafts of its \"home-grown\" version of the PRSP (known as the National EconomicEmpowerment and Development Strategy , or NEEDS), andefforts were made to incorporate environmental issues only afterthe draft was distributed to stakeholders, \"more or less [as] anafterthought\" (Oladipo 2004). Most assessments concluded that the degree of environ- mental mainstreaming in PRSPs is strongly influenced by thenature of civil-society participation in their preparation.

Fewerstill included targets for future progress. Source: Boj\u00f6 et al. 2004 Area under forestUse of solid to safe waterAccess to Page 164165example, the top-scoring cluster of PRSPs in the World Bank studies of environmental mainstreaming also scored high onpublic participation in PRSP development (Boj\u00f6 et al. 2004:15). Many studies also note that inclusion of environmental issues in PRSPs sometimes appears to be driven more by donorconcerns rather than domestic political priorities. In severalcases, donors have pressed reluctant governments to provideopportunities for significant engagement of civil society in PRSPprocesses. Indeed, closer relationships between civil society and donors has been an outgrowth of the evolution of PRSPprocesses in several countries (PRSP Monitoring and SynthesisProject 2002:5). In the PRSPs of many countries, poverty diagnosis and analysis emphasize technical solutions to poverty-environmentissues. Less frequently do PRSPs address more controversial,politically charged issues of access, ownership, control, and rightsto environmental resources and how these impact the poor'scapacity to derive environmental income from productive assets.However, in a few instances, participation by activist NGOs has begun to shape the content of poverty analysis in PRSPs; forexample, the PRSPs of Uganda and Honduras have begun toaddress issues of access to and control of natural resources inresponse to concerns expressed in consultations with civil society(Waldman et al. 2005:32). Another oversight in many PRSPs is the failure to assess the potential impacts of proposed growth policies on environmentalsustainability , maintenance of critical ecosystem functioning,and key natural resources relied on by the poor for their liveli-hoods (Oksanen and Mersmann 2003:137). For example, PRSPsfrequently propose incentives to encourage high-input, export-oriented agriculture to stimulate economic growth, yet rarely dothey analyze the risks of this approach for harming small-scalerural farmers and weakening their ability to manage localnatural resources (Tharakan and MacDonald 2004:25). The PRSP of Nicaragua refers to intensive production of cash crops, including coffee, for export, but this discussion doesnot include measures to improve food security or to diversifyrural incomes through nonfarm activities (Tharakan andMacDonald 2004:32). The PRSP of Sri Lanka presents goals forrapid economic growth through expansion of cash-crop agricul-ture, plantation activity , and fisheries, but provides no analysis ofthe implications of such growth on natural-resource depletion orwaste generation (Tharakan and MacDonald 2004:38-9). Several countries have begun to carry out their PRSPs and thus have been required to submit annual progress reports onPRSP implementation. In general, these annual reports giveeven less attention to environmental sustainability than thePRSPs themselves. In many cases, policies and programsproposed in a country's PRSP are absent entirely from discus-sions in its progress reports. Studies by the World Bank foundthat several countries whose PRSP was very highly rated forenvironmental mainstreaming submitted annual reports thatreflected little progress in implementing environment-relatedmeasures (Boj\u00f6 et al. 2004:19).Upgrading the Treatment of Environmental Income in PRSPs PRSPs have become one of the most powerful vehicles for carrying forward a commitment to better ecosystem manage-ment that benefits the poor. H owever, the processes and content of PRSPs in many countries falls far short of thepotential. Even among strategies recognized within the devel-opment community for a relatively high degree ofenvironmental mainstreaming, PRSPs rarely go far enough inproposing measures that would empower the poor withequitable and sustainable opportunities to derive income fromtheir environmental assets. What can be done to ensure that PRSPs advance a pro- poor agenda for maximizing sustainable environmentalincome while maintaining the integrity of critical ecosystemfunctions? At least seven key issues need to be examined. (See Framework for Upgrading PRSPs.) In the discussion below, examples of good practice in crafting PRSPs are highlightedto show that adequate treatment of these issues in PRSPs isboth possible and desirable. 1. Ecosystem Orientation and Importance of Environmental Income PRSPs need to do a better job of recognizing the importance of environmental income and the role it can play in reducingpoverty . The approach taken in PRSPs to enhancing rural liveli-hoods should be based on an awareness of the importance ofecosystems as the ultimate basis for all economic activity and akey contributor to human welfare, and should seek to ensure thelong-term sustainability of ecosystem services and the livelihoodsderived from them.MAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORK To assess the treatment of environmental income opportunities for the poor, WRR 2005 examined 20 PRSPs that have been touted by the World Bank, the United Nations, and other development experts as the best examples todate of environmental mainstreaming. We found several examples ofproposed policies and programs that, if effectively implemented, wouldgenuinely improve the prospects for the poor to derive sustainable incomefrom their environmental assets. Many of these examples are described inthe text of this chapter. Of course, whether these \"paper promises\" can or will be translated into progress on the ground is the crux of the matter. Our desk study suggeststhat PRSPs with the most extensive and successful mainstreaming ofenvironment and environmental income opportunities were also the mostimpeccably presented documents, in some cases perhaps indicating thatinternational consultants, provided through assistance from the donorcommunity, had a large hand in their preparation. The strength of the polit-ical will behind these environmental proposals remains to be seen.ASSESSING ENVIRONMENTAL INCOME OPPORTUNITIES IN PRSPsjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 165166WORLD RESOURCES 2005 One of the strongest PRSPs in terms of recognizing the potential of environmental income for poverty reduction is that ofCambodia. The Cambodian PRSP identifies land, water, agricul-ture, forests, and fisheries as key to increasing rural incomes andsets out an 11-point program to improve rural livelihoods byincreasing income from the development of small-scale aquacul-ture, establishing and strengthening community forestry ,promoting sustainable, community-based management of fisheryresources, and improving market access for small-scale farmersand rural producers (Cambodia 2002:v, 53, 61). Similarly , Bolivia highlights the potential contribution of biodiversity to rural incomes and the economy as a whole. It citespreliminary studies indicating that within 15 years biodiversity-related activities (such as ecotourism, mitigation of climatechange, and services related to biotechnology) could increase GDPabout 10 percent (Bolivia 2001:133). Biodiversity resources couldprovide near-term gains to disadvantaged rural populations fromprojects featuring sustainable use of wild animal species, includingvicuna, lizard, and peccary (Bolivia 2001:133). Bolivia alsoproposes to formally establish non-timber forest activities (e.g.,gathering of brazil nuts and cultivation of palms) within thenational forest system and municipal forest reserve areas, with theaim of creating new income generation activities for impoverishedlocal communities (Bolivia 2001:134). However, e ven among PRSPs that devote significant atten- tion to opportunities for enhancing the poor's environmentalincome, few refer to the importance of ecosystems as fundamen- tal units for managing natural resources and ensuring long-termenvironmental sustainability . Of the PRSPs reviewed, only Ghanamentioned the \"ecosystem approach\" by name and then only inthe limited sense of using this approach to restore threatenedhabitats and ecosystems (Ghana 2003:75). One exception is Cambodia, which has made some limited efforts to incorporate an ecosystems-based perspective orapproach within specific sectors and activities. For instance, theCambodian PRSP describes a national vision for water resourcesthat explicitly encompasses healthy aquatic ecosystems as well asproductive fisheries and provision of safe and affordable drinkingwater (Cambodia 2002:64). Cambodia also applies the concept ofagroecosystems in agricultural development plans, includingproposals to set up agricultural research centers in each of thecountry's principal agroecosystems that would be oriented tosmall-scale farmers. These centers would conduct research andextension, emphasizing intensification of agricultural productionthrough improved water, soil, and nutrient management, withrelatively few external inputs in the form of agrichemicals orimproved seeds (Cambodia 2002:56). 2. Sustainability of Income Over Time A concentration on environmental income is not by itself suffi-cient if this income stream is not sustainable. Nations thusneed to take care that the strategies they promote in theirENVIRONMENTAL MAINSTREAMING 1. Ecosystem orientation and environmental income. Does the strategy recognize the importance of ecosystems as a source of income for thepoor? Does it advocate an ecosystem approach to maintain andenhance this income source? 2. Sustainability of income over time. Does the strategy take a long- term approach to natural resource income, stressing sustainableecosystem management? Does it integrate with existing nationalsustainability plans? ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE 3. Tenure and access to resources. Does the strategy address issues of resource access of the poor and recognize their centrality to increasingincome security? In particular, does it squarely confront the issue oftenure insecurity and advocate for pro-poor tenure reform? 4. Decentralization and CBNRM. Does the strategy address the devolution of power over resource management to competent local authorities, anddoes it make provision for building the governance capacity and trans-parency of these local institutions? Does the strategy supportcommunity-based natural resource management as an effective form oflocal empowerment and advocate for its clear recognition in law?5. Participation, procedural rights, and gender equality. Is the strategy grounded in broad-based participation by civil society? Are the prioritiesidentified in the consultation process incorporated into the final strategy?Does the strategy emphasize free and informed consent of communities toeconomic development activities that entail local environmental impacts?Does the strategy acknowledge and address gender issues? ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT 6. Environmental monitoring. Does the strategy include plans for monitor- ing environmental conditions to track the impacts of economic growth onenvironmental income and provide the basis for sound ecosystemmanagement? 7. Targets, indicators, and assessments. Does the strategy contain quantifiable targets for improving outcomes with respect to the environ-mental income opportunities of the poor? Does it specify poverty andenvironmental indicators and how these will be used to shape pro-poorgrowth strategies? Does it describe plans for assessments to evaluateperformance in implementing environment- and governance-relatedmeasures to improve the environmental income opportunities of the poor.FRAMEWORK FOR UPGRADING PRSPs How should poverty reduction strategies be evaluated for their treatment of environmental income opportunities for the poor? Th e following questions can shed light on whether PRSPs adequately reflect the importance of environmental income and provide for sustainable and equitable ecos ystem management. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 166167PRSPs for exploiting natural resources are viable over the long term. PRSPs frequently include expansions of the agriculture,forestry , or fisheries sectors, but rarely look at the implicationsof these activities for the future health of the resource. Forexample, of the 20 PRSPs reviewed, several targeted transfor-mation of subsistence agriculture as a key means of reducingrural poverty . In many cases , however , plans for agricultural intensification, modernization, and commercialization did notexplicitly address how this transformation could be achievedin ways that would ensure long-term sustainability of agricul-tural income and protection of the agricultural resource base.Likewise, few PRSPs described detailed plans to generateadditional income and employment from forests and fisheriesthat were explicitly based on improved, sustainable manage-ment of these natural resources. PRSPs might do a better job of incorporating the concepts of sustainability if they were more closely linked toexisting environmental planning processes such as a nationalstrategy for sustainability , or a national plan to meet the termsof the Convention on Biological Diversity . For instance, Nicaragua's PRSP highlights its National Strategy forSustainable Development, which focuses on the implementa-tion of policies and public investments to ensure more rationaluse of the country's natural resources. The strategy containselements addressing several economic sectors and activities,including the Environmental Policy and Action Plan, theForestry and Development Law, the Fisheries Law, and theBiodiversity Law (Nicaragua 2001:22, 25). Sri Lanka's PRSP refers to the various environmental strate- gies and plans it has developed, including a national environmentalaction plan and a national strategy for sustainable development, aswell as planning under international environmental agreements onbiodiversity , climate change, and desertification (Sri Lanka2002:97, 129). The PRSP also mentions revision of other environ-mental plans, including the national Rain Forest Law, coastal zonemanagement plan, and regional plans for integrated forestryresource management (Sri Lanka 2002:19, 90). 3. Tenure and Access to Resources Security of tenure, access, and user rights are central toachieving sustainable livelihoods for the rural poor, particu-larly in providing them with appropriate incentives to manageenvironmental assets for long-term productivity and incomegrowth. Most PRSPs mention tenure and access to land andother productive resour ces; h owever, some treat the subject in only a cursory manner, while others present detailed discus-sions of tenure-related problems or plans for reform. PRSPs should clearly identify the role of property and user rights as important factors shaping investments in agriculturalproductivity and the prospects for expanding rural incomes.More importantly , PRSPs must then indicate how they plan todeal with the nation's particular tenure challenges. Zambia's PRSP points out that nearly 97 percent of Zambian farmers have no title to the land they cultivate,reducing incentives to invest in land improvements and agricul-ture-related infrastructure, preventing farmers from havingaccess to credit, and depressing land productivity within asystem where smallholders contribute about 60 percent ofagricultural output (Zambia 2002:44). The PRSP also links thelack of secure title to disincentives for development of infra-structure for expanded tourism and eco-tourism opportunities(Zambia 2002:67). H owever, Zambia acknowledges that it has made little progress to date in setting up a land administrationsystem, titling communally owned or state lands, or developinga market for land. The proposed remedy\u2014a review of existingland law and tenure arrangements as well as discussions withtraditional communities regarding incentives to open unusedland for investment\u2014may be realistic given political andbudgetary constraints, but seems unlikely to bring aboutsubstantial progress in the foreseeable future (Zambia 2002:58). On the other hand, Sri Lanka's PRSP presents detailed proposals for far-reaching land reform to provide the poor withgreater access to land. The government plans to test a new landMAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORK jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 167168WORLD RESOURCES 2005 titling program, designed to be fairer and more efficient, which is expected to reduce the cost of titling a parcel of land from US$110to under $40. Proposed legal reforms would consolidate 25 differ-ent laws that directly affect land titling, and alternative disputemechanisms will be used to resolve issues that prevent titling.Advanced information technologies, including digital mapping andintegrated data management, will be used to accelerate land titlingand registration and make the land-management system moretransparent and accessible (Sri Lanka 2002:62). Honduras outlines very specific actions, with associated budgets and deadlines, that will be carried out to improve equityand security in the poor's access to land. Key elements includecompleting a nationwide cadastre (survey) of forest and agricul- tural lands to strengthen the legal basis for land ownership,modernizing the rural property registry to provide a modern toolfor guaranteeing the accuracy of land tenure arrangements andland transactions, and an expanded program for titling ruralproperties for small farmers, ethnic groups, and independent campesinos (Honduras 2001:70). Bolivia plans to regularize the titles to all rural land by 2006, including measures to simplify the procedures for register-ing land titles and property rights by merging the systems forphysical and legal registration of property (Bolivia 2001:110).4. Decentralization and Community-Based Natural Resource Management Almost all PRSPs refer to decentralization and its importance for improving governance and reducing poverty . Often the discus-sion is rather general, h owever, and mentions only one or two sectors\u2014usually education and health. PRSPs should incorpo-rate analysis of important aspects of decentralization issues thatare directly related to natural resources management and oppor-tunities to enhance environmental income for the poor. Among the current crop of PRSPs, a few contain well- developed discussions of decentralization for the management ofenvironmental resources. A few also outline ways in which thegovernment proposes to work with local people to increase ruralincome through community-based management of forests,fisheries, and other environmental assets. Bolivia's PRSP explicitly addresses the implications of decentralization for environmental management. The strategyrefers to institution-strengthening initiatives aimed at ensuringthat municipal governments will have the capacity to carry outnew responsibilities to implement environmental policies andstandards. It also highlights the ongoing role of Bolivia's centralgovernment in important environment-related planningfunctions, including the development assessments, jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 168169resource inventories, and soil and water-use plans, that will influ- ence environmental investments (Bolivia 2001:131-2). Someinnovative mechanisms are proposed for financing the environ-mental activities of local governments, including sharingrevenues from a special hydrocarbon tax (Bolivia 2001:149). Zambia designates development of a decentralization policy a matter of top priority to ensure citizen participation intheir own affairs (Zambia 2002:35). The PRSP outlines decen-tralization measures that will enable communities to benefit fromthe commercial use of their lands, including shareholdingarrangements with investors and tax-sharing arrangements(Zambia 2002:51). Concerning community-based natural resource manage- ment, PRSPs should spell out in detail how the governmentproposes to work with local people to increase rural incomesthrough community-based management of forests, fisheries,and other environmental assets. For example, Cambodianotes that it is transitioning from state control to co-manage-ment of fisheries with local communities. In response to risingincidence of conflict between commercial fishing operatorsand subsistence and small-scale family fishers, Cambodia isreleasing more than half of the country's fishing lots to localfishing communities. The PRSP notes that this change willempower local people to participate in conservation andmanagement of the fishery resource, giving them an incentiveto refrain from illegal fishing practices that have been degrad-ing the aquatic environment (Cambodia 2002:59). Also outlined in Cambodia's PRSP are initiatives related to community forestry to enhance local community participa-tion in decision-making for forest management. Inconsultation with local user groups, the government willreview the system of fees and permits on NTFPs and worktoward removing barriers to marketing NTFPs, especiallyresin, that can be harvested without damaging the forest(Cambodia 2002:60). Sri Lanka details several initiatives for community-driven development through sustainable management of naturalresources. Community-based reef management projects will beundertaken as part of a 5-year public investment program tominimize coastal erosion, already affecting an estimated 55percent of the Sri Lankan coast prior to the December 2004tsunami. Community organizations will prepare coastal manage-ment plans, undertake reef stabilization and habitatconservation, implement measures to improve water exchange inaffected lagoons, and help develop community fish hatcheries(Sri Lanka 2002:64, 89-90). The PRSP also highlights plans to involve poor commu- nities in decision-making for protected forests, providingfunding to communities to replant degraded forest areas,manage buffer zones, and develop timber farms using conser-vation-oriented cultivation practices, with a goal of halvingthe rate of deforestation due to encroachment and illegalforest use (Sri Lanka 2002:90-91). The poor will be encour-aged to participate in the development of Sri Lanka'secotourism industry by forming community-based organiza- tions in the buffer zones adjacent to national parks and wildlifesanctuaries, which will receive a share of ecotourism earningsand training to assist in wildlife conservation activities (SriLanka 2002:91). Kenya also plans to promote pro-poor tourism by foster- ing community-based ecotourism in the northern and westernareas of the country . The PRSP outlines efforts to strengthencommunity involvement in wildlife conservation, implementmeasures to reduce human-wildlife conflict, provide small andmedium enterprises with access to credit, review the structureof park tariffs to expand tourism in less-visited parks, andestablish certification schemes for environmentally friendlyresorts (Kenya 2004:49). 5. Participation, Procedural Rights, and Gender Equality Guidelines for preparing PRSPs require that these strategies be prepared with extensive input from a broad range of stake-holders and that countries provide detailed explanations ofprocesses used to secure such participation. Evidence to dateindicates that PRSP mechanisms to promote participationoften emphasize stakeholders that are urban-based, withrelatively sophisticated analytical capabilities, and excludeorganizations representing largely rural constituents, especiallyindigenous peoples. Governments have sometimes barred stakeholders critical of their policies from participating in PRSP consultations(Waldman et al. 2005). Moreover, governments, NGOs, andinternational donors often have very different ideas of whatconstitutes \"participation.\" Some governments have sought tolimit participation merely to dissemination of information toNGOs and other stakeholders, rather than substantive input.NGOs and some donors have pressed for more authenticallydemocratic exercises in which civil society has opportunities toshape the agenda and contribute meaningfully to the design ofPRSPs (PRSP Monitoring and Synthesis Project 2002:2-6).The PRSPs reviewed here varied considerably with respect tothe efforts made to involve environmental stakeholders and toincorporate input from civil society . One of the stronger efforts was that of Cambodia, which devotes an entire chapter of its PRSP to describing its partici-patory processes, including four national workshops. Thechapter also describes consultations held by sector and lineministries, provincial consultations, a forum on monitoring andevaluation aspects, an NGO forum, meetings with the privatesector, donor involvement, meetings with parliamentarians,and consultations with trade unions. It also acknowledges theneed for ongoing consultations as it prepares subsequentversions of the plan (Cambodia 2002:8-12, 164). Ghana presents an appendix that lists specific comments offered on various drafts of the PRSP and indicates how thesecomments were addressed. For instance, environment-relatedissues that were addressed in response to outside input include:MAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES WORKjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 169170WORLD RESOURCES 2005 the need for greater mainstreaming of environment in the PRSP , the imperative to improve natural resources manage-ment as a prerequisite to sustainable production, the role oftenure insecurity as a cause of poverty , the importance ofsmall-scale irrigation and access to land to support farmers,and the need to develop alternative sources of energy (Ghana2003:216-225). In Rwanda and Vietnam, dissemination of key documents in local languages helped improve awareness of the PRSPprocess (Boj\u00f6 and Reddy 2003b:26). Addressing disparities in women's rights and access to land and other productive assets has been shown to be a fundamen-tal aspect of effective poverty reduction strategies. A few of thePRSPs reviewed presented detailed analysis of the impacts ofgender on environmental income opportunities as well asdetailed proposals for remedying gender-based inequities incountries where women traditionally have not been accordedequal rights and access to ecosystems. Cambodia notes that, with women accounting for 65 percent of agricultural labor and 75 percent of fisheriesproduction, poverty reduction cannot succeed unless itaddresses the roles and needs of women (Cambodia2002:127). The PRSP sets an explicit goal of ensuring thatwomen and girls receive full legal protection and educationabout their legal rights to access to land and naturalresources. Equal numbers of women and men are to beincluded in all consultative processes and on all monitoringand evaluation teams (Cambodia 2002:vii). Cambodia sets agoal of ensuring that women, the primary collectors and usersof water, ultimately make up half of all members of water-user associations, and at least 20 percent of such memberswithin three years (Cambodia 2002:113, 128). The govern-ment also pledges to address gender disparities throughbudget allocations as well as policies and programs(Cambodia 2002:136). Sri Lanka highlights plans for legal reforms to ensure women's equal rights to inherit land and proposes to encouragewomen's self-employment in small-scale fishing through train- ing and extension activities (Sri Lanka 2002:200,213). Zambia proposes to mainstream gender in its land policies, including the introduction of legal reforms to provide equal landrights for women and ensure women's access to naturalresources. Women's traditional knowledge of sustainableresource use and management will be integrated into the devel-opment of environmental management and extension programs,and 30 percent of all land allocations will be reserved for womenapplicants (Zambia 2002:54, 114). 6. and 7. Environmental Monitoring, Targets, Indicators, and Assessments PRSPs are notoriously weak in their provisions for monitoring and evaluating the impacts of the policies and programs theypropose. In many cases, provisions for monitoring and evaluat-ing environment-related impacts are particularly inadequate.The World Bank's review of environmental mainstreaming in PRSPs found that few were structured for effective monitor-ing of progress towards proposed outcomes; that is, fewcontained realistic, quantified, time-bound, costed targetscoupled with a sufficient suite of specific, relevant, quantitativeindicators for measuring progress towards these targets (Boj\u00f6and Reddy 2003b:25). Among the PRSPs reviewed, a few clearly identified targets and indicators that will be used to gauge the impact of proposedinterventions related to environment and natural resourcesmanagement. Bolivia presents several targets and indicatorsrelated to enhancing environmental income for the poor, includ-ing increases in the extent of land brought under secure title.The PRSP proposes to complete the process of securing cleartitle to rural property in Bolivia by 2006, which would involveregularizing the ownership of more than 7 million ha per yearfrom 2001 to 2006 (Bolivia 2001:183). Other indicators estab-lished by Bolivia include annual increases in resources allocatedto local communities from the revenues of protected areas, aswell as increases in income from sustainable wildlife manage-ment programs (Bolivia 2001:186). Cambodia's PRSP presents an action-plan matrix with numerous strategic objectives, actionable measures, estimatedcosts, targets and indicators, and the responsible implementingagency . Among the targets and indicators related to environ-mental income opportunities are increases in the number ofland titles issued (including the number of titles held by women) and establishing specific numbers of community forest,fisheries, and small-scale aquaculture projects in variousprovinces. Quantitative goals are also set for the numbers ofwomen receiving agricultural training on such topics as soilfertility and management, prevention of soil degradation, andsafe pesticide use, as well as the percentage of women membersin farmers associations (Cambodia 2002:172-80, 229). Steps toward More Effective PRSPs One emerging area of debate surrounding PRSPs is whetherthese strategies will enable countries to successfully meet theMDGs. The UN suggests that existing PRSPs often are notadequate for this purpose and has called for so-called \"MDG-based poverty reduction strategies\" that are more ambitious,scaled-up, and focused on a longer planning horizon, layingout a path to achievement of the MDGs by 2015. A pivotalstep in ramping up PRSPs will be identifying additionalsources of capital, since lack of existing capital to financeneeded national investments is one of the reasons that inter-ventions described in current PRSPs generally are notambitious enough to meet the MDGs. Increased capital to spark poverty-reducing growth could come from various sources, including mobilizing developingcountries' own domestic sources of natural wealth as well asexpanded development aid and private sector-led trade andinvestment. Key challenges will be to understand the strategicjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:04 PM Page 170and policy elements necessary to scale up investment to meet the MDGs and to strike a thoughtful balance between ambition andrealism in PRSPs. To this end, stakeholders could take several important steps toward PRSPs that emphasize scaled-up investment for pro-poorgrowth while also protecting the ability of ecosystems to providesustainable services that underlie human well-being and thelivelihoods of the poor. The World Bank and IMF can support efforts to achieve theMDGs by adapting macroeconomic frameworks for PRSPsaccording to specific country circumstances. For example, theBank can encourage countries to work with the poor to investin ecosystem services such as water resources, soil conservation,and forests and woodlands that generate needed provisioningservices such as food, fiber, and fuel. These investments, asshown by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, also provideregulating services such as water regulation, erosion control,pest control, and natural-hazard regulation which reducevulnerability of the poor to damaging effects of drought,floods, loss of soil productivity , and crop failures. The United Nations can provide support to developingcountries to help them strategically link Poverty ReductionStrategies to efforts to meet the MDGs. This assistance cantake several forms, including building national capacities todevelop and implement scaled-up investment programs andencouraging the exchange of experiences and lessons learnedbetween countries. Developing countries can contribute to the process by ensur-ing that their PRSP-related efforts emphasize transparencyand inclusion and by being accountable for measurableprogress in reducing poverty . To this end, monitoring andassessment of poverty and environment outcomes usingappropriate data and benchmarks is essential. Donor countries can help by ramping up the levels of assis-tance provided to developing countries to help them reachthe MDGs. Development aid needs to be delivered in a stableand predictable manner to facilitate effective planning as wellas to avoid destabilizing macroeconomic impacts. Donorsshould complement development assistance with rapid andsignificant debt relief to create fiscal \"space\" for pro-poor,MDG-based investments. /orn8flipMAKING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT Human HealthGender and and PovertyEconomics Financial FlowsInstitutions and GovernanceEnergyClimate and AtmosphereWater Agriculturejp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:05 PM Page 173WORLD RESOURCES 2005 WORLD RESOURCES 2005 Data Tables Each edition of World Resources includes a statistical appendix, a compilation of country-level data culled from a variety ofsources. This section presents some of the data required to builda basic picture of the state of the Earth in its human, economic,and environmental dimensions. In an increasingly interde-pendent, globalized world, a picture of the whole is needed to understand the interactions of human development, populationgrowth, economic growth, and the environment. In addition, World Resources 2005 provides a selection of data on global poverty and, in particular, on how the poor use natural resources. The 12 data tables that follow are a subset of a larger online data collection: the EarthTrends database of the World Resources Institute. Based on the World Resources series, EarthTrends is a free, online resource that highlights the environmental, social,and economic trends that shape our world. The website offers the public a comprehensive collection of vital statistics, maps,and graphics viewable by watershed, district, country , region,or worldwide.General Notes The World Resources 2005 data tables present information for 155 countries. These countries were selected from the 191official member states of the United Nations based on theirpopulation levels, land area, and the availability of data. Manymore countries are included in the EarthTrends online database. Country groupings are based on lists developed by the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (for developedand developing countries), the World Bank (for low-, medium-,and high-income countries), and the World Resources Institute(for regional classifications). See pages 224-226 for a full listing. Several general notes apply to all the data tables in the report (except where noted otherwise): \"..\" in a data column signifies that data are not available or arenot relevant (for example, country status has changed, as withthe former Soviet republics). Negative values are shown in parentheses. 0 appearing in a table indicates a value of either zero or less thanone-half the unit of measure used in the table; (0) indicates avalue less than zero and greater than negative one-half. Except where identified by a footnote, regional totals arecalculated using regions designated by the World ResourcesInstitute. Totals represent either a summation or a weightedaverage of available data. Weighted averages of ratios use thedenominator of the ratio as the weight. Regional totals arepublished only if more than 85 percent of the relevant dataare available for a particular region. Missing values are not imputed. The regional totals published here use data from all 222 coun-tries and territories in the World Resources/EarthTrends database (some of these countries are omitted from thecurrent tables). Regional summations and weighted averagescalculated with only the 155 countries listed in these datatables will therefore not match the published totals. Except where identified with a footnote, world totals arepresented as calculated by the original data source (which mayinclude countries not listed in WRI's database); originalsources are listed after each data table. When available data are judged too weak to allow for anymeaningful comparison across countries, the data are notshown. Please review the technical notes for further consider-ation of data reliability . Comprehensive technical notes are available in the pagesfollowing each data table. jp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:05 PM Page More Data Tables available on-line at EarthTrends, http://earthtrends.wri.org EarthTrends: The Environmental Information Portal Much of the environmental information on the internet is fragmented, buried, or only available at a price. World Resources Institute's EarthTrends data portal gathers information from more than 40 of the world's leading statisticalagencies, supplemented with WRI-generated maps and analyses, into a single,free repository for rapid searching and retrieving. EarthTrends supplements its content with detailed metadata that report on research methodologies andinformation reliability. The EarthTrends online data source includes more than 40 data tables, similar to those on the following pages. EarthTrends also features over 2,000 two-page country profiles that highlight country-level statistics on key topicsin sustainable development, as well as hundreds of maps and feature stories.The core of EarthTrends is a searchable database with over 600 time-series indicators, spanning 30-plus years: a corpus of statistical knowledge fromwhich the data tables in this volume are drawn. Two new additions to EarthTrends will be of particular interest to readers of this book. EarthTrends now features the EarthTrends Poverty Resource and the EarthTrends Global Watersheds Collection. The EarthTrends Poverty Resource, released in December 2004, provides a starting point for research on the nexus of poverty, governance, and ecosystems. It brings together a uniquecollection of data, maps, and other resources to help readers comprehend andanalyze developing world poverty. In addition, the Poverty Resource containsdozens of subnational maps depicting the distribution of poverty and humanwell-being within countries. The Global Watersheds Collection, an updated version of the 1998 report Watersheds of the World, provides maps of land cover, population density, and biodiversity for 154 river basins and sub-basinsaround the world.Since 2001, EarthTrends has remained an authoritative, independent source of information for users in more than 190 countries and territories,demonstrating that carefully compiled web-based information can provide an important basis for decision-making and policy development. The information on EarthTrends is varied. While researchers will value the raw data (over 500,000 records), much of the information is available in easy-to-use, printableformats, and can be adapted for educational or policy-oriented presentations. Additional Data Products In addition to the main, graphics-intensive site, EarthTrends offers users additional ways to access our collection of environmental information.

Percent of Population under Age 15 is the proportion of the total population younger than 15 years of age. Percent of Population Age 65 and Over is the proportion of the total population 65 years of age and older. Total Fertility Rate is an estimate of the average number of children a woman would have over the course of her entire life if current age-specific fertility ratesremained constant during her reproductive years. The four variables defined above are estimated by the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) for the years 1950-2000 and forecasted based on theassumptions enumerated below for the years 2001-2050. Past estimates are calculated using census and survey results from all countries. The UNPD compiles, evaluates, and adjusts these data when necessary.Adjustments incorporate data from civil registrations (in developed countries),population surveys (in developing countries), earlier censuses, and, when neces-sary, population models based on information from similar countries. The projections reported here assume medium fertility (the \"medium-fertility assumption\"). All future population projections are based on estimates of the 2000base-year population and incorporate the three main components of populationgrowth: fertility, mortality, and migration. Fertility is estimated by applying age- specific fertility rates to the projected female population using models based on pasttrends in fertility to project future declines. Mortality is projected on the basis of the models of life expectancy that assume a medium pace of mortality decline. Forcountries affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, mortality rates are predicted using amodel developed by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Migration rates are estimated on the basis of past international migration estimates and an assessment of the policy stance of countries with regard to future interna-tional migration flows. The UNPD incorporates information on official immigrationand emigration, labor migration, undocumented migration, and refugees. For more information on methodology, see World Population Prospects, 2002 Revision. Volume III: Analytical Report. Online at http://www.un.org/esa/popula-tion/publications/wpp2002/WPP2002_Vol3.htm. Mortality under Age 5 is the probability of a child dying between birth and age five expressed per 1,000 live births. Data for estimating mortality of children underage 5 is typically obtained from population census information, civil registrationrecords on deaths of young children, United Nations Childrens' Fund (UNICEF)Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS). For each country, UNICEF and its partners plotted all data from 1960 to thepresent on a graph; a curve was fitted through these data using a weighted least-squares regression model. Refugees Granted Asylum Elsewhere is the number of refugees leaving a country who have been granted asylum status by a foreign government. Refugees Repatriations is the number of refugees who have successfully returned (repatriated) to their home country. In both columns, refugees are counted according to their home countries (\"country of origin\"), not their country of asylum. Data were collected in 2003 butinclude all persons that have migrated as refugees without returning to their homecountry. According to Article 1 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status ofRefugees and the related 1967 Protocol, a refugee is a person who \"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality,membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the countryof his nationality and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\" This variable reflects the number ofrefugees recognized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR), which generally relies on host government reporting to obtain data,supplemented with information collected by aid workers. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are defined by the United Nations as \"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leavetheir homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in orderto avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violationsof human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed aninternationally recognized State border.\" The UNHCR estimates that globally thereare 25 million internally displaced people in over 50 countries. Since they have notcrossed into another country, IDPs are generally not afforded the same protectionsand assistance given to refugees. Estimates are from the Global IDP Project andincorporate a wide variety of sources, including non-governmental organizations(NGOs), academic research, governments, and news agencies. Literacy Rates measure the proportion of the population in a specific age group who can both read and write with understanding a short, simple statement on theireveryday life. Adult Literacy Rates refer to all residents of a country or region over the age of 15; Youth Literacy Rates evaluate the population of a country between the ages of 15 and 24 in the year specified. Youth literacy rates are increasinglyused to gauge the impact of primary education as well as the speed with whichilliteracy can be eradicated. Most literacy data are collected during national population censuses and supplemented by household surveys, labor force surveys, employment surveys,industry surveys, and agricultural surveys when they are available. UNESCO usesthese data to graph a logistic regression model. When census and survey data arenot available, literacy rates for a specific country are estimated based on neighbor-ing countries with similar characteristics. Net School Enrollment Ratio (NER) is defined as the enrollment of the official age group for a given level of education expressed as a percentage of the popula-tion from the same age group. The theoretical maximum value is 100 percent. A high NER denotes a high degree of participation of the official school-age popula-tion. If the NER is below 100 percent, users should not assume that the remainingschool-age population is not enrolled in any school; they could be enrolled in schoolat other grade levels. Primary Education is defined by the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) as the \"beginning of systematic apprenticeshipof reading, writing and mathematics.\" Programs are typically six years long andrepresent the beginning of compulsory education in many countries. Secondary education follows primary education, and is characterized as being subject- oriented with specialized fields of learning. Students achieve a full implementationof basic skills. Programs may be academic, vocational, or technical in nature. Net enrollment ratio is calculated by dividing the number of pupils enrolled who are of the official age group for a given level of education by the total popula-tion of the same age group. National governments provide the United NationsEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) with enrollment databased on a series of electronic questionnaires. When data from national govern-ments are not available or are of inferior quality, UNESCO will estimate enrollmentratios from background data, if available. 1781Population and Education: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:06 PM OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS UNPD publishes country-level statistics every two years with annual revisions of key estimates. UNICEF and UNHCR publish the most recently available datain an annual report, with more frequent updates online. Education, literacy andIDP data are updated irregularly. Most updates include revisions of past data. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Total Population, Fertility, and Life Expectancy: Since demographic parameters are estimated on a country-by-country basis, reliability varies among countries. Forsome developing countries, estimates are derived from surveys rather thancensuses, especially when countries lack a civil registration system or have one thatdoes not achieve full coverage of all vital events. Also, for developing countries theavailability of detailed information on fertility and mortality is limited and the dataon international migration flows are generally inadequate. Although estimates arebased on incomplete data and projections cannot factor in unforeseen events (i.e.,famine, wars), U.N. demographic models are widely accepted and use well-under-stood principles, which make these data as comparable, consistent acrosscountries, and reliable as possible. Mortality Under Age 5: Estimates were calculated based on a wide variety of sources of disparate quality. For information on the underlying data for eachcountry's regressions, refer to the country estimates and new country data availablefrom UNICEF online at http://www.childinfo.org/cmr/kh98meth.html. Refugees: Since the determination of refugee status varies among countries, UNHCR will estimate numbers in order to provide a normalized dataset. Data are \"provisionaland subject to change,\" and accuracy is limited by the politically sensitive nature ofrefugee estimates and the circumstances under which many refugees live. UNHCRattempts to harmonize the data in order to allow cross-country comparisons. Internally Displaced Persons: Due to the highly political nature of displacement and the conditions in which many displaced peoples find themselves, accurate dataare difficult to collect. While the numbers presented are broad estimates, thesedata are the best online on the topic. Adult Literacy Rate: The availability and quality of national statistics on literacy vary widely. National census and survey data are typically collected only once everydecade. In addition, many industrialized countries have stopped collecting literacydata in recent years, based on the sometimes incorrect assumption that universalprimary education means universal literacy. When census and survey data are notavailable for a particular country, estimates are sometimes made based on neigh-boring countries. Actual definitions of adult literacy are not strictly comparableamong countries. Some countries equate persons with no schooling with illiterates,or change definitions between censuses. In addition, UNESCO's definition of liter-acy does not include people who, though familiar with the basics of reading andwriting, do not have the skills to function at a reasonable level in their own society. Net School Enrollment: Even though UNESCO has applied the same methodology to analyze all of the country data, definitions of \"schooling\" and \"enrollment\" arenot strictly comparable among countries. As net enrollment ratios approach 100percent, inconsistencies with enrollment and/or population data are more likely toskew the resulting ratios. As a result, some net enrollment ratios are greater than100 percent. Difficulties also arise when a substantial proportion of students beginschool earlier than the prescribed age, or when the reference date for entry intoprimary education does not coincide with the birthdays of all eligible students.SOURCES Total Population, Population by Age Group, and Fertility Rates: United Nations Population Division. 2003.

Physicians per 100,000 Population indicates the density of doctors in a country. \"Physician\" includes graduates of a faculty or school of medicine who are workingin any medical field (including teaching, research, and practice). Improved Water Source includes any of the following types of drinking water sources: household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells,protected springs, and rainwater collection. To be counted, at least 20 liters perperson per day of improved water must be available within one kilometer of a user'sdwelling. Examples of unimproved water sources include unprotected wells andsprings, vendor-provided water, tanker-provided water, and bottled water. Theselast examples are considered \"unimproved\" because they are not consistentlyavailable in sufficient quantities. Improved Sanitation includes any of the follow- ing excreta disposal facilities: connection to a public sewer, connection to a septictank, pour-flush latrine, simple pit latrine, and ventilated improved pit latrine.Examples of an unimproved sanitation system include open pit latrines, public orshared latrines, and service or bucket latrines. Data were collected from assessment questionnaires and household surveys and plotted on a graph for each country to show coverage in available years (notnecessarily 2002). A trend line was drawn and reviewed by a panel of experts fromWHO and UNICEF to determine the level of sanitation and water available in 2002. Underweight Prevalence, an indicator of malnutrition, refers to the proportion of children under five years of age whose weight-for-age is more than two standarddeviations (for moderate underweight) or more than three standard deviations (forsevere underweight) below the median weight-for-age of a reference population. Stunting prevalence, an indicator of chronic malnutrition, refers to the percent- age of children under five whose height-for-age is more than two (moderatestunting) and three (severe stunting) standard deviations from the median of thereference population. Malnutrition data were obtained from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and other national-level surveys.Where possible, only comprehensive or representative national data have been used. Adults Ages 15-49 Living With HIV or AIDS is the estimated percentage of people aged 15-49 living with HIV/AIDS. Change Since 2001 measures the percent change in the total population infected with AIDS or HIV between 2001 and 2003.These estimates include all people with HIV infection, whether or not they havedeveloped symptoms of AIDS, who are alive at the end of the year specified. Datafor this age group capture those in their most sexually active years. Measuringinfection within this age range also allows greater comparability for populationswith different age structures. Estimates for a single point in time and the startingdate of the epidemic were used to plot an epidemic curve charting the spread ofHIV in a particular country. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Use Rate is the estimated percentage of adults with advanced HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy. This therapy candramatically reduce HIV-related mortality and improve the quality of life of thoseinfected. The estimated number of people receiving treatment is determined bynational program-monitoring reports or estimates from local WHO offices. Thenumber of adults with advanced HIV infection is estimated by the Joint UnitedNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to be 15 percent of the total number ofinfected adults.Tuberculosis Incidence Rate is the estimated number of new tuberculosis (TB) cases per 100,000 people in the year specified. The estimates include all cases(pulmonary, smear positive, and extrapulmonary). If left untreated, each personwith an infectious case of TB will infect 10-15 people every year. It is estimated thatTB caused 2 million deaths in 2002 and is now the leading cause of death in peopleinfected with HIV. Data are collected by country using a standard collection form.Initial estimates are derived using surveys of the prevalence of infection and arethen refined using a consultative and analytical process involving a panel ofepidemiological experts at WHO. Reported Malaria Cases is the total number of malaria cases reported to the WHO by countries in which malaria is endemic. Most countries report only laboratoryconfirmed cases, but some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa report clinicallydiagnosed cases as well. Transmitted to humans by the bite of an infectedmosquito, malaria is one of the world's prevalent health crises, killing more thanone million people annually. Data on malaria are collected from a variety of surveys,including Routine Health Information Systems (HIS), MICS, DHS, DemographicSurveillance Sites (DSS), and Rolling Back Malaria (RBM) baseline surveys. Percent of Children Under Age Five Using Treated Bed Nets is the percent of children under age five in each country that sleep under a net treated with an insecti-cide to ward off mosquitoes, a powerful method of preventing malaria infections.According to UNICEF, the majority of deaths from malaria occur in children under age 5. Data are obtained by UNICEF from DHS, MICS, and other national surveys. Health Care Spending per Capita is defined as the sum of government and private expenditures on health, expressed on a per-person basis. The estimates areprovided in international dollars, which minimizes the consequences of differingprice levels among countries. Government Health Spending includes all public outlays reserved for the enhancement of the health status of the population and/orthe distribution of medical care. Expenditures by all levels of government (national,regional, and local), extrabudgetary agencies, and external resources such asgrants are included. The estimates for extrabudgetary expenditure on healthinclude purchase of health goods and services by schemes that are compulsory andgovernment-controlled. Private Health Spending is the sum of expenditures by prepaid plans and risk-pooling arrangements, public and private enterprises formedical care and health-enhancing benefits (outside of payment to socialsecurity), nonprofit institutions that primarily serve households, and householdout-of-pocket spending. Per capita totals were calculated by WHO using population estimates from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and theUnited Nations Population Division. Information on government health expenditures are obtained from the OECD, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), national health-accounts reports, govern-ment finance data, statistical yearbooks, and public-finance reports. Informationfor private health expenditures are obtained from national health-accounts reports,statistical yearbooks and other periodicals, official web sites, reports from non-governmental organizations, household surveys, academic studies, governmentministries, and professional and trade associations. FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS Both the UN Population Division and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) publish country-level statistics every two years with annual revisions of key estimates. UNICEF publishes the most recent available data each year. WHO publishes country-level statistics annually and updates the Global Atlas of Infectious Diseases database as new information becomes available. 1822Human Health: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:06 PM Page 182183DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Life Expectancy: The United Nations Population Division (UNPD) estimates demographic parameters on a country-by-country basis, so data reliability variesamong countries. In some developing countries, census data are not available orare incomplete, and estimates concerning population trends are derived fromsurveys. Although estimates are based on incomplete mortality data and projec-tions cannot factor in unforeseen events (e.g., famine, wars), UN demographicmodels are widely accepted and use well-understood qualities, making these datafairly reliable. Physicians per 100,000 Population: Data reliability varies by country. Due to out- of-date health personnel records, some countries mistakenly include retiredphysicians or physicians no longer working in the health sector, resulting in overes-timates. Also, this indicator speaks solely of the quantity of physicians, not thequality or accessibility of the personnel. It does not show the difference in urbanand rural concentrations. The exact definition of \"physician\" may vary amongcountries. Some countries may include interns, physicians that are retraining, andthose working in the private sector. Improved Water Sources and Sanitation: These data have become more reliable as WHO and UNICEF shift from provider-based information (national censusestimates) to consumer-based information (survey data). Nonetheless, estimateswere calculated based on a wide variety of sources of disparate quality, andcomparisons among countries should be made with care. Definitions of urban andrural are not consistent across countries. The assessment does not account forintermittent or poor quality of water supplies. WHO emphasizes that these datameasure use of an improved water supply and excreta disposal system, but accessto sanitary and safe systems cannot be adequately measured on a global scale. Malnutrition in Children under Five: The data included for these variables cover a wide range of years and sources. Some data refer to periods other than 1995-2002, measure stunting or percentage underweight in a different age range than0-5, or were collected for only part of a country. Since data are not available formore affluent countries, the regional totals reported here may be larger than theactual averages. Adults Ages 15-49 Living with HIV or AIDS: While HIV surveillance systems are generally more extensive than those for other diseases, data reliability still varies ona country-by-country basis. The extent of uncertainty depends primarily on the typeof epidemic\u2014infection rates for generalized (high-level) epidemics are calculateddifferently from rates for concentrated (low-level) epidemics\u2014and on the quality,coverage, and consistency of a country's surveillance system. A detailed descriptionof the methods, software, quality of data, and development of ranges for these datawas published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections in July 2004. Antiretroviral Therapy Use Rate: The data have been reviewed by UNAIDS and compared with other sources to consolidate validity. The reliability of the nationaldata presented in national reports is dependent on the quality of informationprovided by the countries themselves. Some countries have very small or highlylocalized epidemics, so the rates presented here do not necessarily reflect nationalcommitment and action. This indicator does not distinguish between the differenttypes of therapy available nor does it measure the cost, quality, or effectiveness ofthe treatment. In certain settings, a system may not yet be in place to collect datafrom community-based organizations, private prescribers, and pharmacies. Theestimated proportion of the total infected population with advanced HIV infection(currently 15 percent) may require revision, as the proportion varies according to thestage of the HIV epidemic and the coverage and effectiveness of ART. Tuberculosis Incidence Rate: Data are reviewed at all levels of WHO, and WHO headquarters attempts to complete any missing responses and resolve any incon-sistencies. The quality of the information provided by a particular country isdependent on the quality of its national surveillance system. Reported Malaria Cases: Malaria infection-rate data are less accurate than estimates of HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis. Data may reflect only a fraction of the truenumber of malaria cases in a country because of incomplete reporting systems orincomplete coverage by health services, or both. Also, many malaria patients mayseek treatment outside of the formal health sector. Case detection and reportingsystems vary widely. Health Care Spending: The estimates provided here should be considered the best estimates of WHO and not the official estimates of its member states. WHO hascompared the data to a variety of sources, including inpatient care expenditure andpharmaceutical care expenditure, in an effort to ensure the plausibility of theestimates that have been collected.

The measure is calculated from three components. Political partici- pation and decision-making power is measured by the proportional share, by gender, of parliamentary seats. Economic participation and decision-making power is measured by (a) the proportional share, by gender, of positions as legislators,senior officials, and managers; and (b) the proportional share, by gender, of profes-sional and technical positions. Power over economic resources is measured by the estimated earned income for women and men, in US dollars adjusted for purchas-ing power parity (PPP). Variables in these three areas are weighted equally andindexed by their relationship to the ideal scenario (i.e., 50-50 distribution betweengenders is considered the ideal for representation in parliaments). The genderempowerment measure for a particular country is presented on a scale of 0-1, withhigher numbers representing greater levels of equality. Woman-Headed Households is the percent of occupied housing units whose members acknowledge a woman as the head of the household. In many countries,female-headed households suffer from a lower and more precarious tenure statusthan male-headed households, which leads to greater insecurity for themselvesand their dependents. Data were collected primarily through census data andhousehold surveys. In other cases, data may come from specific housing studiescarried out by different UN groups. Public housing boards, housing financial insti-tutions, real-estate agencies, and nongovernmental organizations have alsosupplied data when census or household data were unavailable. Contraceptive Prevalence Rate is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in a marital or consensual union who are currently using contraception. Women with Unmet Family Planning Needs is the percentage of fertile women who are not using contraception and report that they do not want children or wanttheir next child with a delay of two years or more. Contraception includes bothmodern (sterilization, the pill, condoms, vaginal barrier methods, etc.) and tradi-tional (periodic or prolonged abstinence, withdrawal, etc.) methods. Data werecompiled primarily from surveys based on nationally representative samples ofwomen aged 15-49. The surveys used for data compilation include Demographicand Health Surveys (DHS), UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), andFamily Health Surveys (FHS). Maternal Mortality Ratio is the annual number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes, either when pregnant or within 42 days of birth or termi-nation of pregnancy. Measured per 100,000 live births, it quantifies the risk ofdeath once a woman has become pregnant. Women in countries with both highfertility and high maternal mortality run the highest lifetime risks of death as aresult of childbearing. (Reduction of maternal mortality is one the United Nations'MILLENNIUM Development Goals.) Estimates of maternal mortality were obtainedby UNICEF from a variety of sources, including government reporting, householdsurveys, and DHS. Skilled Attendants At Delivery is the percentage of births attended by physicians, nurses, midwives, or primary health care workers trained in midwifery skills.Women are most in need of skilled care during delivery and the immediate postpar-tum period, when roughly three-quarters of all maternal deaths occur. MultipleIndicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), developed by UNICEF with partners in 1997, wereused by governments in 66 countries to collect the data presented here.Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provided relevant data to UNICEF for morethan 35 additional countries. For the majority of remaining countries, nationalgovernments provided non-MICS data. Where no reliable official figures exist,estimates have been made by UNICEF. Where possible, only comprehensive or repre-sentative national data have been used. Ratio of Women to Men Enrolled in Secondary Education represents the ratio of female to male gross enrollment in secondary schooling. A ratio of 100 indicatesequality in representation. Lower numbers represent a higher percentage of malethan female enrollment. The data are for the 2001-2002 school year. The ratio iscalculated by WRI by dividing the gross enrollment of males by that of females forsecondary education. The result is multiplied by 100 to produce the final ratio.UNICEF calculates gross enrollment data by dividing the number of pupils enrolledin a given level of education, regardless of age, by population in the relevantofficial age group, and then multiplying by 100 to produce a ratio. Literacy Rate, shown here for both men and women, is generally defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who can both read and write,with understanding, a short, simple statement on their everyday life. This indicatorcan be used to measure the achievement of literacy programs and the effective-ness of primary education. According to UNESCO, \"literacy represents a potentialfor further intellectual growth and contribution to economic-socio-cultural develop-ment of society.\" Adult literacy correlates with GNP per capita, life expectancy,fertility rates, infant mortality, and urbanization. Most literacy data are collectedduring national population censuses. Typically, censuses are held only once in adecade, so UNESCO supplements these data with household surveys, labor forcesurveys, employment surveys, industry surveys, and agricultural surveys when theyare available. Annual Earned Income, shown here for both men and women, is an estimate of the annual earning power available to workers in the nonagricultural sector. Data are reported in 2002 international dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity(PPP). Direct measures of income disaggregated by gender are unavailable for mostcountries. In order to calculate this indicator, UNDP uses a ratio of female nonagri-cultural wage to the male non-agricultural wage, male and female shares of theeconomically active population, total male and female population, and GDP percapita (PPP). These data are obtained from the World Bank's World DevelopmentIndicators and the United Nations Population Division. Female Professional and Technical Workers is women's share of total positions defined according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations(ISCO-88) Major Group 2. This classification includes physical, mathematical andengineering science professionals, life science and health professionals, teachingprofessionals and other (business, social science, legal, religious) professionals.Values were calculated by UNDP on the basis of occupational data from theInternational Labor Organization (ILO) LABORSTA database. The ILO receives thesedata from country labor surveys. Parliamentary Seats Held by Women is calculated based on the total number of seats in parliament and the number of seats occupied by women. When there isboth an upper house and a lower house of parliament, the total number of womenin both houses is divided by the total number of seats in both houses. Data arecurrent as of April 1, 2004. The Inter-Parliamentary Union compiles these databased on information provided by national parliaments. 1863Gender and Development: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:06 PM Page 186187FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS The Gender Empowerment Index and labor data are published annually by UNDP in the Human Development Report. Literacy and education data are compiled annually by UNESCO. UNICEF publishes maternal health indicators in its annual State of the World's Children. Household data are released by UN-Habitat in its Human Settlement Statistics database approximately every five years. Data onworld contraceptive use are updated every two years. The Inter-Parliamentary Unionupdates its Women in Parliament data set monthly to reflect elections. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Gender Empowerment Measure: This index is calculated for the purposes of comparing across countries, so data must be obtained from international datasets,limiting the variables that can be used for the calculation. Without these constraints,other variables that are more detailed could have been used to measure moreaccurately the political, professional, and economic empowerment of women. Women-Headed Households: Data reliability varies on a country-by-country basis. Data for women-headed households are limited and were collected over a 15-year period. The reader should use caution when comparing across countries. Contraceptive Prevalence Rate and Women with Unmet Family Planning Needs: The data refer only to women ages 15-49 who are married or in a consen- sual union. Information on single men or women is not as widely available, althoughit constitutes a significant proportion of contraceptive use (or lack thereof). Maternal Mortality Ratio: The purpose of these estimates is to draw attention to the existence and likely dimensions of the problem of maternal mortality. The dataare not intended to serve as precise estimates. The margins of uncertainty associ-ated with these values are large and the estimates cannot be used to monitor trends. Skilled Attendants at Delivery: The data included for this variable cover a wide range of years and sources. Some data refer to periods other than 1995-2002.Comparisons between countries should be made with caution due to the resultingpotential for variability in data quality and timing for individual countries. Ratio of Women to Men Enrolled in Secondary Education: While UNESCO keeps the most complete global data set on enrollment levels, problems do remain.The availability and quality of national school enrollment statistics vary widely,particularly for developing countries. Even though UNESCO has applied the samemethodology to analyze all of the country data, definitions of \"schooling\" and\"enrollment\" are not strictly comparable among countries.Literacy Rate: The availability and quality of national statistics on literacy varies widely, particularly for developing countries. When census and survey data are notavailable for a particular country, estimates need to be made based on neighboringcountries. Even when census and survey data are available, they are typicallycollected only once every decade. In addition, many industrialized countries havestopped collecting literacy data in recent years, based on the assumption,sometimes incorrect, that universal primary education means universal literacy.Even though UNESCO has applied the same methodology to analyze all of thecountry data, actual definitions of adult literacy are not strictly comparable amongcountries. Some countries assume that persons with no schooling are illiterate, orchange definitions between censuses. In addition, UNESCO's definition of literacydoes not include people who, though familiar with the basics of reading andwriting, do not have the skills to function at a reasonable level in their own society.Practices for identifying literates and illiterates during actual census enumerationmay also vary, and errors in literacy self-declaration can affect data reliability.Therefore, users should exercise caution when making cross-country comparisons. Annual Earned Income: Since direct measures of income disaggregated by gender are unavailable for most countries, this indicator is calculated by UNDP from wagefigures including both men and women, estimates of the size of the labor force bygender, and ratios of male-to-female income. Female Professional and Technical Workers: The collection and reporting of labor statistics is governed by a well-defined set of standards developed through anumber of international agreements. The ILO applies rigorous quality standards tothe data it receives. However, as is the case with all large datasets that rely ongovernment reporting, there are likely to be some irregularities.

GDP is thefinal market value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given year,equal to total consumer, investment, and government spending. Dollar figures forGDP are converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP)rates and are not adjusted for inflation. An international dollar buys roughly thesame amount of goods and services in each country. PPP rates account for the local prices of goods and services, allowing GDP estimates to be adjusted for cost of living and more accurately compared acrosscountries. PPP rates are estimated through extrapolation and regression analysisusing data from the International Comparison Programme (ICP). Computation ofthe PPP involves deriving implicit quantities from national accounts expendituredata and specially collected price data and then revaluing the implicit quantitiesin each country at a single set of average prices. GDP data for most developingcountries are collected from national statistical organizations and central banks byvisiting and resident World Bank missions. The data for high-income economies arefrom the OECD. The Survey Year shows the years in which the surveys used to collect national poverty data, international poverty data, and income inequality data were administered. National Poverty Rates show the percent of a country's population living below a nationally established poverty line. Estimates include total poverty rates and ratesin both urban and rural areas. Values are calculated on a country-by-country basisaccording to the needs of the poor in a given country. Data for the National PovertyRates are derived from surveys prepared for the World Bank and conducted between1985 and 2002. Surveys asked households to report either their income, or, prefer-ably, their consumption levels. These nationally representative household surveyswere conducted by national statistical offices, private agencies under the supervi-sion of government, or international agencies. The level of income that is used todetermine national poverty lines varies among countries. As the cost of living isfrequently higher in urban areas, the urban poverty line is higher than the ruralpoverty line in the same country. International Poverty Rates data are based on nationally representative primary household surveys conducted by national statistical offices, or by private agenciesunder the supervision of government or international agencies and obtained fromgovernment statistical offices and World Bank country departments. Surveys wereconducted between 1985 and 2002. PPP exchange rates, such as those from thePenn World Tables or the World Bank, are used because they take into account localprices and goods and services not traded internationally. In past years, the WorldBank has calculated poverty estimates using PPPs from the Penn World Tables.Beginning in 2002 the World Bank used 1993 consumption PPP estimates producedat the Bank. Population Living Below $1/day is the percentage of the population of a country living on less than $1.08 a day at 1993 international prices, equivalent to $1 in1985 prices when adjusted for purchasing power parity. This amount is calculatedas the consumption level necessary to basic life maintenance, and income belowthis level is referred to as \"extreme poverty.\" Population Living Below $2/day i s the percentage of the population of a country living on less than $2.15 a day at1993 international prices, equivalent to $2 in 1985 prices when adjusted forpurchasing power parity. Poverty Gap measures both the breadth and severity of poverty below thresholds (poverty lines) of $1.08/day and $2.15/day at 1993 international prices (equivalentto $1 and $2 respectively in 1985 prices, adjusted for purchasing power parity).Measured as a percentage, the indicator shows the \"poverty deficit\" of the country'spopulation, where the poverty deficit is the per capita amount of resources that would be needed to bring all poor people to the poverty line through perfectlytargeted cash transfers. For example, a greater proportion of the population in Laos is living on less than $2/day than in El Salvador\u201473 percent vs. 58 percent. While Laos has agreater breadth (incidence) of poverty, the poverty in El Salvador is more severe, sothe two countries both have poverty gaps that approach 30 percent. It wouldrequire the same investment in both countries relative to the total population ineach to bring the entire population to the poverty line: 30% x $2/day = $0.60/dayper capita. In technical terms, the poverty gap is defined as the mean distance from the poverty line expressed as a percentage of the poverty line, counting the distance ofthe non-poor as zero. It is calculated by dividing the average income shortfall bythe poverty line. For example, in a country with a poverty line of $1/day and threeaverage daily incomes\u2014$1.60, $0.90, and $0.50\u2014the be (Three shortfalls\u2014$0.00, $0.10, and $0.50\u2014are averaged to yield amean shortfall of $0.20, and the resulting poverty gap is $0.20/$1.00 = 20 percent) The Gini Index measures income inequality by quantifying the deviation of income or consumption distribution from perfect equality. A score of zero implies perfectequality while a score of 100 implies perfect inequality. If every person in a countryearned the same income, the Gini Index would be zero; if all income was earned byone person, the Gini Index would be 100. The Gini Index is calculated by compilingincome (or expenditure) distribution data. For developing countries, the Gini Indexis compiled from household survey data; for high-income countries the index iscalculated directly from the Luxemburg Income Study database, using an estima-tion method consistent with that applied for developing countries. Once compiled,income or expenditure distribution data are plotted on a Lorenz curve, which illus-trates the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulativenumber of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The GiniIndex is calculated as the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical (45-degree) line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximumarea under the line. Unemployment Rate is defined as the percentage of the total labor force which is simultaneously without work, available to work, and actively seeking work.Definitions may vary among countries. The World Bank receives its data on nationalunemployment rates from the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Bureau ofStatistics. The ILO compiles this information from a combination of sources, includ-ing labor force surveys, national estimates, social insurance statistics, andemployment office statistics. The information presented here is the annual averageof the monthly, quarterly, or biannual unemployment estimates. The Human Development Index is comprised of three sub-indices that measure health and lifespan, education and knowledge, and standard of living. It attemptsto describe achievement of development goals related to quality of life using datathat can be compared across countries and time. It is aggregated from 4 indica-tors: life expectancy, adult literacy, the gross school enrollment index, andGDP per capita. Life expectancy is the average number of years that a newborn baby is expected to live using current age-specific mortality rates. Adult literacy is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 years and over which can both readand write, with understanding, a short, simple statement on their everyday life. The gross enrollment index measures school enrollment, regardless of age, as a percentage of the official school-age population. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita measures the total annual output of a country's economy per person.These four indicators are classified in three separate categories\u2014life expectancy,education, and GDP\u2014which are indexed independently and then weighted equallyto calculate the final index. More information is available at http://hdr.undp.org. 1904Income and Poverty: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:06 PM Page 190191The Human Poverty Index is a composite indicator that describes a population's deprivation from three development goals related to quality of life: health, literacy,and sufficient standard of living. The index is scaled from 0-100, with 100 repre-senting the highest possible level of poverty. Data presented here are from two separate surveys. Non-OECD countries are evaluated using the \"HP-1\" index based on four indicators: probability at birth ofnot surviving to age 40 (1/3 total index value), adult illiteracy rate (1/3 total indexvalue), children underweight for age (1/6 total index value), and population withoutaccess to an improved water source (1/6 total index value). OECD countries areevaluated using the \"HP-2\" index with four different indicators: probability at birth of not surviving to age 60, adults lacking functional literacy skills, populationbelow income poverty line, and long-term unemployment. The four OECD indicatorsare weighted equally in calculating the final index. For more information, seehttp://hdr.undp.org. FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS Human Development Index and Human Poverty Index data are published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the Human Development Report. Poverty Rates and Income Inequality data are updated irregularly as surveys are conducted in individual countries; new survey resultsare compiled and released annually in the World Bank's World DevelopmentIndicators. GDP Per Capita and Unemployment Rates are updated annually in World Development Indicators. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES GDP per capita (PPP): While the World Bank produces the most reliable global GDP estimates available, many obstacles inhibit data collection and compilation ofaccurate information. Informal economic activities sometimes pose a measurementproblem, especially in developing countries, where much economic activity may gounrecorded. Obtaining a complete picture of the economy requires estimatinghousehold outputs produced for local sale and home use, barter exchanges, andillicit or deliberately unreported activity. Technical improvements and growth in theservices sector are both particularly difficult to measure. Purchasing power parity(PPP) rates are based on price surveys that do not include a full selection of goodsand services, and not all countries participate in the International ComparisonProgram. The World Bank is in the process of developing updated PPP estimatesfrom new price surveys. National Poverty Rates: National poverty lines are based on the calculation of the minimum income necessary to purchase a fixed amount of essential food and non-food items. Since these needs vary by nation, the poverty rates in this category arenot comparable among countries, and, unlike international poverty rates, shouldnot be used for comparison. However, national poverty rates can provide a morecomplete sense of poverty in a nation by describing poverty levels unique to eachcountry and showing the differences between urban and rural areas. International Poverty Rates: The quality of surveys underlying these estimates varies, and even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable. For example,surveys can be based on either household consumption or household income.Consumption data are considered to be more accurate and accord better with thestandard of living, but when consumption data are not available, surveys based onhousehold income are used. Household consumption can also differ widely, forexample, based on the number of distinct categories of consumer goods theyidentify. Comparisons across countries at different levels of development pose apotential problem because of differences in the relative importance of consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all in-kind consumption (includingconsumption from own production, particularly important in underdeveloped ruraleconomies) should be included in the measure of total consumption expenditure.Similarly, the imputed profit from production of nonmarket goods should beincluded in income. This is not always done, though such omissions were a farbigger problem in surveys before the 1980s. Most survey data now include valua-tions for consumption or income from own production. Nonetheless, valuationmethods vary. For example, some surveys use the price in the nearest market, whileothers use the average farm gate selling price. Although the $1/day and $2/day poverty lines are commonly used, there exists an ongoing debate as to how well they capture poverty across nations. Valuesshould be treated as rough statistical approximations of the number of peopleearning or consuming at a given level rather than a certain prognosis of how manypeople are poor. International poverty rates do not capture other elements of poverty,including lack of access to health care, education, safe water, or sanitation. Income Inequality: Values are derived in part from household surveys that measure expenditure in different countries. Despite recent improvements in surveymethodology and consistency in the type of data collection, income distributionindicators are still not strictly comparable across countries. Surveys can differ inthe type of information requested\u2014for example, whether income or consumption isused. The distribution of income is typically more unequal than the distribution ofconsumption. Even where two surveys request income information, definitions ofincome may vary. Consumption is usually a much better welfare indicator, particu-larly in developing countries. The households that are surveyed can differ in sizeand in the extent of income sharing among members, and individuals within ahousehold may differ in age and consumption needs. Differences among countriesin these respects may bias comparisons of distribution. Unemployment Rate: Though the quality of the underlying data compiled by the ILO varies and differences in national reporting standards do exist, the final estimatesshould be considered generally accurate. The ILO has developed a rigorous account-ing procedure, and balances government reports with employment office statisticsas well as its own surveys and the knowledge of in-country experts. Human Development Index and Human Poverty Index: These two indices have been constructed specifically to use data from respected sources and calculated ina fashion as to allow for time-series analysis and cross-country comparisons.Ultimately, there is some degree of subjectivity in the creation of any index of thissort, but the data underlying the index can be considered reliable.

Data are expressed in millions of U.S.dollars. Currencies are converted to dollars using the International Monetary Fund's(IMF) average official exchange rate for 2002. Gross domestic product estimates atpurchaser values (market prices) include the value added in the agriculture, industry, and service sectors, plus taxes and minus subsidies not included in thefinal value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreci-ation of fabricated assets or for depletion of natural resources. To obtain series ofconstant price data that one can compare over time, the World Bank rescales GDPand value added by industrial origin to a common reference year, currently 1995. National accounts indicators for most developing countries are collected from national statistical organizations and central banks by visiting and residentWorld Bank missions. The data for high-income economies are obtained from theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data files (see theOECD's monthly Main Economic Indicators ). Additional data are obtained from the United Nations Statistics Division's National Accounts Statistics: Main Aggregates and Detailed Tables andMonthly Bulletin of Statistics. Average Annual Growth Rate of GDP is the average percentage growth of a country or region's economy for each year between (and including) 1992 and 2002.WRI assumes compound growth and uses the least-squares method to calculateaverage annual percent growth. The least squares method works by fitting a trendline to the natural logarithm of annual GDP values. The slope ( m) of this trend line is used to calculate the annual growth rate ( r) using the equation r = em- 1. The growth rate is an average rate that is representative of the available observationsover the entire period. It does not necessarily match the actual growth rate betweenany two periods. Gross Domestic Product Per Capita is the total annual output of a country's economy divided by the mid-year population. GDP per capita values are obtaineddirectly from the World Bank. Distribution of GDP by Sector is the percent of total output of goods and services that are a result of value added by a given sector. These goods and services are forfinal use occurring within the domestic territory of a given country, regardless of theallocation to domestic and foreign claims. Value added is the net output of a sectorafter adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. The industrialorigin of value added is determined by the International Standard IndustrialClassification (ISIC) revision 3. The ISIC is a classification system for economicactivity developed and maintained by the United Nations. Agriculture corresponds to ISIC divisions 1-5 and includes forestry and fishing. Industry corresponds to ISIC divisions 10-45 and comprises the mining, manufac- turing, construction, electricity, water, and gas sectors. Services correspond to ISIC divisions 50-99 and include value added in wholesale and retail trade (includ-ing hotels and restaurants); transport; and government, financial, professional,and personal services such as education, health care, and real estate services.Value added from services is calculated as total GDP less the portion from agricul-ture and industry, so any discrepancies that may occur in the GDP distribution bysector calculation will appear here.Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) are defined as the joining of two firms or the takeover of one by another when the parties involved are based indifferent national economies. Data are presented here as the net inflows of M&Acapital (sales less purchases) and are in millions of U.S. dollars. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) obtains these data from Thomson Financial Securities Data Company. Data are reported atthe time of transaction and recorded by the governments of both the target firmand the purchasing firm. WRI calculates net inflows by subtracting the total valueof purchases of firms within a country from total value of acquisitions made byfirms within that country. Transaction amounts are recorded at the time of trans-fer, rather than contract. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is private investment in a foreign economy to obtain a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in anenterprise. The IMF defines FDI in its Balance of Payments Manual as the sum of equity investment, reinvestment of earnings, and inter-company loans betweenparent corporations and foreign affiliates. Data are in million current U.S. dollars.FDI became the dominant means for funds transfer from rich to poor countries afterthe liberalization of global financial markets in the 1970s and accounts for morethan one-half of financial flows to developing countries. Data are based on balanceof payments information reported by the IMF, supplemented by data from the OECDand official national sources. Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Aid includes concessions by govern- ments and international institutions to developing countries to promote economicdevelopment and welfare. The data shown here record the actual receipts of finan-cial resources or of goods or services valued at the cost to the donor, less anyrepayments of loan principal during the same period. Values are reported in millioncurrent US dollars. Grants by official agencies of the members of the DevelopmentAssistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD are included, as are loans with a grantelement of at least 25 percent, and technical cooperation and assistance. The dataon development assistance are compiled by the DAC and published in its annualstatistical report, Geographical Distribution of Financial Flows to Aid Recipients, and the DAC annual Development Co-operation Report. WRI calculates Remittances as a Percent of GNI by dividing workers' remit- tances by Gross National Income. Both values are originally in current U.S. dollars,and the quotient is expressed as a percentage. Workers' remittances include the transfer of earned wages by migrant workers to their home country. It includes all transfers by migrants who areemployed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy inwhich they are considered residents. Transfers made by self-employed workers arenot considered remittances, as this indicator attempts to describe money raisedthrough labor rather than entrepreneurial activity. Since 1980, recorded remittancereceipts to low- and middle-income countries have increased six-fold. Average Annual Inflation Rate is the average annual percentage change in consumer prices between (and including) 1998 and 2003. The inflation ratesshown here are based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures thechange in cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods andservices, using the Laspeyres formula. WRI assumes compound growth and usesthe least-squares method to calculate average annual percent growth. The leastsquares method works by fitting a trend line to the natural logarithm of annualconsumer price values. The slope ( m) of this trend line is used to calculate the annual growth rate ( r) using the equation r = em- 1.The growth rate is an average rate that is representative of the available observations over the entire period. Itdoes not necessarily match the actual growth rate between any two periods. 1945Economics and Financial Flows: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:06 PM Page 194195FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS The World Bank publishes World Development Indicators each year in April. Data for this table were taken from the 2004 on-line edition, which typically include values through 2002 or 2003. UNCTAD updates the World Investment Report annually. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Gross Domestic Product: The World Bank produces the most reliable global GDP estimates available. Informal economic activities sometimes pose a measure-ment problem, however, especially in developing countries, where mucheconomic activity may go unrecorded. Obtaining a complete picture of theeconomy requires estimating household outputs produced for local sale andhome use, barter exchanges, and illicit or deliberately unreported activity.Technical improvements and growth in the services sector are both particularlydifficult to measure. How consistent and complete such estimates will bedepends on the skill and methods of the compiling statisticians and theresources available to them. Because values are measured in U.S. dollars, thesedata do not account for differences in purchasing power among countries. Mergers and Acquisitions: Values are calculated based on the year that a deal closes, not at the time a deal is announced. M&A values may be paid out over morethan one year. Data are accepted \"as is\" from national surveys. Some underreportingof data may occur, though as all transactions are registered in both the country of thepurchasing firm and the targeting firm, this is likely to be uncommon. Foreign Direct Investment: Because of the multiplicity of sources, definitions, and reporting methods, data may not be comparable across countries. (Data do notinclude capital raised locally, which has become an important source of financingin some developing countries.) In addition, data only capture cross-border invest-ment flows when equity participation is involved and thus omit non-equitycross-border transactions. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the WorldBank's World Debt Tables 1993-1994, volume 1, chapter 3. Official Development Assistance: Data are not directly comparable, since the ODA figures do not distinguish among different types of aid, which can affect individualeconomies in different ways. Because data are based on donor-country reports, theymay not match aid receipts recorded in developing and transition economies.According to the World Bank, \"the nominal values used here may overstate the realvalue of aid to the recipient.\" The purchasing power of foreign aid can decrease whenprice and exchange rates fluctuate, grants are tied to specific policy restrictions, ortechnical assistance pays for the work of firms in other countries. Worker Remittances: Data on worker remittances are reported by the countries receiving the transfers. Variations in reporting standards do exist, particularly indetermining the residency status of a worker. Inflation Rate: Data are based on CPIs, which are updated frequently and based on the prices of explicit goods and services. However, the weights used in calculat-ing CPIs are derived from household expenditure surveys, which can vary in qualityand frequency across countries. The definition of a household, the specific \"basket\"of goods chosen, and the geographic location of a survey can vary across countriesand within a specific country over time. According to the World Bank, these data are \"useful for measuring consumer prices within a country, [but] consumer priceindexes are of less value in making comparisons across countries.\"SOURCES GDP , Financial Flows (excluding M&A data), Remittances, and Inflation data: The World Bank, Development Data Group. 2004.

A score of plus 10 indicates a strongly democraticstate; a score of minus 10 a strongly autocratic state. A democratic governmentpossesses fully competitive political participation, institutionalized constraints onexecutive power, and guarantee of civil liberties to all citizens. An autocratic systemsharply restricts or suppresses competitive political participation, and its chiefexecutives are chosen by an elite group and exercise power with few institutional-ized constraints. The Level of Political Competition measures the extent to which alternate prefer- ences for policy and leadership can be pursued in the political arena. On a scale of0-5, one of the following categories is assigned to a country: (0) \"Not Applicable\"is used for a political system without stable groups. (1) \"Repressed\" is assigned tototalitarian party systems, authoritarian military dictatorships, and despoticmonarchies\u2014any regime where oppositional activity is not permitted outside of theruling party. Repressed regimes also have the power and ability to carry out system-atic repression. (2) \"Suppressed\" political systems contain some limited politicalcompetition outside of government; however, peaceful political competition andlarge classes of people are excluded from the political process. (3) \"Factional\"polities contain parochial or ethnic-based political factions that compete for influ-ence in order to promote agendas that favor the interests of group members overcommon interests. (4) \"Transitional\" arrangements accommodate competing inter-ests, but some factionalism associated with parochial interests may still bepresent. (5) \"Competitive\" systems are characterized by relatively stable andenduring political groups with regular competition and voluntary transfer of power.Small parties or political groups may, however, be restricted. The Level of Democracy and Political Competition indices are reported by the Polity IV Project of the Center for International Development & ConflictManagement. The Polity IV indices are compiled by a panel of experts using multi-ple historical sources for each country, combined with reference to a variety ofstandard sources. The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) measures the degree to which corrup- tion\u2014the abuse of public office for private gain\u2014is perceived to exist amongpublic officials and politicians. Ratings range in value from 10 (least corrupt) to 0(most corrupt). CPI is a composite index compiled by Transparency Internationalfrom the results of 17 surveys reported by 13 different independent institutions. Regulatory Barriers to Starting a Business measure the average amount of time and money necessary to register and incorporate a new business venture in thelargest city of a given country. These two indicators are measured in days and as apercent of the per capita gross national income (GNI). Governments differ signifi-cantly in the requirements they set for these processes. Broadly speaking, highervalues represent regulatory environments that stifle the creation of new enterprises. Data are obtained from the World Bank's Doing Business Database. World Bank staff collect this information in an extensive investigative process involvingsurveys and the input of local experts. Surveys are sent to lawyers working asbusiness retainers in the country of interest. Respondents are asked to list thesteps required to begin a business and to estimate both the cost and amount oftime required to perform each. Respondents' answers are compared and normal-ized in order to present a clear picture of the regulations surrounding the start of abusiness as well as shortcuts and common methods used for compliance. Surveyresults are corroborated by other in-country experts in business law and practice. Government Expenditures as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP) roughly indicate the economic importance of public health, public education, and militaryactivities on national economies.Public Health Expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from govern ment (both central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants (includ- ing donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations), andsocial (or compulsory) health insurance funds. The estimates of health expenditurecome mostly from the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Health Report 2003 and its subsequent updates, and from the OECD for its member countries, supple-mented by World Bank poverty assessments and country-sector studies. Data are alsodrawn from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Public Education Expenditure consists of public spending on public education plus subsidies to private education at the primary, secondary, and post-secondarylevels. Foreign aid for education is excluded. Education expenditure estimates areprovided to the World Bank by the Institute for Statistics of the United NationsEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO compiles itsdata from annual financial reports of central or federal governments and state orregional administrations. Military Expenditure is defined by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) as \"all current and capital expenditure on: (a) the armed forces,including peacekeeping forces; (b) defense ministries and other governmentagencies engaged in defense projects; (c) paramilitary forces, when judged to betrained and equipped for military operations; and (d) military space activities.\"Expenditures include the cost of procurements, personnel, research and develop-ment, construction, operations, maintenance, and military aid to other countries.Civil defense, veteran's benefits, demobilization, and destruction of weapons arenot included as military expenditures. SIPRI obtains military expenditure data fromseveral sources. Primary sources include national budget documents, defensewhite papers, public finance statistics, and responses to surveys. Surveys areadministered by either SIPRI, the United Nations, or the Organization for Securityand Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Secondary sources include data published bythe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Monetary Fund(IMF), the Europa Yearbook, and country reports of the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Digital Access Index reflects the ability of each country's population to take advantage of internet communication technologies. It is a composite score of eightvariables describing availability of infrastructure, affordability of access, educationallevel, quality of information and communication technology (ICT) services, andInternet usage. The index is calculated by the International TelecommunicationsUnion (ITU). ITU receives data on information technology from governments andindustry associations. Data on education and literacy rates are provided by UNESCO'sInstitute for Statistics. Freedom of Information (FOI) Legislation requires disclosure of government records to the public. There are now 48 countries with comprehensive FOI laws, plusa dozen or so countries with FOI-related constitutional provisions that can be usedto access information. Data are collected by Privacy International on a country-by-country basis and were last updated in February 2005. \"..\" in a data columnsignifies countries with no FOI legislation or no available data. The Press Freedom Index is defined by Freedom House as \"the degree to which each country permits the free flow of information,\" measured on a scale of 1 to 100.Countries with a score between 1 and 30 are considered to have a \"free\" media; 31 to 60, \"partly free\"; and 61 to 100, \"not free.\" Freedom House emphasizes that thissurvey does not measure press responsibility; rather, it measures the degree of freedom in the flow of information. Data are collected from overseas correspondents,staff travel, international visitors, the findings of human rights organizations, special-ists in geographic and geopolitical areas, the reports of governments, and a variety ofdomestic and international news media. The final index measures three separatecategories of influence on the media: national laws and administrative decisions;censorship and intimidation; and quotas, licensing biases, or government funding. 1986Institutions and Governance: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:06 PM Page 198199FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS All variables are updated annually except for the Digital Access Index, which was most recently released by ITU in November, 2003. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Many of the data in this table are index calculations and therefore contain an unavoidable amount of subjectivity. Indices typically measure ideas and behaviors rather than discrete physical quantities. While these data can illus-trate rough comparisons and trends over time, rigid score comparisons andrankings are discouraged. Level of Democracy and Political Competition: The Polity IV data are subject to substantial cross-checking and inter-coder reliability checks. The least reliablecalculations are typically the most recent, due to \"the fluidity of real-time politicaldynamics and the effects this immediacy may have on the assignment of Politycodes in a semi-annual research cycle.\" Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI): CPI is based solely on the perceptions of local residents, expatriates, business people, academics, and risk analysts. Hardempirical data such as cross-country comparisons of prosecutions or media report-ing are not used because they may measure the extent of anti-corruption effortsinstead of the extent of actual corruption. Regulatory Barriers to Starting a Business: The data have been subject to a rigorous series of quality-control measures in order to ensure accuracy and compa-rability across countries. However, problems do remain. Data only measure the timeand expense of starting an enterprise in the largest city of each country. Onlybusinesses who employ more than 50 people or have more than five local ownersare included. Smaller enterprises that are not measured here may have the mostdifficulty navigating bureaucratic and legal requirements. These data also assumethe ability of the business to hire a lawyer well-versed in the regulations regardingthe starting of a business, a service not available to many smaller entrepreneurs. Public Health Expenditure: The values reported here represent the product of an extensive effort by WHO, OECD, and the World Bank to produce a comprehensivedata set on national health accounts. Nonetheless, there are some difficulties withthe data. Few developing countries have health accounts that are methodologicallyconsistent with national accounting procedures. Data on public spending at thesub-national level is not aggregated in all countries, making total public expendi-ture on health care difficult to measure. WHO cautions that these data should onlybe used for an \"order of magnitude\" estimate, and that specific cross-countrycomparisons should be avoided. Public Education Expenditure: Recent data are preliminary. In some cases data refer only to a ministry of education's expenditures, excluding other ministries andlocal authorities that spend a part of their budget on educational activities.Spending on religious schools, which constitutes a large portion of educationalspending in some developing countries, may be included. The World Bank cautionsthat these data do not measure the effectiveness or levels of attainment in a partic-ular educational system.Military Expenditure: The entire data set has been carefully compiled with exten- sive analysis by a single provider, SIPRI, which makes these data fairly reliable.When a time series is not available, or a country's definition of military expenditurediffers from SIPRI's, estimates are made based on analysis of official governmentbudget statistics. Estimates are always based on empirical evidence, not assump-tions or extrapolations. SIPRI cautions that military expenditure does not relatedirectly to military capability or security. Status of Freedom of Information Legislation: While the FOI data have been thoroughly researched, there are unavoidable difficulties in assigning each countryto one of three categories. Some countries have laws guaranteeing access, but thelaws are not enforced. Others guarantee access to government documents inspecific categories, excluding access in other categories. A more thorough descrip-tion of each country's policies is available at http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/foia/foia-survey.html. Press Freedom Index: Freedom House has been reviewing press freedom since 1979; the Press Freedom Survey emerged in its current form in 1994. The dataare reproducible and the index components are clear. The data are consideredto be reliable; nonetheless, there is an unavoidable amount of subjectivity inany index calculation.

Energy losses fromtransportation, friction, heat, and other inefficiencies are included here. The originalsource material published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) refers to thesevalues as Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). To facilitate comparisons among differ-ent sources of energy, the heat content of all energy commodities is presented inmetric tons of oil equivalent (toe), which measures the energy contained in a metricton (1000 kg) of crude oil. One toe is equal to 10 7kilocalories, 41.868 gigajoules, or 11,628 kilowatt-hours (kWh). Basic energy statistics are collected by the IEA from a variety of sources. In OECD member countries, national administrations fill out five annual question-naires. In non-OECD countries, statistics are collected from the distribution ofquestionnaires, communication with international organizations such as the UnitedNations, co-operation with national statistical bodies, and direct contact withenergy consultants and companies. If data are not available from any of thesesources, they are estimated by the IEA. The energy produced by fossil fuels is calcu-lated using conversion factors per unit mass of fuel (e.g., 10,000 kcal/kg of oil).Since energy sources such as coal and crude oil may vary in quality, the IEA usesspecific conversion factors supplied by national administrations for the maincategories of energy sources and uses (i.e., production, imports, exports). The energyproduced by non-fossil fuels is more complicated to measure; the IEA must firstassume a primary form of energy to measure using global or regional efficiencyaverages, and then calculate the primary energy equivalent. Please refer to the origi-nal source for further information on the variables and collection methodologies. Energy Consumption Per Capita is the amount of energy, as defined above, consumed on average by each person, expressed in kilograms of oil equivalent(kgoe). This variable was calculated by dividing total consumption by populationfigures from the United Nations Population Division. Energy Consumption by Source data show the amount of energy consumed in five different categories as a percentage of total consumption: Fossil Fuels include crude oil and natural gas liquids, petroleum products, coal and coal products, and natural gas. Coal and coal products include hard coal,lignite, patent fuel, coke, blast furnace gas, coke-oven gas, brown coal briquettes(BKB), and peat. Oil and natural gas products include crude oil, natural gasliquids, refinery feedstocks, petroleum products, natural gas, gas works gas, andother hydrocarbons. The inclusion of petroleum products accounts for domesticprocessing of crude oil as well as assorted petroleum imports. Petroleum productsrefer to refinery gas, ethane, liquified petroleum gas, aviation gasoline, motorgasoline, jet fuels, kerosene, gas/diesel oil, heavy fuel oil, naphtha, white spirit,lubricants, bitumen, paraffin waxes, petroleum coke, and other products. Solid Biomass includes any plant matter used directly as a fuel or converted into other forms before combustion, including wood; vegetal waste including woodwaste and crop waste used for energy; animal materials and wastes; sulphite lyes(also known as black liquor, this is a sludge that contains the lignin digested fromwood for paper making); and other solid biomass. Inputs to charcoal production areincluded here. However, since charcoal is a secondary product, the IEA excludesfinal charcoal production numbers to avoid double counting. Nuclear includes all energy produced by nuclear power plants from nuclear fission. The consumption data shown here assume an average thermal efficiencyof 33 percent.Hydroelectric shows the energy content of the electricity produced in hydro power plants. The output from pumped storage plants is not included in these values. Other Renewables include energy from biogas, liquid biomass, geothermal, solar, ocean, and wave systems. Biogas energy is produced by the fermentation of animal dung, human sewage or crop residues. Liquid biomass energy is produced from bio-additives such as ethanol (alcohol). Geothermal technologies use the heat of the earth to generate energy. Solar energy includes the production of electricity from solar photovoltaic cells as well as the production of both electricityand heat from solar thermal energy. Passive solar energy for the direct heating,cooling, and lighting of dwellings or other buildings is not included here. Ocean energy includes the production of electricity from the mechanical energy of ocean waves and tides or from the thermal energy (heat) stored in the ocean. Wind energy uses the mechanical energy of the wind for generating electricity. Population Relying on Solid Fuels measures the percentage of the total popula- tion that burns solid fuels in their households. Solid fuels include coal or biomasssuch as dung, charcoal, wood, or crop residues. The World Health Organization(WHO) measures the prevalence of solid fuel usage because the burning of solidfuels in traditional stoves causes high levels of indoor air pollution, emittingdangerous pollutants such as carbon monoxide and particulates. Electricity Consumption per Capita measures the average kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical power generated per person in a particular country or region. Publicelectricity plants, private electricity plants, and combined heat and power (CHP)plants are all included. Electricity output from crude oil and natural gas liquids isnot included here. Electricity consumption equals production and imports minusexports and distribution losses. Population with Access to Electricity is defined as the percentage of the total population that has electrical power in their home. It includes commercially sold electricity, both on and off the grid. For those countries where access toelectricity has been assessed through government surveys, it also includes self-generated electricity. Proved Fossil Fuel Reserves are generally measured as quantities that geologi- cal and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can berecovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operat-ing conditions. In order to facilitate comparisons among different sources of energy,fossil fuel reserves estimates have been converted to metric tons of oil equivalent(toe). A toe measures the energy contained in a metric ton (1000 kg) of crude oil. Coal reserves include anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal. The standard conversion factors for one ton of oil equivalent are 1.5 tons ofanthracite and bituminous coal and 3 tons of sub-bituminous and lignite coal. Oil includes gas condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) as well as crude oil.Estimates were converted to metric tons of oil equivalent by BP, the data provider,using individual country conversion factors. Natural Gas was converted using the standard conversion factor of 0.9 million metric tons of oil equivalent per billioncubic meters of natural gas. 2027Energy: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:06 PM Page 202203Net Fuel Imports measures the amount of fossil fuel that enters the national terri- torial boundaries of a country, whether or not customs clearance has taken place,minus the amount that leaves via export. Fossil fuel includes crude oil and naturalgas liquids, petroleum products, coal and coal products, and natural gas.Quantities of crude oil and oil products imported under processing agreements (i.e.,refining on account) are included. Quantities of oil in transit are excluded. Re-exports of oil imported for processing within bonded areas are shown as exports ofproduct from the processing country to the final destination. Petroleum productsrefer to refinery gas, ethane, liquified petroleum gas, aviation gasoline, motorgasoline, jet fuels, kerosene, gas/diesel oil, heavy fuel oil, naphtha, white spirit,lubricants, bitumen, paraffin waxes, petroleum coke, and other petroleum products.Natural gas and gas-works gas are included. Natural gas is reported as comingfrom the country of origin. Coal imports includes all coal, both primary (includinghard coal and lignite/brown coal) and derived fuels (including patent fuel, coke-oven coke, gas coke, BKB, coke oven gas, and blast furnace gas). Peat is alsoincluded. In most cases, coal in transit is not included. Regional totals includegoods imported from other countries belonging to the same region. Consequently,these totals by no means represent a region's net imports or net exports. FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS IEA and BP update their energy data annually. WHO updates their information everytwo years. These updates also often include revisions of past data. Data may there-fore differ from those reported in past editions of the World Resources Report. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Energy The data on energy balances are based primarily on well-established and institution-alized accounting methodologies and are therefore considered reliable. One exceptionis fuelwood and other biomass fuels, which are estimated by the IEA based on smallsample surveys or other incomplete information. Energy production estimates fromnuclear power and renewable sources (hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, and windpower) are calculated using a number of assumptions about primary energy formsand plant efficiencies. As a result, these values may be less reliable than estimatesof energy produced from fossil fuels, and the share of renewables in total energyconsumption may appear different here than it would from other providers. IEA data do not distinguish between \"no data\" (denoted in these tables with \"..\" ) and zero values. WRI has distinguished between the two where possible, butsome values represented as zero should probably be indicated by \"..\" and vice versa. Proven Fossil Fuel Reserves Every effort is made to come up with a consistent series for reserves based ona common definition; however, in reality, different countries use differentmethodologies, and the data have varying levels of reliability. Since energysources such as coal may vary in quality, converting the estimates into toeusing standard conversion factors, rather than country specific conversionfactors, introduces a level of uncertainty to the reserve estimates shown here. Percent of Population Relying on Solid Fuels The estimates of household solid fuel use were compiled with the help of several studies conducted over the past decade. It has been assumed that patterns in solidfuel use have not changed dramatically over this time period.SOURCES Energy and Electricity Consumption and Net Inputs: International Energy Agency (IEA). 2003.

Data are expressed in million metric tons.CO 2emissions from land-use change are not included here. These estimates do not include bunker fuels used in international transportation. Where values were origi-nally in given in mass of carbon, WRI multiplied by 3.664 (the ratio of the molecularmass of CO 2to that of carbon) to convert to mass of CO2. CO2Emissions Per Capita measures the mass of CO2produced per person for a country or region, in metric tons. WRI calculates per capita emissions with popula-tion estimates from the United Nations Population Division (2002 revision). Data on carbon dioxide emissions are obtained from the World Resources Institute's Climate Analysis and Indicators Tool (CAIT). In order to provide the mostcomplete and accurate data set, CAIT compiles data from the International EnergyAgency (IEA), the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), and theEnergy Information Agency (EIA). Fossil fuel emissions estimates for 131 countriesare available from the IEA and reported in CAIT. WRI used CDIAC data on fossil fuelemissions for the 53 countries that lack IEA data. (Data for Lesotho were obtainedfrom the EIA.) Data on emissions from cement manufacturing were obtained fromCDIAC for all countries and added to the fossil-fuel emissions totals by WRI. Acomplete country-by-country listing of source and notes can be found athttp://cait.wri.org/cait.php?page=notes&chapt=2. Emissions are calculated by the IEA using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reference Approach. CDIAC estimates are derived fromenergy statistics obtained from United Nations Statistical Office questionnairesand supplemented by official national statistical publications. The U.S. EnergyInformation Administration (EIA) estimates CO 2emissions by country and year, based on energy balances. Cumulative CO2Emissions from Fossil Fuels and Cement, 1950-2000 repre- sents the total mass of CO2produced in all years from 1950 to 2000 as a result of the combustion of solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels, as well as from gas flaring andthe manufacture of cement. CO 2emissions from land use change are not included here. These estimates do not include bunker fuels used in international transporta-tion. To estimate cumulative emissions in recently formed countries, WRIapportions emissions estimates based on current emissions and historicalemissions from former countries and territories. Cumulative CO2Emissions from Land-Use Change, 1950-2000 represents the total mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbed or emitted into the atmosphere between 1950 and 2000 as a result of man-made land-use changes (for example,deforestation, shifting cultivation, and vegetation re-growth on abandonedcroplands and pastures). Positive values signify a positive net flux (\"source\") ofCO 2, indicating that carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere. Negative values signify a negative net flux (\"sink\") of CO2, indicating that carbon dioxide has been absorbed as a result of the re-growth of previously removedvegetation. Data include emissions from living and dead vegetation disturbed atthe time of clearing or harvest, emissions from wood products (including fuelwood), and emissions from the oxidation of organic matter in the soil in yearsfollowing initial cultivation. Ecosystems that are not directly affected by humanactivities such as agriculture and forestry are not included in these totals. The netflux of CO 2for each country was calculated by R.A. Houghton at the Woods Hole Research Center based on regional fluxes. WRI calculated cumulative carbonemissions from land-use change using annual country-level data. For more infor-mation, refer to \"Data Note: Emissions (and Sinks) of Carbon from Land-UseChange,\" online at http://cait.wri.org.Carbon Dioxide Emissions by Sector shows the proportion of total CO2emissions from fossil fuel burning contributed by transportation, industry, and electricityproduction. The Transportation sector includes fossil fuel emissions from road, rail, air, and other forms of transportation, and agricultural vehicles while they areon highways. Data do not include international aviation or ship emissions. The Industry and Construction sectors include fossil fuel emissions in all industries and construction. The Electricity sector includes fossil fuel emissions from public electricity generation, combined heat and power generation, and heat plants.Emissions from electricity and heat production for use by the producer (autoproduc-tion) for public or private activities are included here. The emissions figures presented here are calculated by the IEA using the IPCC Sectoral Approach and default emission factors from the Revised 1996 IPCCGuidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the IEA energy balances. Methane Emissions measures the total release of methane (CH4) into the earth's atmosphere that results from human activities such as agricultural and industrialmethane production. Values are expressed in thousand metric tons of CO 2equiva- lent using the global warming potential (GWP), which allows the different gases tobe compared on the basis of their effective contributions. One kilogram of methaneis 23 times as effective at trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere as a singlekilogram of CO 2(using a time horizon of 100 years). Nitrous Oxide Total Emissions represents the total release of nitrous oxide (N2O) into the earth's atmosphere that results from human activities such as agriculture,biomass burning, industrial activities, and livestock management. Values areexpressed in thousand metric tons of CO 2equivalent using the GWP, which allows the different gases to be compared on the basis of their effective contributions. Theglobal warming potential of one kilogram of N 20 is nearly 300 times that of a single kilogram of CO2(using a time horizon of 100 years). Fluorinated Gases Emissions represents the total release of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) into atmosphere. These three groups of fluorinated gases (\"f-gases\") persist in theatmosphere for thousands of years. Hydrofluorocarbons are a by-product of HFC- 23 and HCFC-22 (IPCC Source Categories 2E 2F), which are used theproduction of aerosols, refrigeration/AC compounds, solvents, foams, fire extin-guishing compounds, semiconductors, and flat-panel displays. Perfluorocarbons are produced in the manufacture of semiconductors and as a byproduct of CF4and C2F6in primary aluminum production (IPCC Source Categories 2C, 2E, and 2F). Sulfur Hexafluoride emissions are generated from magnesium processing, semiconductor production, and the use and manufacture of gas insulatedswitchgear in electricity distribution networks (IPCC Source Categories 2C and 2F).Values are expressed in thousand metric tons of CO 2equivalent using the global warming potential (GWP), which allows the different gases to be compared on thebasis of their effective contributions. The global warming potential of one kilogramof a fluorinated gas is several thousand times that of a single kilogram of CO 2 (using a time horizon of 100 years). Most of the Methane, Nitrous Oxide, and Fluorinated Gas data shown here were compiled by WRI from Non-CO2Gases Economic Analysis and Inventory. This data set was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), covers 90countries, and accounts for close to 90 percent of global emissions. The remainingdata were either obtained from the EDGAR database of the Dutch National Instituteof Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) or estimated by WRI based on regionaltotals and figures for earlier years. A complete listing of sources by country is avail-able at http://cait.wri.org/cait.php?page=notes&chapt=2. 2068Climate 206207Total GHG Emissions include the total mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from fossil fuel and cement manufacturing plus the CO2emissions equivalent of methane (CH4), in year 2000. Data shown here exclude CO2 from land-use change. Kyoto Protocol Status indicates the year that a country ratified the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Ratification (or its equivalents of acceptance, approval, or accession) binds thestate to observe the treaty. The Kyoto Protocol was established in 1997 by the thirdsession of the Conference of Parties (COP-3) to the UNFCCC. Upon ratification,Annex I (industrialized) countries commit themselves to reducing their collectiveemissions of six greenhouse gases by at least 5 percent from 1990 levels during thefirst commitment period, which is 2008-2012. Compared to emissions levels thatwould be expected by 2010 without emissions-control measures, the Protocol targetrepresents a 30 percent cut. Under the Protocol, both developed and developingcountries agree to limit emissions and promote adaptation to future climatechange, submit information on their national climate-change program and inven-tories, promote technology transfer, cooperate on scientific and public research, andpromote public awareness and education. The Protocol came into force on February16, 2005, following ratification by Russia in November, 2004. More information isavailable in A Guide to the Climate Change Convention Process, online at http://unfccc.int/resource/process/guideprocess-p.pdf. FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS Carbon dioxide emissions, cumulative emissions, and non-CO2greenhouse gas emissions are updated by WRI's CAIT tool when new data are available; most CO2 emissions data are updated annually, while non-CO2GHG emissions are updated intermittently by RIVM and the EPA. Sectoral emissions data are updated by the IEAevery year; as of spring, 2005, data are available from the original source through2002. Sectoral emissions data from 2000 are included here to enable directcomparisons with the emissions data in this table. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES CO2Emissions: The IPCC Reference Approach (used here for most emissions estimates) can overestimate emissions because it uses energy supply data ratherthan combustion data. In a few cases, the estimates shown here differ significantly(by more than 5 percent) from those reported by individual countries or by theUNFCCC. This is because some countries use different energy figures than the IEAand WRI or treat bunker fuels differently. Other countries calculate emissions withspecific calorific values instead of the averages used by the IEA. Emissions data are synthesized by WRI from three different data sets, which presents both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, \"filling\" the gapsfrom different data sources improved the ability to make cross-country comparisons andrelated analyses. Yet comparability can be endangered when data points from differentsources (using different methodologies) are placed side-by-side. For a complete discussion of CAIT's methodology, see http://cait.wri.org/downloads/cait_ghgs.pdf.Cumulative CO2Emissions from Land-Use Change: CO2emissions estimates from land-use change considerably less reliable than other CO2and GHG emissions estimates; as a result, data should be treated as order-of-magnitudeestimates. The data provider states that yearly flux estimates are uncertain on theorder of \u00b1150 percent for large fluxes, and \u00b150 million tons of carbon per year forestimates near zero. The cumulative emissions presented here, however, are moreaccurate than the data for individual years. More information is available at:http://cait.wri.org/downloads/DN-LUCF .pdf. CO2Emissions by Sector: Data shown in these columns are calculated using the IPCC Sectoral Approach, which surveys actual consumption of fossil fuels by eachsector in order to calculate emissions. Other columns in the table have been calcu-lated using the IPCC Reference Approach. While in theory the numbers should beidentical, in practice there are minor variations between the data produced by thetwo methodologies. Methane, Nitrous Oxide, and Fluorinated Gas Emissions: Generally, estimates of non-CO2GHG emissions are less certain than CO2emissions estimates. Estimates of nitrous oxide emissions are less certain than methane and fluorinatedgas estimates. This data set provides a sound basis for comparability, however,since the methods used are comparable to IPCC methodologies, the global totalscomply with budgets used in atmospheric studies, and the data were based oninternational information sources. The data presented here may not match the official methane emissions estimates submitted by countries to the UNFCCC. In most cases, however, thedifferences are not substantial. In the year 2000, WRI estimated methane andnitrous oxide emissions for some countries (accounting for about 10 percent of allemissions); these estimates should be considered rough approximations.

Actual renewable water resources are defined as the sum of internalrenewable resources (IRWR) and external renewable resources (ERWR), taking intoconsideration the quantity of flow reserved to upstream and downstream countriesthrough formal or informal agreements or treaties and possible reduction of exter-nal flow due to upstream water abstraction. IRWR include the average annual flowof rivers and the recharge of groundwater (aquifers) generated from endogenousprecipitation\u2014the precipitation occurring within a country's borders. ERWR repre-sent the portion of the country's renewable water resources that is not generatedwithin the country. ERWR include inflows from upstream countries (groundwaterand surface water) and a portion of the water of border lakes or rivers. Per Capita Actual Renewable Water Resources are measured in cubic meters per person per year (m3/person/year). Per capita actual water resources werecalculated by WRI using population data from the United Nations PopulationDivision for the year 2004. Annual Water Withdrawals, measured in cubic kilometers per year, is the gross amount of water extracted from any source, either permanently or temporarily, fora given use. It can be either diverted towards distribution networks or directly used.It includes consumptive use, conveyance losses, and return flow. Total waterwithdrawal is the sum of estimated water use by the agricultural, domestic, andindustrial sectors. It does not include precipitation. Per Capita Annual Withdrawals were calculated by WRI using national popula- tion data from the UN Population Division for the year 2000. Withdrawals by Sector, expressed as a percentage, refers to the proportion of water used for one of three purposes: agriculture, industry, or domestic uses. Allwater withdrawals are allocated to one of these three categories. Agricultural uses of water primarily include irrigation and, to a lesser extent, livestock. Industrial use measures consumption by self-supplied industries not connected to any distri-bution network for manufacturing, cooling machinery and equipment, producingenergy, cleaning and washing manufactured goods, and as a solvent. Domestic uses include drinking water plus water withdrawn for homes, municipalities,commercial establishments, and public services (e.g., hospitals). Freshwater resources data were provided by AQUASTAT, a global database of water statistics maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations (FAO). AQUASTAT collects its information from a number of sources\u2014national water resources and irrigation master plans; national yearbooks,statistics, and reports; and national or international surveys. When possible, FAO cross-checks information between countries to improve assessments in countries where information is limited. When several sources givedifferent or contradictory figures, preference is always given to informationcollected at national or sub-national level. This preference is based on the assump-tion that no regional information can be more accurate than studies carried out atthe country level. Unless proven inaccurate, official rather than unofficial sourceswere used. In the case of shared water resources, a comparison between countrieswas made to ensure consistency at river-basin level. Inland and Marine Fisheries Production, Capture data refer to the nominal catch of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic mammals, and other aquatic animalstaken for commercial, industrial, recreational, and subsistence purposes frommarine, brackish, and inland waters. The harvest from aquaculture and other kindsof farming are excluded. Statistics for aquatic plants are also excluded fromcountry totals. Total capture production includes freshwater fish (carp, tilapias,etc.), diadromous fish (river eels, salmon, etc.), marine fish (flounders, cods,redfishes, tunas, mackerels, sharks, etc.) crustaceans (lobster, shrimp, etc.), andmolluscs (oyster, clams, squid, etc.). Data include all quantities caught and landedfor both food and feed purposes but exclude catch discarded at sea. Inland and Marine Fisheries Production, Aquaculture data refer to the harvest of fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and other aquatic animals cultivated in marine,inland, or brackish environments. Data do not include capture production.Statistics for aquatic plants are also excluded. Aquaculture is defined by FAO as \"the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans, andaquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process toenhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators,etc. [It] also implies ownership of the stock being cultivated.\" Aquatic organismsthat are exploitable by the public as a common property resource are not includedin aquaculture production. Production of fish, crustaceans, and molluscs is expressed in live weight, the nominal weight of the aquatic organisms at the time of harvest. For a more detailedlisting of the species mentioned above, refer to the original source athttp://www.fao.org/waicent/faostat/agricult/fishitems-e-e.html. Most fisheries statistics are collected by FAO from questionnaires sent to national fisheries agencies. When these data are missing or considered unreliable,FAO estimates fishery production based on regional fishery organizations, projectdocuments, industry magazines, or statistical interpolations. Regional totals repre-sent a sum of available data and may be incomplete. Trade in Fish and Fisheries Products measures the value of all fisheries products, excluding non-edible shells and aquatic plants, entering (referred to asimports) or leaving (referred to as exports) a country's borders each year throughtrade. The totals reported here incorporate the same species as the FAO's Yearbookof Fishery Statistics (ftp://ftp.fao.org/fi/stat/summary/default.htm). The value ofthis trade is expressed in millions of U.S. dollars. In accordance with internationally recommended practice, import statistics include fish caught by foreign fishing craft, whether or not processed on board,landed in domestic ports; export statistics include fish caught by domestic fishingcraft, whether or not processed on board, landed in foreign ports. As such, land-bound countries can therefore export marine fish and fish products. Exports aregenerally on a free-on-board basis (i.e., not including insurance or freight costs).Regional totals are calculated by adding up imports or exports of each countryincluded in that region. The regional totals should not be taken as a net trade forthat region, since much trade occurs intra-regionally. Number of Fishers includes the number of people employed full or part-time in commercial and subsistence fishing (both personnel on fishing vessels and onshore), operating in freshwater, brackish, and marine areas, and in aquacultureproduction activities. Data on people employed in fishing and aquaculture arecollected by the FAO through annual questionnaires submitted to the nationalreporting offices of the member countries. When possible, other national andregional published sources are also used to estimate figures. Fish Protein as a Percent of Animal Protein Supply is defined as the quantity of protein from both freshwater and marine fish, seafood, and derived productsavailable for human consumption as a percentage of all available animal protein.FAO calculates per capita protein supply for all products, including fish, in its 2109Water Resources and Fisheries: Technical Notesjp8589 210211collection of Supply/Utilization Accounts (SUAs) and food balance sheets. For each product, the SUA traces supplies from production, imports, and stocks to its utiliza-tion in different forms\u2014addition to stocks; exports; animal food and non-food purposes; waste (or losses); and lastly as food available forhuman consumption, where appropriate. For more detailed information, please referto the following article: \"Supply Utilization Accounts and Food Balance Sheets in theContext of a National Statistical System,\" maintained on-line by FAO athttp://www.fao.org/es/ESS/Suafbs.htm. FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS Most freshwater data are not available in a time series and are updated intermit-tently; the global data set maintained on-line by AQUASTAT contains data collectedover a time span of up to 30 years. Fisheries production and trade data areupdated annually by the Fishery Information, Data and Statistics Unit (FIDI) of FAO.Number of fishers data are updated by FIDI every 2-4 years. The FAO updates thedata on fish protein annually; the most recent updates incorporated in these tablesare from July 2004. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Water Resources and Withdrawals: While AQUASTAT represents the most complete and careful compilation to date of statistics on country-level waterresources, the quality of the primary information on which it relies varies.Information sources are numerous but rarely complete. Some governments will keepinternal water resources information confidential because they are competing forwater resources with bordering countries. Many instances of water scarcity arehighly localized and are not reflected in national statistics. In addition, theaccuracy and reliability of information vary greatly among regions, countries, andcategories of information, as does the year in which the information was gathered.All data should be considered order-of-magnitude estimates. Actual Renewable Water Resources: Exchanges between countries are compli- cated when a river crosses the same border several times. Part of the incomingwater flow may thus originate from the same country in which it enters, making itnecessary to calculate a \"net\" inflow to avoid double counting of resources. Inaddition, the water that is actually accessible to humans for consumption is oftenmuch smaller than the total renewable water resources indicated in the data table. Actual Renewable Water Resources Per Capita: Water resources data are from a different set of years than the population data used in the calculation. While thewater resources data are usually long-term averages, inconsistencies may arisewhen combining it with 2000 population data. For more information about thecollection methodology and reliability of the UN population data, please refer to thenotes accompanying the Demographics and Education table. Total Fisheries Production and Trade in Fish and Fisheries Products: While FISHSTAT provides the most extensive global time series of fishery statistics since1950, there are some problems associated with the data. Country-level data are oftensubmitted with a 1-2 year delay. Statistics from smaller artisanal and subsistencefisheries are particularly sparse. While these statistics provide a good overview ofregional fisheries trends, data should be used with caution and supplemented withestimates from regional organizations, academic literature, expert consultations, andtrade data. For more information, consult Fishery Statistics Reliability and Policy Implications, published by the FAO Fisheries Department and available on-line at http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/FIELD/006/Y3354M/Y3354M00.HTM.Number of Fishers data are gross estimates. Many countries do not submit data on fishers, or submit incomplete information; some countries have occasionallyomitted fish farmers from the total or included subsistence and sport fishers, aswell as family members living on fishing. Apart from the gaps and the heavypresence of estimates due to non-reporting, the information provided by nationalstatistical offices may not be strictly comparable due to the utilization of differentdefinitions and methods in the assessment of the number of people engaged infishing and aquaculture. FAO recognizes that these statistics are incomplete andmay not accurately reflect the current level of employment in the fishing sector. Fish Protein as a Percent of Total Protein Supply: Food supply is different from actual consumption. Figures do not account for discards (including bones) andlosses during storage and preparation. Supply data should only be used toassess food security if they are combined with an analysis of food availabilityand accessibility. Nonetheless, the data are subject to \"vigorous consistencychecks.\" According to FAO, the food supply statistics, \"while often far from satis-factory in the proper statistical sense, do provide an approximate picture of theoverall food situation in a country and can be useful for economic and nutritionalstudies, for preparing development plans and for formulating related projects.\"For more information see Food Balance Sheets: A Handbook, maintained on-line by FAO at http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X9892E/X9892E00.htm.

The WDPA contains summary information for over 100,000 sites,including the legal designation, name, IUCN Management Category, size inhectares, location (latitude and longitude), and year of establishment. WRI calcu-lated protected area data using the 2004 WDPA database. IUCN categorizes protected areas by management objective and has identi- fied six distinct categories of protected areas. WRI has calculated Total Area in thousand hectares and Percent of Land Protected for categories I-V. Category Ia. Strict nature reserve: a protected area managed mainly for scientific research and monitoring; an area of land and/or sea possessing someoutstanding or representative ecosystems, geological or physiological features,and/or species. Category Ib. Wilderness area: a protected area managed mainly for wilder- ness protection; a large area of unmodified or slightly modified land and/or searetaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significanthabitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition. Category II. National park: a protected area managed mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation; a natural area of land and/or sea designated to (a)protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for present and futuregenerations; (b) exclude exploitation or occupation inimical to the purposes ofdesignation of the area; or (c) provide a foundation for spiritual, scientific, educa-tional, recreational, and visitor opportunities, all of which must be environmentallyand culturally compatible. Category III. Natural monument: a protected area managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features; an area containing one or more specificnatural or natural/cultural features that is of outstanding or unique value becauseof its inherent rarity, representative or aesthetic qualities, or cultural significance. Category IV. Habitat/species management area: a protected area managed mainly for conservation through management intervention; an area of land and/orsea subject to active intervention for management purposes so as to ensure themaintenance of habitats and/or to meet the requirements of specific species. Category V. Protected landscape/seascape: a protected area managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation and recreation; an area of land, withcoast and sea as appropriate, where the interaction of people and nature over timehas produced an area of distinct character with significant aesthetic, ecological,and/or cultural value, and often with high biological diversity. Category VI. Managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural ecosystems. These areas contain predominantly unmodified natural systems, managed to ensurelong-term protection and maintenance of biological diversity, while also providing asustainable flow of natural products and services to meet community needs. IUCN defines a Marine Protected Area (MPA) as: \"any area of intertidal or subti- dal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora and fauna,historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effectivemeans to protect part or all of the enclosed environment.\" These MPAs include areas that are fully marine or littoral. \"Littoral\" is defined as any site which is known to incorporate at least some intertidal area. Many MPAs have large terrestrial areas. The extent of the marine portion of most protected areas is rarely documented. The degree of protection varies fromone country to another, and may bear little relationship to the legal status of anysite. The total number of marine areas in IUCN categories I-VI is shown in this table. Wetlands of International Importance, or Ramsar sites, are defined under the Wetlands Convention, signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971. In order to qualify as aRamsar site, an area must have \"international significance in terms of ecology,botany, zoology, limnology or hydrology.\" The Convention on Wetlands is an inter-governmental treaty that provides the framework for national action andinternational cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and theirresources. As of January 2005 there were 1420 Ramsar sites in 146 countries withan overall extent of 123,914,362 hectares. Biosphere Reserves are terrestrial and coastal environments recognized under United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO's) Manand the Biosphere Programme. Selected for their value to conservation, they areintended to foster the scientific knowledge and skills necessary for improving thebalance between people and nature, and for promoting sustainable development.Ideally, biosphere reserves perform three main roles: (a) conservation in situ ofnatural and semi-natural ecosystems and landscapes; (b) the establishment ofdemonstration areas for ecologically and socio-culturally sustainable resource use;and (c) the provision of logistic support for research, monitoring, education, train-ing, and information exchange. Biosphere reserves normally consist of threeelements: a minimally disturbed core area for conservation and research; a bufferzone where traditional land uses, research, and ecosystem rehabilitation may bepermitted; and a transition area. Biosphere reserves are nominated by nationalgovernments and remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the state where they arelocated. As of November 2004 there were 459 biosphere reserves in 97 countries. The Total Number of Known Species refers to the total number of a particular type of species in a given country. Data on known mammals exclude marine mammals. Data on known birds include only birds that breed in that country, not those that migrate or winter there. The number of known plants includes higher plants only: ferns and fern allies, conifers and cycads, and flowering plants. The number of known species is collected by WCMC from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, national reports from the Convention on Biodiversity,other national documents, independent studies, and other texts. Data are updatedon a continual basis as they become available; however, updates vary widely bycountry. While some countries (WCMC estimates about 12) have data that wereupdated in the last six months, other species estimates have not changed since thedata were first collected in 1992. The Number of Threatened Species listed for all countries includes all species that are \"critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable\" as defined by the IUCN,but excludes introduced species, species whose status is insufficiently known(categorized by IUCN as \"data deficient\"), those known to be extinct, and those forwhich status has not been assessed (categorized by IUCN as \"not evaluated\").Species are classified as vulnerable or endangered if they face a risk of extinction inthe wild in the immediate future (critically endangered), in the near-term (endan-gered), or in the medium-term (vulnerable). Threat categories are assigned basedon total population size, distribution, and rates of decline. Threatened birds include breeding bird species plus all species that are known to migrate or winter in a givencountry. Where possible, threatened mammals include marine mammals. Net Legal Trade in Selected Wildlife Products is the balance of imports minus exports of live primates, live parrots, and animal skins reported by the Conventionon International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).Negative values represent net exports. Live primates includes all species of monkeys, apes, and prosimians listed under CITES that were traded live in 2002. Live parrots includes individuals from the Psittaciformes species listed under CITES that were traded live in 2002. Animal skins includes whole skins of all crocodile, cat, lizard, and snake species that were traded in 2002. Data areobtained from trade records submitted by parties to the CITES convention andcompiled by the secretariat in the CITES Trade Database. 21410Biodiversity: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:07 PM Page 214215International trade in wildlife and wildlife products, worth billions of dollars annually, causes serious declines in the numbers of many species of animals andplants. In response, CITES entered into force in 1975 with the purpose of protectingwildlife against overexploitation and preventing international trade from threaten-ing species with extinction. Species are listed in appendices to CITES according totheir degree of rarity and the threat posed by trade. International trade in either thelisted species themselves or in products derived from the species requires permitsor certificates for export, import, and re-export. FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS Protected Areas data are updated annually by the WDPA. Wetlands of International Importance and Biosphere Reserves information is updated several times a year as new sites are added. Data for Known Species are updated when new information is provided to WCMC (see above). Threatened Species data are updated by IUCN on a continual basis. Species trade data are published inannual reports; the data presented here were published in 2004. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Protected Areas: Due to variations in consistency and methodology of collection, data on protected areas are highly variable among countries. Some countriesupdate their information with greater regularity or have more accurate data onextent of coverage. Many countries have an underreported number and/or extent ofprotected areas within their borders. Please see http://parksdata.conserveon- line.org for the latest revision. Biosphere Reserves and Wetlands of International Importance: Reserves can be conterminous or overlapping. Regional wetland totals may include some doublecounting of sites that are contained in more than one country. A full listing of these sites is available at http://www.unesco.org/mab/BR-WH.htm and athttp://www.unesco.org/mab/BR-Ramsar.htm. Number of Known Species: Values are preliminary estimates based on a compi- lation of available data from a large variety of sources. They are not based onspecies checklists. Data have been collected over the last decade without a consis-tent approach to taxonomy. This can result in significant variations in data qualityamong countries. Additionally, while the number of species in each country doeschange, not all countries have been updated; some data may not reflect recenttrends. At best, only about 2% of the total species of the world are represented inthe UNEP-WCMC Species Database. For this reason, it is important to recognize thatnumbers of known species in this table are vast underestimates of the actualspecies worldwide. Data for plant species are less reliable and consistent than datafor birds and mammals. Global estimates were not obtained from UNEP-WCMC; seebelow for citations. Number of Species Threatened: The total number of threatened species in species groups worldwide are frequently underestimated. For all species groups,there are many species that have yet to be described and whose status is yetunknown. In addition, while threat assessments have been conducted for alldescribed species of mammals and birds, only a small portion of described plantspecies have been assessed. Net Legal Trade in Selected Wildlife Products: Data on net exports and net imports as reported by CITES correspond to legal international trade and are basedon permits issued, not actual items traded. Figures may be overestimates if not allpermits are used that year. Some permits issued in one year are used at a later date;therefore, numbers of exports and imports may not match exactly for any given year. Species traded within national borders and illegal trade in wildlife and wildlifeproducts are not reflected in these figures. CITES trade data also do not reflect legaltrade between non-CITES members. In addition, data on mortality of individualsduring capture or collection, transit, or quarantine are also not reflected in thesenumbers.

Inland water bodies generally include major rivers and lakes.Data on land area were provided to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) bythe United Nations Statistical Division. Forested Area is calculated by WRI as a percentage of total land area using data from MODIS satellite imagery analyzed by the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) atthe University of Maryland and from FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 (FRA 2000). MODIS Satellite Imagery identifies the percent of tree crown cover for each 500- meter pixel image of land area based on one year of MODIS photography. Data wereaggregated to country-level by the GLCF at the request of WRI. The values presentedhere show the percentage of total land area with more than 10 percent or 50percent of the ground covered by tree crowns. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Estimates are drawn from FRA 2000. Forest area includes both natural forests, composed primarily of native tree species, and plantations, forest stands that are established artificially. If no otherland use (such as agro-forestry) predominates, any area larger than 0.5 hectareswith tree crowns covering more than 10 percent of the ground is classified as aforest. Forest statistics are based primarily on forest inventory information providedby national governments; national gathering methodologies can be found athttp://www.fao.org/forestry/fo/fra/index.jsp. FAO harmonized these nationalassessments with the 10-percent forest definition mentioned above. In tropicalregions, national inventories are supplemented with high resolution Landsat satel-lite data from a number of sample sites covering a total of 10 percent of thetropical forest zone. Where only limited or outdated inventory data were available,FAO used linear projections and expert opinion to fill in data gaps. If no foreststatistics existed for 1990 and 2000, FAO projected forward or backward in time toestimate forest area in the two reference years. Arable and Permanent Cropland is calculated by WRI as a percent of total land area. Arable land is land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are countedonly once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market andkitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). Abandonedland resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Permanentcropland is land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long periods andneed not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber; thiscategory includes land under trees grown for wood or timber. Wherever possible,data on agricultural land use are reported by country governments in question-naires distributed by FAO. However, a significant portion of the data is based onboth official and unofficial estimates. Permanent Pasture is calculated by WRI as a percent of total land area. Permanent pasture is land used long-term (five years or more) for herbaceousforage crops, either cultivated or growing wild. Shrublands and savannas may beclassified in some cases as both forested land and permanent pasture. Drylands is calculated by WRI as the percent of total land area that falls within three of the world's six aridity zones\u2014the arid, semi-arid, and dry to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) adoptedthis definition of drylands in order to identify areas where efforts combating landdegradation should be focused and methods for attaining sustainable developmentshould be promoted. The world is divided into six aridity zones based on the aridityindex\u2014the ratio of mean annual precipitation (PPT) to mean annual potentialevapotranspiration (PET). Drylands of concern to the UNCCD include those landswith an aridity index between .05 and .65 (excluding polar and sub-polar regions).Ratios of less than .05 indicate hyper-arid zones, or true deserts. Ratios of 0.65 or greater identify humid zones. The areas with an aridity index between .05 and .65encompass the arid, sub-humid areas. See the UNCCD's websiteat http://www.unccd.int/main.php for more information. Climatic data from 1950to 1981 were used to define aridity zone boundaries for the globe with a resolutionof about 50 km. Population Density is calculated by WRI as the number of persons per square kilometer of land area using FAO land-area data shown in the first column.Population data are from the United Nations Population Division. Urban Population as a Percent of Total is the proportion of a country's total population that resides in areas defined as urban in each of the countries of theworld. These definitions vary slightly from country to country. Many countries definean urban area by the total number of inhabitants in a population agglomeration.Typically the threshold for considering a region urban is between 1,000 and 10,000inhabitants. Other countries specify several of their cities or provinces as urban,and the remaining population is defined as rural. Estimates of the proportion of thepopulation living in urban areas are obtained from national sources. Censuses andpopulation registers are the most common sources of those counts. Once values ofthe urban proportion at the national level are established, they are applied toestimates and projections of the total national population from World Population Prospects: The 2002 Revision. Percent of Population Living in Cities with More Than 100,000 and 1 Million People indicates population distribution and levels of urbanization within a country. WRI calculated percentages from the Urban Population in World Bank Regions by City Size data set and total population figures from the UN Population Division. Urban population data were primarily collected from national statisticaloffices, international organizations such as the United Nations, and the WorldGazetteer web site. Data from national census bureaus in several OECD countries(Canada, United States) were added to complement this data set. Percent of Urban Population Living in Slum Conditions is the proportion of a country's urban population that is living in households classified as slumdwellings. A slum household is defined by the United Nations Human SettlementsProgram (UN-HABITAT) as a group of individuals living under the same roof thatlacks one or more of the following conditions: \"secure tenure status, adequateaccess to improved water, adequate access to improved sanitation and other infra-structure, structural quality of housing, and sufficient living area.\" While the same methodology was used to determine the slum population in all countries, data sources vary. Where available, household surveys, such asDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys(MICS), were the common sources of data. An effort was made to ensure thathouseholds were not counted twice, in the event that they lacked more than one ofthe indicators. In the absence of household surveys, or when household surveys didnot provide answers for the desired indicators, the slum populations wereestimated. Estimates were derived from a statistical model using available countrydata and the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP). 21811Land Use and 6:07 PM Page 218219FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS Total Land Area, Arable and Permanent Cropland Area, and Permanent Pasture data are updated annually by the FAO. Population data are updated every two years by the United Nations Population Division. Forested Land Area based on Modis Satellite Imagery was released by the GLCF in 2002. The FRA is published by the FAO every 5 years; data in this table are from the 2000 release. Drylands Area data were prepared in 1991; no update is planned. Data on urban population by city size are updated continually by the World Bank. Urban Population Living in Slum Conditions is the first global compilation of such data. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Land-area data are intended for broad estimations only and not for strict compar- isons. Land-area classification is inherently subjective; experts often expressdifferent opinions on the criteria for categorizing ecosystem and use types, and theresolution of the underlying satellite and survey information can vary widely amongdata sets. In addition, the information on land-area types shown here is from differ-ent sources and represents different time periods. They are not intended torepresent exclusive land-cover types; some degree of overlap is present. Forest Cover: As shown in the table, forest cover estimates differ widely based on collection methodology and classification used. FAO uses a more complex definitionof forests than is used in the MODIS data set, requiring that there be 10 percent treecover and that forestry be the predominant land use in the survey area. Thus someareas with tree cover of more than 10 percent may not be counted as forest if thepredominant land use is determined to be agriculture, urban settlement, or someother nonforestry use. Because the MODIS tree-cover data set makes no suchdistinction, the tree cover in the \"10 percent and above\" categories will sum to alarger area than the FAO forest area for most countries. MODIS Satellite Imagery: Following publication of the Global Land Cover Characteristics (GLCC) database by GLCF , a number of scientific teams assessedthe accuracy of the GLCC's approach by comparing the results with higher-resolu-tion satellite imagery. These teams found that the accuracy of the GLCF's approachwas, depending on the assessment approach, in a range from 60 to nearly 80percent, meaning that the assessment teams' classification of a given area agreedwith the GLCF's classification between 60 and 80 percent of the time. FAO Estimates: FAO acknowledges that the quality of primary data available remains poor, particularly for tropical countries, open woodland areas, and non-production forests. In most tropical countries, forests are not monitoredcomprehensively or frequently enough to map their extent accurately or to track theirrate of change. In the absence of inventory data for specific dates (1990 and 2000),FAO's latest estimates of forest area and change over time are often based onprojections and expert opinion and thus remain educated guesses. Just one or twosatellite images appear to have been the prime source of new information for somecountries with poor inventory data. Open woodlands are difficult to monitor byremote sensing techniques, and government forestry agencies tend not to surveythem as part of normal forest inventories. Non-production forests are not includedin these totals, even though many appear to meet the FAO definition of forests.While the quality of data from developed countries is generally better than fromdeveloping countries, problems still arise with estimates because of differences innational forestry definitions and systems of measurement, and the use of differentreference periods. In northern countries, the boundary between forest and tundra isvague. For a discussion of some data reliability issues associated with FRA 2000, see http://pdf.wri.org/fra2000.pdf.Drylands: The accuracy of land-area totals is limited by the 50-kilometer resolu- tion of the data set. The climate data set was derived from a limited number of fieldobservations. Actual boundaries between aridity zones are neither abrupt nor static,making delineated borders somewhat artificial. The data should therefore beconsidered useful as a general indicator of the extent of drylands within eachcountry, rather than as an exact depiction of the climatic situation on the ground.Alternative methods for measuring extent of drylands area include use of soilmoisture and agricultural production systems, although these methods may also besubject to similar problems such as low-resolution data, limited field observations,and subjectivity when delineating exact boundaries on the ground. Percent of Urban Population Living in Slum Conditions: UN-HABITAT's defini- tion of slum conditions, described above, may not always measure living conditionswith sufficient precision. Sub-national coverage for the household surveys varies asdoes the international coverage for the different indicators. Despite thesedrawbacks, this is the most reliable global data set available on this complex issue.

Arable land is land under temporary crops (those that are sown andharvested in the same agricultural year), temporary meadows for mowing orpasture, land under market and kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow (lessthan five years). Abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not includedunder this category. Permanent cropland is land cultivated with crops that occupythe land for long periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, includingland under trees grown for wood or timber. Land in permanent pasture is notincluded here. Irrigated Cropland as a Percent of Total refers to the proportion of agricultural land equipped to provide water to crops. These include areas equipped for full andpartial control irrigation, spate irrigation areas, and equipped wetland or inlandvalley bottoms. Organic Cropland as a Percent of Total shows the portion of agricultural land converted to certified organic agriculture or in the process of conversion. Definitionsof organic agriculture vary among countries. According to the International Federationof Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), \"Organic agriculture is an agriculturalproduction system that promotes environmentally, socially, and economically soundproduction of food and fibers, and excludes the use of synthetically compoundedfertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators, livestock feed and additives, and geneticallymodified organisms.\" Data are obtained directly from IFOAM. The data shown hereinclude pastures used for grazing. Data on land under organic management are aresult of surveys undertaken between October and December of 2003 and researchconducted by IFOAM. Experts from member organizations, certification bodies, andother institutions were asked to contribute statistics. Intensity of Agricultural Inputs: Labor shows the labor input intensity of agricul- tural systems per hectare of agricultural land. WRI calculates labor intensity bydividing the number of agricultural workers by agricultural land area. Agriculturalworkers include all economically active persons engaged in agriculture, hunting,forestry, or fishing. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), theeconomically active population \"comprises all persons of either sex who furnish thesupply of labor for the production of economic goods and services.\" The ILO derivesthe labor estimates from population censuses and sample surveys of the economi-cally active population. When country data are missing, the ILO estimates figuresfrom similar neighboring countries or by using special models of activity rates. TheUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provided the annual figures used forthese calculations through interpolating and extrapolating the ILO's decennial series. Intensity of Agricultural Inputs: Fertilizer measures the mass in kilograms of the nutrients nitrogen (N), potash (K2O), and phosphate (P2O5) consumed annually per hectare of cropland. Some countries report data based on the fertilizer year; i.e.,2001 data actually encompassed July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002. Data are collectedthrough the FAO fertilizer questionnaire, with support from the Ad Hoc Working Partyon Fertilizer Statistics. Intensity of Agricultural Inputs: Mechanization shows the number of tractors used in agriculture per thousand hectares of arable and permanent cropland. WRIcalculates the intensity of tractor use with FAO's estimates on agricultural landarea and the total number of tractors for each country. Tractors generally refer tototal wheeled and crawler tractors, excluding garden tractors. Tractor intensity isuseful for understanding the nature of production systems, as tractors tend to beused in areas with flatter lands and scarce labor. Information on agriculturalmachinery is reported to FAO by country governments through surveys. Intensity of Agricultural Inputs: Water Withdrawals measures the volume of water used in the agricultural sector per square hectare of arable and permanentcropland. Water use for agriculture is defined as the water withdrawals that areattributed to the agricultural sector, used primarily for irrigation. WRI calculateswater intensity using water-use data from FAO's AQUASTAT information system andagricultural land-use data from the FAOSTAT database. To estimate agriculturalwater use, an assessment has to be made both of irrigation water requirementsand of water withdrawal for agriculture. AQUASTAT collects its information from anumber of sources, including national water resources and irrigation master plans;national yearbooks, statistics and reports; reports from FAO; international surveys;and results from surveys made by national or international research centers. The Per Capita Food Production Index shows the food output, excluding animal feed, of a country's agriculture sector relative to the base period 1999-2001. Theper capita food production index covers all edible agricultural products that containnutrients; coffee and tea are excluded. For a given year and country, the index iscalculated by taking the disposable average output of all food commodities interms of weight or volume during the period of interest and dividing that year'soutput by the average of the 1999-2001 output, and then multiplying by 100. Inother words, the index values shown in this table indicate per capita food produc-tion levels larger than 1999-2001 levels if their values are larger than 100. Datashown here are for 1983 and 2003. Cereals Received as Food Aid represents the total shipments of cereals trans- ferred to recipient countries on a total-grant basis or on highly concessional terms.Cereals include wheat, barley, maize, rye, oats, millet, sorghum, rice, buckwheat,alpiste/canary seed, fonio, quinoa, triticale, wheat flour, and the cereal componentof blended foods. To facilitate comparisons between deliveries of differentcommodities, processed and blended cereals are converted into their grain equiv-alent with specific conversion factors. Information on food aid shipments isprovided to the FAO by the World Food Program (WFP). Net Cereal Imports as a Percent of Consumption indicates whether countries are able to produce sufficient grain for domestic consumption. It is calculated bydividing the sum of net imports (imports minus exports) by total cereal consumption(production plus imports, minus exports). Cereals imported as food aid are includedin net imports. This variable does not account for changes in cereal stocks. As aresult, some numbers may be negative or greater than 100. Cereals include wheat,barley, maize, rye, oats, millet, sorghum, rice, buckwheat, alpiste/canary seed, fonio,quinoa, triticale, wheat flour, and the cereal component of blended foods. Import andexport data have, for the most part, been supplied to FAO by governments, nationalpublications and, most frequently, FAO questionnaires. Cereal Fed to Livestock as a Percent of Total Consumption is calculated by dividing the total feed grain consumed by total domestic grain consumed. Grainsinclude wheat, rice, corn, barely, sorghum, millet, rye, oats, and mixed grains. Grainconsumption includes all domestic use during the local marketing year of theindividual country. It is the sum of feed, food, seed, and industrial uses. Data arecollected from a variety of sources. Whereas the FAO is required to use officialcountry estimates, the USDA supplements official estimates with data collectedfrom other sources. The international portion of the USDA data is updated withinput from agricultural attach\u00e9s stationed at U.S. embassies around the world, U.S.Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) commodity analysts, and country and commodityanalysts with the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS). WRI calculates thepercentage shown here from USDA grain consumption and feed estimates. 22212Food and Agriculture: Technical Notesjp8589 WRI.qxd 8/5/05 6:07 PM Page 222223Calorie Supply Per Capita refers to the amount of available food per person per day, expressed in kilocalories. Share of Calorie Supply from Animal Products refers to the percent of available food that is derived from animal products, includingall types of meat and fish; animal fats and fish oils; edible offal; milk, butter, cheese,and cream; and eggs and egg products. FAO compiles statistics on apparent foodconsumption based on Supply/Utilization Accounts (SUAs) maintained in FAOSTAT, itsonline statistical service. SUAs are time-series data using statistics on supply andutilization. For each food product, the SUA traces supplies from production, imports,and stocks to utilization in different forms\u2014addition to stocks, exports, animal feed,seed, processing for food and non-food purposes, waste (or losses), and lastly, as foodavailable to the population. For internal consistency, total food supply equals totalutilization. FAO derives caloric values by applying the appropriate food compositionfactors to the quantities of the processed commodities, rather than examining primarycommodities. Per capita supplies are derived from the total supplies available forhuman consumption by dividing the quantities of food by the total population actuallypartaking of the food supplies during the reference period. FREQUENCY OF UPDATE BY DATA PROVIDERS Data from FAO are updated annually, with the exception of production data, whichare updated three times each year, and trade data, which are updated semiannu-ally. Data on international organic agriculture was first published by IFOAM in 1998and are updated annually. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service updates interna-tional grain production estimates every month. DATA RELIABILITY AND CAUTIONARY NOTES Agricultural Land and Irrigated Cropland: Data are compiled from various sources (national publications, FAO questionnaires, international publications,etc.). As a result, definitions and coverage do not always conform to FAO recommen-dations and may not always be completely consistent across countries. Organic Cropland as a Percent of Total: Data for organic agriculture are collected by IFOAM from a variety of sources, including member organizations, certi-fication bodies, and other institutions. Data collection methods vary depending onthe institution and the country. Figures for percent of total agricultural land underorganic management are calculated by IFOAM. Data on total agricultural land usedin these calculations are different from those provided by FAO for total arable andpermanent cropland. Labor: Values vary widely among and within countries according to labor scarcity, production technologies, and costs of energy and machinery. The annual figures fortotal number of agricultural workers were obtained by interpolating and extrapolat-ing past trends (1950-2000) taken from ILO decennial population series. As aresult, fluctuations in the labor force may not be captured in annual figures. Laborintensity may be overestimated in countries with substantial fishing or forestryindustries, since the total agricultural labor force includes some workers engagedin these activities. Fertilizer: Data are excluded for some countries with a relatively small area of cropland, such as Iceland and Singapore. In these cases, the calculation of fertil-izer consumed per hectare of cropland yields an unreliable number. Mechanization: Data collection methods differ across countries, resulting in varying degrees of reliability. Some caution should be used in interpreting tractors-in-use figures because the data do not account for variations in the size andhorsepower of different tractors.Water Withdrawals : While AQUASTAT represents the most complete and careful compilation of water resources statistics to date, freshwater data are generally ofpoor quality. Sources of information vary but are rarely complete. Access to informa-tion on water resources is still sometimes restricted for reasons related to politicalsensitivity at the regional level. The accuracy and reliability of the information varygreatly among regions and countries. Data are typically collected in different yearsfor different countries and interpolated or extrapolated to a single year. Per Capita Food Production Index: Indices are not directly measured; they are derived from a set of formulas and algorithms. The calculation therefore containsan unavoidable amount of subjectivity. Reliability is limited by the accuracy andprecision of agricultural production and price data. While these data can illustraterough comparisons and trends over time, rigid score comparisons and rankings arediscouraged. The country-level indices reported here may differ from other calcula-tions of agricultural production due to varying concepts of production, coverage,weights, time reference of data, and methods of calculation. Cereals Received as Food Aid: Data on shipments and receipts of food aid are governed by established accounting procedures and are generally considered to bereliable. These measurements represent the amount of cereals distributed to recip-ient countries; they are not a measure of consumption. Cereal Fed to Livestock as a Percent of Total Consumption: As with any large and complex data set, there are numerous difficulties involved with maintainingaccuracy and standardizing reporting standards across countries and commodities.In general, these data should be considered accurate, but users should exercise theusual caution in attempting to create reliable cross-country comparisons. Calorie Supply: Figures shown here represent only the average calorie supply available for the population as a whole and do not necessarily indicate what isactually consumed by individuals. Even if data are used as approximations of percapita consumption, it is important to note that there is considerable variation inconsumption among individuals. Food supply data are only as accurate as theunderlying production, trade, and utilization data.
