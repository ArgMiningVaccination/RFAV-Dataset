What remedies should we take? Common ailments that arise while traveling and camping respond well to homeopathic treatment. When my family and I travel, I like to bring a limited selection of remedies that can take care of the most problems that could arise. Firstly, I bring remedies that would be useful as a mini first-aid kit: minor accidents, cuts or bruises. In addition, I want to be prepared for a fever, cold or food poisoning. The following list contains some of the remedies that I carry with me. Choose the ones that pertain to you and your family's need the next time you travel. Read the Materia Medica below the list for more information on each remedy.

This person is nervous, agitated and can't sit still. This remedy can really be used during an S.O.S.! Aconite is useful for the early stages of an intense fever that comes on suddenly. Often the child or adults goes out on a windy day and, a short time later, comes down with a fever. Aconite will typically be effective for a fever that's accompanied by anxiety, restlessness and a thirst for cold drinks. [Apis](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is well known for the effects of a bee's sting. There is burning, stinging, along with excessive swelling, puffiness and redness. The person feels better in open air, uncovering, and with cold application or ice. For emergencies, see immediate medical attention.

Arnica is useful for: bruises, swelling, muscle soreness, sprains and strains, falls and blows, overexertion from lifting, sports, or work. In addition, Arnica is useful for post-operative swelling, dental procedures and after childbirth. I keep this in my purse with me everyday!

There can be abdominal cramps along with chills. The mood is anxious, restless and the person doesn't want to be left alone.

Asks for something, then refuses it. [Ledum](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is well-known as an acute remedy in bites, stings and wounds. Ledum is also known use in puncture wounds (for example after stepping on a nail). The person feels better from ice cold applications or bathing.
