As JA warns, the game is very much based on the existence of chi - which is an alleged life-force energy that is part of the eastern world view and pantheistic belief systems. The LEGO story presents it as a kind of condensation of nature's raw energy which flows through the waters of Mount Cavora and is the source of the land's life. It is carried by the Cavora River to the Sacred Pool of Chi which is contained in the territory of the lions, one of at least 12 tribes of warring anamorphic creatures that are part of the Chima story. These include lions, bears, foxes, beavers, gorillas, skunks, ravens, wolves, crocodiles, peacocks and rhinos. \"The story centers on a community of animals at war, so expect a fair amount of conflict and peril, but the fact that the characters are animated LEGOs greatly lessens the impact of this content,\" writes a reviewer for [CommonSenseMedia.org,](http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/legends-of-chima) about the cartoon series. \"Issues like prejudice, emotional manipulation, and traitorism are explored on an age-appropriate level, and the messages that emerge laud honesty, forgiveness, and selflessness.\" My only concern is that children may not be able to distinguish between the fictitious chi in this toy and the \"chi\" which is prevalent in so many New Age healing modalities. These practices range from acupuncture, Reiki and Therapeutic Touch to producing jewelry and other objects such as [Power Balance Bands](http://www.womenofgrace.com/blog/?p=1252) and [holographic chips](http://www.womenofgrace.com/blog/?p=106) that purportedly manipulate chi in one way or another. {You might want to read [this blog ](http://www.womenofgrace.com/blog/?p=4)which explains that the existence of chi is not scientifically supported.) However, a good explanation can spare your child from wasting their hard-earned dollars on this nonsense later on in life and allow them to enjoy a very creative story that can teach them many valuable life lessons.
