(415) 353-9339 1569 Sloat Blvd., Suite 33323Before you leave the hospital your provider will tell you when to schedule a postpartum visit in the office. Usually this will be in about six weeks. You should, however, call your provider anytime you have any concerns. Vaginal bleeding It is normal to have some bleeding or discharge for six weeks or more after giving birth. At first, the bleeding is bright red and heavier than a period. Within two weeks, the flow should lighten so you need only a mini pad. The color may be pink, brown, or red. The bleeding may stop for a few days and then start again. This is normal and may depend on how active you were during the day. Stitches After giving birth, women may have some tears, swelling around the vagina, and/or hemorrhoids. Ice packs will help with swelling and discomfort during the first day. By the second day, switch from ice to \"sitz baths,\" soaking in warm water in the tub or in a basin that fits in the toilet. Continuing these soaks once or twice a day for about 10 days will be comforting, may prevent infection, and may speed up the healing process. Your nurse will show you how to use a sitz bath. If your tears require stitches, the stitches will dissolve and do not need to be removed. Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are generally aggravated by pregnancy and also during pushing in labor. They will start to improve after childbirth. In addition to taking sitz baths, avoid constipation by drinking lots of water and eating lots of fiber (such as bran cereal) every day. Taking a stool softener, which is available over the counter, also may help. Cold helps to shrink them, so cold packs just to the hemorrhoids (avoid your stitches area) can help. Pain and discomfort It is normal to have pain and discomfort after giving birth. Most often women have cramping that may be similar or worse than menstrual cramps. The cramps may occur before or during breastfeeding as your body releases hormones. There also may be pain/soreness in your vagina and perineum (bottom). This will get better over time and using comfort measures such as ice, warm water and rest will help. You can take ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol) or other pain medications as prescribed by your provider. Bladder function Due to muscle stretching, nerve damage, and hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy and childbirth, some women may have trouble holding their urine. This means having trouble holding urine long enough to make it to the bathroom when the urge strikes (urge incontinence) or losing urine when they cough, sneeze, or run (stress incontinence).Postpartum Care and Recovery: The First Six Weeks4Urinary incontinence may improve on its own postpartum; however many women may need individualized treatment from a pelvic physical therapist to resolve the issue. If you still have incontinence when you see your Provider for your 6 week follow-up then that is a good time to ask for a referral to see a pelvic physical therapist. The good news is that both stress and urge incontinence respond well to pelvic floor muscle strengthening. Diet Continue to eat well-balanced meals as you have during pregnancy. You may continue your prenatal vitamins as desired. Follow your body's signals to drink plenty of water. Plenty of water helps you feel better after blood loss, and helps minimize constipation. Sleep Not getting enough sleep is a problem for all new parents. While there is no way to get as much sleep as you need, make sure that you get as much as you can. Pain, frustration and depression are all increased by lack of sleep. Whenever possible have another adult at home with you during the first few weeks to help take care of your baby and help you get some extra rest. Sexual activity Bleeding, healing stitches, fatigue, hormonal changes and the demands of breastfeeding all can affect a woman's comfort and interest in sexual activity. Only you can decide when you are ready. Emotional support and affection are always important. We recommend that you wait to begin sexual activity until after seeing your provider. The vagina may be dryer after giving birth, particularly for breastfeeding women. Using a lubricant may make sex play or intercourse more comfortable. If you need more vaginal lubrication we recommend using a water or silicon-based lubricant. Oils or Vaseline as a lubricant can cause a vaginal infection as well as damage condoms. Although breastfeeding can reduce the chances of getting pregnant in the first few months, it does not completely protect against pregnancy. Using contraception for intercourse immediately after giving birth is recommended if you do not want to get pregnant again right away. Condoms are always an option. Read Birth Control Methods, page 14 in this packet and talk with your provider about other options. Choose what works best for you and your family. Activity and exercise After nine months of being pregnant, many women are eager to \"get their bodies back.\" However, just as it took those many months to prepare to give birth, it takes time to feel and look like \"you\" again. There are certain changes that need to occur and cannot be sped along. It takes time for the uterus to shrink, for your body to lose the extra fluid and hormone levels to return to normal. The activities of daily living that you do to care for yourself and your baby around home are enough activity in the first few weeks. Any \"spare\" time should be spent sleeping and off your feet. This will allow stitches to heal, bleeding to slow down and your body to recover. Kegel exercises can be started anytime. Instructions on how to do Kegals can be found on page 12. After four to six weeks, you may begin gradually to add other exercise into your routine. Special instructions after cesarean birth Giving birth by cesarean means you have had major abdominal surgery and may require a longer recovery time. Allow yourself time to heal during the first six weeks. It is easy to get frustrated; make sure to ask for help when you need it.5It is normal to feel pain or numbness around the incision site and this will diminish over time. Try not to strain the incision by lifting anything heavier than your baby. Being up and about is important as it promotes healing, but your activity should be limited in the first few weeks. Slowly start to increase your activity levels based on how you are feeling. It may be unsafe to drive a car for two to three weeks if you are taking narcotics for pain, as they may make you drowsy. You can shower and bathe but keep your incision dry at other times. The adhesive strips (steri-strips) that are across the incision will gradually start to fall off within the first week. After 10 days, you should gently remove all remaining strips. When to call your provider: Increase in bleeding: Soaking > 1 maxi pad/hour; passing > walnut size clots Foul smelling discharge Fever over 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C) New or worsening pain including a headache, that is not helped by pain medicine Problems with urinating or emptying your bladder Signs of infection of the C-section incision such as redness, opening of incision, drainage and/or foul odor.

Even though pregnancy and birth are often joyful occasions, they are also times of increased stress that put women at higher risk for depression. Depression is common Depression affects 10-20% of all women in pregnancy and postpartum. It can begin before the baby is born or develop months after the baby arrives. Any woman can develop depression during pregnancy or postpartum. The blues: a normal part of adjusting to pregnancy and parenting Having the blues is a normal part of adjusting to pregnancy and motherhood. It is common for most pregnant women and new mothers to have emotional ups and downs and to feel overwhelmed. After childbirth, a majority of women will develop postpartum blues within the first few days to two weeks. Many women find that talking to family and friends (including other new mothers), taking time to care for themselves, and getting more rest and assistance with childcare duties will help them feel better. Depression: more than just the blues Depression is more serious than only the blues. Besides being very difficult for you and your family, depression can interfere with your baby's intellectual and emotional development. Women who are depressed suffer from a variety of the symptoms listed below every day for two weeks or more: Depression is treatable Untreated depression can last for months or years, but there are many good treatment options available. They include individual therapy, group therapy, education, and medication. Many antidepressant medications can be taken during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. If you feel you may be suffering from depression or if you just want to talk about what resources are available, call and make an appointment with our counselor who can help you evaluate your situation.

These muscles surround the urethra, vagina, and rectum, and contract and relax under your command. They are important for normal bowel, bladder and sexual function, and provide support to our back and pelvis along with our other core muscles. When they are weak and/or tight, they can cause various symptoms including urinary incontinence, vaginal prolapse and pelvic pain. Who should perform pelvic floor muscle exercises, aka Kegel exercises? Research has shown pelvic floor muscle exercises can be beneficial for people with stress urinary incontinence, urge incontinence and vaginal prolapse. These exercises can be started right away after birth (either vaginal or C-section birth); however If you have any worsening of pelvic pain or urinary incontinence or prolapse, you should stop the pelvic floor muscle exercises and pursue treatment with a pelvic physical therapist. You may be doing the exercise incorrectly and need some guidance on correct form. How to perform pelvic floor muscle exercises, aka Kegel exercises Begin by locating the correct muscles. It can be challenging to locate these muscles in the start but keep trying. 1) Squeeze and lift the area of your vagina and rectum (your pelvic floor region) as if you are trying to stop the flow of urine or stop the pass of gas. 2) Also, you can insert a finger in your vagina to test if you are doing the contraction correctly. You want to feel the muscles squeezing and lifting upward. Once you have found the muscles, you can start exercising. Here are a few guidelines: 1) Avoid tightening the abdominal, buttock and thigh muscles while doing this. These are compensatory muscles and it is best to try to isolate the pelvic floor muscles only. 2) Do not hold your breath. It is best to perform the exercise coordinated with your breathing. Keep your pelvic muscles relaxed on the inhale, and then squeeze and lift the pelvic muscles on the exhale. 3) The recommended number of repetitions per day can be variable depending on a person's baseline of strength, but a general recommendation is 10 to 15 repetitions performed three times a day. 4) It can be helpful to work on both the fast & slow twitch muscle fibers of the pelvic floor by doing some short-hold contractions and some long-hold contractions. Eg. Short holds: 2 sec squeeze/2 sec rest, Long holds: 5 sec squeeze/5 sec rest. You can slowly work on building up your endurance to 10 sec for the long holds. 5) Completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after each repetition. Do not push out/bear down when relaxing the pelvic muscles. 6) Do not do the exercises while urinating, this confuses the bladder. 7) It can take 4-6 weeks to notice a difference in the frequency of leaking. Pelvic Floor Exercises13When to perform Kegel exercises? You can do these exercises at any time during the day: watching television, doing dishes, sitting in school, at your desk, or lying in bed. Typically lying down can be the easiest place to contract the muscles when you first begin to do them. Other tips: 1) Avoiding bladder irritants such as caffeine, alcohol and artificial sweeteners can help reduce symptoms of urinary urgency and frequency 2) Timed voiding i.e. going to the bathroom at specific time intervals about every 2 hours can help you with symptoms of urinary incontinence and urinary urgency 3) Drink adequate amounts of water in the day When to go see a specialist? If you continue to have symptoms of incontinence or vaginal heaviness, or you are experiencing pelvic pain at your 6 week postpartum visit then ask your provider if seeing a pelvic physical therapist is right for you. Benefits of performing Kegel exercises include: Improved healing of the perineum after childbirth Reduce urinary stress incontinence (when urine leaks during coughing, sneezing, or laughing) Possible prevention of a sagging uterus or other pelvic organs Greater pleasure in sexual intercourse Less discomfort from pelvic exams Increased awareness of circulation in genital area MethodRange of EffectivenessHow it Works Advantages Disadvantages Side Effects LAM: Lactational AmenorrheaTypical Use: Unknown egg-containing sac.No cost, Non-Hormonal, Encourages Exclusive BreastfeedingDependent on 100% feeding at the breast round-the-clock.

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de www.immunize.org/vis 1 Why get vaccinated? Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis are very serious diseases. Tdap vaccine can protect us from these diseases. And, Tdap vaccine given to pregnant women can protect newborn babies against pertussis.. TETANUS (Lockjaw) is rare in the United States today. It causes painful muscle tightening and stiffness, usually all over the body. It can lead to tightening of muscles in the head and neck so you can't open your mouth, swallow, or sometimes even breathe. Tetanus kills about 1 out of 10 people who are infected even after receiving the best medical care. DIPHTHERIA is also rare in the United States today. It can cause a thick coating to form in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, heart failure, paralysis, and death. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes severe coughing spells, which can cause difficulty breathing, vomiting and disturbed sleep. It can also lead to weight loss, incontinence, and rib fractures. Up to 2 in 100 adolescents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, which could include pneumonia or death. These diseases are caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person through secretions from coughing or sneezing. Tetanus enters the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds. Before vaccines, as many as 200,000 cases of diphtheria, 200,000 cases of pertussis, and hundreds of cases of tetanus, were reported in the United States each year. Since vaccination began, reports of cases for tetanus and diphtheria have dropped by about 99% and for pertussis by about 80%. 2 Tdap vaccine Tdap vaccine can protect adolescents and adults from tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. One dose of Tdap is routinely given at age 11 or 12. People who did not get Tdap at that age should get it as soon as possible. Tdap is especially important for healthcare professionals and anyone having close contact with a baby younger than 12 months. Pregnant women should get a dose of Tdap during every pregnancy, to protect the newborn from pertussis. Infants are most at risk for severe, life-threatening complications from pertussis. Another vaccine, called Td, protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. A Td booster should be given every 10 years. Tdap may be given as one of these boosters if you have never gotten Tdap before. Tdap may also be given after a severe cut or burn to prevent tetanus infection. Your doctor or the person giving you the vaccine can give you more information. Tdap may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some people should not get this vaccine A person who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a previous dose of any diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis containing vaccine, OR has a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, should not get Tdap vaccine. Tell the person giving the vaccine about any severe allergies. Anyone who had coma or long repeated seizures within 7 days after a childhood dose of DTP or DTaP, or a previous dose of Tdap, should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found. They can still get Td. Talk to your doctor if you: - have seizures or another nervous system problem, - had severe pain or swelling after any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis, - ever had a condition called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), - aren't feeling well on the day the shot is scheduled. Td and Tdap Vaccine Information 18 4 Risks With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious reactions are also possible but are rare. Most people who get Tdap vaccine do not have any problems with it. Mild problems following Tdap (Did not interfere with activities) Pain where the shot was given (about 3 in 4 adolescents or 2 in 3 adults) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 person in 5) Mild fever of at least 100.4\u00b0F (up to about 1 in 25 adolescents or 1 in 100 adults) Headache (about 3 or 4 people in 10) Tiredness (about 1 person in 3 or 4) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 in 4 adolescents or 1 in 10 adults) Chills, sore joints (about 1 person in 10) Body aches (about 1 person in 3 or 4) Rash, swollen glands (uncommon) Moderate problems following Tdap (Interfered with activities, but did not require medical attention) Pain where the shot was given (up to 1 in 5 or 6) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 in 16 adolescents or 1 in 12 adults) Fever over 102\u00b0F (about 1 in 100 adolescents or 1 in 250 adults) Headache (about 1 in 7 adolescents or 1 in 10 adults) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 or 3 people in 100) Swelling of the entire arm where the shot was given (up to about 1 in 500). Severe problems following Tdap (Unable to perform usual activities; required medical attention) Swelling, severe pain, bleeding and redness in the arm where the shot was given (rare). Problems that could happen after any vaccine: People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. Some people get severe pain in the shoulder and have difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given. This happens very rarely. Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at fewer than 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more information, visit: www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ 5 What if there is a serious problem? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or unusual behavior. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would usually start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not give medical advice. 6 The National V accine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. There is a time limit to file a claim for compensation. 7 How can I learn more? Ask your doctor. He or she can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. Call your local or state health department.

UCSF supports breastfeeding due to the many health benefits for both mother and baby. All of our nurses are trained to help you with breastfeeding while you are in the hospital, and we have lactation consultants to see you if you are having any problems. Because of the many health advantages for you and your baby, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you exclusively breastfeed (only breastmilk) for the first six months. They recommend that you continue breastfeeding as solid foods are introduced, for a total of at least one year or as long after that as you and your baby want. Getting Started with frequent Breastfeeding: Move Milk! The most important recommendation for successful breastfeeding is to \"move milk.\" What this means is that frequent feeds in the early days of breastfeeding create an excellent milk supply. This is the foundation for successful feeding. Here are some details of \"moving milk\": The early milk is called colostrum. It is a small volume, so your baby can practice sucking, swallowing and breathing with small amounts. The early milk is also called \"liquid gold\" because each drop has so many protective properties for your baby's immune system. While some babies are sleepy the first 24 hours and nurse less frequently, most babies are waking up and nursing 8-12 times in 24 hours by day 2. These frequent feeds will bring in the milk sooner, and make a bigger milk supply. Expressing milk or pumping 8 or more times in 24 hours will create a good milk supply if your baby is not latching at the breast. Breast pumping and hand expression are important to do if your baby does not or cannot latch at the breast. Cue-Based or Infant-led feeding Healthy term babies know just how much to eat and how often to eat. That is why we say \"watch the baby, not the clock.\" This means that you should feed your baby when your baby gives signals or cues that they are ready to eat. Sometimes babies sleep through a meal and then eat several meals in a row to catch up. This is normal and healthy, and it is called cluster feeding. Early cues to feed: opening eyes to look for the breast, opening their mouth, sucking on their hands. Babies feed best when fed while exhibiting early cues. Later cues to feed: fussing and crying. It is best to calm the baby down before feeding if crying. Babies who are fed by their cues usually eat more often, bring in the milk sooner, lose less weight, and create a better milk supply.Your Guide to Breastfeeding Your Newborn Baby20Rooming-in care UCSF values and supports you in having your baby with you day and night so we can help you care for your baby around-the-clock. Some reasons for having your baby with you in the same room include: We can help show you positions to feed your baby at night that are comfortable and safe. We can help you learn your baby's feeding cues. This will lead to more frequent feeds and a good milk supply. Night feeds are good for your baby's health. Frequent waking is one of the reasons breastfed babies have up to 50% less Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Your baby will cry less when close to you. We are here to help you and your support person work as a team to care for your baby when you are tired. Avoiding bottles and pacifiers at first if your baby is breastfeeding UCSF supports you in being successful in learning to feed your baby at the breast. Ideally, your baby will do most of the work sucking at the breast, and create an excellent milk supply. If your baby needs to have supplemental milk for a medical reason, alternative feeding methods can be explored with your nurse or lactation consultant. Avoiding bottles and pacifiers is advised until breastfeeding is well- established because: Your baby may learn to suck in a different way with a bottle or a pacifier, which might make breastfeeding more difficult When using a pacifier, you might miss some important feeds as you might not notice subtle infant feeding cues. The ways we can supplement a baby without using a bottle include using a feeding syringe, spoon and cup feeding, and tube feeding at the breast. Note: Except for pain relief, for example during a circumcision, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no pacifiers for breastfeeding babies until breastfeeding is well-established (around 3-4 weeks). Comfortable Mom, Comfortable Baby, Baby's Mouth Near the Nipple How to get a wide, comfortable latch: Hold your baby close to your body, with their tummy facing yours. Your baby's nose should be across from your nipple. Gently tickle their upper lip up and down with your nipple until their mouth opens wide like a yawn or touch your nipple near to your baby's nose until they open wide. Pull your baby in quickly, chin leading, so they take in as much breast as possible, resulting in a deep latch. Relatch your baby if there is a shallow latch (only the nipple or a small amount of breast is in their mouth). Note: Baby's chin is in close, baby's mouth is open very wide! 21Your baby is able to breastfeed in many positions. All positions have these things in common: Your baby's mouth is open very wide as your baby latches. Your baby's chin is in close to the breast. Mother and baby are comfortable. Here are some of the positions you might find comfortable, feel free to try one or all of them: Cross-Cradle Hold Cradle Hold Laid-Back Nursing Football Hold Upright Hold Side-Lying Position Double-Football with twins Over-the-shoulder hold for during or after a Cesarean Delivery 22Signs that your baby is getting enough milk in the hospital: Your baby's weight is within the normal range for a newborn. Please note: we expect all babies to lose a small percentage of their birthweight. We will let you know if the weight loss is of concern. Your baby passes urine at least once during the day the first day, and twice on the second day and three times on the third day. Your baby is passing meconium stools. Signs that your baby is getting enough milk at home: Your baby breastfeeds about 8 to 12 times in 24 hours, including at least 1-2 night feeds You can hear your baby suck and swallow. Your baby has more clear or pale-yellow wet diapers by day 4. Your baby may have as many as 4 or more loose yellow stools daily by day 5. Your baby appears calm and full after feedings. Your breasts feel fuller prior to each feed than after the feed, when they feel softer. Note: we will be watching your baby's weight closely, and let you know if supplementation is needed both in the hospital and after discharge. Hand Expression of Milk: Hand Expression of milk is a wonderful skill taught to all of our breastfeeding mothers. It can be used to help stimulate a larger milk supply and to provide extra early milk for your baby. It can also be used to soften your breasts once the later milk comes in if your breasts are too full. Always wash your hands before hand expression of your milk. Your nurse can give you a feeding syringe or a spoon to collect your early milk, and you can feed this to your baby. Women who are exclusively using an electric pump to pump their milk, can make and collect more milk if after most of their pumping sessions are finished, they hand-express their milk. Ask your nurse if you have any questions. How to hand-express: 1. Wash your hands. 2. Massage your breasts. This will stimulate more milk. 3. Place your hands in a wide \"C\" on the breasts, with your fingers together below and your thumb above. (You can use one or two hands) 4. PRESS back towards your chest. Avoid stretching your skin. 5. COMPRESS or squeeze your breast bringing the fingers and thumb towards each other and towards the nipple at the same time. Avoid sliding your fingers around. 23 6. RELAX your thumb and fingers, and start the process again. Move your hand around your breast to drain all areas. 7. Collect any expressed colostrum or breastmilk drops with a spoon, cup, or feeding syringe and give to baby. Use your breastfeeding resources while in the hospital, like help from your nurses, but you can also watch how to do hand-expression of your milk by watching these excellent videos on hand-expression online for extra reinforcement: 1.

Global Health Media Hand Expression: https://globalhealthmedia.org/portfolio-items/how-to-express- breastmilk/ or simply search: Global Health Media How to Express Breastmilk Using an electric breast pump Using an electric breast pump if you are separated from your baby, will help you create and maintain your milk supply. Some tips for using the electric pump include: Begin pumping with a hospital grade pump if your baby is in the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) as soon as advised. You can pump the first feeds by Hand Expression for several minutes (see above), but will want to add the electric breast pump at about 6 hours or as advised. We advise 8 - 10 pumping sessions in 24 hours to create an excellent milk supply. This should include at least 1-2 night pumping sessions. It is normal to have small amounts of milk at first. Even drops of colostrum can be beneficial for your baby. You can increase milk flow by placing warm washcloths on your breast, playing nice music, taking a prior warm shower, putting your pump flanges under warm water prior to pumping, and/or massaging your breasts. Clean the pump parts that come in contact with the breastmilk in hot, soapy water. Rinse, and air dry after each use. You may also boil the kits or place in a dishwasher daily. Follow the written cleaning instructions specific to your pump. Using a Manual or Hand Pump: We give many patients a manual pump prior to discharge from the postpartum unit. Start with breast massage or warmth to the breast as advised above under the topic Using an electric breast pump. Center the pump flange over the nipple. Begin pumping with a steady slow pull, and repeat until milk no longer flows. 24Handling and Storing Your Milk: Storing and feeding from the same bottle decreases the risk of contamination that can occur when the milk is poured from the storage container to the bottle. Label each bottle with the date and time the milk was expressed. This will help you feed the milk in the sequence that it was pumped. Refrigerated or frozen milk should be stored in the back or the refrigerator or freezer to avoid temperature changes when the door is opened. Defrost milk in the refrigerator overnight, or place the bottle in warm (not hot) water for several minutes. Never microwave breast milk as it can have hot spots that can burn your baby. When thawing frozen milk, label the time when the milk is thawed completely to start acceptable time limits. Use fresh milk whenever available. Freezing decreases some of the immune and digestive functions of breastmilk. Breast and Nipple Care It is ideal to wash your hands with soap and water before each feeding. You may wash your nipples with a mild soap and water each day. You may express colostrum, the breastmilk drops, and apply it to your nipples. Air dry to keep your nipples healthy. Wear a well-fitting bra if you need support. Avoid bras that are too tight. Underwire bras have been associated with plugged ducts if the underwire puts pressure on the breast. The underwire should be against the ribs, underneath the breast. Breastfeeding Challenges Flat or inverted nipples: Flat or inverted nipples can be challenging or might not cause any problems at all with breastfeeding. Your infant should open her/his mouth widely and close her/his mouth as far back as possible. Here are some tips: Make a \"sandwich\" with the breast, which means keeping your fingers and thumb parallel to your baby's lips, and pushing as much breast into your baby's mouth as possible. This can particularly help when your nipples are \"flat\" or \"smooth\". Here is a picture of making a sandwich: The thumb and fingers are parallel to the lips and the breast is scooped towards the baby. Help evert your nipples by rolling and gently tugging on the nipple with your fingers. Pump for a short time before feeding to draw the nipples out. Use a nipple shield, only if needed, to allow your baby to latch and help pull out your nipple. 25 Avoid pacifiers or bottles as their use may make your baby less likely to latch well. Get hands-on help from your Nurse or a Lactation Consultant. Sore Nipples In the process of getting a \"good latch,\" your baby should attach with a wide mouth, and lead with the chin. (see: How to get a wide, comfortable latch). If your baby latches deeply, your nipples should not have damage. However, you might experience some sensitivity, especially during the first several sucks of the feeding when your baby first attaches. Nipple sensitivity is common during the first week of breastfeeding, but should improve with practice. If your nipple continues to hurt after the first several sucks, your baby may not be attached deeply enough. You can carefully unlatch and try latching again. After the feeding, your nipples should look the same as they did at the start of the feeding. If they are pinched or creased, your baby may not be deeply latched. If your baby is latched correctly, and in a good position, breastfeeding is usually comfortable. After you are discharged: If your nipples become sore after being comfortable, or they remain uncomfortable without improvement, contact a breastfeeding resource person in your area. Help for Sore Nipples: Start feeds on the less sore side first Use hand expression or massage, or warm compresses to start your milk flowing prior to feeding. Try the clutch (football) hold, or the cross-cradle hold, and you can most easily get a deep latch in these holds. Tilt your baby's head back and lead with the chin. Try changing positions each time you breastfeed. Use comfort measures such as warm compresses, lanolin creams such as Lanisoh and Purelan, your own colostrum, or hydrogel dressings after the feeds. These can be very soothing. Release the suction if you remove your baby from the breast before your baby detaches. Put a clean finger in the side of your baby's mouth, between the jaws, to break the suction. Then remove your baby. Expose your nipples to air as often as possible. Wearing breast shells using the large opening, can help keep your sore nipple from touching your clothing with: can also be more comfortable. Engorgement Engorgement may occur in the first days after childbirth. As low-volume colostrum changes to higher volume mature milk, your breasts will feel full and may become hard and uncomfortable, especially just before a feeding. This usually lasts 2-3 days. Sometimes the breasts are so firm that your baby has difficulty latching. Help for engorgement Breastfeed frequently, at least 10-12 times in 24 hours. Frequent feeds are the most important thing you can do to resolve this overfull feeling. Make sure your baby is well latched when feeding. A thorough feeding will soften the breasts, making them feel empty. Some mothers find that applying a warm, moist towel to your breasts for 2-5 minutes or taking a warm shower before breastfeeding helps improve the milk flow.26 If your baby has trouble latching onto your swollen, full breasts, try hand expressing or pumping for a few minutes to remove a little milk and soften the areola before s/he feeds. If your breasts become so full that your baby cannot latch-on at all, your milk should be expressed and fed to your baby. Examples of alternative feeding methods are spoon-feeding, cup feeding, and finger feeding. The nurse or lactation consultant may teach these techniques to you. Express milk after breastfeeding either by hand or with a pump if your breasts still feel uncomfortably full after a feeding, but try not to over-pump. This can encourage your breasts to make more milk than your baby needs and prolong your engorgement. Many mothers find that placing ice packs on their breasts after feedings helps to relieve some of the swelling and pain. Ice packs can be used for up to 20 minutes every couple of hours. Lying down while applying ice may help relieve fullness and aid in the natural drainage of the breasts. Help for plugged ducts Make sure your baby is well latched onto breast. Breastfeed frequently on the affected side. Position your baby so that her/his chin points to the blocked duct. Alternate breastfeeding positions so your baby can more completely drain the breast. Gentle massage around the plugged duct while in the shower and while breastfeeding can help with drainage. Use warm compresses over area before feeding. Soak the breast in a basin of warm water and gently massage the affected area of the breast before expressing milk. Increase your fluid intake and rest as much as possible. Mastitis Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast that may be the result of an infection or a plugged duct. The milk is generally not affected. Symptoms include having a hard, red, painful area on your breast, fever over 100.4 degrees, and flu-like symptoms. Help for mastitis Any infection of the breast should be seen by a health care provider, and antibiotics are usually necessary. Increase frequency, duration of breastfeeding, and alternate positions to help with breast drainage. If your baby cannot breastfeed from the affected breast, pump that breast until your baby can resume breastfeeding. Rest as much as possible. Go to bed with your baby close by for the first few days of antibiotics. Put off all non-essential tasks or get help with cleaning, shopping, etc. Your job is to rest and nurse. Take a mild pain medication as recommended by your health care provider. Apply warm compresses to the breast several times per day before breastfeeding. Increase your fluid intake.27Breast Milk Storage for Term Infants* Human Milk Room Temperature RefrigeratorRefrigerator Freezer (0\u00b0/-18C)Deep Freezer (<0\u00b0) Freshly expressed breast milkUp to 6 hours Up to 5 days Up to 6 months 12 months Previously frozen, thawed in fridgeUp to 4 hours 24 hours Do not re-freeze Do not re-freeze Previously frozen & brought to room tempUntil feeding ends Up to 4 hours Do not re-freeze Do not re-freeze Previously frozen, warmed and fedUntil feeding ends Up to 4 hours Do not re-freeze Do not re-freeze *Storage time may vary for premature or sick babies.

These can be helped by burping the baby. Burp one or two times during a feeding and after. Spitting up is common during infancy. Sometimes spitting up means your baby has eaten more than her/his stomach can hold; sometimes s/he spits up while burping. It is important to know the difference between normal spitting up and true vomiting. Unlike spitting up, which most babies don't even seem to notice, vomiting is forceful and usually causes discomfort for your baby. Contact your pediatrician if you notice true vomiting or if the spit-up/ vomit is bloody or green. Vitamin D Vitamin D is a bone builder that works with calcium to keep bones strong. Adequate vitamin D intake in infancy is important to prevent rickets. 400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D supplement is recommended for: All breastfed infants Formula-fed infants taking less than 1 quart of formula per day Discuss with your pediatrician whether your infant needs vitamin D supplementation. Other foods In general, infants younger than 6 months should eat only breast milk or formula. They do not need additional water, juice, milk, or solid foods. Discuss with your baby's health care provider when your baby may be ready for the introduction of solid food. Diaper output Every baby's stool (bowel movement) pattern is a little different. Track stool and urine in the book provided to you from the hospital. Following discharge, continue to track your baby's stools and urine until your baby's two-week appointment. Your baby's initial stools, called meconium, will be dark black and sticky. Breast-fed babies usually have loose, seed-like yellow stools as your breastmilk supply increases. Breast-fed babies often will have a stool after every feeding. As your baby gets older stools may occur less often. This is normal. Formula-fed babies have stools that are more formed. Laxatives, suppositories, or enemas should not be used.Keeping Your Baby in Good Health33Notify your baby's health care provider of the following: Your baby is not having stools Stools are still dark green/brown by the 5th day Your baby's stools are excessively watery or hard Bloody stools Normal Urination Babies usually urinate once the first day of life, twice on the second day, and three times on the third day of life. These initial urine outputs can appear concentrated or yellow in color. Babies should urinate 6-8 or more times/day when your milk supply or formula feeding is well established. This urine should be nearly colorless or pale-yellow. Skin care Cord care: The remaining piece of umbilical cord dries up gradually and falls off before two weeks of age. The routine application of alcohol is not necessary to prevent infection, but try to keep area clean and dry. Please talk with your baby's health care provider about specific recommendations regarding umbilical cord care. Contact your baby's healthcare provider if: The area around the cord becomes hot, red or swollen Your baby develops a fever The cord has a foul smelling discharge There is continued bleeding and/or discharge after the cord falls off Bathing : Sponge baths are recommended until the cord has fallen off and the remaining area is clear of discharge. Use water or a mild soap. Daily baths are not necessary if you clean the diaper area thoroughly during diaper changes. Keep your baby wrapped in a towel, and expose only the parts of their body you are actively washing to reduce stress for the baby and keep them warm. Use the dampened cloth first without soap to wash the face, so you don't get soap into their eyes or mouth. Then dip it in the basin of soapy water before washing the rest of the body and, finally, the diaper area. Pay special attention to creases under the arms, behind the ears, around the neck, and, especially with a girl, in the genital area. Always wipe front to back. Babies have sensitive skin, and oils, lotions or powders are not recommended until directed by your child's provider. Circumcision care: 24-48 hours after the circumcision, there may be a patchy yellow film on the glans of the penis. This film is part of the normal healing response that should be left alone and should not be removed with a tissue or gauze. Circumcisions usually heal within 7 to 10 days. Until that time, you may drip water over your baby's penis to clean off stool. Sponge baths are recommended instead of tub baths following a circumcision. Apply A&D ointment to the penis or the part of the diaper in contact your baby's penis with each diaper change until the penis begins to heal (less red, swollen and \"wet\" looking) which will take 3 to 5 days.34Contact your baby's health care provider if: There is excessive swelling There is bleeding the size of a quarter or more There is a foul odor Your baby does not urinate 12-24 hours after circumcision Jaundice: Jaundice causes a yellowing of the baby's skin and progresses from head to toe. Almost all newborn babies get some degree of jaundice. Jaundice can happen from a number of different causes in the newborn period. The most common cause is slow elimination of bilirubin (the substance that causes jaundice) by the baby's liver and intestines. Jaundice usually peaks at age three to five days; however, in some babies the jaundice may occur earlier or later. Feeding your baby frequently will help your baby eliminate the bilirubin in the stool and decrease the jaundice. Jaundice can be serious if the bilirubin level gets too high and remains untreated. If you notice your baby becoming yellow, please contact your baby's health care provider for further instructions. Nails: In the first few weeks, your baby's nails will likely need care 1-2 times per week. Keep the nails trimmed short and smooth to avoid scratches. You can use baby nail clippers or a soft emery board. Take extra care when using clippers because it is possible to cut the tip of your baby's finger or toe, causing pain and bleeding. Push down on the fingertip skin so you can get the clippers around both sides of the nail and avoid cutting your baby's finger (or toe). For best results, trim or file your baby's nails when asleep or calm and their hands are less of a moving target. Do not bite your baby's nails as a way of trimming them. This may cause a condition called \"Herpetic Whitlow\" which is a finger infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Infant behavior Sneezing: All babies sneeze. It is the only way for them to clear their nose. If mucus is visible in the nostrils and seems to be bothering your baby, remove it by using a rubber bulb syringe. Sneezing in the first 2 weeks is usually not a symptom of a cold. Hiccoughing : Hiccoughs are normal, sporadic, and go away without any special treatment. Hiccoughs do not cause pain to your baby. Sleep: Every baby has her/his own sleep pattern. During the first few weeks of life, babies do not know the difference between day and night and will wake up every couple of hours to feed.35Always place your baby on their back to sleep in a crib or bassinet. Keep the crib free from toys, soft bedding, bumpers, blankets, and pillows. Do not use wedges or positioners. Avoid overheating or smoking near your baby. Have your baby within an arm's reach. Room sharing, but not bed sharing, is the safest sleep environment for your baby. Crying: All babies cry to communicate. Try to respond to your baby's crying as soon as possible. Babies cry because they are hungry, wet, tired, have gas pains, etc. Sometimes it is hard to discover the reason and your baby will continue to cry even after feeding, changing, rocking, burping. However, if your baby's crying appears to have changed in quality, your baby might be crying from pain. Contact your baby's health care provider. Development: Newborn infants can see, hear, and respond to touch. They try to focus on close objects of about 6-12 inches and often respond to a face and a voice. Your baby will enjoy being talked to and cuddled. Keeping your baby in good health You can help keep your baby healthy by taking an active role in your baby's safety to prevent unnecessary illnesses and accidents. Safety: It is important to be safety-conscious even during the newborn period. Never leave your baby unattended. Newborns can scoot, roll and fall off beds, counters, and tables. Avoid placing your baby on high surfaces. Watch over other children and pets when they play around your baby. Car and travel: California state law mandates that infants must be restrained in a rear-facing car safety seat in the rear seat of a car until 2 years old and at least 20 pounds. We follow recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics which state that infants should ride rear-facing until the age of 2 or until they reach both the height/weight limits of the car safety seat. Doctor's visits and immunizations: Your baby needs to be checked by a health care provider shortly after discharge from the hospital during the first two weeks of life. Future appointments and immunizations need to be arranged by your baby's health care provider. After the Hepatitis B Vaccine, immunizations are usually started at 2 months of age. Trust your own judgment: You know your baby better than anyone else in the world, so trust your judgment in meeting your baby's needs. Many parenting responsibilities are learned. Help yourself become informed through books, articles, and parent support groups.

This is very important because: Car accidents are the most common cause of death and injury for babies and small children. Most accidents occur within 5 miles of home. Most of these deaths and injuries can be prevented with the proper use of a car safety seat. A parent's arms are not a safe place for a baby, even for a short ride. A small impact or sudden stop could knock a baby from their arms. Infancy is the best time to begin car safety habits that should be continued for the rest of your baby's life. California Car Seat Laws (V.C. 27360-27368) state that all children under the age of 8 or under 4 feet 9 inches in height must be properly restrained in an appropriate child safety seat in the rear seat of a motor vehicle. Keeping your baby safe: Have your car safety seat inspected by a certified child safety seat technician. Call your local California Highway Patrol office (see list on 2nd page) or NHTSA (888) 327-4236 for locations. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends using a rear-facing car safety seat from birth until your child is 2 years old or reaches the highest weight or height limit allowed by the car safety seat manufacturer. If your baby outgrows their seat before reaching 2 yrs of age, consider switching to a seat with a harness approved for rear-facing safety seats with higher weight/height limits. California State Law states that your baby must ride rear facing until 2 years old. The seat should be installed tightly; it should not move more than an inch. Follow your car seat manufacturer's instructions and your vehicle owner's manual on how to install. Booster seats should be used for children under the age of 8 or under 4 feet 9 inches in height. All children younger than 13 years of age should be restrained in the rear seat of vehicles for optimal protection. Never place a rear-facing car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle. Unless, there is no rear seat or, the car safety seat cannot be properly installed. If your baby needs to ride rear-facing in the front seat, make sure the airbags are turned off. Do not use a used child safety seat unless you are certain it has never been in a collision. Keep the car clear of clutter to avoid any additional impact in the event of a collision. Register your car safety seat with the manufacturer to receive recall information, or register with the NHTSA.Protect Your Baby in the Car38Resources: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): (888) 327-4236: www.nhtsa.gov Click on Child Passenger Safety American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) parent website www.healthychildren.org SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A., Helpline at (800) 745-SAFE, English, or 800-745-SANO (7266) (Spanish). www.carseat.org Car Safety Seat Installation Resource The following agencies listed by county can assist you with car safety seat installation checks or low-cost car safety seat programs in your community.

Hepatitis B is a serious disease that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B can cause mild illness lasting a few weeks, or it can lead to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis B virus infection can be either acute or chronic. Acute hepatitis B virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis B virus. This can lead to: \u0082fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and/or vomiting \u0082jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements) \u0082pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person's body. Most people who go on to develop chronic hepatitis B do not have symptoms, but it is still very serious and can lead to: \u0082liver damage (cirrhosis) \u0082liver cancer \u0082death Chronically-infected people can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they do not feel or look sick themselves. Up to 1.4 million people in the United States may have chronic hepatitis B infection. About 90% of infants who get hepatitis B become chronically infected and about 1 out of 4 of them dies. Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluid infected with the Hepatitis B virus enters the body of a person who is not infected. People can become infected with the virus through: \u0082Birth (a baby whose mother is infected can be infected at or after birth) \u0082Sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person \u0082Contact with the blood or open sores of an infected person \u0082Sex with an infected partner \u0082Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment \u0082Exposure to blood from needlesticks or other sharp instrumentsEach year about 2,000 people in the United States die from hepatitis B-related liver disease. Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B and its consequences, including liver cancer and cirrhosis. 2Hepatitis B vaccine Hepatitis B vaccine is made from parts of the hepatitis B virus. It cannot cause hepatitis B infection. The vaccine is usually given as 2, 3, or 4 shots over 1 to 6 months. Infants should get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and will usually complete the series at 6 months of age. All children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age who have not yet gotten the vaccine should also be vaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated adults who are at risk for hepatitis B virus infection, including: \u0082People whose sex partners have hepatitis B \u0082Sexually active persons who are not in a long-term monogamous relationship \u0082Persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease \u0082Men who have sexual contact with other men \u0082People who share needles, syringes, or other drug- injection equipment \u0082People who have household contact with someone infected with the hepatitis B virus \u0082Health care and public safety workers at risk for exposure to blood or body fluids \u0082Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons \u0082Persons in correctional facilities \u0082Victims of sexual assault or abuse \u0082Travelers to regions with increased rates of hepatitis B \u0082People with chronic liver disease, kidney disease, HIV infection, or diabetes \u0082Anyone who wants to be protected from hepatitis B There are no known risks to getting hepatitis B vaccine at the same time as other vaccines. Hepatitis B Vaccine Information 39Office use only 3 Some people should not get this vaccine Tell the person who is giving the vaccine: \u0082If the person getting the vaccine has any severe, life- threatening allergies. If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of hepatitis B vaccine, or have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you may be advised not to get vaccinated. Ask your health care provider if you want information about vaccine components. If the person getting the vaccine is not feeling well. If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, you can probably get the vaccine today. If you are moderately or severely ill, you should probably wait until you recover. Y our doctor can advise you.\u0082 4Risks of a vaccine reaction With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible. Most people who get hepatitis B vaccine do not have any problems with it. Minor problems following hepatitis B vaccine include: \u0082soreness where the shot was given \u0082temperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1 or 2 days. Y our doctor can tell you more about these reactions. Other problems that could happen after this vaccine: \u0082People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. \u0082Some people get shoulder pain that can be more severe and longer-lasting than the more routine soreness that can follow injections. This happens very rarely. \u0082Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more information, visit: www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ 5 What if there is a serious problem? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or unusual behavior. \u0082 Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? \u0082If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your clinic. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Y our doctor should file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not give medical advice. 6 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccin e can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. There is a time limit to file a claim for compensation. 7 How can I learn more? \u0082Ask your healthcare provider. He or she can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. \u0082Call your local or state health department. \u0082Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) or - Visit CDC's website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines Vaccine Information Statement Hepatitis B Vaccine 10/12/2018 | 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-26 401855 Fourth St., Phone: 415-353-1787 Website: www.ucsfhealth.org Maps and directions: www.ucsfhealth.org/pathway PRINTED ON PARTIALLY RECYCLED PAPER 3.19 "}
