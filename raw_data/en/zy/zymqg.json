I believe that one of the most important aspects of mental health care is relationships and that a strong relationship with your mental health provider is important for healing. In addition to medication treatment, I have an interest in complementary and supplemental treatments, such as exercise, nutrition, meditation, supplements, and other behavioral and lifestyle interventions. I'm a competitive, amateur weightlifter and, when not at work or with family, you will find me in my garage gym training for a powerlifting competition.
