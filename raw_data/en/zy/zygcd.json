Integrative health consultation and education addressing individual health needs from a physical, emotional, mental & spiritual perspective. Another Way East Meets West The healthcare status quo is too narrow and outdated in its worldview, it's dysfunctional and it hides behind all the shiny objects it dangles to people and companies. Innovation is not just about AI, new medicines or expensive procedures. Healthcare systems are prioritizing profits over the people they should serve. Individuals We help individuals, who are struggling with the current healthcare system, find answers and achieve optimal health by examining the roots of their health story. Third Opinion MD is the bridge between ancient Eastern wisdom and modern medicine. This \"East meets West\" approach takes the best, most effective elements of each philosophy and uses them to transform the \"patient\" role from a passive healthcare recipient to an empowered driver of their own health management and prevention. Companies We deliver healthcare strategies tailored for specific company needs that include learning how to design robust health benefits and wellness offerings to lower costs, retain talent, boost productivity, and build prevention into the foundation of a company's culture.

But complex problems need tailored systems approaches. That's what we do. We, at Third Opinion MD, study the heartbeat of a company's system through careful listening and observation. Together, we craft solutions that work for maximizing your company's health now and in the future. Discover that health is simple, achievable and so much more than a doctor's visit.

I feel she gave great advice and would hope other doctors would lean more in that direction. She asked about nutrition, etcetera, and I feel came up with a great holistic plan for me.\" About Barbara de la Torre, MD As a second-generation integrative physician with knowledge of a more holistic model of care, I've come to love both types of medicine because each has the strength to overcome the other's weaknesses.

When you learn to understand the bigger picture, your health is simplified. It becomes possible to treat, achieve, and ultimately maintain. Every Third Opinion MD client begins with a \"blank slate\" and with individualized attention. Together, we focus on education, self-ownership, and simple methods for staying connected with ourselves. By actively listening, we begin to understand factors that maintain our health and those things that disrupt the balance.
