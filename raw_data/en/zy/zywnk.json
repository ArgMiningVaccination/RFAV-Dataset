A quadrivalent influenza (flu) vaccine is designed to protect against four different flu viruses, including two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. Learn more about the [vaccine composition](/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2023-2024.htm) for the current flu season vaccines. Why was quadrivalent flu vaccine developed? For many years, flu vaccines were designed to protect against three different flu viruses: an influenza A(H1N1) virus, an influenza A(H3N2) virus and one influenza B virus. Adding a B virus from the second lineage was done to give broader protection against circulating flu viruses. Who can get quadrivalent flu vaccine? All flu vaccines in the United States are quadrivalent. Different vaccines are approved for different age groups. Information on approved flu vaccines for the current flu season, and age indications for each vaccine are available in CDC's [Table: U.S. Influenza Vaccine Products for the 2023-2024 Season](/flu/professionals/acip/2022-2023/acip-table.htm). Who shouldn't get quadrivalent flu vaccine? Different influenza (flu) vaccines are approved for use in people in different age groups. In addition, some vaccines are not recommended for certain groups of people. Factors that can determine a person's suitability for vaccination, or vaccination with a particular vaccine, include a person's age, health (current and past) and any allergies to flu vaccine or its components. More information is available at [Who Should and Who Should NOT get a Flu Vaccine.](/flu/prevent/whoshouldvax.htm) Yes, for some people. There are three flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older. These are [Fluzone High-Dose flu vaccine](/flu/prevent/adjuvant.htm). This recommendation was based on a review of available studies which suggests that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. There is no preferential recommendation for people younger than 65 years. If none of the three flu vaccines preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older is available at the time of administration, people in this age group should get any other age-appropriate flu vaccine instead. How much quadrivalent flu vaccine will be available for the United States during the 2023-2024 flu season? All flu vaccine for the 2023-2024 season is quadrivalent. More information about flu vaccine supply is [available](/flu/prevent/vaccine-supply-distribution.htm). Are quadrivalent flu vaccines safe? Yes. Flu vaccines that protect against four flu viruses have a safety profile similar to seasonal flu vaccines made to protect against three viruses, with similar\u2014mostly mild\u2014side effects. Like all seasonal flu vaccines, vaccines that protect against four flu viruses are monitored annually for their safety and effectiveness. For information about flu vaccine side effects, see [\"Can the flu vaccine give me the flu?\"](/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm#side-effects) People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. Previously, it was recommended that people with severe allergy to egg (those who have had any symptom other than hives with egg exposure) be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting. Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg. All vaccines should be given in settings where allergic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly. "}
