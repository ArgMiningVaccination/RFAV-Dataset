All without restricting calories and the ability to eat as much as you want!", "sitename": "detox.reimagined-health.com", "date": "2023-04-09", "cleaned_text": "The type of detox we recommend is a comprehensive, physician-led detox that involves REAL FOOD, zero quantity restrictions or calorie counting, and superior, professional-grade supplements. A detox that supports the body's natural Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 detoxification processes. This type of detox can lead to... A future where you wake up well-rested. No longer feeling chained to coffee. In fact, maybe not even drinking coffee anymore, and STILL maintaining excellent energy levels all day. When it comes to food... It's like something has shifted inside where you actually crave healthy food! And the gas, bloating, or other digestive issues that used to be a regular occurrence are GONE! (yes, a detox CAN heal the gut). And as if that wasn't enough... Our clients often tell us that they've released that extra 15lbs they'd been carrying the last 5 years and haven't gained it back. These results align with what we've seen 500+ clients experience during a simple, food-based, no-restriction, 4-week detox paired with professional pharmaceutical-grade supplement support. "}
