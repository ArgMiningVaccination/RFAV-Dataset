This report by the Global hivPrevention Working Group makes detailed recommendations on how to effectively integrate hivprevention into expanding hivtreatment programs. The report also provides recommendations on new approaches to hivprevention that will be required as treatment access expands \u2014 including programs that take into account the different needs of people who are hiv-positive and hiv-negative. the global hiv prevention working group The Global hivPrevention Working Group is a panel of nearly 50 leading public health experts, clinicians, biomedical and behavioral researchers, and people affected by hiv/aids, convened by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. The Working Group seeks to inform global policy-making, program planning, and donor decisions on hivprevention, and to advocate for a comprehensive response to hiv/aids that integrates prevention and care. In July 2002, the Working Group issued its rst report, Global Mobilization for hivPrevention: A Blueprint for Action . In May 2003 it released Access to hivPrevention: Closing the Gap. Both are available at www.gatesfoundation.org and www.kaisernetwork.org .ccess to hivtreatment and care in developing countries is at last becoming a global priority. Governments, international agencies, drug manufacturers, and private organizations are mobilizing to substantially increase access to life-prolonging antiretroviral therapy ( art). Greater availability of hivtreatment* for the 40 million people currently infected with hivis a humani- tarian imperative that could prolongthe lives of millions, restoreeconomic productivity, and stabilizesocieties in some of the world'shardest-hit regions. But long-term success against hiv/aids requires simultaneous expansion of both artand prevention. Unless the incidence of hivis sharply reduced, hivtreat- ment will not be able to keep pace with all those who willneed therapy. For example, while the who /unaids 3 by 5 Initiative establishes the goal of having 3 million peopleon artby 2005, 5 million new infections occur every year. New Opportunities The world has a unique opportunity, as artprograms are launched and expanded, to simultaneously bolsterprevention efforts. Increased availability of hivtreatment is likely to result in increased hivtesting rates, reduced stigma, and possibly reduced infectivity for those on art. But more widespread access to hivtreatment could also bring millions of people into health care settings, providing new opportunities for health care workers to deliver andreinforce hivprevention messages and interventions. Pilot programs in developing countries are demonstratingthat such an integrated approach is feasible and cansubstantially increase condom use and hivtesting rates. New Challenges Greater artaccess will also present new challenges for hivprevention programs. Experience in industrialized countries suggests that hivtreatment access can alterpeople's perception of the risk associated with hiv, and can lead to increased risk behavior. In addition, becauseartcan signicantly increase the longevity and health of people living with hiv, the number of opportunities for hivtransmission to occur could increase. As testing rates increase and more people learn their hivstatus, there is a unique opportunity to adapt prevention strategies to meet the differing needs of hiv- positive and hiv-negative people. While not all prevention serviceswill be targeted this way, such atargeted prevention approach isnow possible: tPrevention for hiv-Positive People. Although most people diagnosed with hivtake steps to avoid exposing others to the virus, some have difculty maintainingsafer behavior, making \"prevention for positives\" a criticalstrategy in reducing the number of new hivinfections. 1 t Prevention for hiv-Negative and Untested People. Prevention strategies for hiv-negative and untested people must be adapted to ensure that risk behaviordoes not increase in the context of artaccess. Ultimate Goal: Widespread Access to hivPrevention and Treatment Globally, fewer than one in ve people at high risk of infec- tion have access to proven hivprevention interventions2\u2014 voluntary hivcounseling and testing, condom promotion campaigns, treatment for sexually transmitted diseases(std s), drugs and strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hiv, and harm reduction programs for injecting drug users, among others. In the case of anti-retroviral therapy, access in developing countries is evenlower \u2014 only 7% of people who need artin low- and middle-income countries currently receive it. If the world fails to act now to expand access to hiv prevention during this critical time of growing artaccess, 1* Throughout this report the term \" hivtreatment\" is used to refer to antiretroviral therapy. The Working Group recognizes that there is a spectrum of treatmentneeds for people living with hiv, including treatment for tb, opportunistic infections and other conditions associated with hivinfection. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The world has a unique opportunity to simultaneously expand both treatment and prevention.we could repeat the mistakes of the industrialized world, where hivprevention was not sufciently prioritized as hivtreatment was expanded, leading to an increase in risk behavior and infection rates. However, if the world mobilizes to simultaneously and aggressively expand both hivprevention and treatment, we could achieve a truly comprehensive approach to ghtingaids that could contain and ultimately reverse the epidemic. summary of recommendations The Working Group recommends a four-point plan of action: 1. Integrate hivPrevention and Treatment t Expansion of Access to hivTesting. Because hiv counseling and testing is a critical entry point for bothprevention and artservices, testing programs should be signicantly expanded and aggressively promoted.As artis introduced, testing should remain voluntary and condential. Where artaccess exists, hivtesting and counseling should be universally offered in allhealth care settings \u2014 including stdand tbclinics, family planning and reproductive health clinics,prenatal and prevention of mother-to-child transmis-sion ( pmtct ) settings, and mobile health programs in rural areas \u2014 provided individuals have the ability toopt out of testing. t hivPrevention in Health Care Settings. All health care settings, including hivtreatment sites, should deliver hivprevention services. Doctors, nurses, and non- clinical staff in health care settings \u2014 including art sites, tband stdclinics, family planning and reproduc- tive health clinics, harm reduction programs for injection drug users, maternal-child health clinics, andpmtct programs \u2014 should be trained to provide hiv prevention counseling, access to condoms and otherprevention tools, and screening for sexually transmitteddiseases. Risk reduction strategies should also be integrated into initiatives that promote artadherence. Prevention and treatment services should be tailored tomeet the specic needs of women, recog nizing the multiple social, legal, and economic disadvantages they confront. Special efforts will similarly be needed to make integrated prevention and treatment a realityfor young people, who often do not enter the caresystem until they are adults.t artPromotion in Prevention Services. Prevention outreach programs should promote hivtesting, educate communities about hivtreatments, and facilitate linkages to care. In some circumstances, such as harm reduction programs, prevention programsmay actually serve as ideal venues for the delivery ofartand other hiv/aids treatment. t Donor Priorities. Donors and national programs should prioritize integration of prevention in artsettings. The Global Fund and the World Bank Multicountry aids Program should prioritize funding for proposals thatinclude delivery of prevention services in artsettings. who should ensure that 3 by 5 Initiative staff receive training on hivprevention as part of training and technical assistance activities. Bilateral and multilateraldonors, such as the U.S. government and the WorldBank, should ensure that all programs integrate compre-hensive, science-based hivprevention in the delivery of art, and should require programs to report on progress toward prevention-treatment integration. Individualcountries should revise their aids strategic plans to prioritize integration of hivprevention in treatment settings. unaids and who should emphasize the impor- tance of integrating prevention services in artsettings in their technical assistance on Global Fund proposals. t Research. Research efforts should be strengthened and expanded to identify the most effective strategiesfor integrating hivprevention and treatment. who and unaids should develop mechanisms to rapidly disseminate research ndings to the eld. 2. Deliver Prevention for hiv-Positive People t \"Prevention for Positives.\" New prevention programs tailored to the needs of people living with hivshould be developed and implemented. Programs should include counseling regarding personal disclosure ofhivstatus, information on the ability of individuals to transmit hiveven while on art, and promotion of safer behavior. Research should be quickly undertakento identify optimal messages and strategies forreaching hiv-positive people. t Involving People Living with hiv.Donors and govern- ments should provide nancial support to organiza-tions of people living with hiv. Such organizations should be involved in the planning, development,delivery, and evaluation of hivprevention services for people living with hiv. 23t Fighting Stigma. Efforts to combat hiv-related stigma and discrimination must be strengthened andsustained. Enforceable laws must be in place to protect people with hivfrom discrimination. Community-based initiatives that empower people living with hivwill help increase rates of voluntary testing, clinic attendance, andparticipation in hivprevention efforts. 3. Adapt Prevention for hiv-Negative People t New Messages. Prevention strategies for hiv-negative and untested people should be revised to emphasize the continuing importance of risk reduction as hivtreat- ment access expands and to address the limitations ofart. Evaluation of existing programs should be under- taken to provide information about successful strategies. t Monitoring Behavioral Impact of art.Behavioral surveillance and sentinel surveillance must be signicantly expanded to monitor the effect of art access on risk behavior and trends in hivprevalence. 4. Fund a Comprehensive Response t Simultaneous Scale-Up of Prevention and Treatment. To expand access to the full range of proven hiv prevention and treatment interventions, hiv/aids spending from all sources should increase from $4.7billion in 2003 to $10.5 billion in 2005 and to $15billion in 2007, as recommended by unaids.t Addressing Barriers to Scale-Up. Funding initiatives for hivprevention and treatment must include both short- and long-term strategies to build sustainablecapacity in countries to deliver essential services \u2014including health care infrastructure and training forhealth care personnel. t Research into New Prevention Technologies. Annual funding for hivvaccine research should double from approximately $520 million to $570 million today to atleast $1 billion in 2007. Annual funding for microbicideresearch should increase from less than $150 m illion today to $300 million in 2007. In addition, funding should substantially increase for research into otherprevention technologies, such as female condoms,diaphragms, circumcision, treatment of viral std s, and oral chemoprophylaxis. Opportunities for peopleto participate in clinical trials of new prevention tech-nologies should be linked with hivtesting, prevention, and artservices. These recommendations are intended to provide guidance on one critical aspect of the global response to aids \u2014 the need to integrate hivprevention into health care settings, and adapt hivprevention strategies in the era of increased access to hivtreatment. In addition to the recommendations identi- ed here, it will also be essential to scale up access to the fullarray of proven prevention interventions in all settings. In earlier reports, the Working Group has identied the key elements of an effective effort to prevent hivtransmis- sion. E ven if prevention is more fully integrated into expanded artprograms, many prevention services will need to be offered outside medical settings. This isespecially the case for young people, who have much lowerrates of hivinfection than adults and are therefore not as likely to visit hivtreatment sites. Effective prevention involves a series of strategies that achieve maximum impact when pursued in combination.These elements include: tBehavior change programs to promote condom use,reduction in the number of partners, mutual monogamy,abstinence, and delayed initiation of sexual activity tPrevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseasesthivcounseling and testing tHarm reduction programs for injecting drug users tPrevention of mother-to-child transmission tBlood safety practices tInfection control in health care settings tPolicy reforms to reduce the vulnerability of women and girls, and ensure the legality and availability of proven hiv prevention strategies such as condoms and clean syringes tPrevention programs specically designed for peopleliving with hiv In addition to expanding access to existing interventions,the rapid development and deployment of new tools \u2014such as vaccines and microbicides, once developed \u2014 willbe a crucial part of the comprehensive response to theepidemic. bringing comprehensive hiv prevention to scalehe world has entered a new stage in the ght against hiv/aids. Fueled by a determination to improve the health and well-being of nations where 95% of the world's hiv-infected people live, the global community is beginning a major effort to expandaccess to anti-retroviral therapies ( art) and other hiv- related health services. Since 2001, when 189 member states of the United Nationsendorsed worldwide hivtreat- ment access in the Declaration ofCommitment on hiv/aids, efforts to deliver artin developing coun- tries have accelerated. 3 who and unaids have established a global target of having 3 million people on artby 2005. As of early 2004, the Global Fund had approved grants to supportthe provision of artto 700,000 people. The President's Emergency Plan for aids Relief ( pepfar ) initiative of the U.S. government plans to deliver artto 2 million people by 2007 in 14 high-prevalence countries in sub-SaharanAfrica and the Caribbean. The World Bank also hasannounced plans to increase its nancial assistance forartprograms in eligible countries, with particular focus on support for the infrastructure that will be required toinitiate and sustain treatment programs. Countries indiverse regions are also examining national policies andfunding allocations to facilitate the delivery of art through the public sector. These initiatives must overcome substantial obstacles in resource-limited settings, including the need to recruitand train tens of thousands of health care workers. Bylate 2003, only 400,000 people in low- and middle-income countries were receiving art, reflecting treat- ment coverage of only 7%. 4Despite the many challenges confronting the global community, however, it is clearthat the response to hiv/aids is entering a stage of expanded access to art. In addition to the therapeutic benets that will flow to millions of hiv-infected individuals, enhanced artaccess will offer important new opportunities to strengthen andexpand hivprevention efforts. Increased availability of hiv treatment is likely to result in increased hivtesting rates, reduced stigma, and possibly reduced infectivity for those on art. But more widespread access to artalso offers critical new opportunities for hivpreven- tion efforts: t Integration of Prevention and Treatment. As access expands, artwill be delivered in health care venues where hiv prevention services can be offered. t Prevention for hiv-Positive People. As more people learn their hivstatus in the context of expanded art access, prevention programs should develop and directservices to people living with hiv. t New Strategies for hiv-Negative or Untested Individuals. Prevention programs will need to anticipate and seek tominimize potential increases in risk behavior associatedwith increased access to artby updating prevention messages and strategies to ensure their relevance andeffectiveness. The potential health dividends from seizing these new opportunities are enormous. If rapid expansion of artis combined with a dramatically scaled-up prevention effort,the world could substantially reduce the severity of theglobal epidemic. In fact, a 2002 study led by unaids and who reported that existing hivprevention strategies, if substantially expanded, could avert 29 million of the 45million new infections projected to occur between 2002and 2010. 5 4HIV PREVENTION IN THE ERA OF EXPANDED TREATMENT ACCESS introduction Rapid scale-up of hivtreatment and prevention could improve the lives of millions, avert countless new infections, and ultimately contain the global aids epidemic.5integrating hiv prevention in health care settings artcan enhance hivprevention by attracting millions of individuals into a wide range of health care settings whereprevention services can be offered. Expanded hivtreat- ment availability will also provide greater incentives for hiv testing, and testing settings will serve as critical entrypoints for both prevention and hivtreatment services. Increasing Knowledge of hivStatus Experts estimate that close to 90% of people living with hivin developing countries are unaware oftheir infection. 6Because inadequate knowledge of hivstatus impedes both prevention and hivtreatment efforts, the percentage of people in developing countrieswho know their hivstatus must signicantly increase. Numerous factors currently impede widespread knowledge of hivstatus, including the perception that knowledge of serostatus is not useful where hivtreatment is unavailable. However, studies demonstrate that knowledge of hivstatus has an independent hivprevention benet, leading people to reduce their risk behavior, even when hivtreatment is not available.7artavailability will provide much greater incentive to increase knowledge of hivstatus. tLimited Access to vct Sites. Historically, the primary means to learn one's hivstatus in developing countries is through stand-alone voluntary counseling and testing(vct) sites. At present, only 12% of individuals who need vcthave meaningful access to testing services, under- scoring the importance of increased funding for vct. 8 tUniversal Offer of Voluntary Testing in Health Care Settings Where artis Available. While stand-alone vctsites have long provided an important means of promoting knowledge of hiv status, exclusive reliance on these venues is unlikely to generate thelevels of testing and counselingneeded to achieve prevention andhivtreatment goals. 9vctdepends on the individual 's own volition in coming forward to be tested. In areas where arthas been introduced, providers should always offer testing in abroad range of health care settings, including hospi-tals, stdand tbclinics, family planning and reproduc- tive health service settings, prenatal care settings, andmobile health programs in rural areas. Patients shouldbe given the opportunity to opt not be tested, and con-dentiality must in all cases be maintained. Programsshould make maximum use of rapid testing technolo-gies to increase knowledge of hivstatus, 10and donors should prioritize training in use of such technologies.Only 12 percent of people who need voluntary hivcounseling and testing have access to it. hivtesting services should be offered in a wide range of health care settings \u2014 from hospitals to tbclinics to mobile health centers in rural areas. It is estimated that 90% of people with hivin the devel- oping world are unaware of their infection. Expandingopportunities for voluntary hivtesting will be critical to expanding access to both prevention and artservices, yet only 12% of people who need access to testing andcounseling services have it. As artprograms expand, it is essential that testing opportunities increase: tWhere artis available: hivtesting should be universally offered in a broad range of health care settings, including hospitals, std and tbclinics, family planning and reproductive health service settings, prenatal care settings, and mobilehealth programs in rural areas. Patients should be given the opportunity to opt not be tested, and condentiality must in all cases be maintained. If a patient presents in a health care setting with possible symptoms of hivinfection, the patient should be informed that an hivtest will be performed for diagnostic purposes unless he or she expressly declines. tAll blood donors should be advised that their blood willbe tested condentially for hiv, and hiv-infected blood donations should be removed from the blood supply.Donors who test positive for hivshould be notied of their hivstatus and linked to appropriate care and art programs. tPrograms should make maximum use of rapid testingtechnologies to increase knowledge of hivstatus, and donors should prioritize training in use of such technologies.hiv testing: expanding opportunities to deliver prevention and hiv treatment6Treatment and prevention are essential partners in the ght against aids. In the absence of hivtreatment, prevention programs lack incentives for people to knowtheir hivstatus. Without effective prevention to reduce the number of new infections, artinitiatives will not be able to keep pace with the spread of the disease. Potential Prevention Benets of art Greater access to artis likely to benet hivprevention efforts in a variety of ways. tIncreased Knowledge of hivStatus. Pilot artprojects in Haiti and South Africa have generated increases inutilization of voluntary counseling and testing ( vct) services of 300% 11and 1,200%,12respectively. After former Henrique Cardoso of Brazildecreed in 1996 that artwould be provided through the country's public health service, demand for vct soared; by 2003, 2.3 million people were tested, upfrom 1.8 million the year before. 13The encouragement provided by artprograms for hivtesting has been shown to benet hivprevention efforts.14In a controlled trial in three developing countries (Kenya,Tanzania, and Trinidad), individuals receiving vctwere nearly three times more likely to reduce risky sexualbehavior than people who received health informationalone, with hiv-infected individuals being more likely than uninfected people to take protective measures. 15 tReduced Stigma. Stigma impedes the dissemination of life-saving hivprevention information within communities and discourages key social institutions from becomingengaged in efforts to curb transmission. Early experiencewith artscale-up in developing countries suggests that artaccess could potentially have a major positive impact on public attitudes about aids. After M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res ( msf) began providing artin the Khayelitsha township outside Cape Town, a survey of nine commutersites throughout South Africa found that Khayelitsha residents were notably more likely than other SouthAfricans to express willingness to be tested for hiv,seek hiv/aids information and counseling, and use condoms. 16 Researchers associated with an artproject in central Haiti have also detected a decline in hiv-related stigma.17 tReduced Infectivity. Although denitive evidence is not yet available, existing data suggests that broad access toart, when combined with interventions to promote adherence to drug regimens, might reduce an indi-vidual's risk of transmitting hiv. 18The risk of hiv transmission is strongly correlated with the infectedperson's plasma viral load. 19In individual patients, arttypically results in a signicant reduction in plasma viral load.20Strict adherence to artregimens increases the likelihood that viral suppression will be sustained.21 Whether this potential individual-level preventionbenet can be extended to an entire population willdepend on the balance between reduced infectivity andother epidemiological or behavioral factors, such as thelonger lifespan of people who receive artand possible shifts in community-level risk behavior. The Potential for Increased Risk Behavior to Overwhelm the Prevention Benets of art Experience in industrialized countries indicates that it is possible for the prevention benets of artnoted above to be overwhelmed by complacency about the threat ofhiv/aids and resulting increases in risk behavior and new hivinfections. 22 Increases in risk behavior may occur for a variety of reasons, including a belief by some that hivis no longer as serious and the perception that hiv-positive people on art are no longer infectious. People may also have difcultyadhering to a lifetime of safer sexual behavior. In addition,artsignicantly enhances quality of life and personal sense Media Coverage of KemronMedia Coverage of Pearl Omega 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 year% of Sex Workers Reporting 100% Condom Use with Clients100 908070605040302010 0the prevention-treatment dynamic Effect of Treatment News on Condom Use Among Commercial Sex Workers in Nairobi Figure 1 Source: Jha et al., Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, 20017of well being, enabling many individuals to resume sexual activity \u2014 which may involve risky behavior. While this canbe an important benet of therapy, it could also increaseopportunities for hivtransmission. It is too early to know whether increases in risk behavior seen in industrialized countries will surface indeveloping countries as artis introduced. Past evidence from Kenya suggests, however, that perceived treatmentadvances may have had an impact on levels of riskbehavior in that country. Since 1985, surveys have detected notable increases in condom use among commercial sex workers in Kenya.Evidence indicates, however, that the upward trajectory of condom use was twice interrupted when highly touted anti-hivtherapies attracted signicant public interest. In 1988-90, when press reports in Africa suggested that thedrug Kemron was a cure for aids, reported condom use plummeted. Again, in 1993-94, when an agent called PearlOmega generated comparable press coverage as a possibletreatment for hiv/aids, reported rates of condom use sharply declined (see Figure 1). To ensure that increased risk behavior does not over- whelm the natural prevention benets of art, it is vital that artbe coupled with a simultaneous expansion of preven- tion strategies that have been shown to reduce the risk ofhivtransmission.

Using available evidence on the likelihood that artreduces individual infectivity, Sally Blower and colleagues modeled the epidemic's future course in settings where artis widely available (50-90% coverage). Where risk behavior declines following widespread introduction of art, as indicated in the lower-left-hand box in the graph, hiv transmission falls, producing a decline in incidence over time. If risk behavior increases in the context of expanded art, however, the prevention benets of artwill be overwhelmed, leading to an increase in the rate of new infections and a continuing expansion of the epidemic.Potential Impact of Risk Behavior on Future Epidemic in India with Expanded Treatment Access Effect of Risk Behavior on the Future Course of the Epidemic with Expanded artAccess Source: J. Valasco-Hernandez et al., Lancet Inf Dis 2002;2:487-93.Roarv= Average number of new infections generated by one infectedcase when artis widely availableFigure 2. Projections by the World Bank estimate a savings of more than 25 million discounted life-years in India if condomuse remains stable in the era of expanded treatment access. If condom use falls by only 10 percentage points following theintroduction of art, however, the net result over time will instead be a loss of more than 18 million life-years through 2033, underscoring the critical need for prevention and treatmentto be brought to scale simultaneously. Moreover, if India's program to expand access to artis coupled with incentives to states and ngo sto improve access to hivprevention services like condoms, the World Bank projects that such a program could, by increasing condom use by 20percentage points, save 79.2 million discounted life years \u2014 three times more than without the prevention incentives.Note: Life-years saved are discounted at 10%.Source: Over et al., hiv/aids Treatment and Prevention in India: Modeling the Costs and Consequences, World Bank, 2004.When a patient presents in a health care setting with possible symptoms of hivinfection, providers should in the course of counseling inform the indi-vidual that an hivtest will be performed for diagnostic purposes unless he or she expressly declines. Blooddonors should be advised that their blood will be testedcondentially for hiv, and hiv-infected blood dona- tions should be removed from the blood supply. tMarketing Knowledge of hivStatus. Streamlining testing procedures will help increase the number ofpeople tested, but changes in policies and practices are unlikely on their own to lead to substantially higher testing rates. The stigma associated with hiv and with the behaviors that lead to transmission oftendiscourage individuals from being tested, even whentesting and hivtreatment services are readily available. To increase knowledge of hivstatus, enhanced availability of testing services must be supported bymarketing strategies that address attitudinal impedi-ments to testing. In particular, programs shouldactively promote the individual benets of testing. In Canada, a country with one of the world's most generous single-payer health care systems, authoritiesestimate that up to one-third of Canadians with hiv are unaware of their hivstatus. 23Similarly, in the U.S., cdcestimates that at least 25% of people living with hiv are unaware they are infected.24In Botswana, where national authorities have committed to scale up art, knowledge of hivstatus remains at low levels. Even though hivprevalence is 38% in the adult population in Botswana, only 65,000 people had used governmenttesting facilities by the beginning of 2003. 25 A recent study in South Africa compared attitudes of voluntary testers versus those who had not beentested. Individuals who avoided testing or failed toreturn for test results held signicantly more negativeattitudes toward the test than those who knew theirhivstatus. Untested individuals were signicantly more likely to exhibit social disapproval of people withhivand to believe that hivinfection is shameful. 26 Delivering prevention services in artclinical settings artscale-up could bring millions of individuals into health care settings, providing new opportunities todeliver and reinforce risk reduction interventions. thivPrevention Training for Clinicians. Brief clinician- tdelivered prevention interventions have proven effective for a variety of health conditions, including smoking,obesity, alcohol abuse, depression, and physical inac- tivity.27A recent clinic-based study found that the delivery by medical providers of brief hivprevention messages that emphasize the dangers of unsafe sexreduced risk behaviors among hiv-positive patients. 28In contrast to the more structured counseling protocols forvct, a brief intervention by a clinician could, for example, remind the patient of the importance of safersex, provide information on clinic-based access tocondoms and counseling, and ask if the patient wishesto discuss issues related to hivprevention. Rapid scale-up will require signicant efforts to train health care workers to deliver art.For example, who envisions the need to train 100,000 clinical and community-based personnel to facilitate the scale-up ofartprograms. Competency in discussing sexual and drug use behavior with patients and in delivering briefhivprevention interventions should be included in all art-related training protocols.* Training protocols for clinicians should also include instruction in properinfection control, such as handling and disposal ofsharp instruments. thivPrevention Training for Non-Health Care Profes- sionals. It may not be feasible to rely solely on clinical staff to deliver prevention services in medical settings.Clinical personnel in developing countries are alreadyoverburdened, and the weight of demands will onlygrow as the world embarks on an unprecedentedexpansion of hivtreatment programs. Indeed, surveys in industrialized countries also indicate that the paceof clinical care often makes it difcult for health careworkers to deliver prevention services. 29 A more sustainable strategy may be to structure clinical episodes to permit trained non-health careprofessionals to provide prevention services. Forexample, a patient waiting to see a clinician can beprovided with hivprevention information and referred to other needed services. Clinics and other healthsettings should also offer the option of a one-on-onemeeting with a counselor during clinic visits. tIntegrating hivPrevention into Adherence Support Programs. Early artinitiatives in developing countries have incorporated strategies to help patients adhere totreatment. Adherence support strategies that have been 8* In Uganda, where aggressive plans are underway to extend access to artbeyond the private sector, an alliance of Ugandan and North American physicians andacademic experts is helping the country expand human capacity by training clin-ical staff in the management of hiv/aids, including art. The training curriculum in Uganda now includes sessions specically devoted to hivprevention and the delivery of brief hivprevention messages and counseling in clinical settings. 9used in developing countries include support groups and counseling interventions in Khayelitsha, SouthAfrica, community-based adherence workers (knownas accompagnateurs) in Haiti, and various informa-tional, counseling, and support services in other loca-tions. Because adherence support and hivprevention services both seek to influence individual behavior,adherence programs provide an especially efciententry point for discussion of hivprevention. tAccess to Condoms. Male and female condoms should be readily available in all health care settings, but the\"condom gap\" is substantial. For example, current donor country funding for condoms is sufcient toprovide roughly three condoms per year for every adultmale in sub-Saharan Africa. 30As artattracts many more people to health care settings, clinics provide anoptimal venue to help close the gap in condom access,which in sub-Saharan Africa alone is estimated at 1.9billion condoms annually. 31In addition to increasing the condom supply, distribution problems oftencontribute to condom shortages. As in the case of art, assuring a continuous supply of high-quality condomsis an urgent global necessity. Addressing stock supplyissues for arv scould yield important lessons for condom supplies, as well. Delivering hivPrevention Services in Non- artSites An integrated response to hiv/aids will ensure that prevention and artservices are made available in key health care and social service sites that might be used bypeople with hiv. tPrenatal Clinics and pmtct Programs. Prenatal care clinics are essential venues for delivering preventionservices to women, as they are often the only point ofcontact women in developing countries have with thehealth system. 32Programs that implement measures to prevent mother-to-child hivtransmission ( pmtct ) also offer an ideal venue for delivery of a broad array of hivprevention services. In many respects, pmtct programs are in the vanguard of efforts to integrateprevention and hivtreatment. Recognition of the importance of artfor mothers who test hiv-positive in prenatal settings led to the formation in December2001 of the mtct -Plus initiative. Based at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in NewYork, mtct -Plus seeks to provide lifelong care and art to hiv-affected families in developing countries. The initiative is supporting hivtreatment programs in 12 demonstration sites and providing additional nancingfor planning in 13 other sites, with an initial goal ofenrolling 10,000 people. ttband stdClinics. tband stdclinics constitute critical entry points for hivtreatment and care, as well as forFigure 4. hivprevention should be integrated into each step in the health care process \u2014 especially in settings frequented by people who are at higher risk for hivinfection. Each site should offer prevention counseling, voluntary hivtesting, and appropriate prevention tools, such as condoms. hiv-positive people should be referred to treatment, where prevention counseling specically designed for hiv-positive people should be delivered, and hiv-negative people should continue to receive prevention support and education both within and outside of the health care system.opportunities for hiv prevention in the health care system Health Care Settings hivTreatment Settings Other Settings stdtreatment clinics artdelivery sites Voluntary counseling and testing sites Reproductive and family Treatment education initiatives plwha support programs planning clinics tbclinics Treatment adherence programs Substance abuse clinicsPrevention of mother-to-child transmission centers Prenatal settingsAlthough artprograms are in their early stages in devel- oping countries, there are several examples of efforts bycountries to simultaneously scale up prevention and treat-ment, and some pilot projects are specically exploringstrategies to integrate hivprevention in artsettings. Brazil: Expanded Access to Prevention and hivTreatment The response to hiv/aids in Brazil predated the emergence of combination artin the mid-1990s. Early responses to the epidemic \u2014 facilitated by strong community activismand nancial support from the World Bank \u2014 includedpublic aids awareness efforts, initiatives to ensure the safety of national blood supplies, and provision of aztto hiv-positive patients through the public sector. Brazil has also prioritized research on new prevention technologies,beginning with the initiation of a National aids Vacc ine Task Force in 1992. Distribution of artthrough the public sector began in 1996 in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janiero and was thenextended nationwide. Since 1996, more than 141,000people have received artthrough the public sector in Brazil. Nationwide access to arthas enabled the country to avert an estimated 58,000 new aids cases and an esti- mated 90,000 deaths, reduce hiv-related hospitalizations seven-fold, and realize net savings of $2.2 billion. 33 Brazil's artprogram beneted from the national capacityto manufacture high-quality, lower-cost generic equivalents of antiretroviral drugs. The advent of artin Brazil also produced extraordinary changes in the public response to the epidemic. In the rstyear of the country's artprogram, the number of people entering the hiv/aids care system rose by 30%. aids activism and public awareness of the epidemic have signicantly strengthened since artwas introduced. 34 Brazil has coupled its artprogram with energetic prevention efforts, including a major nationwide testinginitiative called \"Be Aware\" to identify approximately376,000 people who are estimated to be infected with hiv, but are unaware of their infection. The result has been a simultaneous increase in use of artand voluntary counseling and testing (see Figure 5). Between 1994 and2000, the country also initiated dozens of needle exchangeprojects, which resulted in steep declines in hivincidence among injection drug users. Between 1996 and 2000, asthe country aggressively promoted condoms, sales ofcondoms increased by 57%. 35 South Africa: An Integrated Response by the Private Sector A promising South Africa-based program is in the early launching stage. South Africa's national hivprevention program for youth \u2014 loveLife \u2014 supports development of hivservice delivery in government clinics around the country. In partnership with the SouthAfrican mining company Anglo American,loveLife is working to integrate preventionand hivtreatment programs in communi- ties where Anglo American has its mainoperations. Anglo American was an early leader among large South African employers tocommit to providing artto its workers. The partnership with loveLife will extend thebenets of Anglo's treatment program to thefamilies of its employees and communitiesin which it operates. This program willestablish comprehensive hiv/aids services, including artmanagement, in government clinics in the target sites within the contextof an intensive ongoing hiveducation and prevention effort. 10early experience with coordinated prevention and treatment programs yearnumber of patients on art number of hiv tests 01,000,0002,000,0003,000,0004,000,0005,000,000 030,00060,00090,000120,000150,000 1997* 1998* 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003Simultaneous Increase in Use of art andvctin Brazil, 1997-2003 * Data on hivtests not available Source: Ministry of Health, Brazil Figure 511South Africa: Incorporating Prevention in Treatment Settings In the Khayelitsha township near Cape Town, South Africa, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res ( msf) provides hiv/aids medical services in a primary care setting. The msf project relies on generic medications and seeks to integrate hiv, tb,and std treatment services. The program includes standardizedregimens, laboratory monitoring, and patient-centeredadherence support strategies. Prevention programs in theKhayelitsha project offer group services on risk reductioncounseling and disclosure of hivstatus to partners. The Khayelitsha project provides arv sto more than 400 patients. Median weight gain at six months is 8.8 kg,and at 12 months there is an 83% survival rate and a 70%reduction in opportunistic infections. Adherence rates areas high as those reported in developed countries, and 91%of patients have undetectable viral loads at six months. There is early evidence that the Khayelitsha project may be influencing public attitudes in ways that support hiv prevention. Surveys of South African commuters at ninedifferent sites found that residents of Khayelitsha hadgreater awareness of hiv, more positive feelings toward voluntary hivtesting, and higher rates of condom use. msf, working in partnership with provincial health authorities and theNelson Mandela Foundation, hasrecently expanded its hivtreatment activities in South Africa to rural public health clinics sitesin the Eastern Cape Province. South Africa's national hiv prevention program for youth, loveLife, is working in thesame clinics in an effort to ensure ongoing integration ofprevention services. Haiti: Integrating Prevention and hiv Treatment Partners in Health has long administered a rural health program in Haiti that has delivered directly observed tb therapy. In 1998, the program began extending this modelto hiv/aids , providing combination artfree of charge. The Haiti project relies primarily on community-based care that is closely monitored by outreach workers knownas accompagnateurs. In addition to observing patients taketheir therapy, accompagnateurs provide practical and socialsupport to individuals enrolled in the program. They receiveextensive training on tband hiv, including medications and their side effects, condentiality, referral systems, andstrategies for promoting adherence. Given the many socialand economic challenges confronted by individuals in ruralHaiti, both clinical and non-clinical staff participate inaddressing non-medical impediments to adherence andhealth promotion.A key feature of the Haiti program is its incorporation of hivprevention interventions, many of them led by people with hivthemselves. Patients are routinely counseled to avoid risky behaviors. 36 Results of the program have been encouraging. The Partners in Health program is currently following morethan 3,000 patients living with hiv/aids and providing arv s(through directly observed therapy) to more than 400 patients. Eighty-six percent of patients on arvshave suppressed viral loads, all have experienced weight gainand other improvements in health, and fewer than 10%have required medication changes due to side effects.This model is now being expanded in other parts ofcentral Haiti and in certain urban areas. Botswana: Simultaneous Scale-Up of Prevention and art Botswana was the rst African country to initiate a compre- hensive response to the epidemic that includes both accessto artand strengthened hivprevention efforts. Partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The MerckCompany Foundation/Merck Co., Inc., the government of Botswana introduced artin four clinics in 2002. As of April 2004, the artcomponent of Botswana's comprehensive program,known as masa , was providing art to approximately 14,000 patients. artaccess is one component of a comprehensive plan set forth in Botswana's national hiv/aids strategy. In late 2003, Botswana decided to routinely offer vctin medical settings. The country is installing 10,500 condom vendingmachines in diverse settings and supporting these withsocial marketing campaigns. Having installed video equipment in all the country's schools, Botswana istraining teachers to play a role in delivering hivprevention messages to young people. The government is conductinga series of trainings over three years to enhance the abilityof diverse communities and stakeholders to develop and deliver prevention interventions that are tailored tolocal needs and circumstances. Botswana is alsoenhancing support programs for children orphaned byaids , providing funding to organizations of people living with hiv/aids , educating its citizens about hiv/aids and available treatments, and making an offer of hivtesting and counseling routine in medical settings. All materials and standard presentations on hiv/aids, including those specically targeted to hiv-positive people, emphasize the importance of hivprevention and provide information on correct and consistent condom use. In 2004,Botswana will increasingly focus on strategies to enhancethe integration of prevention and treatment components.The Khayelitsha project in South Africa has successfully provided hivtreatment while increasing condom use in the community.enhanced prevention programming for people at increased risk of acquiring hiv. tb is the leading cause of death for people with hiv, underscoring the neces- sity of close linkages between tband hiv/aids clinical services.37Likewise, as untreated stdssignicantly increase the risk of hivtransmission, stdservice settings are ideally positioned to provide hivtesting and to deliver hivprevention interventions. tFamily Planning and Reproductive Health Services. Family planning and reproductive health services function as a key entry point for hiv-infected and at- risk women, providing voluntary hiv counseling and testing, stdscreening and treatment, and information to permit hiv-positive and hiv-negative women to make informed reproductive health decisions.38These settings serve as potentially critical venues for thedelivery of enhanced hivprevention services and linkage to art. Promoting artin hivPrevention Settings Not only is hivprevention critical to reducing the number of people who will ever need artand thus helping to preserve the nancial and logistical feasibilityof hivtreatment programs, but prevention programs also have a vital role to play in the promotion and deliveryof art. thivPrevention Outreach and Education. Prevention workers should actively promote knowledge ofserostatus; educate communities about artavailability, benets, and limitations; and facilitate linkages to care. tHarm Reduction Programs. Harm reduction programs offer an ideal venue for delivery of artand other hiv- related medical services. This is especially important inthe many countries where idu sexperience over- whelming barriers to care. Coordinated Planning to Promote an Integrated Approach In developed countries, bureaucratic structures have often separated hiv prevention and treatment programs. In practice, this resulted in prevention programs thatfocused on hiv-negative individuals and care settings that provided few, if any, prevention services for hiv-posi- tive people. As the expansion of artaccess in developing countries gets underway, the global community has anopportunity to do things differently and ensuremaximum synergy between prevention and treatment. A potentially ideal vehicle for promoting careful integrationof prevention and hivtreatment at the country level is the Global Fund, which already mandates that all fundingproposals be developed by Country Coordinating Mecha-nisms. Similarly, the World Bank Multicountry aids Program, which has pioneered new ways of channelinghiv-related funds to affected communities, offers another important avenue for the integration of prevention andtreatment services. hiv prevention for people living with hiv Because so few people in developing countries are aware of their hivstatus, prevention programs have often relied on general messages that implicitly assumethat all individuals are in the same situation. Thisapproach has sometimes limited the effectiveness andsophistication of hivprevention strategies. Every new hivinfection through sexual behavior or injecting drug use requires the participation of one indi-vidual who is hiv-positive and one who is hiv-negative. In addition, hiv-positive people can be reinfected with another strain of hiv, and emerging evidence suggests that reinfection may accelerate the progression of hiv disease. 39To maximize the likelihood of success, preven- tion strategies should influence the behaviors of eachpartner. However, individual needs, perspectives, and riskreduction challenges can differ substantially dependingon hivstatus. As more people become aware of their hivstatus as artaccess expands, prevention programs will need to craft carefully tailored strategies that are optimally effective for different audiences. Although a positive test result typically prompts hiv-positive people to avoid transmitting hivto others, evidence in developed countries indicates that a notableshare of people with hivinfection have difculty imple- menting and/or sustaining safer behavior. 40Historically, in both developing and industrialized countries, hiv prevention strategies have almost exclusively targetedindividuals who are uninfected or untested. 41 In recent years, experts have recommended the development and implementation of community-basedprevention services that are specically targeted to peoplewith hiv/aids. 42The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( cdc), for example, allocated $35 million in fy2003 to program models that address hivprevention in the context of artaccess. Specically, cdcis supporting a 1213While greater artaccess will generally afford new opportu- nities to strengthen hivprevention, certain key populations will not necessarily benet from integrating preventionprograms into health care settings, including those who donot regularly use health care or experience special barriersto access. Making the integration of prevention and healthcare services meaningful for certain populations will requireadditional funding, policy reforms, and outreach. tYoung People. Although young people account for one-half or more all new hiv infections, they typically enter hiv/aids care systems many years after infection, when theyare adults. In addition, young people generally have limitedhealth care options. Even when youth-oriented hiv-specic health services are available, hivstigma often discourages young people from seeking care. South Africa's Adolescent-Friendly Clinic Initiative, a part- nership between the national loveLife program and theSouth African health ministry, offers a potentially usefulstrategy for overcoming historic impediments to care foryoung people and for integrating hivprevention into artsettings. The initiative, supported in large part by nancing from the Global Fund, is establishing compre-hensive youth-friendly hivservices, including treatment monitoring, in public clinics throughout the country. Toencourage young people to frequent the clinics, loveLifemaintains outreach, youth activities, and educationalprograms in the surrounding communities and clinics.loveLife-trained peer educators, based in the clinics,provide clinic attendees with hivprevention information and counseling. t Women. Women represent about 50% of all people living with hiv, including 58% in sub- Saharan Africa. Infection rates are especially highamong teenage girls due to numerous factors, includinggreater physical susceptibility to infection and the highprevalence of sex with older men, who are more likely thanyounger men to be hiv-infected. The above-noted strate- gies to increase health service utilization for young peoplewill help draw young girls into care, where they can receiveboth medical and hivprevention services. In addition, programs must acknowledge the multiple social, legal, and economic disadvantages that womenconfront. Health services must address access barriersfaced by many women, including lack of transportation,lack of child care, and limited options for women-orientedcare. 43hivtreatment and prevention programs should provide guarantees of privacy and condentiality, andcounseling, referrals, and follow-up about the risk of aban-donment or violence after disclosing their hivstatus, including links to safe shelters for women. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric aids Foundation ( egpaf) reports that participation in its pmtct clinics has increased, due in part to concerted efforts to make clinic attendancemore attractive to women. Where transportation, child care,and other support services are provided, women oftencome to view the clinic as a refuge from the day-to-day pres-sures associated with caregiving. Several egpaf sites now participate in the mtct -Plus initiative, which offers hiv- infected women access to artand primary care. Safer sex counseling is integrated in all egpaf sites. t Injecting Drug Users. Worldwide, idusaccount for approximately 10% of all hivinfections.44In many parts of the world, injecting drug use is driving the epidemic,with idu srepresenting the largest share of cases.45 Due to longstanding barriers to health care access experienced by injection drug users,46bringing prevention to traditional clinical settings may not sufce to producean integrated public health strategy. In the case of idu s, it may be more feasible to bring artto more accessible and client-centered harm reduction programs that are currentlyproviding essential hivprevention services, such as syringe and needle programs, drug substitution therapy,and mobile van programs. Integration of prevention and treatment in harm reduction settings will require substantially greater supportfor harm reduction programs. In the Russian Federation,for example, existing harm reduction services are able toreach only about 3-5% of those in need. 47In Russia and several other countries in Central Asia and Eastern Europe,legal reform is also needed to eliminate harassment ofharm reduction programs and to legalize methadonemaintenance or other drug substitution therapy. 48unique needs of key populationsseries of U.S.-based demonstration projects to evaluate and compare various approaches to \"prevention for positives.\"49 Prevention programs targeted to hiv-positive people must, for example, underscore that transmission is still possible, evenwhen a person is on art.It is critical that research be under- taken to determine the most effective messages to influencethe risk behavior of hiv-positive people. artwill help many people with hivrecover sexual desire that had been lost due toillness. Prevention programs forpeople with hivmust acknowl- edge the natural desire toengage in sexual activity, andprovide indivi dually tailored support to facilitate safer sexual choices. 50 Organizations of people living with hivare often ideally positioned to deliver hivprevention services. In Thailand, national efforts to expand access to arthave enlisted hiv-positive patients on therapy to help convince the public that hivtherapy works. Botswana's national aids program provides nancial support to organizations of people with hiv, enabling them to build capacity to increase understanding of the benets and limitations ofart, and provide education and counseling on living with hiv/aids. hiv prevention for people who are uninfected oruntested While greater artaccess will have the most obvious impact on people livingwith hiv, it may also alter the perspec- tives of people who are uninfected oruntested. As fewer people become illand fewer die, the disease may cometo seem less threatening. Individualswho have taken steps to reduce theirrisk due to fear of contracting hiv may over time relax their guardagainst infection. As artaccess expands, prevention programs will need to anticipate suchpotential behavioral shifts by helpingpeople understand both the benetsand limitations of current therapies. Inparticular, common ground must befound between the need to stress the potential benets of artand the prevention imperative of emphasizing that hivinfection, a preventable and incurable condition, should be avoided. Key to striking a reasonable balance between these competing interests is the development of meaningful\"treatment literacy\" in developing countries. 51Improving community-based treatment awareness will help people understand hivtreatment options, assist in the de-stigma-tization of the disease, enable the broader public to makeinformed decisions on the risks and benets of relevant behaviors, and help individ- uals understand that people on artare still infectious. Botswana's national artprogram \u2014 entitled masa , which means \"hope\" in the local language \u2014 couples theuse of hope in its public messages with extensive educa-tion regarding the benets and limitations of therapies.To ensure that its emphasis on hope does not lull people into a sense of complacency, Botswana subjected itsprogram logo and materials to pre-testing by experts atthe University of Botswana. Adopting a \"train-the-trainer\"model, Botswana has trained 60 full-time treatmenteducators to present information on hivtreatments in workplaces, churches, schools, and other communitygathering places. In this hivtreatment education initiative, Botswana balances the positive news about artwith information about the limitations of current drugs. Botswana'sprogram, for example, strongly emphasizes that artis not a cure for hiv/aids. Educational sessions inform participants of theside effects of artand note that people infected with the virus areencouraged to stay off artuntil such drugs are medically indicated. Allpresentations and materials producedin connection with Botswana's treat-ment literacy initiatives emphasizecondom use and provide instructionson how to use condoms correctly. As artaccess expands, timely information on the behavioralimpact of artwill be critical to effective prevention planning.Research will also be needed to identify effective preventionmessages and program models in an era of more widespread access to art. 14 This poster from Botswana's masa hiv treatment program is part of a campaign to educate the public about the benets and limitations of hivtherapy.NOTAs fewer people become ill and fewer die, aids may come to seem less threatening and risk behavior could increase. 15funding a comprehensiveresponse Although funding for hiv/aids programs has increased in recentyears, it remains far short of what is needed for an effective responseto the global epidemic. unaids estimates that funding for hiv- related interventions at the countrylevel totaled $4.7 billion in 2003 \u2014less than one-half of amountsneeded by 2005 ($10.5 billion) andunder one-third of what will berequired by 2007 ($15 billion). 52 Separate estimates by who /unaids project that $5.5 billion will beneeded over the 2004-2005 periodto ensure 3 million people on artin high-priority countries. Funding for research into newprevention technologies should also increase substantiallyto $1 billion annually for hivvaccines and $300 million annually for microbicides by 2007. Resources shouldalso increase for research into other prevention tech- niques such as female condoms, circumcision, treatmentof viral std s, and oral chemoprophylaxis. As a result of under-nancing, prevention programs currently reach fewer than one in ve of people at highrisk of infection, and only 7% of people in low- andmiddle-income countries who need arthave access to the regimens. Only 5% of pregnant women received services in 2001 to prevent mother-to-child transmission;12% of individuals who wanted to be tested for hivhad access to testing and counseling services; and 19% ofinjecting drug users could obtain harm reduction services. Globally, fewer than one in four people worldwide hadaccess in 2001 to basic aids education, and only 42% of people who wanted to use a condom during sex couldobtain one. The costs of integrating prevention into hivtreatment settings may be relatively small. The cost of failing tointegrate prevention and treatment services, however, will be signicant since the number of new infectionswill continue to grow, with a resulting need to continuallyexpand hivtreatment services. Due to dramatic under- funding of hiv/aids programs of all kinds, however, integrated programs will reach few who need themunless the entire response to the epidemic is brought to scale. To capitalize on the momentous opportunityafforded by artaccess to produce durable progressagainst the epidemic, funding for both prevention and treatment programs must simultaneously increase. Unfortunately, the experience in developed countries, where artscale-up began in the mid-1990s, suggests that commitment to prevention sometimes wanes whennew treatments emerge. In the U.S., for example, publicsector expenditures for hivtreatment and research are substantially higher than those devoted to preventionactivities. In recent years, public spending on hivpreven- tion has grown at a notably slower pace than other formsof hiv-related programming (e.g., care and treatment, housing, and research). 53 In addition to inadequate funding, a major barrier to rapid expansion of prevention and hivtreatment programs is the frequent lack of national capacity toabsorb substantial new funding. To make fundingincreases meaningful, donors, technical agencies,national governments, and other stakeholders must alsosignicantly strengthen efforts to expand sustainablenational capacity. 2007 Prevention Needs$6.6 2007 Care and Support Needs$8.5 2005 Prevention Needs$5.7 2005 Care and Support Needs$5.5billions (u.s. $) 0246810 $1.6 2002 Care and Support Spending$1.9 2002 Prevention SpendingGlobal hiv/aids Resource Needs Figure 6 Source: unaids; Working Group analysis16When artrst emerged in the mid-1990s, wealthy coun- tries rapidly brought treatment programs to scale, ensuringuniversal access to these new therapies. artaccess, for example, produced dramatic public health results. In theU.S., hiv-related mortality declined by 66% between 1995 and 2002. 54 As artprograms were expanded in industrialized countries, however, prevention messages often continuedto be the same ones used in the pre- artera. As artdrew patients to health care settings, hiv prevention interventions were not incorporated in clinicalpractice. Surveys have repeatedly found that hivhealth care providers in the U.S. seldom inquire about sexual riskbehavior or provide related counseling. 55 In the treatment era, risk behaviors have increased in industrialized countries. Especially among men who havesex with men ( msm ), substantial evidence has emerged of an overall increase in risk behavior in recent years. 56 Outbreaks of syphilis and gonorrhea among msm illustrate the increased level of risk behavior in many industrializedcountries. 57Several studies have linked these increases in risk behavior to the growing perception among many msm that the advent of arthas made hiv/aids less threat- ening,58particularly as hiv-related mortality has declined. Recently, evidence indicates that this phenomenon is beginning to affect the trajectory of the hiv/aids epidemic in some industrialized countries. In the United Kingdom, where studies have documented recent increases in sexual risk behavior, nearly twice asmany people were diagnosed with hivin 2002 as in 1998. For the European Union as a whole, the annual number of new hivdiagnoses increased notably between 2000 and 2002 among all major population groupsexcept injecting drug users, with especiallysignicant increases among heterosexuals(excluding cases among immigrants from countries with generalized hiv/aids epidemics). 59The rate of new hiv diagnoses is also on the rise in Canada,with notable increases among msm. 60 In Australia, the annual number of new hiv diagnoses increased by 23% between 1998and 2002, with a growing share of newdiagnoses representing recent infection. 61 Likewise, in the U.S., the overall increase in risk behavior appears to haveoverwhelmed the benecial prevention effects of wide- spread artutilization.62In the 29 U.S. states that had hiv infection reporting systems in place by 1999, the numberof hivdiagnoses among msm signicantly increased between 1999-2002. 63Analysis of available data has led cdc to conclude that these trends in new diagnoses likely reflect an actual increase in new infections (as opposed,for example, to increased utilization of testing servicesand knowledge of hivstatus). 64 In response to these emerging trends, public health agencies in industrialized countries are now activelyworking to update prevention strategies to ensure theireffectiveness in the treatment era. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently issued recommen-dations for incorporating hivprevention services in hiv- related medical care settings. 65In 2003, cdc announced a new national hivprevention strategy with an emphasis on prevention/treatment integration; key componentsinclude promoting hivtesting and counseling, imple- menting prevention programs specically targeted topeople living with hiv, and strengthening national efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission. As hivtreatment expands in developing countries, the global community should learn from the experience of industrialized countries. As artaccess is expanded, prevention services must be brought to scale as well.Prevention programs should be integrated in all healthcare settings, and prevention strategies should be revisedto meet the differing needs of hiv-positive and hiv- negative people. 6000 50004000300020001000 0 1999 2000 2001 2002EAPC* = 4.8White HispanicBlack Asian/Pacific Islander American Indian/ Alaska NativeEAPC = 4.3 EAPC = 10.7 year of diagnosisnumberIncrease in Infections Among Men Who Have Sex with Men, United States, 1999-2002 *Estimated annual percentage change Figure 7 Source: cdcindustrialized countries: a cautionary taleo capture the many opportunities to expand hivprevention as access to artincreases and signicantly reduce hivincidence over the coming years, the Working Group makes the following recommendations and urges their rapid implementation: 1. INTEGRATE HIV PREVENTION ANDTREATMENT Access to voluntary counseling and testing programs should be signicantly expanded. tIn Areas Where artAccess Exists, Voluntary hiv Counseling and Testing Should Be Universally Offered in Diverse Health Care Settings. Where artaccess is available, providers should always offer voluntary hiv counseling and testing in a broad range of health caresettings, including hospitals, pmtct programs, family planning and reproductive health clinics, stdand tb clinics, blood donation sites, and in mobile healthprograms in rural areas. 66Testing should in all cases remain condential and voluntary, and clients shouldhave the right to opt out of testing. All blood donationsshould be screened for hivand other bloodborne diseases. tFunding Should Increase for vct.The vct centers should signicantly increase, and stafng forexisting centers should grow. Testing services should beoffered free of charge, as studies suggest that service feesoften discourage individuals from voluntarily learningtheir hivstatus. 67 tThe Importance of Knowing hivStatus Should be Effectively Marketed. State-of-the-art social marketing techniques should be used to promote knowledge of hivstatus and address attitudinal barriers to voluntary testing. Social marketing has effectively been employedto promote condom use, 68and early experience in devel-oping countries suggests that social marketing may be successful, as well, in promoting use of hivtesting and counseling services.69 tExpand Use of Rapid Testing Technologies. Rapid testing technologies are ideal for widespread use inresource-limited settings, as they are relatively inexpen-sive, 70are extremely accurate,71and do not require highly trained laboratory technicians.72Rapid testing enables individuals to receive test results in a matter of minutesrather than waiting for hours or even days. Rapid testingalso permits vctto be delivered in a wide range of non-clinical sites, including churches and mosques,workplaces and community centers. tExpand Access to Post-Test Services. vctsites, community groups, and hivclinics should offer a variety of post-test services. Post-test services can provide vitalhivprevention information to people who have just tested positive, help hiv-positive individuals cope with their diagnosis, link individuals to art, help individuals prevent transmission to their partners, and provideavenues for people living with hiv/aids to develop communications and advocacy networks. All health care settings, including hiv treatment sites, should deliver hiv prevention services. tDeliver hivPrevention Services in hiv/aids Clinical Settings. Training in delivering brief hivprevention interventions should be included in art-related training protocols. Both clinical and non-clinical staff in healthcare settings should receive training, as all will need tocontribute to the delivery of hivprevention messages. Staff should also receive training in proper infectioncontrol procedures. Clinic appointments should be struc-tured to facilitate the delivery of prevention interventions.Male and female condoms should be readily available in all health care settings. As new technologies emerge, suchas vaccines or microbicides, health systems will need toadapt to quickly integrate these new prevention tools.RECOMMENDATIONS 1718tIntegrate Prevention and Adherence Support Programs. Clinic-based adherence counselors, leaders of patient supportgroups, and other adherence workers should receive hiv prevention training. Written informational materials onadherence should be supplemented with information onrisk reduction targeted to the needs of people with hiv/aids. tEmphasize Prevention and artin Prenatal Settings and in Programs to Prevent Mother-to-Child Transmis-sion ( pmtct ).Early experience in the pmtct eld conrms that access to art can facilitate hivprevention . In the six Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric aids Foundation sites that have initiated artprograms through mtct -Plus, demand for testing and counseling has signicantlyincreased, and community attitudes toward hiv/aids have rapidly begun to change. tProvide Prevention and hivTreatment in stdand tb Clinics. Training should be provided to personnel in stdand tbclinics to enable them to deliver brief hiv prevention interventions. In addition, training shouldequip personnel in stdand tbclinics to make timely referrals for hivprevention services and hiv/aids clinical care. tIntegrate Prevention in Family Planning and Reproductive Health Services. Because family planning and reproductive health services function as a key entrypoint for hiv-infected and at-risk women, hivprevention training should be provided to reproductive healthpersonnel. tParticular Efforts for Women. Issues affecting hiv treatment and prevention access for women should becomprehensively addressed, ranging from cost of hiv treatment, transportation, and child care, to sufcientnumbers of women health workers, and guarantees ofprivacy and condentiality. artand prevention programs should provide women with counseling, referrals, andfollow-up about the risk of abandonment or violence after disclosing their hivstatus, including links to safe shelters for women. artshould be promoted and/or delivered in the context of prevention services. tPromote artThrough Prevention Programs. Prevention outreach and educational efforts should promote knowledge of hivstatus, educate people at risk abouthiv/aids treatments, and facilitate linkage to care and treatment services. tIntegrate Prevention and hivTreatment in Harm Reduction Settings. hiv/aids prevention and medical services \u2014 including access to art, screening and treatment for tband stds, prevention interventions, and drug treatment \u2014 should be integrated into harmreduction programs for injecting drug users. Funding forharm reduction programs should signicantly increase,and laws should be revised, where needed, to legalizemethadone maintenance and needle syringe programmingand address other ofcial impediments to harm reduction. Donors and national programs should prioritize integration of prevention and artservices. tAll artInitiatives Should Establish Policies to Promote Integrated Services. In cooperation with national govern- ments, donors should prioritize community-based strategies for the delivery of integrated artand prevention programs. The Global Fund and the World Bank shouldprioritize funding for country proposals on hiv/aids that integrate prevention and art. who should ensure that 3 by 5 Initiative staff receive training on hivprevention as part of training and technical assistance activities. In theirassistance to countries in developing proposals for theGlobal Fund, unaids and who should emphasize the importance of integrating prevention services in hiv treatment settings. All bilateral funding sources shouldpromote integration of prevention services in artsettings; for example, the U.S. government should ensure that allprograms funded through the President's Emergency Plan for aids Relief ( pepfar) integrate science-based hiv prevention in the delivery of hivtreatment. Countries should revise their aids strategic plans to prioritize integration of hivprevention in artsettings. tDonors Should Require That Reports of Country Activities Specify How Prevention and hivTreatment are Being Integrated. Bilateral programs such as the U.S. pepfar initiative should require programs that receive funding to provide documentation on provision ofprevention services in treatment settings and on clinicallinkages and coordination with other prevention services. 19Research efforts should be strengthened and expanded to help inform the scaling-upof an integrated response to hiv/aids. tSupport Research on Integration. Donors and research agencies should collaborate on research to identify themost effective strategies to integrate prevention and art programs, and to promote testing and counseling services. tResearch Results Must Be Disseminated Rapidly. who and unaids should develop communications mechanisms to facilitate rapid delivery of research ndings to the eld.Bilateral and international technical agencies should beprepared to assist national governments in integrating newresearch ndings into national policies and programs. 2.DELIVER PREVENTION FOR HIV-POSITIVE PEOPLE tNew Prevention Programs Tailored to the Needs of People Living with hivShould Be Developed and Implemented. \"Prevention for positives\" should include counseling regarding personal disclosure of hivstatus, information on the ability of individuals to transmit hiveven while on art, assistance in identifying and addressing impediments to safer behavior, and promo-tion of accessible stdscreening. Programs should acknowledge the natural desire of many people with hiv to be sexually active, and provide individually tailoredsupport to facilitate safer sexual choices. tAll Countries Should Include the Delivery of Prevention Services for People with hivin their National aids Plans. Programs to address the unique hivpreven- tion needs of people living with hivshould be an integral part of each country's broader strategy to ght hiv/aids. tPrevention Services for People Living with hivMust Be Supported by Strengthened and Sustained Efforts toCombat hiv-related Stigma and Discrimination. In many countries, stigma against people living with hivremains a major deterrent to expanded voluntary hivcounseling and testing and provision of artand prevention services. Anti-stigma campaigns, anti-discrimination protections,and political leadership are all necessary to combat negative social attitudes. tInvolve Organizations of People with hiv. People living with hiv/aids (plwha ) remain a major under- utilized resource in the ght against the global epidemic . Donors should direct signicant nancial support toplwha organizations, and these organizations should be actively engaged in the delivery of hivprevention services to hiv-positive people. tResearch Should Be Urgently Undertaken to Identify Optimal Messages and Strategies for Reaching hiv- Positive People. Best practices must be rapidly and widely disseminated. 3.ADAPT PREVENTION FOR HIV-NEGATIVE PEOPLE tPrevention Strategies for hiv-Negative and Untested People Should Be Revised to Emphasize the Continuing Importance of Risk Reduction. Without further stigma- tizing people living with hiv, prevention programs will need to persuade individuals at risk that hiv/aids remains a serious, incurable disease that should be avoided. tCommunity-Based Prevention and Education Programs Must Help People \u2014 Both Infected and Uninfected \u2014 to Understand the Benets and Limitationsof art. While promoting the benets of art, programs should emphasize that artis not a cure and that patients undergoing treatment could spread the virus to theirpartners. tCapacity to Undertake Behavioral Surveillance and Sentinel Surveillance Must Be Signicantly Expanded to Monitor the Behavioral Impact of art. Surveys should be undertaken to assess any behavioral impact of art. Special studies should be undertaken to monitor new hiv infections in the treatment era. In addition, aggregateinformation from routine voluntary and condential hiv testing should be collected and analyzed on an ongoingbasis from key settings, such as prenatal clinics. tResearch Should Identify Optimal Prevention Messages and Strategies in the Treatment Era. The global community must prioritize research to identify effective messages in this new era and ensure the swift dissemina-tion of best practices to the eld.204.FUND A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE tFunding for hivPrevention and Treatment Programs Should Grow to at Least $10.5 Billion in 2005 and $15Billion in 2007. Even though existing prevention strate- gies could, if adequately funded, prevent 63% of all newinfections projected during this decade, 73hivprevention has yet to attract sufcient donor support. With minimalartcoverage worldwide, funding for hiv-related treat- ment is even more inadequate. unaids estimates that funding for all hiv-related interventions at country-level totaled $4.7 billion in 2003 \u2014 less than one-half ofamounts needed by 2005 ($10.5 billion) and under one-third of what will be required by 2007 ($15 billion). tFunding Initiatives for Prevention and hivTreatment Must Emphasize Both Short- and Long-term Strategies to Build Sustainable Capacity in Countries. Short-term strategies may include intensive training initiatives,preceptorship programs, and virtual networks for consul-tation and learning. Longer-term strategies includesubstantial investments in medical and other education,health care infrastructure, as well as comprehensiveefforts to strengthen key national sectors. tSupport for hivPrevention Research Should Be Substantially Increased. Annual funding for hivvaccine research should double from approximately $520 millionto $570 million today to at least $1 billion in 2007. Annualfunding for microbicide research should increase from lessthan $150 million today to $300 million in 2007. Fundingfor research into other prevention technologies \u2014 such asfemale condoms, diaphragms, circumcision, treatment ofviral std s, and oral chemoprophylaxis \u2014 should increase substantially. In addition, because the infrastructure needsfor conducting hivprevention research in developing countries are similar to the infrastructure needed forongoing primary prevention and artefforts, opportunities to participate in clinical trials of new prevention technolo-gies should be linked with hivtesting, prevention, and treatment services. 21references 1 Holtgrave, Estimation of Annual hiv Trans- mission Rates in the United States, 1978-2000, J Acquir Immune Dec Syndr 2004;35:89-92. 2 See World Health Organization, Coverage of Selected Health Services for hiv/aids Prevention and Care in Less Developed Countries, 2001, 2002. 3 Declaration of Commitment on hiv/aids, \u00b6 55, unanimously adopted by the United NationsGeneral Assembly Special Session on hiv/aids, June 2001. 4 World Health Organization and unaids , Treating 3 Million by 2005: Making It Happen , 2003 (\" who /unaids 3 by 5 Strategy\"). 5 Stover et al., Can we reverse the aids epidemic with an expanded response?, Lancet 2002;360:19- 20. 6 See World Health Organization, Increasing Access to hivTesting and Counseling: Report of a who Consultation, 19-21 November 2002, Geneva, Switzerland , 2002 (\" who Testing Consultation \"). 7 Ibid., Voluntary hiv- 1Counseling and Testing Efcacy Study Group, 2000.
