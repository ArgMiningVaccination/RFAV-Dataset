We discuss the recent publication of a paper describing how relativistic time dilation at the DNA level can lead to novel approaches in disease prevention and cure, and we elaborate on the role of the human microbiota in restoring quantum entanglement at the DNA level. According to this hypothesis, microbial degradation of a glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, leads to restauration of gene expression, induces general and sequence-specific relativistic time dilation, restores DNA quantum entanglement, and improves the ability of DNA to retain, process and transmit information both at the biochemical and the quantum levels. It can be argued that these processes played a role in the evolution of the human brain and consciousness. Fermented aliments that today would be defined as \"probiotics\" were the first processed foods eaten by early humans, and it is conceivable that the effects of the microbes in those aliments on the chondroitin sulfate, coming from cartilage of animals hunted or scavenged, may have led to the biochemical, relativistic and quantum effects responsible for human evolution. Finally, we discuss the implications in the field of autism where the theory of consciousness based on quantum biology presents exciting and innovative perspectives for prevention and cure.
