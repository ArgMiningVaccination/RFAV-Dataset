I'm an Elite Fear Free Certified veterinarian that practices 'lifestyle Medicine' as opposed to 'cookie cutter' style. Not every patient needs everything and not every patient needs the same.

Not every patient needs everything and not every patient needs the same. General practice has become the fast paced race against the clock today. Many of the patients I have seen over the years would have greatly benefitted from that extra 'floor time' with me or the owners that extra time for 'question answer time'. Being under the pressure of general practice; my patients and owners were underserved....this was my pivoting point. I realized I walked into this life of treating animals and educating their human counterparts to better their lives and improve their quality of it together. I was not able to achieve this in a general \" Western\" medicine setting. My appointments are based on my patients needs and how we can achieve them together as a whole; owner, patient and doctor together. Having a strong healthcare team with an owner that is educated about their pets specific situation by involving that owner will benefit not only the patient but the bond between them. This allows for a more complete approach to our pet's lives and overall wellbeing. Striving for not just quantity of life, but quality is key. This is what I promise to strive for everyday for each one of my patients.
