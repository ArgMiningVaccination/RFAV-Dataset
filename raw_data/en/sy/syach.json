Since its inception in 1981, the program has maintained as its objective, the selection and enrollment of students who have demonstrated excellence in academic and leadership per - formance and have strong potential to become leaders on campus and in the community. The scholarship offers four levels of awards. For the students who entered Georgia Tech as freshmen in fall of 2007, the four-year award amounts were: Georgia resident: $80,000 and $40,000. To apply for the President 's Scholarship, a student must submit the Georgia Tech application for admission by October 31 of their senior year. The most qualified applicants in terms of high school grades, standardized test scores, writing ability, and demonstrated leadership and involvement in activities are selected as scholarship semifinalists. Each semifinalist is sent a supplemental application in December and interviewed by a Regional Committee in January. Approximately 100 of the top-ranked candidates in the competition are invited as finalists to attend the President 's Scholarship Weekend on campus in the spring. HOPE -- Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally -- is Georgia's unique program, created by Governor Zell Miller, that rewards students' hard work with financial assistance in degree, diploma, or certificate programs at any eligible Georgia public or private college, university, or public technical institute. HOPE is funded by Georgia's Lottery for Education.Table 4.8 President's Tech Fact Book All Institutions Public Institutions National Merit Scholars, Fall 2007Table 4.10 National Merit and Achievement Scholars, Fall 2007 Institution RankFreshmen Enrollment# of Scholars% of Class Institution RankFINANCIAL AID # of Scholars National Achievement Scholars, Fall 2007 Source: Office of Undergraduate AdmissionsADMISSIONS AND ENROLLMENT 1.

This unit offers the traditional Cooperative Plan of education as well as Undergraduate Professional Internships, Graduate Co-op Program, and the Work Abroad Program. The Co-op option has been offered to undergraduates since 1912, and is the fourth oldest program of its kind in the world. It is a five-year, totally optional plan for undergraduates who wish to combine career-related experience with classroom studies. Students who enroll in this program alternate between industrial assignments and classroom studies on a semester basis, taking the same course work on the campus that is completed by regular students. Graduates of the program are awarded a degree in their field with the designation \"Coop - erative Plan.\" The Co-op Program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education, and for six consecutive years has been listed as one of the top 10 \"Programs that Work\" by U.S. News & World Report . Students who participate in Undergraduate Co-op have the opportunity to develop career interests, become more confident in their career choices, and develop human relation skills through their work experiences. Since all Co-op positions are paid, students are able to save a portion of their salaries to apply toward educational expenses. Approximately 600 employers participate throughout the U.S. and internation - ally. With average starting salaries over $14 per hour for undergraduate students, the aggregate amount earned last year by all undergraduate co-ops was about $18 million. The Undergraduate Professional Internship (UPI) program had its first students participating in the Spring Semester 2003. This program is geared toward those students who, for some reason could not or did not participate in Co-op, but desire some career-related experience before graduation. Aimed mainly at rising juniors and seniors, hundreds of students have been able to take advantage of the UPI program since its inception. UPI students may work any semester of the year and maintain full-time student status. As part of the International Plan which began at Georgia Tech in 2005, the Work Abroad Program was established to provide students op - portunities to practice their respective professions outside the United States, and be immersed into a different culture. Being able to gain relevant work experience in a totally different environment is extremely rewarding, and can be very challenging. This past year, 46 students worked abroad in 19 different countries on 5 continents. Countries of employment include: Germany, Japan, China, Spain, Singapore, France, and several others. A full-time coordinator and administrative staff are in place to assist students both on the undergraduate and graduate level who are interested in obtaining this type of experience.

Ever since 1892, when the first football team was organized on The Flats, Georgia Tech teams in all sports have represented the Institute in outstanding fashion while producing some of the best-known names in athletics. Dan Radakovich, the current Director of Athletics, oversees teams in 17 sports, and also the following departments: a Total Person pro-gram, compliance, business, development, finance, accounting, ticketing, marketing, sports information and sports medicine. The most important function of Georgia Tech athletics, however, is academic support. The Georgia Tech Athletic Association is a non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the intercollegiate athletic program at Tech. The Athletic Association is overseen by the Georgia Tech Athletic Board, chaired by the president of the Institute, Dr. Wayne Clough, and composed of seven faculty members, three alumni members, and three student members. Radakovich follows in the footsteps of some of the most honored men in college athletics: John Heisman, for whom football's Heisman Trophy is named, William Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Dr. Homer Rice and Dave Braine. Over the past 100 years, Tech has had only 12 head football coaches: John Heisman, Bill Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Bud Carson, Bill Fulcher, Pepper Rodgers, Bill Curry, Bobby Ross, Bill Lewis, George O'Leary, Chan Gailey, and our new head coach, Paul Johnson. Tech has won four National Championships in football in the years 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990. The Yellow Jacket football teams have the nation's best record in bowl games at 22-13. Other major highlights in sports have been two Final Four appearances by the Tech men's basketball team in 1990 and 2004, when the Yellow Jackets reached the NCAA title game, a NWIT women's basketball title in 1992 and a pair of College World Series berths in baseball. The GT Women's Tennis team captured the NCAA Championship, the first title ever won in an NCAA team championship. Some of the most prominent names in Georgia Tech athletic history have been Grand Slam Champion Bobby Jones, former Masters cham- pion Larry Mize, British Open champion David Duval and Stewart Cink in golf, Billy Lothridge, George Morris, Robert Lavette, Maxie Baughan, Marco Coleman, Shawn Jones, Calvin Johnson, and Joe Hamilton, runner -up in the 1999 Heisman T rophy race, in football. Also, four Olympic gold medal winners in track, Antonio McKay, Derek Mills, Derrick Adkins, and Angelo Taylor, as well as three-time NCAA high jump champion and 2004 U.S. Olympian Chaunte Howard in women's track, current Major League stars Mark Texeira, No - mar Garciaparra, Jason Varitek and Kevin Brown in baseball, and Roger Kaiser, Rich Yunkus, Mark Price, John Salley, Kenny Anderson, Stephon and Jarrett Jack in men's basketball. Tech's athletic facilities rank among the finest in college athletics and improvements are on the drawing board. Bobby Dodd Stadium at Grant field, one of America's oldest and most recognized football facilities, was recently renovated and expanded to 55,000 seats. A $9.7 million reconstruction of Russ Chandler Baseball Stadium was completed in less than nine months and opened for the 2002 season. The Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, site of the 1996 Olympic Games, was recently enclosed to provide the Yellow Jackets with one of the nation's top swimming and diving facilities. The facility hosted the 2006 NCAA Championships. The hub of Georgia Tech athletics is the Arthur Edge Athletics Center, which houses administrative and coaching staffs, a dining hall, locker rooms, training and weight facilities and the Andrew Hearn Academic Center. The Homer Rice Center for Sports Performance is the home of the Total Person Program, the best of its kind in the United States. The Center is comprised of seven sports performance and wellness clinics. Georgia Tech teams participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference, generally regarded as one of the finest collegiate conferences in the country. The primary purpose of the Athletic Association is to help each student-athlete grow as a person, develop as an athlete, earn a meaningful degree and become a good citizen.

The mission of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association is to promote and serve our alumni and the Institute. We will continually create relevant and meaningful programs for current and future alumni to foster lifelong participation and philanthropic support. We will communicate the achievements of the Institute, maintain its traditions and engage the campus community. Underlying all that we do is the belief in the value of education, the commitment to integrity and exceptional customer service, and a pledge that we will perform in a fiscally responsible manner. The Association's business can be categorized into four major disciplines: the acquisition and management of information about Tech's alumni and friends, communication to these constituents, engagement of these supporters and fund raising. It is currently organized into five departments: Administration, Communications, Marketing Services, Constituent Services and Fund raising/Business Development. Administration is responsible for accounting, purchasing, finance and budgeting, management of the Association' s extensive database, computing and information services and management of the or ganization's facilities and other assets. Accounting maintains business records, manages investments and cash flows, and produces all financial reports.
