Changes have been made in the content of the book to keep the material as current as possible. Most of these are small changes, such as a new cell organelle, the protea-some, in Chapter 3; a clarication of blood cell production in Chapters 4, 11, and 14;and the addition of concentric and eccentric contractions to Chapter 7. The mostextensive revision is in Chapter 14: The section on immunity has been rewritten usingthe categories of innate and adaptive immunity. New illustrations in this edition include positive and negative feedback mecha- nisms in Chapter 1, cellular transport mechanisms in Chapter 3, hormones that affectblood pressure in Chapter 13, innate immunity in Chapter 14, and synthesis uses offoods in Chapter 17. Illustrations that have been revised include protein structure,active site theory, and DNA and RNA structure in Chapter 2, blood cells in Chapter11, and adaptive immunity in Chapter 14. Also new to this edition are illustration questions. Each gure legend is followed by a question for the student; the answers are in Appendix G. As always, your comments and suggestions will be most welcome, and they may be sent to us in care of the publisher: F . A. Davis Company, 1915 Arch Street,Philadelphia, PA 19103. Valerie C. Scanlon Dobbs Ferry, New York Tina Sanders Castle Creek, New York00Scanlon(p3)-FM 8/17/06 10:40 AM Page vviTo the Instructor A s the science and arts of medicine and health care become increasingly complex, so too does the education of those who pursue careers in nursing and other health-related elds. Human anatomy and physiology is often a rst course in many educa-tion programs, and is the basis for so many of the more specialized courses. T eachersof introductory anatomy and physiology thus take on a special challenge: We mustdistill and express the complexities of human structure and function in a simple way,without losing the essence and meaning of the material. That is the goal of this text-book: to make this material readily accessible to students with diverse backgroundsand varying levels of educational preparation. No prior knowledge of biology or chemistry is assumed, and even the most funda- mental terms are dened thoroughly. Essential aspects of anatomy are presentedclearly and reinforced with excellent illustrations. Essential aspects of physiology arediscussed simply, yet with accuracy and precision. Again, the illustrations complementthe text material and foster comprehension on the part of the student. These illustra-tions were prepared especially for students for whom this is a rst course in anatomyand physiology. As you will see, these are images in which detail is readily apparent.All important parts have been labeled, but the student is not overwhelmed withunnecessary labels. Illustrations of physiology lead the student step-by-step.Wherever appropriate, the legends refer students to the text for further description orexplanation. Each illustration also has a question for the student; the illustration ques-tions in a chapter form an ongoing self-test. (The answers are given in Appendix G.) The text has three unifying themes: the relationship between physiology and anatomy, the interrelations among the organ systems, and the relationship of eachorgan system to homeostasis. Although each type of cell, tissue, organ, or organ sys-tem is discussed simply and thoroughly in itself, applicable connections are made toother aspects of the body or to the functioning of the body as a whole. Our goal is toprovide your students with the essentials of anatomy and physiology, and in doing so,to help give them a solid foundation for their future work, and an appreciation for theincredible living organism that is the human body. The sequence of chapters is a very traditional one. Cross-references are used to remind students of what they have learned from previous chapters. Nevertheless, thetextbook is very flexible, and, following the introductory four chapters, the organ sys-tems may be covered in almost any order, depending on the needs of your course. Each chapter is organized from the simple to the more complex, with the anatomy followed by the physiology. The Instructor's Guide presents modications of the topicsequences that may be used, again depending on the needs of your course. Certainmore advanced topics may be omitted from each chapter without losing the meaningor flow of the rest of the material, and these are indicated, for each chapter, in theInstructor's Guide. Clinical applications are set apart from the text in boxed inserts. These are often aspects of pathophysiology that are related to the normal anatomy or physiology in thetext discussion. Each box presents one particular topic and is referenced at the appro-priate point in the text. This material is intended to be an integral part of the chapter00Scanlon(p3)-FM 8/17/06 10:40 AM Page vibut is set apart for ease of reference and to enable you to include or omit as many of these topics as you wish. The use of these boxes also enables students to read the textmaterial without interruption and then to focus on specic aspects of pathophysiology.A comprehensive list of the boxes appears inside the book's front and back covers, andanother list at the beginning of each chapter cites the boxes within that chapter. T ables are utilized as summaries of structure and function, to present a sequence of events, or additional material that you may choose to include. Each table is referencedin the text and is intended to facilitate your teaching and to help your students learn. New terms appear in bold type within the text, and all such terms are fully dened in an extensive glossary, with phonetic pronunciations. Bold type may also be used foremphasis whenever one of these terms is used again in a later chapter. Each chapter begins with a chapter outline and student objectives to prepare the student for the chapter itself. New terminology and related clinical terms are alsolisted, with phonetic pronunciations. Each of these terms is fully dened in the glos-sary, with cross-references back to the chapter in which the term is introduced. At the end of each chapter are a study outline and review questions. The study out- line includes all of the essentials of the chapter in a concise outline form. The reviewquestions may be assigned as homework, or used by the students as a review or self-test. Following each question is a page reference in parentheses. This reference citesthe page(s) in the chapter on which the content needed to answer the question cor-rectly can be found. The answers themselves are included in the Instructor's Guide.The questions in the sections titled For Further Thought may be used in a variety ofways, and the answers are in the Instructor's Guide. An important supplementary learning tool for your students is available in the form of a Student Workbook that accompanies this text. For each chapter in the textbook, the workbook offers ll-in and matching-column questions, gure-labeling and gure-coloring exercises, and crossword puzzles based on the chapter's vocabulary list. Alsoincluded are two comprehensive, multiple-choice chapter tests to provide a thoroughreview. All answers are provided at the end of the workbook. Ancillary materials for the teacher using this text are all on a CD-ROM: a complete Instructor's Guide, two computerized test banks, and an Image Ancillary presentationof the text illustrations. The Instructor's Guide contains notes on each chapter'sorganization and content (useful for modifying the book to your specic teachingneeds), topics for class discussion, answers to the chapter review questions from thetextbook, and detailed answers to the For Further Thought questions. The multiple-choice test bank contains more than 2600 questions that have been organized inrelation to the chapter review questions, and further explanation may be found in theInstructor's Guide. The ll-in test bank contains more than 2100 questions organizedby textbook chapter. The Image Ancillary presentation contains many of the illustra-tions from the textbook, with suggested points for use in classroom lectures. Suggestions and comments from colleagues are always valuable, and yours would be greatly appreciated. When we took on the task of writing and illustrating this text-book, we wanted to make it the most useful book possible for you and your students.Any suggestions that you can provide to help us achieve that goal are most welcome,and they may be sent to us in care of F . A. Davis Company, 1915 Arch Street,Philadelphia, PA 19103. Valerie C. Scanlon Dobbs Ferry, New York Tina Sanders Castle Creek, New YorkTo the Instructor vii00Scanlon(p3)-FM 8/17/06 10:40 AM Page viiviiiTo the Student This is your textbook for your rst course in human anatomy and physiology, a sub- ject that is both fascinating and rewarding. That you are taking such a course sayssomething about you. You may simply be curious as to how the human body functionsor you may have a personal goal of making a contribution in one of the healthcareprofessions. Whatever your reason, this textbook will help you to be successful in youranatomy and physiology course. The material is presented simply and concisely, yet with accuracy and precision. The writing style is informal yet clear and specic; it is intended to promote yourcomprehension and understanding. ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXTBOOK T o use this textbook effectively, you should know the purpose of its various parts. Eachchapter is organized in the following way: Chapter Outline \u2014This presents the main topics in the chapter, which corre- spond to the major headings in the text. Student Objectives \u2014These summarize what you should know after reading and studying the chapter. These are not questions to be answered, but arerather, with the chapter outline, a preview of the chapter contents. New Terminology and Related Clinical Terminology \u2014These are some of the new terms you will come across in the chapter. Read through these termsbefore you read the chapter, but do not attempt to memorize them just yet.When you have nished the chapter, return to the list and see how manyterms you can dene. Note those you may not be sure of and look them up.All of these terms are fully dened in the glossary. Study Outline \u2014This is found at the end of the chapter. It is a concise summary of the essentials in the chapter. You may nd this outline very useful as a quickreview before an exam. Review Questions \u2014These are also at the end of the chapter. Your instructor may assign some or all of them as homework. If not, the questions may beused as a self-test to evaluate your comprehension of the chapter's content.The page number(s) in parentheses following each question refers you to thepage(s) in the chapter on which the content needed to answer the questioncorrectly can be found. For Further Thought \u2014The heading tells you what these are for: thinking. Your instructor may use these for class discussion, and, if so, please do notever be afraid to be wrong. Being wrong in the classroom is one of the wayseach and every one of us learns. Contribute, raise your hand and speak upwith your best thoughts, and listen to those of others. T ogether you will ndthe answers.00Scanlon(p3)-FM 8/17/06 10:40 AM Page viiiOTHER FEATURES WITHIN EACH CHAPTER Illustrations \u2014These are an essential part of this textbook. Use them. Study them carefully, and they will be of great help to you as you learn. They areintended to help you develop your own mental picture of the body and itsparts and processes. You may not have thought of mental pictures as beingimportant, but they are, and each new one you create is a major step in learn-ing. Each illustration is referenced in the text, so you will know when to con-sult it. With a little concentration, you will have it in your mind for wheneveryou need it. You will see that each illustration also has a question after the leg-end. These questions provide an ongoing quiz; try to answer each one as youcome to it. (Will it matter if you're wrong? No, but answering the questionswill help you to learn.) The answers are given in Appendix G, just before theglossary. Boxes \u2014Discussions of clinical applications are in separate boxes in the text so that you may nd and refer to them easily. Your instructor may include all orsome of these as required reading. If you are planning a career in the healthprofessions, these boxes are an introduction to pathophysiology, and you willnd them interesting and helpful. Bold Type \u2014This is used whenever a new term is introduced, or when an old term is especially important. The terms in bold type are fully dened in theglossary, which includes phonetic pronunciations. Tables \u2014This format is used to present material in a very concise form. Some tables are summaries of text material and are very useful for a quick review.Other tables present additional material that complements the text material. Glossary \u2014Not within the chapters but at the end, the glossary is the diction- ary of the book. All of the terms in bold type, as well as others, are denedhere. Make use of it, rather than wonder what a word means. The sooner youhave a denition rmly in your mind, the sooner it is truly part of yourknowledge. T o make the best use of your study time, a Student Workbook is available that will help you to focus your attention on the essentials in each chapter. Also included arecomprehensive chapter tests to help you determine which topics you have learnedthoroughly and which you may have to review. If your instructor has not made theworkbook a required text, you may wish to ask that it be ordered and made availablein your bookstore. You will nd it very helpful. SOME FINAL WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT Your success in this course depends to a great extent on you. T ry to set aside studytime for yourself every day; a little time each day is usually much more productivethan trying to cram at the last minute. Ask questions of yourself as you are studying. What kinds of questions? The sim- plest ones. If you are studying a part of the body such as an organ, ask yourself: Whatis its name? Where is it? What is it made of? What does it do? That is: name, loca-tion, structure, and function. These are the essentials. If you are studying a process,ask yourself: What is happening here? What is its purpose? That is: What is going on?And what good is it? Again, these are the essentials.To the Student ix00Scanlon(p3)-FM 8/17/06 10:40 AM Page ixWe hope this textbook will contribute to your success.

Have you ever thought of your-self in this way? Probably not, and yet, in the strictlyphysical sense, that is what each of us is. The bodyconsists of trillions of atoms in specic arrangementsand thousands of chemical reactions proceeding ina very orderly manner. That literally describesus, and yet it is clearly not the whole story. The keysto understanding human consciousness and self-awareness are still beyond our grasp. We do not yetknow what enables us to study ourselves\u2014no otheranimals do, as far as we know\u2014but we have accumu-lated a great deal of knowledge about what we aremade of and how it all works. Some of this knowledgemakes up the course you are about to take, a course inbasic human anatomy and physiology. Anatomy is the study of body structure, which includes size, shape, composition, and perhaps evencoloration. Physiology is the study of how the body functions. The physiology of red blood cells, for exam-ple, includes what these cells do, how they do it, andhow this is related to the functioning of the rest of thebody. Physiology is directly related to anatomy. Forexample, red blood cells contain the mineral iron inmolecules of the protein called hemoglobin; this is anaspect of their anatomy. The presence of iron enablesred blood cells to carry oxygen, which is their function.All cells in the body must receive oxygen in order tofunction properly, so the physiology of red blood cellsis essential to the physiology of the body as a whole. Pathophysiology is the study of disorders of func- tioning, and a knowledge of normal physiology makessuch disorders easier to understand. For example, youare probably familiar with the anemia called iron-deciency anemia. With insufficient iron in the diet, there will not be enough iron in the hemoglobin ofred blood cells, and hence less oxygen will be trans-ported throughout the body, resulting in the symp- toms of the iron-deciency disorder. This exampleshows the relationship between anatomy, physiology,and pathophysiology. The purpose of this text is to enable you to gain an understanding of anatomy and physiology withthe emphasis on normal structure and function. Manyexamples of pathophysiology have been included,however, to illustrate the relationship of disease to normal physiology and to describe some of the proce-dures used in the diagnosis of disease. Many of the examples are clinical applications that will help youbegin to apply what you have learned and demonstratethat your knowledge of anatomy and physiology will become the basis for your further study in the healthprofessions. LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION The human body is organized into structural andfunctional levels of increasing complexity. Each higherlevel incorporates the structures and functions of theprevious level, as you will see. We will begin with thesimplest level, which is the chemical level, and pro-ceed to cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. All ofthe levels of organization are depicted in Fig. 1-1. CHEMICALS The chemicals that make up the body may be dividedinto two major categories: inorganic and organic.Inorganic chemicals are usually simple molecules made of one or two elements other than carbon (witha few exceptions). Examples of inorganic chemicals arewater (H 2O); oxygen (O2); one of the exceptions, car- bon dioxide (CO2); and minerals such as iron (Fe), cal- cium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Organic chemicals are often very complex and always contain the elementscarbon and hydrogen. In this category of organicchemicals are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, andnucleic acids. The chemical organization of the bodyis the subject of Chapter 2. CELLS The smallest living units of structure and function arecells . There are many different types of human cells, though they all have certain similarities. Each type ofcell is made of chemicals and carries out specicchemical reactions. Cell structure and function arediscussed in Chapter 3. TISSUES A tissue is a group of cells with similar structure and function. There are four groups of tissues: Epithelial tissues \u2014cover or line body surfaces; some are capable of producing secretions with specicfunctions. The outer layer of the skin and sweatglands are examples of epithelial tissues. Internalepithelial tissues include the walls of capillaries(squamous epithelium) and the kidney tubules(cuboidal epithelium), as shown in Fig. 1-1.4 Organization and General Plan of the Body01Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 41.

The organ system shown here is theurinary system.QUESTION: What other organ system seems to work directly with the urinary system? 501Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 5Connective tissues \u2014connect and support parts of the body; some transport or store materials. Blood,bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue are examples ofthis group. Muscle tissues \u2014specialized for contraction, which brings about movement. Our skeletal muscles andthe heart are examples of muscle tissue. In Fig. 1-1,you see smooth muscle tissue, which is found inorgans such as the urinary bladder and stomach. Nerve tissue \u2014specialized to generate and transmit electrochemical impulses that regulate body func-tions. The brain and optic nerves are examples ofnerve tissue. The types of tissues in these four groups, as well as their specic functions, are the subject of Chapter 4. ORGANS An organ is a group of tissues precisely arranged so as to accomplish specic functions. Examples of organsare the kidneys, individual bones, the liver, lungs,and stomach. The kidneys contain several kinds of epithelial, or surface tissues, for their work of absorp-tion. The stomach is lined with epithelial tissue thatsecretes gastric juice for digestion. Smooth muscletissue in the wall of the stomach contracts to mixfood with gastric juice and propel it to the small intes-tine. Nerve tissue carries impulses that increase ordecrease the contractions of the stomach (see Box 1-1:Replacing Tissues and Organs). ORGAN SYSTEMS An organ system is a group of organs that all con- tribute to a particular function. Examples are the uri-nary system, digestive system, and respiratory system.In Fig. 1-1 you see the urinary system, which consistsof the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.These organs all contribute to the formation andelimination of urine. As a starting point, T able 1-1 lists the organ sys- tems of the human body with their general functions,and some representative organs, and Fig. 1-2 depicts6 Organization and General Plan of the Body BOX1-1 REPLACING TISSUES AND ORGANS eventually be used to cover a large surface. Other cells grown in culture include cartilage, bone, pan-creas, and liver. Much research is being done onliver implants (not transplants), clusters of func-tional liver cells grown in a lab. Such implantswould reduce or eliminate the need for humandonors. Tissue engineering is also being used to cre-ate arteries and urinary bladders. Many articial replacement parts have also been developed. These are made of plastic or metal andare not rejected as foreign by the recipient'simmune system. Damaged heart valves, for exam-ple, may be replaced by articial ones, and sectionsof arteries may be replaced by tubular grafts madeof synthetic materials. Articial joints are availablefor every joint in the body, as is articial bone forreconstructive surgery. Cochlear implants are tinyinstruments that convert sound waves to electricalimpulses the brain can learn to interpret, and haveprovided some sense of hearing for people with cer-tain types of deafness. Work is also progressing onthe use of a featherweight computer chip as an arti-cial retina, on devices that help damaged heartspump blood more efficiently, and on small, self-contained articial hearts.Blood transfusions are probably the most familiar and frequent form of \"replacement parts\" for peo-ple. Blood is a tissue, and when properly typed andcross-matched (blood types will be discussed inChapter 11) may safely be given to someone withthe same or a compatible blood type. Organs, however, are much more complex struc- tures. When a patient receives an organ transplant,there is always the possibility of rejection (destruc-tion) of the organ by the recipient's immune sys-tem (Chapter 14). With the discovery and use ofmore effective immune-suppressing medications,however, the success rate for many types of organtransplants has increased. Organs that may be trans-planted include corneas, kidneys, the heart, theliver, and the lungs. The skin is also an organ, but skin transplanted from another person will not survive very long.Several kinds of articial skin are now available totemporarily cover large areas of damaged skin.Patients with severe burns, for example, will even-tually need skin grafts from their own unburnedskin to form permanent new skin over the burnsites. It is possible to \"grow\" a patient's skin in lab-oratory culture, so that a small patch of skin may01Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 6all of the organ systems. Some organs are part of two organ systems; the pancreas, for example, is both adigestive and an endocrine organ, and the diaphragmis part of both the muscular and respiratory systems.All of the organ systems make up an individual person.The balance of this text discusses each system in moredetail. METABOLISM AND HOMEOSTASIS Metabolism is a collective noun; it is all of the chem- ical reactions and physical processes that take placewithin the body. Metabolism includes growing, repair-ing, reacting, and reproducing\u2014all the characteristicsof life. The pumping of the heart, the digestion of food in the stomach, the diffusion of gases in the lungsand tissues, and the production of energy in each cellof the body are just a few of the thousands of aspectsof metabolism. Metabolism comes from a Greek word meaning \"change,\" and the body is always changing invisible ways (walking down the street), microscopicways (cells dividing in the skin to produce new epider-mis), and submicroscopic or molecular ways (RNAand enzymes constructing new proteins). A relatedconcept, metabolic rate , is most often used to mean the speed at which the body produces energy and heat,or, put another way, energy production per unit oftime, such as 24 hours. Metabolic rate, therefore, isone aspect of metabolism.Organization and General Plan of the Body 7 Table 1-1 THE ORGAN SYSTEMS System Functions Organs* Integumentary Skeletal Muscular Nervous EndocrineCirculatory Lymphatic Respiratory DigestiveUrinaryReproductive *These are simply representative organs, not an all-inclusive list.

(Continued) 901Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 9A person who is in good health may be said to be in a state of homeostasis . Homeostasis reflects the abil- ity of the body to maintain a relatively stable metabo-lism and to function normally despite many constantchanges. The changes that are part of normal metab-olism may be internal or external, and the body mustrespond appropriately. Eating breakfast, for example, brings about an internal change. Suddenly there is food in the stom-ach, and something must be done with it. What hap-pens? The food is digested or broken down intosimple chemicals that the body can use. The protein ina hard-boiled egg is digested into amino acids, its basicchemical building blocks; these amino acids can thenbe used by the cells of the body to produce their ownspecialized proteins. An example of an external change is a rise in envi- ronmental temperature. On a hot day, the body tem-perature would also tend to rise. However, bodytemperature must be kept within its normal range ofabout 97 /H11034to 99 /H11034F (36 /H11034to 38 /H11034C) in order to support normal functioning. What happens? One of the body'sresponses to the external temperature rise is toincrease sweating so that excess body heat can be lost by the evaporation of sweat on the surface of the skin. This response, however, may bring about an undesir-able internal change, dehydration. What happens? Asbody water decreases, we feel the sensation of thirstand drink fluids to replace the water lost in sweating.Notice that when certain body responses occur, theyreverse the event that triggered them. In the preced-ing example a rising body temperature stimulatesincreased sweating, which lowers body temperature,which in turn decreases sweating. Unnecessary sweat-ing that would be wasteful of water is prevented. Thisis an example of a negative feedback mechanism , in which the body's response reverses the stimulus (ineffect, turning it off for a while) and keeps some aspectof the body metabolism within its normal range. Look at Fig. 1-3 for another negative feedback mechanism, one in which the hormone thyroxine reg-ulates the metabolic rate of the body. As metabolicrate decreases, the hypothalamus (part of the brain)and pituitary gland detect this decrease and secretehormones to stimulate the thyroid gland (on the frontof the neck just below the larynx) to secrete the hor-mone thyroxine. Thyroxine stimulates the cellularenzyme systems that produce energy from food, whichincreases the metabolic rate. The rise in energy andheat production is detected by the brain and pituitary gland. They then decrease secretion of their hor-mones, which in turn inhibits any further secretion ofthyroxine until the metabolic rate decreases again.Metabolic rate does rise and fall, but is kept withinnormal limits. You may be wondering if there is such a thing as a positive feedback mechanism. There is, but they arerare in the body and quite different from a negativefeedback mechanism. In a positive feedback mecha- nism , the response to the stimulus does not stop or reverse the stimulus, but instead keeps the sequence ofevents going. A good example is childbirth, in whichthe sequence of events, simply stated, is as follows:Stretching of the uterine cervix stimulates the uterine muscle,which causes more stretching, which stimulates moreoxytocin and, hence, more contractions. The mecha-nism stops with the delivery of the baby and the pla-centa. This is the \"brake,\" the interrupting event. Any positive feedback mechanism requires an external \"brake,\" something to interrupt it. Bloodclotting is such a mechanism, and without external controls, clotting may become a vicious cycle of clot- ting and more clotting, doing far more harm thangood (discussed in Chapter 11). Inflammation follow-ing an injury is benecial and necessary for repair tobegin, but the process may evolve into a cycle of dam-age and more damage. The rise of a fever may alsotrigger a positive feedback mechanism. Notice in Fig.1-3 that bacteria have affected the body's thermostatin the hypothalamus and caused a fever. The risingbody temperature increases the metabolic rate, whichincreases body temperature even more, becoming acycle. Where is the inhibition, the brake? For thisinfection, the brake is white blood cells destroying thebacteria that caused the fever. An interruption fromoutside the cycle is necessary. It is for this reason,because positive feedback mechanisms have the poten-tial to be self-perpetuating and cause harm, that theyare rare in the body. Negative feedback mechanisms, however, contain their own brakes in that inhibition is a natural part ofthe cycle, and the body has many of them. The secre-tion of most hormones (Chapter 10) is regulated bynegative feedback mechanisms. The regulation ofheart rate (Chapter 12) and blood pressure (Chapter13) involves several negative feedback mechanisms. 10 Organization and General Plan of the Body01Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 10The result of all of these mechanisms working to- gether is that all aspects of body functioning, that is, ofmetabolism, are kept within normal limits, a steadystate or equilibrium. This is homeostasis. In the chapters to come, you will nd many more examples of homeostasis. As you continue your studyof the human body, keep in mind that the proper func- tioning of each organ and organ system contributes tohomeostasis. Keep in mind as well that what we callthe normal values of metabolism are often ranges, notsingle numbers. Recall that normal body temperatureis a range: 97 /H11034to 99 /H11034F (36 /H11034to 38 /H11034C).

QUESTION: For each mechanism, where is the source of the \"brake\" or inhibition?01Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 11rate, another example, is 60 to 80 beats per minute; a normal respiratory rate is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.Variations within the normal range are part of normalmetabolism. TERMINOLOGY AND GENERAL PLAN OF THE BODY As part of your course in anatomy and physiology,you will learn many new words or terms. At times youmay feel that you are learning a second language, andindeed you are. Each term has a precise meaning,which is understood by everyone else who has learnedthe language. Mastering the terminology of your pro-fession is essential to enable you to communicate effec-tively with your coworkers and your future patients.Although the number of new terms may seem a bitoverwhelming at rst, you will nd that their use soonbecomes second nature to you. The terminology presented in this chapter will be used throughout the text in the discussion of the organsystems. This will help to reinforce the meanings ofthese terms and will transform these new words intoknowledge. BODY PARTS AND AREAS Each of the terms listed in T able 1-2 and shown inFig. 1-4 refers to a specic part or area of the body.For example, the term femoral always refers to the thigh. The femoral artery is a blood vessel that passesthrough the thigh, and the quadriceps femoris is alarge muscle group of the thigh. Another example is pulmonary , which always refers to the lungs, as in pulmonary artery, pulmonary edema,and pulmonary embolism. Although you may notknow the exact meaning of each of these terms now,you do know that each has something to do with thelungs. TERMS OF LOCATION AND POSITION When describing relative locations, the body is alwaysassumed to be in anatomic position: standing uprightfacing forward, arms at the sides with palms forward,and the feet slightly apart. The terms of location arelisted in T able 1-3, with a denition and example foreach. As you read each term, nd the body parts usedas examples in Figs. 1-4 and 1-5. Notice also thatthese are pairs of terms and that each pair is a set of opposites. This will help you recall the terms and theirmeanings. BODY CAVITIES AND THEIR MEMBRANES The body has two major cavities: the dorsal cavity (posterior) and the ventral cavity (anterior). Each ofthese cavities has further subdivisions, which areshown in Fig. 1-5.12 Organization and General Plan of the Body Table 1-2 DESCRIPTIVE TERMS FOR BODY PARTS AND AREAS Term Denition (Refers to) Antebrachial forearm Antecubital front groinLumbar Pedal footPerineal pelvic floorPlantar sole of foot Popliteal back of knee Pulmonary lungsRenal kidneySacral base of spine The dorsal cavity contains the central nervous system, and consists of the cranial cavity and the vertebral orspinal cavity. The dorsal cavity is a continuous one;that is, no wall or boundary separates its subdivisions.The cranial cavity is formed by the skull and containsthe brain. The spinal cavity is formed by the backbone(spine) and contains the spinal cord. The membranesthat line these cavities and cover the brain and spinalcord are called the meninges .Ventral Cavity The ventral cavity consists of two compartments, the thoracic cavity and the abdominal cavity, which are separated by the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large,dome-shaped respiratory muscle. It has openings forthe esophagus and for large blood vessels, but other-wise is a wall between the thoracic and abdominal cav-ities. The pelvic cavity may be considered asubdivision of the abdominal cavity (there is no wallbetween them) or as a separate cavity.Organization and General Plan of the Body 13 Body Parts and Areas Anatomic position 1-4.

The membranes of the thoracic cavity . the chest wall, and the vis-ceral pleura covers the lungs. The heart has its the visceral pericardium covers theheart muscle. Organs in the abdominal cavity include the liver, stomach, and intestines. The membranes of theabdominal cavity are also serous membranes called theperitoneum and mesentery. The peritoneum is the membrane that lines the entire abdominal wall, andthe mesentery is the continuation of this membrane,folded around and covering the outer surfaces of the abdominal organs. The pelvic cavity is inferior to the abdominal cav- ity. Although the peritoneum does not line the pelviccavity, it covers the free surfaces of several pelvicorgans. Within the pelvic cavity are the urinary blad-der and reproductive organs such as the uterus inwomen and the prostate gland in men. PLANES AND SECTIONS When internal anatomy is described, the body or anorgan is often cut or sectioned in a specic way so asto make particular structures easily visible. A plane is an imaginary flat surface that separates two portions of - AB Figure 1-6. (A) Planes and sections of the body.

(Continued) ( C) Transverse section through the upper abdomen. the body or an organ. These planes and sections are shown in Fig. 1-6 (see Box 1-2: Visualizing theInterior of the Body). Frontal (coronal) section \u2014a plane from side to side separates the body into front and back portions. Sagittal section \u2014a plane from front to back separates the body into right and left portions. A midsagittalsection creates equal right and left halves. Transverse section \u2014a horizontal plane separates the body into upper and lower portions. Cross-section \u2014a plane perpendicular to the long axis of an organ. A cross-section of the small intes-tine (which is a tube) would look like a circle withthe cavity of the intestine in the center. Longitudinal section \u2014a plane along the long axis of an organ. A longitudinal section of the intestine isshown in Fig. 1-6, and a frontal section of thefemur (thigh bone) would also be a longitudinalsection (see Fig. 6-1 in Chapter 6). AREAS OF THE ABDOMEN The abdomen is a large area of the lower trunk of thebody. If a patient reported abdominal pain, the physi-cian or nurse would want to know more precisely where the pain was. T o determine this, the abdomenmay be divided into smaller regions or areas, whichare shown in Fig. 1-7. Quadrants \u2014a transverse plane and a midsagittal plane that cross at the umbilicus will divide theabdomen into four quadrants. Clinically, this isprobably the division used more frequently. Thepain of gallstones might then be described as in theright upper quadrant. Nine areas \u2014two transverse planes and two sagittal planes divide the abdomen into nine areas:Upper areas \u2014above the level of the rib cartilages are the left hypochondriac, epigastric, and righthypochondriac. Middle areas \u2014the left lumbar, umbilical, and right lumbar. Lower areas \u2014below the level of the top of the pelvic bone are the left iliac, hypogastric, and rightiliac. These divisions are often used in anatomic studies to describe the location of organs. The liver, for exam-ple, is located in the epigastric and right hypochon-driac areas.01Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 16Organization and General Plan of the Body 17 SUMMARY As you will see, the terminology presented in this chapter is used throughout the text to describe the anatomy of organs and the names of their parts. Allorgans of the body contribute to homeostasis, thehealthy state of the body that is maintained by con-stant and appropriate responses to internal and exter-nal changes. In the chapters that follow, you will nd detailed descriptions of the physiology of each organand organ system, and how the metabolism of each isnecessary to homeostasis. We will now return to aconsideration of the structural organization of thebody and to more extensive descriptions of its levels oforganization.

FA Davis,Philadelphia, 1992, pp 27 and 298, with permission.)In the past, the need for exploratory surgery brought with it hospitalization, risk of infection, anddiscomfort and pain for the patient. Today, how-ever, several technologies and the extensive use ofcomputers permit us to see the interior of the bodywithout surgery. Computed tomography (CT)scanning uses a narrowly focused x-ray beam that circles rapidlyaround the body. A detector then measures howmuch radiation passes through different tissues,and a computer constructs an image of a thinslice through the body. Several images may bemade at different levels\u2014each takes only a fewseconds\u2014to provide a more complete picture ofan organ or part of the body. The images aremuch more detailed than are those produced byconventional x-rays. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another diagnostic tool that is especially useful for visual-izing soft tissues, including the brain and spinalcord. Recent renements have produced imagesof individual nerve bundles, which had not beenpossible using any other technique. The patient is placed inside a strong magnetic eld, and thetissues are pulsed with radio waves. Becauseeach tissue has different proportions of variousatoms, which resonate or respond differently,each tissue emits a characteristic signal. A com-puter then translates these signals into an image;the entire procedure takes 30 to 45 minutes. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning creates images that depict the rates of physio-logical processes such as blood flow, oxygenusage, or glucose metabolism. The comparativerates are depicted by colors: Red represents thehighest rate, followed by yellow, then green, andnally blue representing the lowest rate. One drawback of these technologies is their cost; they are expensive. However, the benets topatients are great: Highly detailed images of thebody are obtained without the risks of surgery andwith virtually no discomfort in the procedures them-selves.01Scanlon(p3)-ch01 8/17/06 10:41 AM Page 183.

Metabolism and Homeostasis 1. Metabolism is the sum of all of the chemical and physical changes that take place in the body.Metabolic rate is the amount of energy and heatproduction per unit of time. 2. Homeostasis is a state of good health maintained by the normal metabolism (functioning) of theorgan systems. 3. The body constantly responds to internal and external changes, yet remains stable; its manyaspects of metabolism are kept within normal lim-its (usually a range of values, not a single value). 4. Negative feedback mechanism\u2014a control system in which a stimulus initiates a response thatreverses or reduces the stimulus, thereby stoppingthe response until the stimulus occurs again andthere is a need for the response (see Fig. 1-3). 5. Positive feedback mechanism\u2014a control system that requires an external interruption or brake. Hasthe potential to become a self-perpetuating andharmful cycle, therefore is rare in the body (see Fig.1-3). Terminology and General Plan of the Body 1.

The air we breathe is a mixture of chem-icals in the form of gases. Water, gasoline, and dietsoda are chemicals in liquid form. Our foods arechemicals, and our bodies are complex arrangementsof thousands of chemicals. Recall from Chapter 1 thatthe simplest level of organization of the body is thechemical level. This chapter covers some very basic aspects of chemistry as they are related to living organisms, andmost especially as they are related to our understand-ing of the human body. So try to think of chemistrynot as a complicated science, but as the air, water, andfood we need, and every substance that is part of us. ELEMENTS All matter, both living and not living, is made of ele-ments, the simplest chemicals. An element is a sub- stance made of only one type of atom (therefore, anatom is the smallest part of an element). There are 92naturally occurring elements in the world around us.Examples are hydrogen (H), iron (Fe), oxygen (O),calcium (Ca), nitrogen (N), and carbon (C). In nature,an element does not usually exist by itself but rathercombines with the atoms of other elements to formcompounds. Examples of some compounds importantto our study of the human body are water (H 2O), in which two atoms of hydrogen combine with one atomof oxygen; carbon dioxide (CO 2), in which an atom of carbon combines with two atoms of oxygen; and glu-cose (C 6H12O6), in which six carbon atoms and six oxygen atoms combine with 12 hydrogen atoms. The elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are found in all living things. Ifcalcium is included, these seven elements make upapproximately 99% of the human body (weight). More than 20 different elements are found, in vary- ing amounts, in the human body. Some of these arelisted in T able 2-1. As you can see, each element has astandard chemical symbol. This is simply the rst (andsometimes the second) letter of the element's Englishor Latin name. You should know the symbols of theelements in this table, because they are used in text-24 Some Basic Chemistry Table 2-1 ELEMENTS IN THE HUMAN BODY Percent of Atomic the Body Elements Symbol Number* by Weight Hydrogen H 1 9.5 Carbon C 6 18.5 Nitrogen N 7 3.3Oxygen O 8 65.0Fluorine F 9 Trace Sodium Na 11 0.2 Magnesium Mg 12 0.1Phosphorus P 15 1.0Sulfur S 16 0.3 Chlorine Cl 17 0.2 Potassium K 19 0.4Calcium Ca 20 1.5Manganese Mn 25 Trace Iron Fe 26 Trace Cobalt Co 27 TraceCopper Cu 29 TraceZinc Zn 30 Trace Iodine I 53 Trace *Atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom. It also represents the number of electrons thatorbit the nucleus. books, articles, hospital lab reports, and so on. Notice that if a two-letter symbol is used for an element, thesecond letter is always lowercase, not a capital. Forexample, the symbol for calcium is Ca, not CA. CA isan abbreviation often used for cancer. ATOMS Atoms are the smallest parts of an element that have the characteristics of that element. An atom consists ofthree major subunits or particles: protons, a positive elec- trical charge and is found in the nucleus (or center) ofthe atom. A neutron is electrically neutral (has no charge) and is also found in the nucleus. An electron has a negative electrical charge and is found outsidethe nucleus orbiting in what may be called an electroncloud or shell around the nucleus. The number of protons in an atom gives it its atomic number . Protons and neutrons have mass and weight; they give an atom its atomic weight . In an02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 atom is electrically neu- tral. The electrons, however, are important in thatthey may enable an atom to connect, or bond , to other atoms to form molecules . A molecule is a combina- tion of atoms (usually of more than one element) thatare so tightly bound together that the moleculebehaves as a single unit. Each atom is capable of bonding in only very spe- cic ways. This capability depends on the number andthe arrangement of the electrons of the atom.Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom in shells orenergy levels . The rst, or innermost, energy level can contain a maximum of two electrons and is thenconsidered stable. The second energy level is stablewhen it contains its maximum of eight electrons. Theremaining energy levels, more distant from thenucleus, are also most stable when they contain eightelectrons, or a multiple of eight. A few atoms (elements) are naturally stable, or uninterested in reacting, because their outermostenergy level already contains the maximum number ofelectrons. The gases helium and neon are examples ofthese stable atoms, which do not usually react withother atoms. Most atoms are not stable, however, andtend to gain, lose, or share electrons in order to lltheir outermost shell. By doing so, an atom is capableof forming one or more chemical bonds with otheratoms. In this way, the atom becomes stable, because its outermost shell of electrons has been lled. It isthese reactive atoms that are of interest in our study ofanatomy and physiology. CHEMICAL BONDS A chemical bond is not a structure, but rather a forceor attraction between positive and negative electricalcharges that keeps two or more atoms closely associ-ated with each other to form a molecule. By way ofcomparison, think of gravity. We know that gravity isnot a \"thing,\" but rather the force that keeps our feeton the floor and allows us to pour coffee with consis-tent success. Molecules formed by chemical bondingoften have physical characteristics different from thoseof the atoms of the original elements. For example,the elements hydrogen and oxygen are gases, butatoms of each may chemically bond to form moleculesof water, which is a liquid. The type of chemical bonding depends upon the tendencies of the electrons of atoms involved, as youwill see. Four kinds of bonds are very important to thechemistry of the body: ionic bonds, covalent bonds,disulde bonds, and hydrogen bonds. IONIC BONDS An ionic bond involves the loss of one or more elec- trons by one atom and the gain of the electron(s) byanother atom or atoms. Refer to Fig. 2-2 as you readthe following. An atom of sodium (Na) has one electron in its out- ermost shell, and in order to become stable, it tends tolose that electron. When it does so, the sodium atomhas one more proton than it has electrons. Therefore,it now has an electrical charge (or valence ) of /H110011 and is called a sodium ion(Na /H11001). An atom of chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell, and in order tobecome stable tends to gain one electron. When itdoes so, the chlorine atom has one more electron thanit has protons, and now has a charge (valence) of /H110021. It is called a chloride ion (Cl /H11002). When an atom of sodium loses an electron to an atom of chlorine, their ions have unlike charges (pos-itive and negative) and are thus attracted to oneanother. The result is the formation of a molecule ofsodium chloride: NaCl, or common table salt. Thebond that holds these ions together is called an ionicbond.Some Basic Chemistry 25 Second energy level First energy level Proton [+] NeutronNucleus Electrons [--] Figure 2-1. An atom of carbon. The nucleus contains six protons and six neutrons (not all are visible here). Six electrons orbit the nucleus, two in the rst energy level and four in the second energy level.QUESTION: What is the electrical charge of this atom as a whole?02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 25Another example is the bonding of chlorine to cal- cium. An atom of calcium has two electrons in its out-ermost shell and tends to lose those electrons in orderto become stable. If two atoms of chlorine each gainone of those electrons, they become chloride ions.The positive and negative ions are then attracted toone another, forming a molecule of calcium chloride, CaCl 2, which is also a salt. A saltis a molecule made of ions other than hydrogen (H/H11001) ions or hydroxyl Ca/H110012, K/H11001, , which include Cl/H11002, SO4/H110022(sulfate), and HCO3/H11002(bicarbonate). The types of compounds formed by ionic bonding are salts,acids, and bases. (Acids and bases are discussed later inthis chapter.) In the solid state, ionic bonds are relatively strong. Our bones, for example, contain the salt calcium car-bonate (CaCO 3), which helps give bone its strength. However, in an aqueous (water) solution , many ionic bonds are weakened. The bonds may become so weakthat the bound ions of a molecule separate, creating asolution of free positive and negative ions. For exam-ple, if sodium chloride is put in water, it dissolves, thenionizes . The water now contains Na /H11001ions and Cl/H11002 ions. Ionization, also called dissociation , is important to living organisms because once dissociated, the ionsare free to take part in other chemical reactions withinthe body. Cells in the stomach lining producehydrochloric acid (HCl) and must have Cl /H11002ions to do so. The chloride in NaCl would not be free to takepart in another reaction since it is tightly bound to the sodium atom. However, the Cl/H11002ions available from ionized NaCl in the cellular water can be used for thesynthesis , or chemical manufacture, of HCl in the stomach. COVALENT BONDS Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms. As shown in Fig. 2-3, an atom of oxy-gen needs two electrons to become stable. It mayshare two of its electrons with another atom of oxy- gen, also sharing two electrons. T ogether they form a molecule of oxygen gas (O 2), which is the form in which oxygen exists in the atmosphere. An atom of oxygen may also share two of its elec- trons with two atoms of hydrogen, each sharing itssingle electron (see Fig. 2-3). T ogether they form amolecule of water (H 2O). When writing structural formulas for chemical molecules, a pair of shared elec-trons is indicated by a single line, as shown in the for-mula for water; this is a single covalent bond. A doublecovalent bond is indicated by two lines, as in the for-mula for oxygen; this represents two pairs of sharedelectrons. The element carbon always forms covalent bonds; an atom of carbon has four electrons to share withother atoms. If these four electrons are shared withfour atoms of hydrogen, each sharing its one electron,a molecule of methane gas (CH 4) is formed. Carbon may form covalent bonds with other carbons, hydro-gen, oxygen, nitrogen, or other elements. Organic26 Some Basic Chemistry Na + Cl = NaCl + - Figure 2-2. Formation of an ionic bond. An atom of sodium loses an electron to an atom of chlorine. The two ions formed have unlike charges, are attracted to one another, and form a molecule of sodium chloride. QUESTION: Why is the charge of a sodium ion /H110011?02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 26compounds such as proteins and carbohydrates are complex and precise arrangements of these atomscovalently bonded to one another. Covalent bonds arerelatively strong and are not weakened in an aqueoussolution. This is important because the proteins pro-duced by the body, for example, must remain intact inorder to function properly in the water of our cells andblood. The functions of organic compounds will beconsidered later in this chapter. DISULFIDE BONDS AND HYDROGEN BONDS T wo other types of bonds that are important to the chemistry of the body are disulde bonds andhydrogen bonds. Disulde bonds are found in some proteins. Hydrogen bonds are part of many differentmolecules. A disulde bond (also called a disulde bridge) is a covalent bond formed between two atoms of sulfur,usually within the same large protein molecule. Thehormone insulin, for example, is a protein that musthave a very specic three-dimensional shape in orderto function properly to regulate the blood glucoselevel. Each molecule of insulin has two disulde bondsthat help maintain its proper shape and function (seeBox Fig. 10-A). Other proteins with shapes thatdepend upon disulde bonds are antibodies of theimmune system (see Fig. 14-8) and keratin of the skinand hair.Some Basic Chemistry 27 Figure 2-3. Formation of covalent bonds. ( A) Two atoms of oxygen share two electrons each, forming a molecule of oxygen gas. ( B) An atom of oxygen shares one electron with each of two hydrogen atoms, each sharing its electron. A molecule of water is formed.QUESTION: Which of the bonds shown here is a double covalent bond? O + O = O 2 O=O 8+ + 8+ = 8+ 8+A O + its shape (a genetic char- acteristic) because of disulde bonds. When naturallycurly hair is straightened, the disulde bonds in thekeratin molecules are broken. When naturally straighthair is \"permed\" or curled, the disulde bonds in thekeratin are rst broken, then re-formed in the curledhair. Neither process affects the living part of the hair,the hair root, so the hair will grow out in its originalshape. We would not want such a process affecting ourinsulin or antibody molecules, for that would destroytheir functioning. A hydrogen bond does not involve the sharing or exchange of electrons, but rather results because of aproperty of hydrogen atoms. When a hydrogen atomshares its one electron in a covalent bond with anotheratom, its proton has a slight positive charge and maythen be attracted to a nearby oxygen or nitrogen atom,which has a slight negative charge. Although they are weak bonds, hydrogen bonds are important in several ways. Large organic moleculessuch as proteins and DNA have very specic functionsthat depend upon their three-dimensional shapes. Theshapes of these molecules, so crucial to their properfunctioning, are often maintained by hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds also make water cohesive; that is, each water molecule is attracted to nearby water mol-ecules. Such cohesiveness can be seen if water isdropped onto clean glass; the surface tension createdby the hydrogen bonds makes the water form three-dimensional beads. Within the body, the cohesivenessof water helps keep blood a continuous stream as itflows within the blood vessels, and keeps tissue fluidcontinuous around cells. These hydrogen bonds arealso responsible for the other important characteris-tics of water, which are discussed in a later section. CHEMICAL REACTIONS A chemical reaction is a change brought about by theformation or breaking of chemical bonds. T wo generaltypes of reactions are synthesis reactions and decom-position reactions. In a synthesis reaction , bonds are formed to join two or more atoms or molecules to make a new com-pound. The production of the protein hemoglobin inpotential red blood cells is an example of a synthesisreaction. Proteins are synthesized by the bonding ofmany amino acids, their smaller subunits. Synthesisreactions require energy for the formation of bonds.In a decomposition reaction , bonds are broken, and a large molecule is changed to two or moresmaller ones. One example is the digestion of largemolecules of starch into many smaller glucose mole-cules. Some decomposition reactions release energy;this is described in a later section on cell respiration. In this and future chapters, keep in mind that the term reaction refers to the making or breaking of chemical bonds and thus to changes in the physicaland chemical characteristics of the moleculesinvolved. INORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF IMPORTANCE Inorganic compounds are usually simple moleculesthat often consist of only one or two different ele-ments. Despite their simplicity, however, some inor-ganic compounds are essential to normal structure andfunctioning of the body. WATER Water makes up 60% to 75% of the human body, andis essential to life for several reasons: 1.Water is a solvent ; that is, many substances (called solutes) can dissolve in water. Nutrients such asglucose are dissolved in blood plasma (which islargely water) to be transported to cells throughoutthe body. The sense of taste depends upon the sol-vent ability of saliva; dissolved food stimulates thereceptors in taste buds. The excretion of wasteproducts is possible because they are dissolved inthe water of urine. 2.Water is a lubricant , which prevents friction where surfaces meet and move. In the digestive tract,swallowing depends upon the presence of saliva, and mucus is a slippery fluid that permits the smooth passage of food through the intestines.Synovial fluid within joint cavities prevents frictionas bones move. 3.Water changes temperature slowly . Water has a high heat capacity, which means that it will absorb agreat deal of heat before its temperature rises sig-nicantly, or it must lose a great deal of heat beforeits temperature drops signicantly. This is one ofthe factors that helps the body maintain a constanttemperature. Water also has a high heat of vapor-ization, which is important for the process of28 Some Basic Chemistry02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 28sweating. Excess body heat evaporates sweat on the skin surfaces, rather than overheating the body'scells, and because of water's high heat of vaporiza-tion, a great deal of heat can be given off with theloss of a relatively small amount of water. WATER COMPARTMENTS All water within the body is continually moving, butwater is given different names when it is in specicbody locations, which are called compartments (Fig.2-4). Intracellular fluid (ICF) \u2014the water within cells; about the total body water Extracellular fluid (ECF) \u2014all the rest of the water in the body; about 35% of the total. More speciccompartments of extracellular fluid include:Plasma \u2014water found in blood vessels Lymph \u2014water found in lymphatic vessels Tissue fluid or interstitial fluid \u2014water found in the small spaces between cells Specialized fluids \u2014synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humor in the eye, and others The movement of water between compartments inthe body and the functions of the specialized fluids will be discussed in later chapters. OXYGEN Oxygen in the form of a gas (O2) is approximately 21% of the atmosphere, which we inhale. We all knowthat without oxygen we wouldn't survive very long,but exactly what does it do? Oxygen is important to usbecause it is essential for a process called cell respira-tion, in which cells break down simple nutrients suchas glucose in order to release energy. The reason webreathe is to obtain oxygen for cell respiration and toexhale the carbon dioxide produced in cell respiration(this will be discussed in the next section). Biologicallyuseful energy that is released by the reactions of cellrespiration is trapped in a molecule called ATP(adenosine triphosphate). ATP can then be used forcellular processes that require energy. CARBON DIOXIDE Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced by cells as a waste product of cell respiration. You may ask why a wasteproduct is considered important. Keep in mind that\"important\" does not always mean \"benecial,\" but itSome Basic Chemistry 29 Figure 2-4. Water compartments, showing the names water is given in its different loca- tions and the ways in which water moves between compartments.QUESTION: Which of the fluids shown are extracellular fluids? Fluid movementIntracellular fluid 10:42 AM Page 29does mean \"signicant.\" If the amount of carbon di- oxide in the body fluids increases, it causes these fluidsto become too acidic. Therefore, carbon dioxide mustbe exhaled as rapidly as it is formed to keep theamount in the body within normal limits. Normallythis is just what happens, but severe pulmonary dis-eases such as pneumonia or emphysema decrease gasexchange in the lungs and permit carbon dioxide toaccumulate in the blood. When this happens, a personis said to be in a state of acidosis , which may seriously disrupt body functioning (see the sections on pH andenzymes later in this chapter; see also Box 2-1: BloodGases). CELL RESPIRATION Cell respiration is the name for energy production within cells and involves both respiratory gases, oxy-gen and carbon dioxide. Many chemical reactions areinvolved, but in its simplest form, cell respiration maybe summarized by the following equation: Glucose (C6H12O6) /H110016O26CO2/H110016H2O /H11001ATP /H11001heat This reaction shows us that glucose and oxygen combine to yield carbon dioxide, water, ATP , and heat.Food, represented here by glucose, in the presence of oxygen is broken down into the simpler moleculescarbon dioxide and water. The potential energy in the glucose molecule is released in two forms: ATP andheat. Each of the four products of this process has apurpose or signicance in the body. The carbon diox-ide is a waste product that moves from the cells intothe blood to be carried to the lungs and eventuallyexhaled. The water formed is useful and becomes partof the intracellular fluid. The heat produced con-tributes to normal body temperature. ATP is used forcell processes such as mitosis, protein synthesis, andmuscle contraction, all of which require energy andwill be discussed a bit further on in the text. We will also return to cell respiration in later chap- ters. For now, the brief description just given will suf-ce to show that eating and breathing are interrelated;both are essential for energy production. TRACE ELEMENTS Trace elements are those that are needed by the body in very small amounts. When they are present in foodor nutritional supplements, we often call them miner-als, and examples are iron, cobalt, and zinc. Although they may not be as abundant in the body as are carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, they are nonetheless essential.T able 2-2 lists some of these trace elements and theirfunctions (see also Box 2-2: Nitric Oxide).30 Some Basic Chemistry BOX2-1 BLOOD GASES oxygen falls below the normal range, oxygen will be administered; if blood carbon dioxide risesabove the normal range, blood pH will be correctedto prevent serious acidosis. Damage to the heart may also bring about a change in blood gases, especially oxygen. Oxygenis picked up by red blood cells as they circulatethrough lung capillaries; as red blood cells circulatethrough the body, they release oxygen to tissues.What keeps the blood circulating or moving? Thepumping of the heart. A mild heart attack, when heart failure is unlikely, is often characterized by a blood oxygen level thatis low but still within normal limits. A more severeheart attack that seriously impairs the pumping ofthe heart will decrease the blood oxygen level toless than normal. This condition is called hypoxia , which means that too little oxygen is reaching tis-sues. When this is determined by measurement ofblood gases, appropriate oxygen therapy can bestarted to correct the hypoxia.A patient is admitted to the emergency room with a possible heart attack, and the doctor in charge orders \"blood gases.\" Another patient hospitalizedwith pneumonia has \"blood gases\" monitored atfrequent intervals. What are blood gases, and whatdoes measurement of them tell us? The blood gasesare oxygen and carbon dioxide, and their levelsin arterial blood provide information about thefunctioning of the respiratory and circulatorysystems. Arterial blood normally has a high con-centration of oxygen and a low concentration ofcarbon dioxide. These levels are maintained bygas exchange in the lungs and by the proper circu-lation of blood. A pulmonary disease such as pneumonia inter- feres with efficient gas exchange in the lungs. As aresult, blood oxygen concentration may decrease,and blood carbon dioxide concentration mayincrease. Either of these changes in blood gasesmay become life threatening for the patient, somonitoring of blood gases is important. If blood02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 30ACIDS, BASES, AND pH An acid may be dened as a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H/H11001) in a water solution. A base is a substance that decreases the con- centration of H/H11001ions, which, in the case of water, has the same effect as increasing the concentration ofhydroxyl ions (OH /H11002). The acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of a solution is measured on a scale of values called pH(parts hydro- gen). The values on the pH scale range from 0 to 14, with 0 indicating the most acidic level and 14 the mostalkaline. A solution with a pH of 7 is neutral becauseit contains the same number of H /H11001ions and OH/H11002 ions. Pure water has a pH of 7. A solution with ahigher concentration of H /H11001ions than OH/H11002ions is an acidic solution with a pH below 7. An alkaline solu-tion, therefore, has a higher concentration of OH /H11002 ions than H/H11001ions and has a pH above 7. The pH scale, with the relative concentrations of H/H11001ions and OH/H11002ions, is shown in Fig. 2-5. A change of one pH unit is a 10-fold change in H/H11001ion concentration. This means that a solution with a pHof 4 has 10 times as many H /H11001ions as a solution with a pH of 5, and 100 times as many H/H11001ions as a solutionwith a pH of 6. Figure 2-5 also shows the pH of some body fluids and other familiar solutions. Notice thatgastric juice has a pH of 1 and coffee has a pH of 5.This means that gastric juice has 10,000 times as manyH /H11001ions as does coffee. Although coffee is acidic, it is a weak acid and does not have the corrosive effect ofgastric juice, a strong acid. The cells and internal fluids of the human body have a pH close to neutral. The pH of intracellularfluid is around 6.8, and the normal pH range of bloodis 7.35 to 7.45. Fluids such as gastric juice and urineare technically external fluids, because they are inbody tracts that open to the environment. The pH ofthese fluids may be more strongly acidic or alkalinewithout harm to the body. The pH of blood, however, must be maintained within its very narrow, slightly alkaline range. Adecrease of only one pH unit, which is 10 times asmany H /H11001ions, would disrupt the chemical reactions of the blood and cause the death of the individual.Normal metabolism tends to make body fluids moreSome Basic Chemistry 31 Table 2-2 TRACE ELEMENTS Element Function Calcium PhosphorusIron Copper Sodium and potassium Sulfur Cobalt Iodine Provides strength in bones and teeth Necessary for blood clotting Necessary for muscle contraction Provides strength in bones and teeth Part of DNA, RNA, and ATP Part of cell membranes Part of hemoglobin in red blood cells; transports oxygen Part of myoglobin in muscles; stores oxygen Necessary for cell respiration Necessary for cell respiration Necessary for hemoglobin synthesis Necessary for muscle contraction Necessary for nerve impulse trans- mission Part of some proteins such as insulin and keratin Part of vitamin B12 Part of thyroid hormones\u2014thyroxine BOX2-2 NITRIC OXIDE Nitric oxide is a gas with the molecular formula NO. You have probably heard of it as a compo-nent of air pollution and cigarette smoke, but itis synthesized by several human tissues, andthis deceptively simple molecule has importantfunctions. Nitric oxide is produced by the endothelium (lining) of blood vessels and promotes vasodila-tion of arterioles, permitting greater blood flowand oxygen delivery to tissues. It is involved innerve impulse transmission in the brain, and maycontribute to memory storage. Some immunesystem cells produce nitric oxide as a cytotoxic(cell-poisoning) agent to help destroy foreigncells such as bacteria. Nitric oxide is also being used therapeutically in clinical trials. It has been found useful in thetreatment of pulmonary hypertension to relaxabnormally constricted arteries in the lungs topermit normal gas exchange. Other studiesshow that nitric oxide helps some prematurebabies breathe more easily and efficiently. Much more research is needed, including a determination of possible harmful side effects ofgreater than normal amounts of nitric oxide, butthe results of some clinical trials thus far arepromising.02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 31acidic, and this tendency to acidosis must be continu- ally corrected. Normal pH of internal fluids is main-tained by the kidneys, respiratory system, and buffersystems. Although acid-base balance will be a majortopic of Chapter 19, we will briefly mention buffersystems here. Buffer Systems A buffer system is a chemical or pair of chemicals that minimizes changes in pH by reacting with strongacids or strong bases to transform them into sub-stances that will not drastically change pH. Expressedin another way, a buffer may bond to H /H11001ions when a body fluid is becoming too acidic, or release H/H11001ions when a fluid is becoming too alkaline.As a specic example, we will use the bicarbonate buffer system, which consists of carbonic acid(H 2CO3), a weak acid, and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a weak base. This pair of chemicals is present in all body fluids but is especially important tobuffer blood and tissue fluid. Carbonic acid ionizes as follows (but remember, because it is a weak acid it does not contribute manyH /H11001ions to a solution): H2CO3H/H11001/H11001HCO3/H11002 Sodium bicarbonate ionizes NaHCO3Na/H11001/H11001HCO3/H11002 If a acid, such as HCl, is added to extracel- lular fluid, this reaction will occur:32 Some Basic Chemistry Figure 2-5. The pH scale. The pH values of several body fluids are indicated above the scale. The pH values of some familiar solutions are indicated below the scale.QUESTION: Describe the pH range of blood compared to the pH range of urine.02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 32HCl /H11001NaHCO3NaCl /H11001H2CO3 What has happened here? Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid that would greatly lower pH, has reactedwith sodium bicarbonate. The products of this reac-tion are NaCl, a salt that has no effect on pH, andH 2CO3, a weak acid that lowers pH only slightly. This prevents a drastic change in the pH of the extracellu-lar fluid. If a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide, is added to the extracellular fluid, this reaction will occur: NaOH /H11001H 2CO3H2O /H11001NaHCO3 Sodium hydroxide, a strong base that would greatly raise pH, has reacted with carbonic acid. The productsof this reaction are water, which has no effect on pH,and sodium bicarbonate, a weak base that raises pHonly slightly. Again, this prevents a drastic change inthe pH of the extracellular fluid. In the body, such reactions take place in less than a second whenever acids or bases are formed that wouldgreatly change pH. Because of the body's tendency tobecome more acidic, the need to correct acidosis ismore frequent. With respect to the bicarbonate buffersystem, this means that more NaHCO 3than H2CO3isneeded. For this reason, the usual ratio of these buffers is 20:1 (NaHCO3:H2CO3). ORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF IMPORTANCE Organic compounds all contain covalently bondedcarbon and hydrogen atoms and perhaps other ele-ments as well. In the human body there are four majorgroups of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids,proteins, and nucleic acids. CARBOHYDRATES A primary function of carbohydrates is to serve as sources of energy in cell respiration. All carbohydratescontain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and are classi-ed as monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccha-rides, and polysaccharides. Saccharide means sugar, and the prex indicates how many are present. Monosaccharides, or single-sugar compounds, are the simplest sugars. Glucose is a hexose , or six- carbon, sugar with the formula C 6H12O6(Fig. 2-6). Fructose and galactose also have the same formula,Some Basic Chemistry 33 Figure 2-6. Carbohydrates. ( A) Glucose, depicting its structural formula. ( B) A disac- charide such as sucrose. ( C) a Starch, a (E) Glycogen, a polysaccharide. Each hexagon represents a hexose sugar such as glucose.

H C OHCH2OH C H OH C HH C OHH C OHA Glucose E GlycogenB DisaccharideC Cellulose D Starcho02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 33but the physical arrangement of the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in each differs from that of glu-cose. This gives each hexose sugar a different three-dimensional shape. The liver is able to change fructoseand galactose to glucose, which is then used by cells inthe process of cell respiration to produce ATP . Another type of monosaccharide is the pentose , or ve-carbon, sugar. These are not involved in energyproduction but rather are structural components ofthe nucleic acids. Deoxyribose (C 5H10O4) is part of DNA, which is the genetic material of chromosomes.Ribose (C 5H10O5) is part of RNA, which is essential for protein synthesis. We will return to the nucleicacids later in this chapter. Disaccharides are double sugars, made of two monosaccharides linked by a covalent bond. Sucrose,or cane sugar, for example, is made of one glucose andone fructose. Others are lactose (glucose and galac-tose) and maltose (two glucose), which are also presentin food. Disaccharides are digested into monosaccha-rides and then used for energy production. The prex oligo means \"few\"; oligosaccharides consist of from 3 to 20 monosaccharides. In humancells, oligosaccharides are found on the outer surfaceof cell membranes. Here they serve as antigens , which are chemical markers (or \"signposts\") that iden-tify cells. The A, B, and AB blood types, for example,are the result of oligosaccharide antigens on the outersurface of red blood cell membranes. All of our cellshave \"self\" antigens, which identify the cells thatbelong in an individual. The presence of \"self\" anti-gens on our own cells enables the immune system torecognize antigens that are \"non-self.\" Such foreignantigens include bacteria and viruses, and immunitywill be a major topic of Chapter 14. Polysaccharides are made of thousands of glucose molecules, bonded in different ways, resulting in dif-ferent shapes (see Fig. 2-6). Starches are branched chains of glucose and are produced by plant cells tostore energy. We have digestive enzymes that split thebonds of starch molecules, releasing glucose. The glu-cose is then absorbed and used by cells to produceATP. Glycogen , a highly branched chain of glucose mol- ecules, is our own storage form for glucose. After ameal high in carbohydrates, the blood glucose levelrises. Excess glucose is then changed to glycogen andstored in the liver and skeletal muscles. When theblood glucose level decreases between meals, theglycogen is converted back to glucose, which is released into the blood (these reactions are regulatedby insulin and other hormones). The blood glucoselevel is kept within normal limits, and cells can take inthis glucose to produce energy. Cellulose is a nearly straight chain of glucose mol- ecules produced by plant cells as part of their cellwalls. We have no enzyme to digest the cellulose weconsume as part of vegetables and grains, and it passesthrough the digestive tract unchanged. Another namefor dietary cellulose is \"ber,\" and although we cannotuse its glucose for energy, it does have a function.Fiber provides bulk within the cavity of the large intestine. This promotes efficient peristalsis , the waves of contraction that propel undigested materialthrough the colon. A diet low in ber does not givethe colon much exercise, and the muscle tissue of thecolon will contract weakly, just as our skeletal muscleswill become flabby without exercise. A diet high inber provides exercise for the colon muscle and mayhelp prevent chronic constipation. The structure and functions of the carbohydrates are summarized in T able 2-3. LIPIDS Lipids contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; some also contain phosphorus. In this groupof organic compounds are different types of sub-stances with very different functions. We will con-sider three types: true fats, phospholipids, and steroids(Fig. 2-7). True fats (also called neutral fats) are made of one molecule of glycerol and one, two, or three fatty acidmolecules. If three fatty acid molecules are bonded toa single glycerol, a triglyceride is formed. T wo fatty acids and a glycerol form a diglyceride , and one fatty acid and a glycerol form a monoglyceride . The fatty acids in a true fat may be saturated or unsaturated . Refer to Fig. 2-7 and notice that one of the fatty acids has single covalent bonds between all itscarbon atoms. Each of these carbons is then bonded tothe maximum number of hydrogens; this is a saturatedfatty acid, meaning saturated with hydrogen. Theother fatty acids shown have one or more (poly) dou-ble covalent bonds between their carbons and lessthan the maximum of hydrogens; these acids. triglycerides containboth though34 Some Basic Chemistry02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 34it is not as precise, it is often easier to speak of satu- rated and unsaturated fats, indicating the predomi- nance of one or the other type of fatty acid. At room temperature, saturated fats are often in solid form, while unsaturated fats are often (notalways) in liquid form. Saturated fats tend to be foundin animal foods such as beef, pork, eggs, and cheese,but palm oil and coconut oil are also saturated.Unsaturated fats are found in other plant oils such ascorn oil, sunflower oil, and safflower oil, but certainsh oils are also unsaturated, and even pork containsunsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fats may be changed to saturated fats in order to give packaged foods a more pleasing tex-ture or taste, or to allow them to be stored longerwithout refrigeration (a longer shelf life). These arehydrogenated fats (meaning that hydrogens have beenadded), also called trans fats. T rans fats contribute sig-nicantly to atherosclerosis of arteries, that is, abnormal cholesterol deposits in the lining that mayclog arteries, especially the coronary arteries of the heart. (See also Box 2-3: Lipids in the Blood.) The triglyceride forms of true fats are a storage form for excess food, that is, they are stored energy(potential energy). Any type of food consumed in excess of the body's caloric needs will be converted to fat and stored in adipose tissue. Most adipose tissue issubcutaneous, between the skin and muscles. Someorgans, however, such as the eyes and kidneys, areenclosed in a layer of fat that acts as a cushion toabsorb shock. Phospholipids are diglycerides with a phosphate group (PO 4) in the third bonding site of glycerol. Although similar in structure to the true fats, phos-pholipids are not stored energy but rather structuralcomponents of cells. Lecithin is a phospholipid that ispart of our cell membranes (see Fig. 3-1; each phos- pholipid molecule looks like a sphere with two tails;the sphere is the glycerol and phosphate, the tails arethe two fatty acids). Another phospholipid is myelin ,Some Basic Chemistry 35 Table 2-3 CARBOHYDRATES Name Structure Monosaccharides\u2014\"Single\" sugar Pentose sugar Pentose sugar Most important energy source for cells Converted to glucose by the liver, then used for energy production Part of DNA, the genetic code in the chromosomes of cells Part of RNA, needed for protein synthesis within cells Two hexose sugars Present in food; digested to monosaccharides, which are then used for energy production Form \"self\" antigens on cell membranes; important to permit the immune system to distinguish \"self\" fromforeign antigens (pathogens) Branched chains of glucose molecules Highly branched chains of glucose molecules Straight chains of glucose molecules Found in plant foods; digested to monosaccharides and used for energy production Storage form for excess glucose in the liver and skeletal muscles Part of plant cell walls; provides ber to promote peristalsis, especially by the colon02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 35BOX2-3 LIPIDS IN THE BLOOD cause in this form cholesterol is more easily removed from the blood by the liver and excretedin bile. A diet low in total fat, with most of it unsaturated fat, tends to raise HDL levels and lower LDL levels. The benet is the delaying of atherosclerosis andcoronary artery disease. A simple blood test called alipid prole (or lipid panel) can determine levels oftotal cholesterol, triglycerides, HDLs, and LDLs. Ahigh HDL level, above 50 mg/dL, is consideredgood, but some researchers now believe that theLDL level is more important and should be as low aspossible, below 100 mg/dL. Other factors contribute to coronary artery dis- ease, such as heredity, smoking, being overweight,and lack of exercise. Diet alone cannot prevent ath-erosclerosis. However, a diet low in total fat andhigh in polyunsaturated fats is a good start.Triglycerides and cholesterol are transported in the blood in combination with proteins. Such mole-cules made by the small intestine are called chy-lomicrons. Those made by the liver are calledlipoproteins and are categorized by their density,which reflects the proportion of protein to choles-terol. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs, which are low in protein and high in cholesterol) transport choles-terol to the tissues, where it is used to synthesizecell membranes or secretions. LDLs are also called\"bad cholesterol,\" because in this form the choles-terol is more likely to be deposited in the walls ofblood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs, which are higher in protein and lower in cholesterol thanLDLs) transport cholesterol from the tissues to theliver. HDLs are also called \"good Figure A triglyceride made of one glycerol and three fatty acids. ( B) The steroid cholesterol. The hexagons and pentagon represent rings of carbon and hydrogen.QUESTION: What would a diglyceride look like? 3602Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 36which forms the myelin sheath around nerve cells and provides electrical insulation for nerve impulse trans-mission. The structure of steroids is very different from that of the other lipids. Cholesterol is an important steroid; it is made of four rings of carbon and hydro-gen (not fatty acids and glycerol) and is shown in Fig.2-7. The liver synthesizes cholesterol, in addition tothe cholesterol we eat in food as part of our diet.Cholesterol is another component of cell membranesand is the precursor (raw material) for the synthesis ofother steroids. In the ovaries or testes, cholesterol isused to synthesize the steroid hormones estrogen ortestosterone, respectively. A form of cholesterol in theskin is changed to vitamin D on exposure to sunlight.Liver cells use cholesterol for the synthesis of bilesalts, which emulsify fats in digestion. Despite its linkto coronary artery disease and heart attacks, choles-terol is an essential substance for human beings. The structure and functions of lipids are summa- rized in T able 2-4. PROTEINS Proteins are made of smaller subunits or building blocks called amino acids , which all contain the ele- ments carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Someamino acids contain sulfur, which permits the forma-tion of disulde bonds. There are about 20 aminoacids that make up human proteins. The structure ofamino acids is shown in Fig. 2-8. Each amino acid has a central carbon atom covalently bonded to an atom ofhydrogen, an amino group (NH 2), and a carboxyl group (COOH). At the fourth bond of the central car-bon is the variable portion of the amino acid, repre-sented by R. The R group may be a single hydrogenatom, or a CH 3group, or a more complex congura- tion of carbon and hydrogen. This gives each of the 20amino acids a slightly different physical shape. A bondbetween two amino acids is called a peptide bond , and a short chain of amino acids linked by peptidebonds is a polypeptide . A protein may consist of from 50 to thousands of amino acids. The sequence of the amino acids isspecic and unique for each protein, and is calledits primary structure. This unique sequence, and thehydrogen bonds and disulde bonds formed withinthe amino acid chain, determines how the protein willbe folded to complete its synthesis. The folding maybe simple, a helix (coil) or pleated sheet, called the sec-ondary structure, or a more complex folding mayoccur to form a globular protein, called the tertiarystructure. Myoglobin, found in muscles, is a globularprotein (Fig. 2-8). When complete, each protein has acharacteristic three-dimensional shape, which in turndetermines its function. Some proteins consist ofmore than one amino acid chain (quaternary struc-ture). Hemoglobin, for example, has four amino acidchains (see Box 3-2). Notice that myoglobin containsan atom of iron (a hemoglobin molecule has four ironSome Basic Chemistry 37 Table 2-4 LIPIDS Name Structure Function True fats Phospholipids Steroids (cholesterol)A triglyceride consists of three fatty acid toa glycerol molecule (some aremonoglycerides or diglycerides) Diglycerides with a phosphate group bonded to the glycerolmolecule Four carbon-hydrogen rings Storage form for excess food molecules in subcutaneous tissue Cushion organs such as the eyes and kidneys Part of cell membranes (lecithin) Form the myelin sheath to provide electrical insulation for neurons Part of cell membranes Converted to vitamin D in the skin on exposure to UV rays of the sun Converted by the liver to bile salts, which emulsify fats during digestion Precursor for the steroid hormones such as estrogen in women (ovaries) or testosterone in men (testes)02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 37atoms). Some proteins require a trace element such as iron or zinc to complete their structure and permitthem to function properly. Our body proteins have many functions; some of these are listed in T able 2-5 and will be mentionedagain in later chapters. And though we usually do notthink of protein as an energy food, if our diet includesmore amino acids than are necessary for our proteinsynthesis, those excess amino acids will be convertedto simple carbohydrates or even to fat, to be stored aspotential energy. (See Box 2-4: A Protein Mystery:Prions, for a discussion of disease-causing proteins.)One very important function of proteins will be dis-cussed further here: the role of proteins as enzymes.Enzymes Enzymes are catalysts , which means that they speed up chemical reactions without the need for an externalsource of energy such as heat. The many reactionsthat take place within the body are catalyzed by spe-cic enzymes; all of these reactions must take place atbody temperature. The way in which enzymes function as catalysts is called the active site theory , and is based on the shape of the enzyme and the shapes of the reactingmolecules, called substrates . A simple synthesis reac- tion is depicted in Fig. 2-9A. Notice that the enzymehas a specic shape, as do the substrate molecules.38 Some Basic Chemistry NH2 C COOHH R Amino group Carboxyl group Variable portionPeptide bonds Iron in hemeA Amino acid B Polypeptide C Primary structure D Secondary structure- alpha helixE Tertiary structure- myoglobin Figure 2-8.

The product of the reaction, the new compound, is then released,leaving the enzyme itself unchanged and able to cat-alyze another reaction of the same type. The reaction shown in Fig. 2-9B is a decomposition reaction. As the substrate molecule bonds to the activesite of the enzyme, strain is put on its internal bonds,which break, forming two product molecules andagain leaving the enzyme unchanged. Each enzyme isspecic in that it will catalyze only one type of reac-tion. An enzyme that digests the protein in food, forexample, has the proper shape for that reaction butcannot digest starches. For starch digestion, anotherenzyme with a differently shaped active site is needed.Thousands of chemical reactions take place within thebody, and therefore we have thousands of enzymes,each with its own shape and active site. The ability of enzymes to function may be limited or destroyed by changes in the intracellular or extra-cellular fluids in which they are found. Changes in pHand temperature are especially crucial. Recall that thepH of intracellular fluid is approximately 6.8, and thata decrease in pH means that more H /H11001ions are pres- ent. If pH decreases signicantly, the excess H/H11001ions will react with the active sites of cellular enzymes,change their shapes, and prevent them from catalyzingreactions. This is why a state of acidosis may cause thedeath of cells\u2014the cells' enzymes are unable to func-tion properly.Some Basic Chemistry 39 Table 2-5 FUNCTIONS OF PROTEINS Type of Protein Function Structural proteins Hormones Hemoglobin Myoglobin Antibodies Myosin and actin Enzymes Form pores and receptor sites in cell membranes Keratin\u2014part of skin and hair Collagen\u2014part of tendons and ligaments Insulin\u2014enables cells to take in glucose; lowers blood glucose level Growth hormone\u2014increases protein synthesis and cell division Enables red blood cells to carry oxygen Stores oxygen in muscle cells Produced by lymphocytes (white blood cells); label pathogens fordestruction Muscle structure and Catalyze reactions BOX2-4 A PROTEIN MYSTERY: PRIONS ing misfolding, which brings about deterioration of brain tissue. We do not know how to destroy prions.Prions are not living; they do not contain geneticmaterial or carry out processes that might be dis-rupted by antibiotics or antiviral medications.Standard sterilization practices that kill bacteria andviruses do not seem to inactivate prions. Prevention of prion disease depends upon keeping animal brain tissue from contaminatingmeat destined for human or animal consumption.In Great Britain, where the human form of mad-cow disease emerged and killed nearly 100 people,butchering practices are now stringently regulated.The rst cases of mad-cow disease in Canadaand the United States were found in 2003, in cattle.As of this writing, people have not yet beenaffected.Prions are proteinaceous infectious particles, the cause of lethal diseases of the nervous system inpeople and animals. Mad-cow disease is perhapsthe best known; its formal name is bovine spongi-form encephalopathy (BSE). The name tells us aboutthe disease: Encephalopathy means that the brain isaffected, and spongiform indicates that brain tissuebecomes spongy, full of holes. People may acquireBSE by eating beef contaminated with infected cowbrain tissue. They develop what is called variantCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is characterizedby loss of coordination, loss of memory and person-ality, and death within a few months. There is notreatment. How do prions cause this disease? We do not yet have the entire answer. We do know that prionschange the structure of other brain proteins, caus-The active site of the enzyme is the part that matches the shapes of the substrates. The substrates must \"t\"into the active site of the enzyme, and temporarybonds may form between the enzyme and the sub-strate. This is called the enzyme-substrate complex. Inthis case, two substrate molecules are thus broughtclose together so that chemical bonds are formed be-02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 39With respect to temperature, most human enzymes have their optimum functioning in the normal rangeof body temperature: 97 a high fever, may break the chemi- cal bonds that maintain the shapes of enzymes (seeFig. 2-9C). If an enzyme loses its shape, it is said to bedenatured , and a denatured enzyme is unable to func- tion as a catalyst. Some human enzymes, when dena-tured by a high fever, may revert to their originalshapes if the fever is lowered quickly. Others, however,will not. (An example of irreversible denaturation is ahard-boiled egg; the proteins in the egg white andyolk will never revert to what they were in the originalegg.) A high fever may cause brain damage or deathbecause enzymes in the brain have become perma- nently denatured. You already know that metals such as lead and mer- cury are harmful to humans and that both may causeserious damage to the nervous system and other bodytissues. These heavy metals are harmful to us becausethey are very reactive and block the actions of ourenzymes. Fig. 2-9D depicts what happens. Notice that the heavy metal ion bonds with part of the active site of the enzyme and changes its shape. The substratemolecule cannot t, and the enzyme is useless. Manyother chemicals are poisonous to us for the very samereason: They destroy the functioning of our enzymes,and essential reactions cannot take place.40 Some Basic Chemistry B C D Figure 2-9.

QUESTION: Which of these four pictures best represents the effect of an acidic pH on an enzyme, and why?02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 40NUCLEIC ACIDS DNA and RNA The nucleic acids , DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), are large molecules made of smaller subunits called nucleotides. A nucleotide con- sists of a pentose sugar, a phosphate group, and one ofseveral nitrogenous bases. In DNA nucleotides, the sugar is deoxyribose, and the bases are adenine, cytosine, or thymine. In RNA the bases are adenine, guanine,cytosine, or uracil. DNA and RNA molecules areshown in Fig. 2-10. Notice that DNA looks somewhatlike a twisted ladder; this ladder is two strands ofSome Basic Chemistry 41 Deoxyribose (DNA) Ribose (RNA) Phosphate strands Hydrogen bonds RNA strand Figure 2-10. DNA and RNA. Both molecules are shown, with each part of a nucleotide represented by its shape and in a different color. Note the complementary base pairing ofDNA (A-T and G-C). When RNA is synthesized, it is a complementary copy of half the DNAmolecule (with U in place of T).QUESTION: Why can't adenine pair with guanine to form a rung of the DNA ladder?02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 41nucleotides called a double helix (two coils). Alterna- ting phosphate and sugar molecules form the uprightsof the ladder, and pairs of nitrogenous bases form therungs. The size of the bases and the number of hydro-gen bonds each can form the complementary basepairing of the nucleic acids. In DNA, adenine is alwayspaired with thymine (with two hydrogen bonds), andguanine is always paired with cytosine (with threehydrogen bonds). DNA makes up the chromosomes of cells and is, therefore, the genetic code for hereditary characteris- tics. The sequence of bases in the DNA strands is actu-ally a code for the many kinds of proteins living thingsproduce; the code is the same in plants, other animals,and microbes. The sequence of bases for one protein iscalled a gene. Human genes are the codes for the pro-teins produced by human cells (though many of thesegenes are also found in all other forms of life\u2014we areall very much related). The functioning of DNA willbe covered in more detail in the next chapter. RNA is often a single strand of nucleotides (see Fig. 2-10), with uracil nucleotides in place of thyminenucleotides. RNA is synthesized from DNA in thenucleus of a cell but carries out a major function in the cytoplasm. This function is protein synthesis, which will also be discussed in the following chapter. ATP ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a specialized nucleotide that consists of the base adenine, the sugarribose, and three phosphate groups. Mention hasalready been made of ATP as a product of cell respira-tion that contains biologically useful energy. ATP is one of several \"energy transfer\" molecules withincells, transferring the potential energy in food mole-cules to cell processes. When a molecule of glucose isbroken down into carbon dioxide and water with therelease of energy, the cell uses some of this energy tosynthesize ATP . Present in cells are molecules of ADP(adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate. The energyreleased from glucose is used to loosely bond a thirdphosphate to ADP , forming ATP . When the bond ofthis third phosphate is again broken and energy isreleased, ATP then becomes the energy source for cellprocesses such as mitosis. All cells have enzymes that can remove the third phosphate group from ATP to release its energy,forming ADP and phosphate. As cell respiration con-tinues, ATP is resynthesized from ADP and phos-phate. ATP formation to trap energy from food andbreakdown to release energy for cell processes is acontinuing cycle in cells. The structure and functions of the nucleic acids are summarized in T able 2-6. SUMMARY All of the chemicals we have just described are consid-ered to be non-living, even though they are essentialparts of all living organisms. The cells of our bodiesare precise arrangements of these non-living chemi-cals and yet are considered living matter. The cellularlevel, therefore, is the next level of organization wewill examine.42 Some Basic Chemistry Table 2-6 NUCLEIC ACIDS Name Structure Function DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) RNA (ribonucleic acid) ATP (adenosine triphosphate)A double helix of nucleotides; adenine with A single adenine nucleotide with three phosphate groups Found in the chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell Is the genetic code for hereditary characteristics Copies the genetic code of DNA to direct protein synthesis in the cytoplasm of cells An energy-transferring molecule Formed when cell respiration releases energy from food molecules Used for energy-requiring cellular processes02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 42Elements 1. Elements are the simplest chemicals, which make up all matter. 2. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and calcium make up 99% of the humanbody. 3. Elements combine in many ways to form mole- cules. Atoms (see Fig. 2-1) 1. Atoms are the smallest part of an element that still retains the characteristics of the element. 2. Atoms consist of positively and negatively charged particles and neutral (or uncharged) particles. Protons have a positive charge and are found in the nucleus of the atom. Neutrons have no charge and are found in the nucleus of the atom. Electrons have a negative charge and orbit the nucleus. 3. The number and arrangement of electrons give an atom its bonding capabilities. Chemical Bonds 1. An ionic bond involves the loss of electrons by one atom and the gain of these electrons by anotheratom: Ions are formed that attract one another acids, and bases are formed by ionic bond- ing. In water, many ionic bonds break; dissociation releases ions for other reactions. 2. A covalent bond involves the sharing of electrons between two atoms (see Fig. 2-3). Oxygen gas (O2) and water (H2O) are covalently bonded molecules. Carbon always forms covalent bonds; these are the basis for the organic compounds. Covalent bonds are not weakened in an aqueous solution. 3. A disulde bond is a covalent bond between two sulfur atoms in a protein; it helps maintain thethree-dimensional shape of some proteins.4. A hydrogen bond is the attraction of a covalently bonded hydrogen to a nearby oxygen or nitrogenatom. The three-dimensional shape of proteins and nucleic acids is maintained by hydrogen bonds. Water is cohesive because of hydrogen bonds. Chemical Reactions 1. A change brought about by the formation or break- ing of chemical bonds. 2. Synthesis\u2014bonds are formed to join two or more molecules. 3. Decomposition\u2014bonds are broken within a mole- cule. Inorganic Compounds of Importance 1.

Acids, bases, and pH The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14; 7 is neutral; below 7 is acidic; above 7 is alkaline. An acid increases the H/H11001ion concentration of a solution; a base decreases the H/H11001ion concentra- tion (or increases the OH-ion concentration) (see Fig. 2-5). The pH of cells is about 6.8. The pH range of blood is 7.35 to 7.45. Buffer systems maintain normal pH by react- ing with strong acids or strong bases to changethem to substances that do not greatly changepH. The bicarbonate buffer system consists of H 2CO3 and NaHCO3. Organic Compounds of Importance 1. Carbohydrates (see T able 2-3 and Fig. 2-6). Monosaccharides are simple sugars. Glucose, a hexose sugar (C6H12O6), is the primary energy source for cell respiration. Pentose sugars are part of the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. Disaccharides are made of two hexose sugars. Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are digested tomonosaccharides and used for cell respiration. Oligosaccharides consist of from 3 to 20 mono- saccharides; they are antigens on the cell mem-brane that identify cells as \"self.\" Polysaccharides are made of thousands of glu- cose molecules. Starches are plant products broken down in digestion to glucose. Glycogen is the form in which glucose is stored in the liver and muscles. Cellulose, the ber portion of plant cells, can- not be digested but promotes efficient peristal-sis in the colon. 2. Lipids (see T able 2-4 and Fig. 2-7). T rue fats are made of fatty acids and glycerol; triglycerides are a storage form for potentialenergy in adipose tissue. The eyes and kidneysare cushioned by fat. Fatty acids may be saturatedor unsaturated. Saturated fats and hydrogenatedor trans fats contribute to atherosclerosis. Phospholipids are diglycerides such as lecithin that are part of cell membranes. Myelin is aphospholipid that provides electrical insulationfor nerve cells. Steroids consist of four rings of carbon and hydrogen. Cholesterol, produced by the liverand consumed in food, is the basic steroid fromwhich the body manufactures others: steroidhormones, vitamin D, and bile salts. 3. Proteins Amino acids are the subunits of proteins; 20 amino acids make up human proteins. Peptidebonds join amino acids to one another (see Fig.2-8). A protein consists of from 50 to thousands of amino acids in a specic sequence (primarystructure) that is folded into a specic shape (sec-ondary and tertiary structures). Some proteinsare made of two or more amino acid chains;some proteins contain trace elements. Protein functions\u2014see T able 2-5. Amino acids in excess of the need for protein synthesis are converted to simple carbohydratesor to fat, for energy production. Enzymes are catalysts, which speed up reactions without additional energy. The active site theoryis based on the shapes of the enzyme and the sub-strate molecules: These must \"t\" (see Fig. 2-9).The enzyme remains unchanged after the prod-uct of the reaction is released. Each enzyme isspecic for one type of reaction. The functioningof enzymes may be disrupted by changes in pHor body temperature or by the presence of a poi-son, which changes the shape of the active sitesof enzymes. 4. Nucleic acids (see T able 2-6 and Fig. 2-10). Nucleotides are the subunits of nucleic acids. A nucleotide consists of a pentose sugar, a phos-phate group, and a nitrogenous base. DNA is a double strand of nucleotides, coiled into a double helix, with complementary basepairing: A-T and G-C. DNA makes up thechromosomes of cells and is the genetic code forthe synthesis of proteins. RNA is a single strand of nucleotides, synthe- sized from DNA, with U in place of T. RNAfunctions in protein synthesis. ATP is a nucleotide that is specialized to trap and release energy. Energy released from food in cell respiration is used to synthesize ATP from ADP /H11001P . When cells need energy, ATP is bro- ken down to ADP /H11001P and the energy is released for cell processes.44 Some Basic Chemistry02Scanlon(p3)-ch02 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 441.

This simple statement, called the cell the-ory, was rst proposed more than 150 years ago. Youmay think of a theory as a guess or hypothesis, andsometimes this is so. A scientic theory , however, is actually the best explanation of all available evidence.All of the evidence science has gathered so far sup-ports the validity of the cell theory. Cells are the smallest living subunits of a multicel- lular organism such as a human being. A cell is a com-plex arrangement of the chemicals discussed in theprevious chapter, is living, and carries out specicactivities. Microorganisms, such as amoebas and bac-teria, are single cells that function independently.Human cells, however, must work together and func-tion interdependently. Homeostasis depends upon thecontributions of all of the different kinds of cells. Human cells vary in size, shape, and function. Most human cells are so small they can only be seen withthe aid of a microscope and are measured in unitscalled micrometers (formerly called microns). One micrometer /H110051/1,000,000 of a meter or 1/25,000 of an inch (see Appendix A: Units of Measure). Oneexception is the human ovum or egg cell, which isabout 1 millimeter in diameter, just visible to theunaided eye. Some nerve cells, although microscopicin diameter, may be quite long. Those in our arms andlegs, for example, are at least 2 feet (60 cm) long. With respect to shape, human cells vary greatly. Some are round or spherical, others rectangular, stillothers irregular. White blood cells even change shapeas they move. Cell functions also vary, and since our cells do not act independently, we will cover specialized cell func-tions as part of tissue functions in Chapter 4. Based onfunction, there are more than 200 different kinds ofhuman cells. This chapter is concerned with the basicstructure of cells and the cellular activities common toall our cells. CELL STRUCTURE Despite their many differences, human cells have sev-eral similar structural features: a cell membrane, anucleus, and cytoplasm and cell organelles. Red bloodcells are an exception because they have no nucleiwhen mature. The cell membrane forms the outerboundary of the cell and surrounds the cytoplasm, organelles, and nucleus. CELL MEMBRANE Also called the plasma membrane , the cell mem- brane is made of phospholipids, cholesterol, and pro- teins. The arrangement of these organic molecules isshown in Fig. 3-1. The phospholipids are diglyc-erides, and form a bilayer, or double layer, whichmakes up most of the membrane. Phospholipidspermit lipid-soluble materials to easily enter or leavethe cell by diffusion through the cell membrane. Thepresence of cholesterol decreases the fluidity ofthe membrane, thus making it more stable. The pro-teins have several functions: Some form channels or pores to permit passage of materials such as water or ions; others are carrier enzymes or transporters that also help substances enter the cell. Still other proteins,with oligosaccharides on their outer surface, are anti- gens , markers that identify the cells of an individual as \"self.\" Yet another group of proteins serves as recep- tor sites for hormones. Many hormones bring about their specic effects by rst bonding to a particularreceptor on the cell membrane, a receptor with theproper shape. This bonding, or t, then triggerschemical reactions within the cell membrane or theinterior of the cell (see Box 10-3 for an illustrationinvolving the hormone insulin). Many receptors for other molecules are also part of cell membranes. These molecules are part of thechemical communication networks our cells have. Anunavoidable consequence of having so many receptorsfor chemical communication is that some pathogenshave evolved shapes to match certain receptors. Forexample, HIV , the virus that causes AIDS, just hap-pens to t a particular surface receptor on our whiteblood cells. When the virus ts in, the receptorbecomes a gateway into the cell, which begins thetakeover of the cell by the virus. Most often, however, the cell membrane is a bene- cial structure. Although the cell membrane is theouter boundary of the cell, it should already be appar-ent to you that it is not a static or wall-like boundary,but rather an active, dynamic one. It is much more likea line of tollbooths than a concrete barrier. The cellmembrane is selectively permeable ; that is, certain substances are permitted to pass through and others48 Cells03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 48are not. These mechanisms of cellular transport will be covered later in this chapter. The cell membrane isof particular importance for muscle cells and nervecells because it carries electrical impulses. This will becovered in Chapters 7 and 8. NUCLEUS With the exception of mature red blood cells, allhuman cells have a nucleus. The nucleus is within the cytoplasm and is bounded by a double-layered nuclear membrane with many pores. It contains one or more nucleoli and the chromosomes of the cell (Fig. 3-2). A nucleolus is a small sphere made of DNA, RNA, and protein. The nucleoli form a type of RNA calledribosomal RNA, which becomes part of ribosomes(a cell organelle) and is involved in protein synthesis.The nucleus is the control center of the cell because it contains the chromosomes. Even with amicroscope, the 46 chromosomes of a human cell are usually not visible; they are long threads called chro- matin . Before a cell divides, however, the chromatin coils extensively into visible chromosomes. Chromo-somes are made of DNA and protein. Some chromo-somal proteins provide the structural framework forthe coiling of the chromatin into chromosomes sothat cell division can take place. Other chromosomalproteins help regulate the activity of the DNA.Remember from our earlier discussion that the DNAis the genetic code for the characteristics and activities of the cell. Although the DNA in the nucleus of each cell contains all of the genetic information for allhuman traits, only a small number of genes (a gene is the genetic code for one protein) are actually active, orCells 49 Receptor siteOutside of cell Oligosaccharide antigens CholesterolInside Protein forming a pore Phospholipid bilayer Figure 3-1.

QUESTION: The receptor site shown is probably what type of organic molecule?03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 49\"switched on,\" in a particular cell. These active genes are the codes for the proteins necessary for the speciccell type and its functions. For example, the gene forinsulin is present in all human cells, but only in certainislet cells of the pancreas is the gene active or switchedon. Only in these cells is insulin produced. How thegenetic code in chromosomes is translated into pro-teins will be covered in a later section.CYTOPLASM AND CELL ORGANELLES Cytoplasm is a watery solution of minerals, gases, organic molecules, and cell organelles that is foundbetween the cell membrane and the nucleus. Cytosol is the water portion of cytoplasm, and many chemicalreactions take place within it. Cell organelles areintracellular structures, often bounded by Figure 3-2. Generalized human cell depicting the structural components. See text and Table 3-1 for descriptions.QUESTION: How do cilia differ in structure from microvilli?03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 50membranes, that have specic functions in cellular metabolism. They are also shown in Fig. 3-2. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an extensive network of membranous tubules that extend fromthe nuclear membrane to the cell membrane. RoughER has numerous ribosomes on its surface, whereassmooth ER has no ribosomes. As a network of inter-connected tunnels, the ER is a passageway for thetransport of the materials necessary for cell functionwithin the cell. These include proteins synthesized bythe ribosomes on the rough ER, and lipids synthesizedby the smooth ER. Ribosomes are very small structures made of pro- tein and ribosomal RNA. Some are found on the sur-face of rough ER, while others float freely within thecytoplasm. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis.The proteins produced may be structural proteinssuch as collagen in the skin, enzymes, or hormonessuch as insulin that regulate cellular processes. Theseproteins may function within the cell or be secretedfrom the cell to be used elsewhere in the body. Our protein molecules are subject to damage, and some cellular proteins, especially regulatory proteins,may be needed just for a very short time. All suchproteins must be destroyed, and this is the functionof proteasomes. A proteasome is a barrel-shaped organelle made of enzymes that cut protein moleculesapart (protease enzymes). Proteins that are to be des-troyed, that is, those no longer needed or those thatare damaged or misfolded, are tagged by a proteincalled ubiquitin (sort of a cellular mop or broom) andcarried into a proteasome. The protein is snippedinto peptides or amino acids, which may be used againfor protein synthesis on ribosomes. Proteasomes areparticularly important during cell division and duringembryonic development, when great changes are tak-ing place very rapidly as cells become specialized. Many of our cells have secretory functions, that is, they produce specic products to be used elsewhere intissues. Secretion is one task of the Golgi apparatus , a series of flat, membranous sacs, somewhat likea stack of saucers. Carbohydrates are synthesizedwithin the Golgi apparatus, and are packaged, alongwith other materials, for secretion from the cell. Proteins from the ribosomes or lipids from thesmooth endoplasmic reticulum may also be secreted inthis way. T o secrete a substance, small sacs of the Golgi membrane break off and fuse with the cellmembrane, releasing the substance to the exterior ofthe cell. This is exocytosis , exomeaning \"to or spherical organelles bounded by a double membrane. The inner mem-brane has folds called cristae. Within the mitochon-dria, the aerobic (oxygen-requiring) reactions of cell respiration take place. Therefore, mitochondria arethe site of ATP (and hence energy) production. Cellsthat require large amounts of ATP , such as musclecells, have many mitochondria to meet their need forenergy. Mitochondria contain their own genes in asingle DNA molecule and duplicate themselves whena cell divides. An individual's mitochondrial DNA(mDNA) is of maternal origin, that is, from the mito-chondria that were present in the ovum, or egg cell,which was then fertilized by a sperm cell. The mito-chondria of the sperm cell usually do not enter theovum during fertilization, because they are not foundin the head of the sperm with the chromosomes (seeFig. 20-1). Lysosomes are single-membrane structures that contain digestive enzymes. When certain white bloodcells engulf bacteria, the bacteria are digested anddestroyed by these lysosomal enzymes. Worn-out cellparts and dead cells are also digested by these enzymes.This is a benecial process, and is necessary before tis-sue repair can begin. But it does have a disadvantage inthat lysosomal digestion contributes to inflammationin damaged tissues. An excess of inflammation canstart a vicious cycle, actually a positive feedback mech-anism, that results in extensive tissue damage. Many of our cells are capable of dividing, or repro- ducing, themselves. Centrioles are a pair of rod- shaped structures perpendicular to one another,located just outside the nucleus. Their function is toorganize the spindle bers during cell division. Thespindle bers are contracting proteins that pull thetwo sets of chromosomes apart, toward the ends of theoriginal cell as it divides into two new cells. Each newcell then has a full set of chromosomes. Cilia and flagella are mobile thread-like projec- tions through the cell membrane; each is anchored bya basal body just within the membrane. Cilia are usu- ally shorter than flagella, and an individual cell hasmany of them on its free surface. The cilia of a cellbeat in unison and sweep materials across the cell sur-face. Cells lining the fallopian tubes, for example, havecilia to sweep the egg cell toward the uterus. The only human cell with a flagellum is the sperm cell. The fla- gellum provides motility , or movement, for the sperm cell. Microvilli are folds of the cell membrane on the free surface of a cell. These folds greatly increase the Cells 5103Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 51surface area of the membrane, and are part of the cells lining organs that absorb materials. The small intes-tine, for example, requires a large surface area for theabsorption of nutrients, and many of its lining cellshave microvilli. Some cells of the kidney tubules alsohave microvilli (see Fig. 1-1) that provide for the effi-cient reabsorption of useful materials back to theblood. The functions of the cell organelles are summa- rized in T able 3-1. CELLULAR TRANSPORT MECHANISMS Living cells constantly interact with the blood or tis-sue fluid around them, taking in some substances andsecreting or excreting others. There are several mech-anisms of transport that enable cells to move materials into or out of the cell: diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport, ltration, phagocytosis,and pinocytosis. Some of these take place without the52 Cells Table 3-1 FUNCTIONS OF Passageway for transport of materials within the cell Synthesis of lipids Site of protein synthesis Site of destruction of old or damaged proteins Synthesis of carbohydrates Packaging of materials for secretion from the cell Site of aerobic cell respiration\u2014ATP production Contain enzymes to digest ingested material or damaged tissue Organize the spindle bers during cell division Sweep materials across the cell surface Enables a cell to move Increase a cell's surface area for absorptionexpenditure of energy by the cells. But others do require energy, often in the form of ATP . Each ofthese mechanisms is described in the following sec-tions and an example is included to show how each isimportant to the body. DIFFUSION Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concen-tration (that is, with or along a concentration gradi- ent). Diffusion occurs because molecules have free energy; that is, they are always in motion. The mole-cules in a solid move very slowly; those in a liquidmove faster; and those in a gas move faster still, suchas when ice absorbs heat energy, melts, and then evap-orates. Imagine a green sugar cube at the bottom of aglass of water (green so that we can see it). As thesugar dissolves, the sugar molecules collide with oneanother or the water molecules, and the green colorseems to rise in the glass. These collisions spread outthe sugar molecules until they are evenly dispersedamong the water molecules (this would take a verylong time), and the water eventually becomes entirelygreen. The molecules are still moving, but as some goto the top, others go to the bottom, and so on. Thus,an equilibrium (or steady state) is reached. Diffusion is a very slow process, but may be an effective transport mechanism across microscopic dis-tances. Within the body, the gases oxygen and carbondioxide move by diffusion. In the lungs, for example,there is a high concentration of oxygen in the alveoli(air sacs) and a low concentration of oxygen in theblood in the surrounding pulmonary capillaries (seeFig. 3-3). The opposite is true for carbon dioxide: alow concentration in the air in the alveoli and a highconcentration in the blood in the pulmonary capillar-ies. These gases diffuse in opposite directions, eachmoving from where there is more to where there isless. Oxygen diffuses from the air to the blood to becirculated throughout the body. Carbon dioxide dif-fuses from the blood to the air to be exhaled. OSMOSIS Osmosis may be simply dened as the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane.That is, water will move from an area with more waterpresent to an area with less water. Another way to saythis is that water will naturally tend to move to an areawhere there is more dissolved material, such as salt or03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 52sugar. If a 2% salt solution and a 6% salt solution are separated by a membrane allowing water but not saltto pass through it, water will diffuse from the 2% saltsolution to the 6% salt solution. The result is that the2% solution will become more concentrated, and the6% solution will become more dilute. In the body, the cells lining the small intestine absorb water from digested food by osmosis. Thesecells have rst absorbed salts, have become more \"salty,\" and water follows salt into the cells (see Fig.3-3). The process of osmosis also takes place in thekidneys, which reabsorb large amounts of water (manygallons each day) to prevent its loss in urine. Box 3-1:T erminology of Solutions lists some terminology weuse when discussing solutions and the effects of vari-ous solutions on cells.Cells 53 BOX3-1 TERMINOLOGY OF SOLUTIONS Human cells or other body fluids contain many dis- solved substances (called solutes ) such as salts, sugars, acids, and bases. The concentration ofsolutes in a fluid creates the osmotic pressure of the solution, which in turn determines the move-ment of water through membranes. As an example here, we will use sodium chloride (NaCl). Human cells have an NaCl concentration of0.9%. With human cells as a reference point, the relative NaCl concentrations of other solutions maybe described with the following terms: Isotonic \u2014a solution with the same salt concentra- tion as in cells. The blood plasma is isotonic to red blood cells.Hypotonic \u2014a solution with a lower salt concentra- tion than in cells. Distilled water (0% salt) is hypotonic to human cells. Hypertonic \u2014a solution with a higher salt concen- tration than in cells. Seawater (3% salt) is hypertonic to human cells.Refer now to the diagrams shown in Box Figure 3-A of red blood cells (RBCs )in each of these different types of solutions, andnote the effect of each on osmosis: When RBCs are in plasma, water moves intoand out of them at equal rates, and the cellsremain normal in size and water content. If RBCs are placed in distilled water, morewater will enter the cells than leave, and thecells will swell and eventually burst. If RBCs are placed in seawater, more water willleave the cells than enter, and the cells willshrivel and die. This knowledge of osmotic pressure is used when replacement fluids are needed for a patientwho has become dehydrated. Isotonic solutionsare usually used; normal saline and Ringer's solu-tion are examples. These will provide rehydrationwithout causing osmotic damage to cells orextensive shifts of fluid between the blood andtissues. Box Figure 3-A Red blood cells in different solutions and the effect of osmosis in each.03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:42 AM Page 53FACILITATED DIFFUSION The word facilitate means to help or assist. In facili- tated diffusion , molecules move through a membrane from an area of greater concentration to an area oflesser concentration, but they need some help to dothis. In the body, our cells must take in glucose to use for ATP production. Glucose, however, will not diffusethrough most cell membranes by itself, even if there ismore outside the cell than inside. Diffusion of glucoseinto most cells requires a glucose transporter , which may also be called a carrier enzyme . These trans- porters are proteins that are part of the cell mem-brane. Glucose bonds to the transporter (see Fig. 3-3),and by doing so changes the shape of the protein. Thisphysical change propels the glucose into the interiorof the cell. Other transporters are specic for otherorganic molecules such as amino acids. ACTIVE TRANSPORT Active transport requires the energy of ATP to move molecules from an area of lesser concentration to anarea of greater concentration. Notice that this is theopposite of diffusion, in which the free energy of mol-ecules causes them to move to where there are fewerof them. Active transport is therefore said to be move-ment against a concentration gradient.In the body, nerve cells and muscle cells have \"sodium pumps\" to move sodium ions (Na /H11001) out of the cells. Sodium ions are more abundant outside thecells, and they constantly diffuse into the cell (throughspecic diffusion channels), their area of lesser con-centration (see Fig. 3-3). Without the sodium pumpsto return them outside, the incoming sodium ionswould bring about an unwanted nerve impulse ormuscle contraction. Nerve and muscle cells constantlyproduce ATP to keep their sodium pumps (and simi-lar potassium pumps) working and prevent sponta-neous impulses. Another example of active transport is the absorp- tion of glucose and amino acids by the cells liningthe small intestine. The cells use ATP to absorb thesenutrients from digested food, even when their intra-cellular concentration becomes greater than theirextracellular concentration. FILTRATION The process of ltration also requires energy, but the energy needed does not come directly from ATP . It isthe energy of mechanical pressure. Filtration meansthat water and dissolved materials are forced througha membrane from an area of higher pressure to an areaof lower pressure. In the body, blood pressure is created by the54 Cells Table 3-2 CELLULAR TRANSPORT MECHANISMS Mechanism Denition Example in the Body Diffusion Osmosis Facilitated diffusionActive transport Filtration Phagocytosis PinocytosisMovement of molecules from an area of greater concentration to an area oflesser concentration.

Which depends on the move- ment of a cell?03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 55pumping of the heart. Filtration occurs when blood flows through capillaries, whose walls are only onecell thick and very permeable. The blood pressure incapillaries is higher than the pressure of the surround-ing tissue fluid. In capillaries throughout the body,blood pressure forces plasma (water) and dissolvedmaterials through the capillary membranes into thesurrounding tissue spaces (see Fig. 3-3). This cre-ates more tissue fluid and is how cells receive glu-cose, amino acids, and other nutrients. Blood pressurein the capillaries of the kidneys also brings aboutltration, which is the rst step in the formation ofurine. PHAGOCYTOSIS AND PINOCYTOSIS These two processes are similar in that both involve acell engulng something, and both are forms of endo- cytosis endo meaning \"to take into\" a cell. An exam- ple of phagocytosis is a white blood cell engulng bacteria. The white blood cell flows around the bac-terium (see Fig. 3-3), taking it in and eventuallydigesting it. Digestion is accomplished by the enzymesin the cell's lysosomes. Other cells that are stationary may take in small molecules that become adsorbed or attached to theirmembranes. The cells of the kidney tubules reabsorbsmall proteins by pinocytosis (see Fig. 3-3) so that the protein is not lost in urine. T able 3-2 summarizes the cellular transport mech- anisms.THE GENETIC CODE AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS The structure of DNA, RNA, and protein wasdescribed in Chapter 2. We will review some of theessentials here, and go a step further with a simpledescription of how all of these organic molecules areinvolved in the process of protein synthesis. DNA AND THE GENETIC CODE DNA is a double strand of nucleotides in the form of a double helix , very much like a spiral ladder. The uprights of the ladder are made of alternating phos-phate groups and deoxyribose sugar molecules. Therungs of the ladder are made of the four nitrogenousbases, always found in complementary pairs: adeninewith thymine (A-T) and guanine with cytosine (G-C).Although DNA contains just these four bases, thebases may be arranged in many different sequences(reading up or down the ladder). It is the sequence ofbases, the sequence of A, T, C, and G, that is thegenetic code . The DNA of our 46 chromosomes may also be called our genome , which is the term for the total genetic information in a particular species. Thehuman genome is believed to contain about 3 billionbase pairs, and the number of our genes is now esti-mated to be between 20,000 and 25,000 (or perhaps asmany as 30,000, but much lower than previouslythought).56 Cells Table 3-3 PROTEIN SYNTHESIS Molecule or Organelle Function DNA mRNA (messenger RNA) Ribosomes tRNA (transfer RNA) A double strand (helix) of nucleotides that is the genetic code in the chromosomes of cells. A gene is the sequence of bases (segment of DNA) that is the code for one protein. A single strand of nucleotides formed as a complementary copy of a gene in the DNA.

See text for further description.QUESTION: A tRNA molecule has two attachment sites; what is each for?03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 57Recall that in Chapter 2 you read that a gene is the genetic code for one protein. This is a simplication,and the functioning of genes is often much more com-plex. We have genes with segments that may be shuf-fled or associated in many combinations, with thepotential for coding for many more proteins. A fullexplanation is beyond the scope of our book, so for thesake of simplicity, and in the following discussion, wewill say that a gene is the code for one protein. Recalltoo that a protein is a specic sequence of amino acids.Therefore, a gene, or segment of DNA, is the code forthe sequence of amino acids in a particular protein. The code for a single amino acid consists of three bases in the DNA molecule; this triplet of bases may be called a codon (see Fig. 3-4). There is a triplet of bases in the DNA for each amino acid in the protein.If a protein consists of 100 amino acids, the gene forthat protein would consist of 100 triplets, or 300 bases.Some of the triplets will be the same, since the sameamino acid may be present in several places within theprotein. Also part of the gene are other triplets thatstart and stop the process of making the protein,rather like capital letters or punctuation marks startand stop sentences. RNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS RNA , the other nucleic acid, has become a surprising molecule, in that it has been found to have quite a fewfunctions. It may be involved in the repair of DNA,and it is certainly involved in gene expression . The expression of a gene means that the product of thegene is somehow apparent to us, in a way we can seeor measure, or is not apparent when it should be.Examples would be having brown eyes or blue eyes, orhaving or not having the intestinal enzyme lactase todigest milk sugar. Although these functions of RNAare essential for us, they too are beyond the scope ofour book, so the roles of RNA in the process of pro-tein synthesis will be our focus. The transcription and translation of the genetic code in DNA into proteins require RNA. DNA isfound in the chromosomes in the nucleus of the cell,but protein synthesis takes place on the ribosomes inthe cytoplasm. Messenger RNA (mRNA ) is the intermediary molecule between these two sites. When a protein is to be made, the segment of DNA that is its gene uncoils, and the hydrogen bondsbetween the base pairs break (see Fig. 3-4). Withinthe nucleus are RNA nucleotides (A, C, G, U) andenzymes to construct a single strand of nucleotidesthat is a complementary copy of half the DNA gene(with uracil in place of thymine). This process is tran- scription , or copying, and the copy of the gene is mRNA, which now has the codons for the amino acidsof the protein, and then separates from the DNA. Thegene coils back into the double helix, and the mRNAleaves the nucleus, enters the cytoplasm, and becomesattached to ribosomes. As the copy of the gene, mRNA is a series of triplets of bases; each triplet is a codon, the code for oneamino acid. Another type of RNA, called transfer RNA (tRNA ), is also found in the cytoplasm. Each has an anticodon , The tRNAmolecules pick up specic amino acids (which havecome from protein in our food) and bring them totheir proper triplets on the mRNA. This process istranslation ; that is, it is as if we are translating from one language to another\u2014the language of nucleotidebases to that of amino acids. The ribosomes containenzymes to catalyze the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids. When an amino acid hasbeen brought to each triplet on the mRNA, andall peptide bonds have been formed, the protein isnished. The protein then leaves the ribosomes and may be transported by the endoplasmic reticulum to whereverit is needed in the cell, or it may be packaged by theGolgi apparatus for secretion from the cell. A sum-mary of the process of protein synthesis is found inT able 3-3. Thus, the expression of the genetic code may be described by the following sequence: Each of us is the sum total of our genetic charac- teristics. Blood type, hair color, muscle proteins, nervecells, and thousands of other aspects of our structureand functioning have their basis in the genetic code of DNA. If there is a \"mistake\" in the DNA, that is, incorrect bases or triplets of bases, this mistake will be copied bythe mRNA. The result is the formation of a malfunc-tioning or non-functioning protein. This is called agenetic or hereditary disease , and a specic example is described in Box 3-2: Genetic Disease\u2014Sickle-CellAnemia. DNA RNA Proteins: Structural Enzymes Page 5859 BOX3-2 GENETIC DISEASE\u2014SICKLE-CELL ANEMIA Normal hemoglobin Normal red blood cells (RBCs) Sickle red blood cellsSickle hemoglobin (HbS)Deo xygenatio n Iron in heme Box Figure Structure of hemo- globin A and sickle-cell hemoglobin andtheir effect on red blood cells.Agenetic disease is a hereditary disorder, one that may be passed from generation to generation.Although there are hundreds of genetic diseases,they all have the same basis: a mistake in DNA.Because DNA makes up the chromosomes that arefound in eggs and sperm, this mistake may bepassed from parents to children. Sickle-cell anemia is the most common genetic disorder among people of African descent andaffects the hemoglobin in red blood cells. Normalhemoglobin, called hemoglobin A (HbA), is a pro-tein made of two alpha chains (141 amino acidseach) and two beta chains (146 amino acids each).In sickle-cell hemoglobin (HbS), the sixth aminoacid in each beta chain is incorrect; valine instead ofthe glutamic acid found in HbA. This minor\u2014only 2 incorrect amino acids out ofmore than 500\u2014but the consequences for the per-son are very serious. HbS has a great tendency to crystallize when oxygen levels are low, as is true in capillaries. WhenHbS crystallizes, the red blood cells are deformedinto crescents (sickles) and other irregular shapes.These irregular, rigid red blood cells clog and rup- ture capillaries, causing internal bleeding andsevere pain. These cells are also fragile and break upeasily, leading to anemia and hypoxia (lack of oxy-gen). Treatment of this disease has improvedgreatly, but it is still incurable. What has happened to cause the formation of HbS rather than HbA? Hemoglobin is a protein; thegene for its beta chain is in DNA (chromosome 11).One amino acid in the beta chains is incorrect,therefore, one triplet in its DNA gene must be, andis, incorrect. This mistake is copied by mRNA in thecells of the red bone marrow, and HbS is synthe-sized in red blood cells. Sickle-cell anemia is a recessive genetic disease, which means that a person with one gene for HbSand one gene for HbA will have \"sickle-cell trait.\"Such a person usually will not have the severeeffects of sickle-cell anemia, but may pass the genefor HbS to children. It is estimated that 9% trait 10:43 AM Page 59CELL DIVISION Cell division is the process by which a cell reproduces itself. There are two types of cell division, mitosis andmeiosis. Although both types involve cell reproduc-tion, their purposes are very different. MITOSIS Each of us began life as one cell, a fertilized egg. Eachof us now consists of billions of cells produced by theprocess of mitosis. In mitosis , one cell with the diploid number of chromosomes (the usual number, 46 for people) divides into two identical cells, eachwith the diploid number of chromosomes. This pro-duction of identical cells is necessary for the growth ofthe organism and for repair of tissues (see also Box3-3: Abnormal Cellular Functioning\u2014Cancer). Before mitosis can take place, a cell must have two complete sets of chromosomes, because each new cellmust have the diploid number. The process of DNA replication enables each chromosome (in the form of chromatin) to make a copy of itself. The time duringwhich this takes place is called interphase , the time between mitotic divisions. Although interphase issometimes referred to as the resting stage, restingmeans \"not dividing\" rather than \"inactive.\" The cellis quite actively producing a second set of chromo-somes and storing energy in ATP . The long, thin, and invisible chromatin molecules then begin to coil very precisely and extensively, and if we were looking at the nucleus of a living cell under a microscope, we would see the duplicated chromo-somes appear. Each would look somewhat like the let-ter X, because the original DNA molecule and its copy (now called chromatids) are still attached. The stages of What happens in each of these stages is described in T able 3-4. As you read theevents of each stage, refer to Fig. 3-5, which depictsmitosis in a cell with a diploid number of four. As mentioned previously, mitosis is essential for repair of tissues, to replace damaged or dead cells.Some examples may help illustrate this. In severalareas of the body, mitosis takes place constantly. Thesesites include the epidermis of the skin, the stomachlining, and the red bone marrow. For each of thesesites, there is a specic reason why this constant mito-sis is necessary. What happens to the surface of the skin? The dead,outer cells are worn off by contact with the environ- ment. Mitosis of the epidermal cells in the lower liv-ing layer replaces these cells, and the epidermismaintains its normal thickness. The stomach lining, although internal, is also con- stantly worn away. Gastric juice, especially hydrochlo-ric acid, is very damaging to cells. Rapid mitosis of theseveral kinds of lining cells replaces damaged cells andkeeps the stomach lining intact. One of the functions of red bone marrow is the production of red blood cells. Because red blood cellshave a life span of only about 120 days, new ones areneeded to replace the older ones that die. Very rapidmitosis in the red bone marrow produces approxi-mately 2 million new red blood cells every second.These dividing cells in the red bone marrow areamong the stem cells present in the body. A stem cell is an unspecialized cell that may develop into severaldifferent kinds of cells. Stem cells in the red bone mar-row may become red blood cells, white blood cells, orplatelets. These marrow stem cells are often calledadult stem cells, and many, if not all, of the body'sorgans have such cells. Embryonic stem cells will bedescribed in a later chapter; these are cells in which allof the DNA still has the potential to be active. Theymay become any of the more than 200 different kindsof human cells. The stem cells found in the umbilicalcords of newborns are between the adult and embry-onic cells in terms of their potential. It is also important to be aware of the areas of the body where mitosis does not take place. In an adult,most muscle cells and neurons (nerve cells) do notreproduce themselves. If they die, their functions arealso lost. Someone whose spinal cord has been severedwill have paralysis and loss of sensation below the levelof the injury. The spinal cord neurons do not undergomitosis to replace the ones that were lost, and such aninjury is permanent. Skeletal muscle cells are capable of limited mitosis for repair. The heart is made of cardiac muscle cells,which, like neurons, seem to be incapable of mitosis. Aheart attack (myocardial infarction) means that a por-tion of cardiac muscle dies because of lack of oxygen.These cells are not replaced, and the heart will be aless effective pump. If a large enough area of the heartmuscle dies, the heart attack may be fatal. Some research has found evidence for the potential for mitosis after damage in both the central nervoussystem and the heart. Such cell division may be that ofneurons or muscle cells that were stimulated to divide 60 Cells03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 60by chemicals from the adjacent damaged tissue. Or the dividing cells may be stem cells that are among thespecialized cells. (A region of the brain called the hip-pocampus, which is necessary to form new memories,seems to have cells capable of division.) At present wedo not have denitive knowledge, but we do know thatfor most people with heart damage or central nervous system injury, mitosis does not take place, or not suf- ciently enough to replace the cells that have died andpreserve or restore normal functioning of the organ.Research is continuing, and may eventually nd the stimulus necessary to produce extended mitosis thatwould bring about true tissue repair. MEIOSIS Meiosis is a more complex process of cell division that results in the formation of gametes , which are egg and sperm cells. In meiosis, one cell with the diploidnumber of chromosomes divides twice to form fourCells 61 BOX3-3 ABNORMAL CELLULAR FUNCTIONING\u2014CANCER the trigger is believed to be infection with certain viruses that cause cellular mutations. Carriers ofhepatitis B virus, for example, are more likely todevelop primary liver cancer than are people whohave never been exposed to this virus. Research hasdiscovered two genes, one on chromosome 2 andthe other on chromosome 3, that contribute to acertain form of colon cancer. Both of these genesare the codes for proteins that correct the \"mis-takes\" that may occur when the new DNA is syn-thesized. When these repair proteins do notfunction properly, the mistakes (mutations) in theDNA lead to the synthesis of yet other faulty pro-teins that impair the functioning of the cell and pre-dispose it to becoming malignant. Once cells have become malignant, their func- tioning cannot return to normal, and though theimmune system will often destroy such cells, some-times it does not, especially as we get older.Therefore, the treatments for cancer are directed atremoving or destroying the abnormal cells. Surgery to remove tumors, radiation to destroy cells, and chemotherapy to stop cell division or interfere with other aspects of cell metabolism are all aspectsof cancer treatment. New chemotherapy drugs are becoming more specic, with very precise targets. For example, thecells of several types of solid-tumor cancers havebeen found to have mutations in the gene for thecell membrane receptor for a natural growth factor(epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR). Thesealtered receptors, when triggered by their usualgrowth factor, then cause the cell to divide uncon-trollably, an abnormal response. Medications thattarget only these altered receptors have alreadybeen developed for some forms of lung cancer andbreast cancer. Not only do they show promise intreating the cancer, they do not have the sideeffects of other forms of chemotherapy.There are more than 200 different types of cancer , all of which are characterized by abnormal cellularfunctioning. Normally, our cells undergo mitosisonly when necessary and stop when appropriate. Acut in the skin, for example, is repaired by mitosis,usually without formation of excess tissue. The newcells ll in the damaged area, and mitosis slowswhen the cells make contact with surrounding cells.This is called contact inhibition, which limits thenew tissue to just what is needed. Malignant (cancer) cells, however, are characterized by uncon-trolled cell division. Our cells are genetically pro-grammed to have particular life spans and to divideor die. One gene is known to act as a brake on celldivision; another gene enables cells to live inde-nitely, beyond their normal life span, and to keepdividing. Any imbalance in the activity of thesegenes may lead to abnormal cell division. Such cellsare not inhibited by contact with other cells, keepdividing, and tend to spread. A malignant tumor begins in a primary site such as the colon, then may spread or metastasize. Oftenthe malignant cells are carried by the lymph orblood to other organs such as the liver, where sec-ondary tumors develop. Metastasis is characteris- tic only of malignant cells; benign tumors do not metastasize but remain localized in their primarysite. What causes normal cells to become malignant? At present, we have only partial answers. A malig-nant cell is created by a mutation , a genetic change that brings about abnormal cell functionsor responses and often leads to a series of muta-tions. Environmental substances that cause muta-tions are called carcinogens . One example is the tar found in cigarette smoke, which is denitely acause of lung cancer. Ultraviolet light may alsocause mutations, especially in skin that is overex-posed to sunlight. For a few specic kinds of cancer, 03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 61cells, each with the haploid number (half the usual number) of chromosomes. In women, meiosis takesplace in the ovaries and is called oogenesis . In men, meiosis takes place in the testes and is called sper- matogenesis . The differences between oogenesis and spermatogenesis will be discussed in Chapter 20, TheReproductive Systems. The egg and sperm cells produced by meiosis havethe haploid number of chromosomes, which is 23 for humans. Meiosis is sometimes called reduction divi-sion because the division process reduces the chromo-some number in the egg or sperm. Then, duringfertilization , in which the egg unites with the sperm, the 23 chromosomes of the sperm plus the 23 chro-mosomes of the egg will restore the diploid numberof 46 in the fertilized egg.

AGING AND CELLS Multicellular organisms, including people, age andeventually die; our cells do not have innite life spans.It has been proposed that some cells capable of mito-sis are limited to a certain number of divisions; that is,every division is sort of a tick-tock off a biologicalclock. We do not yet know exactly what this cellularbiological clock is. There is evidence that the ends ofchromosomes, called telomeres, may be an aspect of it.With each cell division, part of the telomeres is lost(rather like a piece of rope fraying at both ends), and eventually the telomeres are gone. With the next divi- sion, the ends of the chromosomes, actual genes,begin to be lost. This may be one signal that a cell's lifespan has come to an end (there are probably many dif-ferent kinds of signals). Cellular aging also involves the inevitable deterio- ration of membranes and cell organelles. Just as theparts of a car break down in time, so too will cells.Unlike cars or machines, however, cells can oftenrepair themselves, but they do have limits. As cellsage, structural proteins break down and are notreplaced, or necessary enzymes are not synthesized.Proteins called chaperones , which are responsiblefor the proper folding of many other proteins and for the repair or disposal of damaged proteins, nolonger function as well as cells age. Without chaper-ones, damaged proteins accumulate within cells anddisrupt normal cellular processes. Clinical manifesta-tions of impaired chaperones include cataracts (seeBox 9-1) and such Box 8-7), and Huntington's disease (seeT able 21-4). Much about the chemistry of the aging process remains a mystery, though we can describe what hap-pens to organs and to the body as a whole. Each of thefollowing chapters on body systems provides a briefdiscussion of how aging affects the system. Keep inmind that a system is the sum of its cells, in tissues andorgans, and that all aging is ultimately at the cellularlevel. SUMMARY As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, humancells work closely together and function interdepend-ently. Each type of human cell makes a contribution tothe body as a whole. Usually, however, cells do notfunction as individuals, but rather in groups. Groupsof cells with similar structure and function form a tis-sue, which is the next level of organization.Cells 63 Table 3-4 STAGES OF MITOSIS Stage Events Prophase Metaphase AnaphaseTelophaseCytokinesis1. The chromosomes coil up and become visible as short rods. Each chromosome is really two chromatids (original DNA plus its copy) still attached at a region called the centromere. 2. The nuclear membrane disappears.3. The centrioles move toward opposite poles of the cell and organize the spindle bers, which extend across the equator of the cell. 1. The pairs of chromatids line up along the equator of the cell. The centromere of each pair is attached to a spindle ber. 2. The centromeres now divide. 1. Each chromatid is now considered a separate chromosome; there are two complete and separate sets. 2. The spindle bers contract and pull the chromosomes, one set toward each pole of the cell. 1. The sets of chromosomes reach the poles of the cell and become indistinct as their DNA uncoils to form chromatin. 2. A nuclear membrane re-forms around each set of chromosomes. 1. The cytoplasm divides; new cell membrane is formed.03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 63Human cells vary in size, shape, and function. Our cells function interdependently to main-tain homeostasis. Cell Structure\u2014the major parts of a cell are the cell membrane, nucleus (except matureRBCs), cytoplasm, and cell organelles1. Cell membrane\u2014the selectively permeable bound- ary of the cell (see Fig. 3-1). Phospholipids permit diffusion of lipid-soluble materials. Cholesterol provides stability. Proteins form channels, transporters, \"self\" anti- gens, and receptor sites for hormones or othersignaling molecules. 2. Nucleus\u2014the control center of the cell; has a double-layer membrane. Nucleolus\u2014forms ribosomal RNA. Chromosomes\u2014made of DNA and protein; DNA is the genetic code for the structure andfunctioning of the cell. A gene is a segment ofDNA that is the code for one protein. Humancells have 46 chromosomes, and their geneticinformation is called the genome. 3. Cytoplasm\u2014a watery solution of minerals, gases, and organic molecules; contains the cell organelles;site for many chemical reactions. 4. Cell organelles\u2014intracellular structures with spe- cic functions (see T able 3-1 and Fig. 3-2). Cellular Transport Mechanisms\u2014the proces- ses by which cells take in or secrete or excrete materials through the selectivelypermeable cell membrane (see Fig. 3-3 andTable 3-2).1. Diffusion\u2014movement of molecules from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser con-centration; occurs because molecules have freeenergy: They are constantly in motion. Oxygenand carbon dioxide are exchanged by diffusion inthe lungs and tissues. 2. Osmosis\u2014the diffusion of water. Water diffuses to an area of less water, that is, to an area of more dis-solved material. The small intestine absorbs waterfrom digested food by osmosis. Isotonic, hyper-tonic, and hypotonic (see Box 3-1). 3. Facilitated diffusion\u2014transporters (carrier enzymes) that are part of the cell membrane permitcells to take in materials that would not diffuse bythemselves. Most cells take in glucose by facilitated diffusion. 4. Active transport\u2014a cell uses ATP to move sub- stances from an area of lesser concentration to anarea of greater concentration. Nerve cells and mus-cle cells have sodium pumps to return Na /H11001ions to the exterior of the cells; this prevents spontaneousimpulses. Cells of the small intestine absorb glu-cose and amino acids from digested food by activetransport. 5. Filtration\u2014pressure forces water and dissolved materials through a membrane from an area ofhigher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Tissue fluid is formed by ltration: Blood pressure forces plasma and dissolved nutrients out of capillariesand into tissues. Blood pressure in the kidney cap-illaries creates ltration, which is the rst step inthe formation of urine. 6. Phagocytosis\u2014(a form of endocytosis) a moving cell engulfs something; white blood cells phagocy-tize bacteria to destroy them. 7. Pinocytosis\u2014(a form of endocytosis) a stationary cell engulfs small molecules; kidney tubule cellsreabsorb small proteins by pinocytosis. The Genetic Code and Protein Synthesis (see Fig. 3-4 and Table 3-3)1. DNA and the genetic code DNA is a double helix with complementary base pairing: A-T and G-C. The sequence of bases in the DNA is the genetic code for proteins. The triplet code: three bases (a codon) is the code for one amino acid. A gene consists of all the triplets that code for a single protein. 2. RNA and protein synthesis T ranscription\u2014mRNA is formed as a comple- mentary copy of the sequence of bases in a gene(DNA). mRNA moves from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. tRNA molecules (in the cytoplasm) have codons for the triplets on the mRNA. T ranslation\u2014tRNA molecules bring amino acids to their proper triplets on the mRNA. Ribosomes contain enzymes to form peptide bonds between the amino acids. 3. Expression of the genetic code64 Cells STUDY OUTLINE03Scanlon(p3)-ch03 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 64 DNA RNA proteins (structural proteins and enzymes that catalyze reactions) heredi- tary characteristics. A genetic disease is a \"mistake\" in the DNA, which is copied by mRNA and results in a mal-functioning protein. Cell Division 1. Mitosis\u2014one cell with the diploid number of chro- mosomes divides once to form two cells, each withthe diploid number of chromosomes (46 forhumans). DNA replication forms two sets of chromosomes during interphase. Stages of mitosis (see Fig. 3-5 and T able 3-4): prophase, metaphase, fol- lowing telophase. Mitosis is essential for growth and for repair and replacement of damaged cells. Most adult nerve and muscle cells seem unable to divide; their loss may involve permanent loss offunction. 2. Meiosis\u2014one cell with the diploid number of chro- mosomes divides twice to form four each withthe haploid number of chromosomes (23 forhumans). Oogenesis in the ovaries forms egg cells. Spermatogenesis in the testes forms sperm cells. Fertilization of an egg by a sperm restores the diploid number in the fertilized egg.Cells 65 REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

The tissue contributes to the function-ing of the organs in which it is found. You may recallthat in Chapter 1 the four major groups of tissues werenamed and very briefly described. These four groupsare epithelial, connective, muscle, and nerve tissue. This chapter presents more detailed descriptions of the tissues in these four categories. For each tissue, itsfunctions are related to the organs of which it is a part.Also in this chapter is a discussion of membranes , which are sheets of tissues. As you might expect, eachtype of membrane has its specic locations and func-tions. EPITHELIAL TISSUE Epithelial tissues are found on surfaces as either cov- erings (outer surfaces) or linings (inner surfaces).Because they have no capillaries of their own, epithe-lial tissues receive oxygen and nutrients from theblood supply of the connective tissue beneath them.Many epithelial tissues are capable of secretion andmay be called glandular epithelium, or more simply,glands .Classication of the epithelial tissues is based on the type of cell of which the tissue is made, its charac-teristic shape, and the number of layers of cells. Thereare three distinctive shapes: squamous cells are flat, cuboidal cells are cube shaped, and columnar cells are tall and narrow. \" Simple \" is the term for a single layer of cells, and \" stratied \" means that many layers of cells are present (Fig. 4-1). SIMPLE SQUAMOUS EPITHELIUM Simple squamous epithelium is a single layer of flat cells (Fig. 4-2). These cells are very thin and verysmooth\u2014these are important physical characteristics.The alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs are simple squamousepithelium. The thinness of the cells permits the dif-fusion of gases between the air and blood. Another location of this tissue is capillaries, the smallest blood vessels. Capillary walls are only one cellthick, which permits the exchange of gases, nutrients,and waste products between the blood and tissue fluid.The interior surface of capillaries is also very smooth(and these cells continue as the lining of the arteries,veins, and heart); this is important because it preventsabnormal blood clotting within blood vessels.70 Tissues and Membranes ColumnarCuboidalSquamous Simple Shapes Figure 4-1. Classication of epithelial tissues based on the shape of the cells and the number of layers of cells. QUESTION: Which of these might be best for effi- cient consists of many layers of mostly flat cells, although lower cells arerounded. Mitosis takes place in the lowest layer tocontinually produce new cells to replace those wornoff the surface (see Fig. 4-2). This type of epitheliummakes up the epidermis of the skin, where it is called\"keratinizing\" because the protein keratin is produced,and the surface cells are dead. Stratied squamousepithelium of the non-keratinizing type lines the oralcavity, the esophagus, and, in women, the vagina. Inthese locations the surface cells are living and make upthe mucous membranes of these organs. In all of its body locations, this tissue is a barrier to microorgan-isms because the cells of which it is made are veryclose together. The more specialized functions of theepidermis will be covered in the next chapter. TRANSITIONAL EPITHELIUM Transitional epithelium is a type of stratied epithe- lium in which the surface cells change shape fromround to squamous. The urinary bladder is lined withtransitional epithelium. When the bladder is empty,the surface cells are rounded (see Fig. 4-2). As theTissues and Membranes 71 Free surface Example: Urinary (approximately 430X) C A Figure 4-2. Epithelial tissues. ( A) Simple squamous. ( B) Stratified squamous. (C) Transitional.

T ransitional epithelium enables the bladder to ll and stretch with-out tearing the lining. SIMPLE CUBOIDAL EPITHELIUM Simple cuboidal epithelium is a single layer of cube- shaped cells (Fig. 4-3). This type of tissue makes upthe functional units of the thyroid gland and salivaryglands. These are examples of glandular epithelium ; their function is secretion . In these glands the cuboidal cells are arranged in small spheres and secreteinto the cavity formed by the sphere. In the thyroidgland, the cuboidal epithelium secretes the thyroidhormones; thyroxine is an example. In the salivaryglands the cuboidal cells secrete saliva. Cuboidalepithelium also makes up portions of the kidney tubules. Here the cells have microvilli (see Fig. 1-1),and their function is the reabsorption of useful materi-als back to the blood. SIMPLE COLUMNAR EPITHELIUM Columnar cells are taller than they are wide and arespecialized for secretion and absorption . The stom- ach lining is made of columnar epithelium that secretes gastric juice for digestion. The lining of thesmall intestine (see Fig. 4-3) secretes digestiveenzymes, but these cells also absorb the end productsof digestion from the cavity of the intestine into theblood and lymph. T o absorb efficiently, the columnarcells of the small intestine have microvilli , which you72 and Simple columnar. ( C) Ciliated.

These microscopic foldsgreatly increase the surface area for absorption. Yet another type of columnar cell is the goblet cell , which is a unicellular gland. Goblet cells secretemucus and are found in the lining of the intestines and the lining of parts of the respiratory tract such asthe trachea. Mucous membranes epithelium consists of columnar cells that have cilia on their free surfaces (see Fig. 4-3). Recall from Chapter 3 that the function of cilia is to sweepmaterials across the cell sweep mucus, with trappeddust and bacteria from the inhaled air, toward thepharynx to be swallowed. Bacteria are then destroyedby the hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The air thatreaches the lungs is almost entirely free of pathogensand particulate pollution. Another location of ciliated epithelium in women is the lining of the fallopian tubes. The cilia here sweepthe ovum, which has no means of self-locomotion,toward the uterus. The epithelial tissues are summarized in T able 4-1.GLANDS Glands are cells or organs that secrete something; that is, they produce a substance that has a functioneither at that site or at a more distant site. Unicellular Glands Unicellular means \"one cell.\" Goblet cells are an example of unicellular glands. As mentioned earlier,goblet cells are found in the lining of the respiratoryand digestive tracts. Fibrosis). Multicellular Glands Most glands are made of many similar cells, or of avariety of cells with their secretions mingled into acollective secretion. Multicellular glands may be two major groups: exocrine glands andendocrine glands. Exocrine glands have ducts (tubes) to take the secretion away from the gland to the site of its func- tion. Salivary glands, for example, secrete saliva that iscarried by ducts to the oral cavity. Sweat glands secrete sweat that is transported by ducts to the skin surface,where it can be evaporated by excess body heat. Thegastric glands of the stomach lining contain differentkinds of cells (see Fig. 16-5), which produceTissues and Membranes 73 Table 4-1 TYPES OF EPITHELIAL TISSUE Type Structure Location and Function Simple squamous Stratied squamousTransitional Cuboidal Columnar CiliatedOne layer of flat cells layers of cells; surface cells flat; lower cells rounded; lower layer undergoes mitosis Many layers of cells; surface cells change from rounded to flat One layer of cube-shaped cells One layer of column-shaped cells One layer of columnar cells with cilia on their free surfaces Alveoli of the lungs\u2014thin to permit diffusion of gases Capillaries\u2014thin to permit exchanges of materials; smooth to prevent abnormal blood clotting Epidermis\u2014surface cells are dead; a barrier to pathogens Lining of esophagus, vagina\u2014surface cells are living; a barrier to pathogens Lining of urinary bladder\u2014permits expansion without tearing the gland\u2014secretes thyroxine Salivary glands\u2014secrete saliva Kidney tubules\u2014permit reabsorption of useful materials back to the blood Lining of stomach\u2014secretes gastric juice Lining of small intestine\u2014secretes enzymes and absorbs end products of digestion (microvilli present) Lining of trachea\u2014sweeps mucus and dust to toward the enzyme pepsin. Both of these secretions are part of gastric juice. Endocrine glands are ductless glands. The secre- tions of endocrine glands are a group of chemicalscalled hormones , which enter capillaries and are cir- culated throughout the body. Hormones then bringabout specic effects in their target organs. Theseeffects include aspects of growth, use of minerals andother nutrients, and regulation of blood pressure, andwill be covered in more detail in Chapter 10.Examples of endocrine glands are the thyroid gland,adrenal glands, and pituitary gland. The pancreas is an organ that is both an exocrine and an endocrine gland. The exocrine portions secretedigestive enzymes that are carried by ducts to theduodenum of the small intestine, their site of action.The endocrine portions of the pancreas, called pan-creatic islets or islets of Langerhans, secrete the hor-mones insulin and glucagon directly into the blood. CONNECTIVE TISSUE There are several kinds of connective tissue , some of which may at rst seem more different than alike. Thetypes of connective tissue include areolar, adipose,brous, and elastic tissue as well as blood, bone, andcartilage; these are summarized in T able 4-2. A char-acteristic that all connective tissues have in common isthe presence of a matrix in addition to cells. Thematrix is a structural network or solution of non- living intercellular material. Each connective tissuehas its own specic kind of matrix. The matrix ofblood, for example, is blood plasma, which is mostlywater. The matrix of bone is made primarily of cal-cium salts, which are hard and strong. As each type ofconnective tissue is described in the following sec-tions, mention will be made of the types of cells pres-ent as well as the kind of matrix. BLOOD Although blood is the subject of Chapter 11, a brief description will be given here. Blood consists of cellsand plasma; cells are the living portion. The matrix ofblood is plasma , which is about 52% to 62% of the total blood volume in the body. The water of plasmacontains dissolved salts, nutrients, gases, and wasteproducts. As you might expect, one of the primaryfunctions of plasma is transport of these materialswithin the body. Blood cells are produced from stem cells in the red bone marrow, the body's primary hemopoietic tissue (blood-forming tissue), which is found in flat andirregular bones such as the hip bone and vertebrae.The blood cells are red blood cells, platelets, and thefive kinds of white blood cells: in lymphatic Tissues the lung cells to produce copious thick mucus, an ideal growth environment for bac-teria. Defensive white blood cells cannot getthrough the thick mucus, and their activity mistak-enly destroys lung tissue. A person with CF hasclogged bronchial tubes, frequent episodes ofpneumonia, and, ultimately, lungs that cannot carryout gas exchange. CF is a chronic, progressive dis-ease that is eventually fatal unless a lung transplantis performed. CF is one of several disorders believed to be cor- rectable by gene therapy, but because it involveshuman subjects, this kind of work proceeds veryslowly.Cystic brosis (CF) is a genetic disorder (there are many forms) of certain exocrine glands includingthe salivary glands, the sweat glands, the pancreas,and the mucous glands of the respiratory tract. In the pancreas, thick mucus clogs the ducts and prevents pancreatic enzymes from reaching thesmall intestine, thus impairing digestion, especiallyof fats. But the most serious effects of CF are in thelungs. The genetic mistake in CF often involves agene called CFTR, which codes for chloride ionchannels (proteins) in the membranes of epithelialcells. In the lungs, the defective channels aredestroyed (by proteasomes), which causes a changein the composition of the tissue fluid around thecells. This change inactivates defensin, a naturalantibiotic produced by lung tissue. In the absence of04Scanlon(p3)-ch04 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 74the lymph nodes, and the thymus gland. The thymus also contains stem cells, but they produce only asubset of lymphocytes. Stem cells are present in thespleen and lymph nodes as well, though the number oflymphocytes they produce is a small fraction of thetotal. The blood cells make up 38% to 48% of the total blood, and each type of cell has its specic function.Red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen bonded to the iron in their hemoglobin. White blood cells (WBCs) destroy pathogens by phagocytosis, the production ofantibodies, or other chemical methods, and provide uswith immunity to some diseases. Platelets prevent blood loss; the process of blood clotting involvesplatelets.AREOLAR CONNECTIVE TISSUE The cells of areolar (or loose ) connective tissue are called broblasts . A blast cell is a \"producing\" cell, and broblasts produce protein bers. Collagen bers are very strong; elastin bers are elastic, that is, able to return to their original length, or recoil, after beingstretched. These protein bers and tissue fluid makeup the matrix, or non-living portion, of areolar con-nective tissue (see Fig. 4-4). Also within the matrix aremast cells that release inflammatory chemicals whentissue is damaged, and many white blood cells, whichare capable of self-locomotion. Their importance hereis related to the locations of areolar connective tissue. Areolar tissue is found beneath the dermis theTissues and Membranes 75 BloodAreolar ( C) Adipose. QUESTION: What is the matrix of blood, and what is found in adipocytes?04Scanlon(p3)-ch04 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 75skin and beneath the epithelial tissue of all the body systems that have openings to the environment. Recallthat one function of white blood cells is to destroypathogens. How do pathogens enter the body? Manydo so through breaks in the skin. Bacteria and virusesalso enter with the air we breathe and the food we eat,and some may get through the epithelial linings of therespiratory and digestive tracts and cause tissue dam-age. Areolar connective tissue with its mast cells andmany white blood cells is strategically placed to inter-cept pathogens before they get to the blood and circu-late throughout the body. ADIPOSE TISSUE The cells of adipose tissue are called adipocytes and are specialized to store fat in microscopic droplets.T rue fats are the chemical form of long-term energystorage. Excess nutrients have calories that are notwasted but are converted to fat to be stored for usewhen food intake decreases. Any form of excess calo-ries, whether in the form of fats, carbohydrates, oramino acids from protein, may be changed to triglyc-erides and stored. The amount of matrix in adipose tissue is small and consists of tissue fluid and a few col-lagen bers (see Fig. 4-4). Most fat is stored subcutaneously in the areolar connective tissue between the dermis and the muscles.This layer varies in thickness among individuals; themore excess calories consumed, the thicker the layer.As mentioned in Chapter 2, adipose tissue also cush-ions organs such as the eyes and kidneys. Recent research has discovered that adipose tissue does much more than provide a cushion or storeenergy. Adipose tissue is now considered an endocrinetissue, because it produces at least one hormone.Leptin is an appetite-suppressing hormone secretedby adipocytes to signal the hypothalamus in the brainthat fat storage is sufficient (see also Chapter 17).When leptin secretion diminishes, appetite increases.Adipocytes secrete at least two chemicals that helpregulate the use of insulin in glucose and fat metabo-lism. Adipose tissue is also involved in inflammation,the body's rst response to injury, in that it producescytokines, chemicals that activate white blood cells.Our adipose tissue is not simply an inert depository ( B) Cartilage. ( C) Bone. QUESTION: What is the matrix of brous tissue, and of bone?04Scanlon(p3)-ch04 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 76fat, rather it is part of the complex systems that ensure we are nourished properly or that protect us frompathogens that get through the skin. FIBROUS CONNECTIVE TISSUE Fibrous connective tissue consists mainly of parallel (regular) collagen bers with a few broblasts scat-tered among them (Fig. 4-5). This parallel arrange-ment of collagen provides great strength, yet isflexible. The locations of this tissue are related tothe need for flexible strength. The outer walls of arter-ies are reinforced with brous connective tissue, because the blood in these vessels is under high pres-sure. The strong outer wall prevents rupture of theartery (see also Box 4-2: Vitamin C and Collagen).T endons and ligaments are made of brous connectivetissue. T endons connect muscle to bone; ligamentsconnect bone to bone. When the skeleton is moved,these structures must be able to withstand the greatmechanical forces exerted upon them. Fibrous connective tissue has a relatively poor blood supply, which makes repair a slow process.

An irregular type of brous connective tissue forms the dermis of the skin and the fasciae (membranes)around muscles. Although the collagen bers here arenot parallel to one another, the tissue is still strong.The dermis is different from other brous connectivetissue in that it has a good blood supply (see also Box4-3: Cosmetic Collagen). ELASTIC CONNECTIVE TISSUE As its name tells us, elastic connective tissue is pri- marily elastin bers. One of its locations is in the wallsof large arteries. These vessels are stretched when theheart contracts and pumps blood, then they recoil, orsnap back, when the heart relaxes. This recoil helps keep the blood moving away from the heart, and isimportant to maintain normal blood pressure. Elastic connective tissue is also found surrounding the alveoli of the lungs. The elastic bers are stretchedduring inhalation, then recoil during exhalation tosqueeze air out of the lungs. If you pay attention toyour breathing for a few moments, you will notice thatnormal exhalation does not require \"work\" or energy.This is because of the normal elasticity of the lungs. BONE The prex that designates bone is \"osteo,\" so bonecells are called osteocytes . The matrix of bone is made of calcium salts and collagen and is strong, hard,78 Tissues and Membranes BOX4-2 VITAMIN C AND COLLAGEN Many people take extra vitamin C, for various rea- sons. Vitamin C has several functions, and an im-portant one is the synthesis of collagen. Imagine the protein collagen as a ladder with three uprights and rungs that connect adjacentuprights. Vitamin C is essential for forming the\"rungs,\" without which the uprights will not staytogether as a strong unit. Collagen formed in theabsence of vitamin C is weak, and the effects ofweak collagen are dramatically seen in the diseasecalled scurvy.In 1753 James Lind, a Scottish surgeon, recom- mended to the British Navy that lime juice be takenon long voyages to prevent scurvy among thesailors. Scurvy is characterized by bleeding gumsand loss of teeth, poor healing of wounds, fractures,and bleeding in the skin, joints, and elsewhere inthe body. The lime juice did prevent this potentiallyfatal disease, as did consumption of fresh fruits andvegetables, although at the time no one knew why.Vitamin C was nally isolated in the laboratory in1928. BOX4-3 COSMETIC COLLAGEN system as foreign tissue. More seriously, an autoim- mune response may be triggered in some individu-als, and the immune system may begin to destroythe person's own connective tissue. In an effort to avoid these problems, some cos- metic surgeons now use the person's own collagenand fat, which may be extracted from the thigh, hip, or abdomen. The long-term consequences and outcomes of such procedures have yet to be evalu-ated. We might remember that for many years theuse of silicone injections had been considered safe.Silicone injections are now banned by the FDA,since we now know that they carry signicant riskof serious tissue damage.Collagen is the protein that makes tendons, liga- ments, and other connective tissues strong. In 1981,the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvedthe use of cattle collagen by injection for cosmeticpurposes, to minimize wrinkles and scars. Indeed,collagen injected below the skin will flatten outdeep facial wrinkles and make them less prominent, and many people have had this seemingly simple cosmetic surgery. There are, however, drawbacks. Injected colla- gen lasts only a few months; the injections must berepeated several times a year, and they are expen-sive. Some people have allergic reactions to the cat-tle collagen, which is perceived by the immune04Scanlon(p3)-ch04 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 78and not flexible. In the shafts of long bones such as the femur, the osteocytes, matrix, and blood vessels arein very precise arrangements called haversian sys- tems or osteons (see Fig. 4-5). Bone has a good blood supply, which enables it to serve as a storage site forcalcium and to repair itself relatively rapidly after asimple fracture. Some bones, such as the sternum(breastbone) and pelvic bone, contain red bone mar-row, the primary hemopoietic tissue that producesblood cells. Other functions of bone tissue are related to the strength of bone matrix. The skeleton supports thebody, and some bones protect internal organs frommechanical injury. A more complete discussion ofbone is found in Chapter 6. CARTILAGE The protein-carbohydrate matrix of cartilage does not contain calcium salts, and also differs from that ofbone in that it contains more water, which makes itresilient. It is rm, yet smooth and flexible. Cartilageis found on the joint surfaces of bones, where itssmooth surface helps prevent friction. The tip of thenose and external ear are supported by flexible carti-lage. The wall of the trachea, the airway to the lungs,contains rm rings of cartilage to maintain an open airpassageway. Discs of cartilage are found between thevertebrae of the spine. Here the cartilage is a rmcushion; it absorbs shock and permits movement. Within the cartilage matrix are the chondrocytes , or cartilage cells (see Fig. 4-5). There are no capillar-ies within the cartilage matrix, so these cells are nour-ished by diffusion through the matrix, a slow process.This becomes clinically important when cartilage isdamaged, for repair will take place very slowly or notat all. Athletes sometimes damage cartilage within theknee joint. Such damaged cartilage is usually surgicallyremoved in order to preserve as much joint mobility aspossible. MUSCLE TISSUE Muscle tissue is specialized for contraction. When muscle cells contract, they shorten and bring aboutsome type of movement. There are three types ofmuscle tissue: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac (T able4-3). The movements each can produce have very dif-ferent purposes.SKELETAL MUSCLE Skeletal muscle may also be called striated muscle or voluntary muscle. Each name describes a particular aspect of this tissue, as you will see. The skeletal mus-cle cells are cylindrical, have several nuclei each, andappear striated, or striped (Fig. 4-6). The striationsare the result of the precise arrangement of the con-tracting proteins within the cells. Skeletal muscle tissue makes up the muscles that are attached to bones. These muscles are suppliedwith motor nerves, and thus move the skeleton. Theyalso produce a signicant amount of heat, which isimportant to help maintain the body's constant tem-perature. Each muscle cell has its own motor nerveending. The nerve impulses that can then travel to themuscles are essential to cause contraction. Althoughwe do not have to consciously plan all our movements,the nerve impulses for them originate in the cere-brum, the \"thinking\" part of the brain. Let us return to the three names for this tissue: \"skeletal\" describes its location, \"striated\" describes itsappearance, and \"voluntary\" describes how it func-tions. The skeletal muscles and their functioning arethe subject of Chapter 7. SMOOTH MUSCLE Smooth muscle may also be called involuntary mus- cle or visceral muscle. The cells of smooth muscle have tapered ends, a single nucleus, and no striations(see Fig. 4-6). Although nerve impulses do bringabout contractions, this is not something most of uscan control, hence the name involuntary . The term vis- ceral refers to internal organs, many of which contain smooth muscle. The functions of smooth muscle areactually functions of the organs in which the muscle isfound. In the stomach and intestines, smooth muscle con- tracts in waves called peristalsis to propel foodthrough the digestive tract. In the walls of arteries andveins, smooth muscle constricts or dilates the vesselsto maintain normal blood pressure. The iris of the eyehas two sets of smooth muscle bers to constrict ordilate the pupil, which regulates the amount of lightthat strikes the retina. Other functions of smooth muscle are mentioned in later chapters. This is an important tissue that youwill come across again and again in our study of thehuman body.Tissues and Membranes Skeletal.

They are branched, have one nucleus each,and have faint striations. The cell membranes at theends of these cells are somewhat folded and t intomatching folds of the membranes of the next cells.(Interlock the ngers of both hands to get an idea ofwhat these adjacent membranes look like.) Theseinterlocking folds are called intercalated discs , and permit the electrical impulses of muscle contraction topass swiftly from cell to cell. This enables the heart tobeat in a very precise wave of contraction from theupper chambers to the lower chambers. Cardiac mus-cle as a whole is called the myocardium , and forms the walls of the four chambers of the heart. Its func-tion, therefore, is the function of the heart, to pumpblood. The contractions of the myocardium createblood pressure and keep blood circulating throughoutthe body, so that the blood can carry out its manyfunctions. Cardiac muscle cells have the ability to contract by themselves. Thus the heart maintains its own beat.The role of nerve impulses is to increase or decreasethe heart rate, depending upon whatever is neededby the body in a particular situation. We will return tothe heart in Chapter 12. NERVE TISSUE Nerve tissue consists of nerve cells called neurons and some specialized cells found only in the nervoussystem. The nervous system has two divisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheralnervous system (PNS). The brain and spinal cord arethe organs of the CNS. They are made of neurons andspecialized cells called neuroglia. The CNS and theneuroglia are discussed in detail in Chapter 8. ThePNS consists of all of the nerves that emerge fromthe CNS and supply the rest of the body. These nervesare made of neurons and specialized cells calledSchwann cells. The Schwann cells form the myelinsheath to electrically insulate neurons. Neurons are capable of generating and transmit- ting electrochemical impulses. There are many differ-ent kinds of neurons, but they all have the same basicstructure (Fig. 4-7). The cell body contains the nucleus and is essential for the continuing life of theneuron. An axon is a process (the term \"process\" here means \"something that sticks out,\" a cellular exten-sion) that carries impulses away from the cell body; aneuron has only one axon. Dendrites are processes that carry impulses toward the cell body; a neuronmay have several dendrites. A nerve impulse travelsalong the cell membrane of a neuron, and is electrical,but where neurons meet there is a small space called asynapse , which an electrical impulse cannot cross. At a synapse, between the axon of one neuron and thedendrite or cell body of the next neuron, impulsetransmission depends upon chemicals called neuro- transmitters . A summary of nerve tissue is found in T able 4-4, and each of these aspects of nerve tissue iscovered in more detail in Chapter 8. Nerve tissue makes up the brain, spinal cord, andTissues and Membranes 81 Table 4-4 NERVE TISSUE Part Structure Function Neuron (nerve cell) Cell bodyAxonDendrites Synapse Neurotransmitters Neuroglia Schwann cellsContains the nucleus Cellular process (extension) Cellular process (extension) Space between axon of one neuron and the dendrite or cell body of the next neuron Chemicals released by axons Specialized cells in the central nervous system Specialized cells in the peripheral nervous system Regulates the functioning of the neuron Carries impulses away from the cell body Carry impulses toward the cell body Transmits impulses from one neuron to others Transmit impulses across synapses Form myelin sheaths and other functions Form the myelin sheaths around neurons04Scanlon(p3)-ch04 8/17/06 10:43 AM Page 81peripheral nerves. As you can imagine, each of these organs has very specic functions. For now, we willjust mention the categories of the functions of nervetissue. These include feeling and interpreting sensa-tion, initiation of movement, the rapid regulation ofbody functions such as heart rate and breathing, andthe organization of information for learning and memory. MEMBRANES Membranes are sheets of tissue that cover or line sur- faces or that separate organs or parts (lobes) of organsfrom one another. Many membranes produce secre-tions that have specic functions. The two major egories membranes are epithelial membranes andconnective tissue membranes. There are two types of epithelial membranes, serousand mucous. Each type is found in specic locationswithin the body and secretes a fluid. These serous fluid and mucus. that line some closed body cavities andcover the organs in these cavities (Fig. pleura lines the chest walland the pleura covers the lungs. (Notice thatlinemeans \"on the inside\" and cover means \"on the outside.\" These terms cannot be used interchangeably,because each indicates a different location.) The pleu-ral membranes secrete serous fluid , which prevents friction between them as the lungs expand and recoilduring breathing. The heart, in the thoracic cavity between the lungs, has its own set of serous membranes. The parietalpericardium lines the brous the visceral pericardium,or epicardium , is on the surface of the heart muscle (see also Fig. 12-1). Serous fluid is produced to pre-vent friction as the heart beats. In the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum is the serous membrane that lines the cavity. The mesen- tery, or visceral peritoneum, is folded over and covers the abdominal organs. Here, the serous fluid preventsfriction as the stomach and intestines contract andslide against other organs (see also Fig. 16-4). Mucous Membranes Mucous membranes line the body tracts (systems) that have openings to the environment. These are therespiratory, digestive, urinary, and ( mucosa ) varies with the different organs involved. The mucosaof the esophagus and of the vagina is of the ciliatedepithelium; mucosa of the stomach is columnarepithelium.82 Tissues and Membranes Figure 4-7.

Remember that these areliving cells, and if they dry out, they will die. In thedigestive tract, mucus also lubricates the surface topermit the smooth passage of food. In the respiratorytract the mucus traps dust and bacteria, which are thenswept to the pharynx by ciliated epithelium.CONNECTIVE TISSUE MEMBRANES Many membranes are made of connective tissue.Because these will be covered with the organ systemsof which they are a part, their locations and functionsare summarized in T able 4-5. AGING AND TISSUES As mentioned in the previous chapter, aging takesplace at the cellular level, but of course is apparent inthe groups of cells we call tissues. In muscle tissue, forexample, the proteins that bring about contractiondeteriorate and are not repaired or replaced. The sameis true of collagen and elastin, the proteins of connec-tive tissue such as the dermis of the skin. Other aspectsof the aging of tissues will be more meaningful to you in the context of the functions of organs and systems, so we will save those for the following chapters. SUMMARY The tissues and membranes described in this chapterare more complex than the individual cells of whichthey are made. However, we have only reached an intermediate level with respect to the structural and functional complexity of the body as a whole. The fol-lowing chapters are concerned with the organ systems,the most complex level. In the descriptions of theorgans of these systems, you will nd mention of thetissues and their contributions to each organ andorgan system.84 Tissues and Membranes Table 4-5 CONNECTIVE adipose tissue stores fat Covers each bone; contains blood vessels that enter the bone Anchors tendons and ligaments Covers cartilage; contains capil- laries, the only blood supply for cartilage Lines joint cavities; secretes syn- ovial fluid to prevent frictionwhen joints move Covers each skeletal muscle; anchors tendons Cover the brain and spinal cord; contain cerebrospinal fluid Forms a sac around the heart; lined by the serous parietal peri- cardium STUDY OUTLINE A tissue is a group of cells with similar struc- ture and function.

The skin ismade of several different tissue types and is consideredan organ. Because the skin covers the surface of thebody, one of its functions is readily apparent: It sepa-rates the internal environment of the body from theexternal environment and prevents the entry of manyharmful substances. The subcutaneous tissue directlyunderneath the skin connects it to the muscles and hasother functions as well. THE SKIN The two major layers of the skin are the outerepidermis and the inner dermis . Each of these layers is made of different tissues and has very different func-tions. EPIDERMIS The epidermis is made of stratied squamous epithelial tissue and is thickest on the palmsand soles. The cells that are most abundant are calledkeratinocytes , and there are no capillaries present between them. Although the epidermis may be furthersubdivided into four or ve sublayers, two of these areof greatest importance: the innermost layer, the stra-tum germinativum, and outermost layer, the stra-tum corneum (Fig. 5-1). Stratum Germinativum The stratum germinativum may also be called the stratum basale. Each name tells us something aboutthis layer. T o germinate means \"to sprout\" base of the epidermis, theinnermost layer in which mitosis takes place. New cells are continually being produced, pushing theolder cells toward the skin surface. These cells pro-duce the protein keratin , and as they get farther away from the capillaries in the dermis, they die. As deadcells are worn off the skin's surface, they are replacedby cells from the lower layers. Scattered among thekeratinocytes of the stratum germinativum are verydifferent cells called Merkel cells (or Merkel discs);these are receptors for the sense of touch (Fig. 5-2).The living keratinocytes are able to synthesize antimicrobial peptides called defensins; these andother chemicals are produced following any injury tothe skin, as part of the process of inflammation.Defensins rupture the membranes of pathogens suchas bacteria that may enter by way of breaks in the skin. The living portion of the epidermis also produces a vitamin; the cells have a form of cholesterol that, onexposure to ultraviolet light, is changed to vitamin D(then modied by the liver and kidneys to the mostactive form, called 1,25-D, or calcitriol, which is con-sidered a hormone). This is why vitamin D is some-times referred to as the \"sunshine vitamin.\" Peoplewho do not get much sunlight depend more on nutri-tional sources of vitamin D, such as fortied milk. Butsunlight is probably the best way to get vitamin D, and15 minutes a day a few times a week is often enough.Vitamin D is important for the absorption of calciumand phosphorus from food in the small intestine; thisfunction has been known for years. Recent research,however, suggests that vitamin D is also involved inmaintaining muscle strength, especially in elderly peo-ple, in the functioning of insulin, and in some immuneresponses, where it may be protective for some typesof cancer. Stratum Corneum The stratum corneum , the outermost epidermal layer, consists of many layers of dead cells; all that isleft is their keratin . The protein keratin is relatively waterproof, and though the stratum corneum shouldnot be thought of as a plastic bag encasing the body, itdoes prevent most evaporation of body water. Also ofimportance, keratin prevents the entry of water. With-out a waterproof stratum corneum, it would be impos-sible to swim in a pool or even take a shower withoutdamaging our cells. The stratum corneum is also a barrier to pathogens and chemicals. Most bacteria and other microorgan-isms cannot penetrate unbroken skin. The flaking ofdead cells from the skin surface helps remove micro-organisms, and the fatty acids in sebum help inhibittheir growth. Most chemicals, unless they are corro-sive, will not get through unbroken skin to the livingtissue within. One painful exception is the sap of poi-son ivy. This resin does penetrate the skin and initiatesan allergic reaction in susceptible people. The inflam-matory response that characterizes allergies causes90 The Integumentary System05Scanlon(p3)-ch05 8/17/06 10:44 AM Page 90blisters and severe itching. The importance of the stratum corneum becomes especially apparent when itis lost (see Box 5-1: Burns). Certain minor changes in the epidermis are undoubtedly familiar to you. When rst wearing newshoes, for example, the skin of the foot may be sub-jected to friction. This will separate layers of the epi-dermis, or separate the epidermis from the dermis, and tissue fluid may collect, causing a blister . If the skin is subjected to pressure, the rate of mitosis in thestratum germinativum will increase and create athicker call this a callus . Although cal- luses are more common on the palms and soles, they may occur on any part of the skin.The Integumentary System 91 Sebaceous gland Receptor for touch germinativum endingNerve Arteriole Venule Figure 5-1.

BOX5-1 BURNS Burns of the skin may be caused by flames, hot water or steam, sunlight, electricity, or corrosivechemicals. The severity of burns ranges from minorto fatal, and the classication of burns is based onthe extent of damage. First-Degree Burn \u2014only the supercial epidermis is burned, and is painful but not blistered. Light-colored skin will appear red due to localizedvasodilation in the damaged area. Vasodilation is part of the inflammatory response that brings moreblood to the injured site.Second-Degree Burn \u2014deeper layers of the epi- dermis are affected. Another aspect of inflam- mation is that damaged cells release histamine , which makes capillaries more permeable. Moreplasma leaves these capillaries and becomes tissuefluid, which collects at the burn site, creating blis-ters. The burned skin is often very painful.Third-Degree Burn \u2014the entire epidermis is charred or burned away, and the burn may extendinto the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Often sucha burn is not painful at rst, if the receptors in thedermis have been destroyed.Extensive third-degree burns are potentially life- threatening because of the loss of the stratum corneum. Without this natural barrier, living tissue isexposed to the environment and is susceptible toinfection and dehydration. Bacterial infection is a serious problem for burn patients; the pathogens may get into the blood(septicemia ) and quickly spread throughout the body. Dehydration may also be fatal if medicalintervention does not interrupt and correct thefollowing sequence: Tissue fluid evaporates fromthe burned surface, and more plasma is pulledout of capillaries into the tissue spaces. As moreplasma is lost, blood volume and blood pressuredecrease. This is called circulatory shock ; eventu- ally the heart simply does not have enough bloodto pump, and heart failure is the cause of death. Toprevent these serious consequences, third-degreeburns are covered with donor skin or articial skinuntil skin grafts of the patient's own skin can be putin place.

Langerhans Cells Within the epidermis are Langerhans cells , which are also called dendritic cells because of their branched appearance when they move (see Fig. 5-2).These cells originate in the red bone marrow, and arequite mobile. They are able to phagocytize foreignmaterial, such as bacteria that enter the body throughbreaks in the skin. With such ingested pathogens, theLangerhans cells migrate to lymph nodes and presentthe pathogen to lymphocytes, a type of white bloodcell. This triggers an immune response such as theproduction of antibodies (antibodies are proteins that label foreign material for destruction). Because of itsposition adjacent to the external environment, the skinis an important component of the body's protectiveresponses, though many of the exact aspects of thishave yet to be determined. Immunity is covered inChapter 14. Melanocytes Another type of cell found in the lower epidermis isthe melanocyte, which is also shown in Fig. 5-2.05Scanlon(p3)-ch05 8/17/06 10:44 AM Page 93Melanocytes produce another protein, a pigment called melanin . People of the same size have approxi- mately the same number of melanocytes, though thesecells may differ in their level of activity. In people withdark skin, the melanocytes continuously produce largeamounts of melanin. The melanocytes of light-skinned people produce less melanin. The activity ofmelanocytes is genetically regulated; skin color is oneof our hereditary characteristics. In all people, melanin production is increased by exposure of the skin to ultraviolet rays, which are partof sunlight and are damaging to living cells. As moremelanin is produced, it is taken in by the epidermalcells as they are pushed toward the surface. This gives the skin a darker color, which prevents further expo-sure of the living stratum germinativum to ultravioletrays. People with dark skin already have good protec-tion against the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays;people with light skin do not (see Box 5-2: PreventingSkin Cancer: Common Sense and Sunscreens).Melanin also gives color to hair, though its protectivefunction is conned to the hair of the head. T wo partsof the eye obtain their color from melanin: the iris andthe interior choroid layer of the eyeball (the eye is dis-cussed in Chapter 9).The functions of the epidermisand its cells are summarized in T able 5-1. 94 The Integumentary System BOX5-2 PREVENTING SKIN CANCER: COMMON SENSE AND SUNSCREENS B AAnyone can get skin cancer, and the most impor- tant factor is exposure to sunlight. Light-skinnedpeople are, of course, more susceptible to theeffects of ultraviolet (UV) rays, which may triggermutations in living epidermal cells. Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carci- noma (see A in Box Fig. 5-B) are the most commonforms of skin cancer. The lesions are visible aschanges in the normal appearance of the skin, andabiopsy (microscopic examination of a tissue spec- imen) is used to conrm the diagnosis. These lesionsusually do not metastasize rapidly, and can be completely removed using simple procedures Malignant melanoma (see B in Box Fig. 5-B) is a more serious form of skin cancer, which begins inmelanocytes. Any change in a pigmented spot ormole ( nevus ) should prompt a person to see a doc- tor. Melanoma is serious not because of its growthin the skin, but because it may metastasize very rapidly to the lungs, liver, or other vital organ. Researchers are testing individualized vaccines for people who have had melanoma. The purpose ofthe vaccine is to stimulate the immune systemstrongly enough to prevent a second case, for such recurrences are often fatal. Although the most common forms of skin cancer are readily curable, prevention is a better strategy.We cannot, and we would not want to, stay out ofthe sun altogether (because sunlight may be thebest way to get sufficient vitamin D), but we maybe able to do so when sunlight is most damaging.During the summer months, UV rays are especiallyintense between 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. If we are or must be outdoors during this time, dermatologistsrecommend use of a sunscreen. Sunscreens contain chemicals such as PABA (para-amino benzoic acid) that block UV rays andprevent them from damaging the epidermis. AnSPF (sun protection factor) of 15 or higher is con-sidered good protection. Use of a sunscreen onexposed skin not only helps prevent skin cancer butalso prevents sunburn and its painful effects. It isespecially important to prevent children from get-ting severely sunburned, because such burns havebeen linked to the development of skin cancer yearslater.

Fibroblasts pro-duce collagen and elastin bers. are strong, and elastin bers are able torecoil after being stretched. Strength and elasticity aretwo characteristics of the dermis. With increasing age,however, the deterioration of the elastin bers causesthe skin to lose its elasticity. We can all look forwardto at least a few wrinkles as we get older. The uneven junction of the dermis with the epider- mis is called the papillary layer (see Fig. 5-1). Capil- laries are abundant here to nourish not only thedermis but also the stratum germinativum. The epi-dermis has no capillaries of its own, and the lower, liv-ing cells depend on the blood supply in the dermis foroxygen and nutrients. Within the dermis are the accessory skin structures: hair and nail follicles, sensory receptors, and severaltypes of glands. Some of these project through theepidermis to the skin surface, but their active portionsare in the dermis. Hair Follicles Hair follicles are made of epidermal tissue, and the growth process of hair is very similar to growth of theepidermis. At the base of a follicle is the hair root , which contains cells called the matrix , where mitosis takes place (Fig. 5-3). The new cells produce keratin,get their color from melanin, then die and becomeincorporated into the hair shaft , which is pushed toward the surface of the skin. The hair that we comband brush every day consists of dead, keratinized cells.The rate of hair growth averages 0.3 to 0.4 in./month(8 to 10 mm). Compared to some other mammals, humans do not have very much hair. The actual functions of humanhair are quite few. Eyelashes and eyebrows help tokeep dust and perspiration out of the eyes, and thehairs just inside the nostrils help to keep dust out ofthe nasal cavities. Hair of the scalp does provide insu-lation from cold for the head. The hair on our bodies,however, no longer serves this function, but we havethe evolutionary remnants of it. Attached to each hairfollicle is a small, smooth muscle called the pilomotorThe Integumentary System 95 Hair shaft Follicle Hair rootB Capillary Venule Fat cells A Figure 5-3.

When stimulated by cold or emotions such as fear, these muscles pull the hair fol-licles upright. For an animal with fur, this would trapair and provide greater insulation. Because people donot have thick fur, all this does for us is give us \"goosebumps.\" Nail Follicles Found on the ends of ngers and toes, nail follicles produce nails just as hair follicles produce hair. Mitosistakes place in the nail root at the base of the nail (Fig. 5-4), and the new cells produce keratin (a strongerform of this protein than is found in hair) and then die.Although the nail itself consists of keratinized deadcells, the flat nail bed is living epidermis and dermis.This is why cutting a nail too short can be quitepainful. Nails protect the ends of the ngers and toesfrom mechanical injury and give the ngers greaterability to pick up small objects. Fingernails are alsogood for scratching. This is more important than itmay seem at rst. An itch might mean the presence ofan arthropod parasite, mosquito, tick, flea, or louse.These parasites (all but the tick are insects) feed on blood, and all are potential vectors of diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, or protozoa. A quick and vigorousscratch may kill or at least dislodge the arthropod andprevent the transmission of the disease. Fingernailsgrow at the rate of about 0.12 in./month (3 mm), andgrowth is a little faster during the summer months.Receptors Most sensory receptors for the cutaneous senses are found in the dermis (Merkel cells are in the stra-tum germinativum, as are some nerve endings). Thecutaneous senses are touch, pressure, heat, cold, andpain. For each sensation there is a specic type ofreceptor, which is a structure that will detect a partic-ular change. For pain, heat, and cold, the receptors arefree nerve endings . For touch and pressure, the receptors are called encapsulated nerve endings , which means there is a cellular structure around thesensory nerve ending (see Fig. 5-1). The purpose ofthese receptors and sensations is to provide the centralnervous system with information about the externalenvironment and its effect on the skin. This informa-tion may stimulate responses, such as washing apainful cut finger, scratching an insect bite, orresponding to a feeling of cold by putting on a sweater. The sensitivity of an area of skin is determined by how many receptors are present. The skin of the n- gertips, for example, is very sensitive to touch becausethere are many receptors per square inch. The skin ofthe upper arm, with few touch receptors per squareinch, is less sensitive. When receptors detect changes, they generate nerve impulses that are carried to the brain, whichinterprets the impulses as a particular sensation.Sensation, therefore, is actually a function of the brain(we will return to this in Chapters 8 and 9). Glands Glands are made of epithelial tissue. The exocrine glands of the skin have their secretory portions in thedermis. Some of these are shown in Fig. 5-1. Sebaceous Glands. The ducts of sebaceous glands open into hair follicles or directly to the skin surface.Their secretion is sebum , a lipid substance that we commonly refer to as oil. As mentioned previously,sebum inhibits the growth of bacteria on the skin sur-face. Another function of sebum is to prevent drying ofskin and hair. The importance of this may not be read-ily apparent, but skin that is dry tends to crack moreeasily. Even very small breaks in the skin are potentialentryways for bacteria. Decreased sebum production isanother consequence of getting older, and elderly peo-ple often have dry and more fragile skin. Adolescents may have the problem of overactive sebaceous glands.

Because sebaceous glands are more numerous aroundthe nose and mouth, these are common sites of pim-ples in young people (see also Box 5-3: Common SkinDisorders).Ceruminous Glands. These glands are located in the dermis of the ear canals. Their secretion is calledcerumen or ear wax (which includes the sebum secreted in the ear canals).

The characteristicpustules (pus-containing lesions) crust as they heal;the infection is contagious to others.Eczema \u2014a symptom of what is more properly called atopic dermatitis. This may be an allergicreaction, and is more common in children thanadults; the rash is itchy (pruritus) and may blister or ooze. Eczema may be related to foods such assh, eggs, or milk products, or to inhaled allergenssuch as dust, pollens, or animal dander. Preventiondepends upon determining what the child is aller-gic to and eliminating or at least limiting exposure.Warts \u2014caused by a virus that makes epidermal cells divide abnormally, producing a growth on theskin that is often raised and has a rough or pitted surface. Warts are probably most common on thehands, but they may be anywhere on the skin.Plantar warts on the sole of the foot may becomequite painful because of the constant pressure ofstanding and walking.Fever blisters (cold sores)\u2014caused by the herpes simplex virus, to which most people are exposedas children. An active lesion, usually at the edgeof the lip (but may be anywhere on the skin), ispainful and oozes. If not destroyed by the immunesystem, the virus \"hides out\" and becomes dor-mant in nerves of the face. Another lesion, weeksor months later, may be triggered by stress or another illness.

Sweat Glands. There are two types of sweat glands, apocrine and eccrine. Apocrine glands are most numerous in the axillae (underarm) and genital areasand are most active in stressful and emotional situa-tions. Although their secretion does have an odor, it isbarely perceptible to other people. Animals such asdogs, however, can easily distinguish among peoplebecause of their individual scents. If the apocrinesecretions are allowed to accumulate on the skin, bac-teria metabolize the chemicals in the sweat and pro-duce waste products that have distinct odors thatmany people nd unpleasant. Eccrine glands are found all over the body but are especially numerous on the forehead, upper lip, palms,and soles. The secretory portion of these glands issimply a coiled tube in the dermis. The duct of thistube extends to the skin's surface, where it opens intoa pore . The sweat produced by eccrine glands is important in the maintenance of normal body temperature. In awarm environment, or during exercise, more sweat issecreted onto the skin surface, where it is then evapo-rated by excess body heat. Recall that water has a highheat of vaporization, which means that a great deal ofheat can be lost in the evaporation of a relatively smallamount of water. Although this is a very effectivemechanism of heat loss, it has a potentially serious dis-advantage. Loss of too much body water in sweat maylead to dehydration , as in heat exhaustion or even after exercise on a hot and humid day. Increasedsweating during exercise or on warm days shouldalways be accompanied by increased fluid intake. Those who exercise regularly know that they must replace salt as well as water. Sodium chloride is alsolost in sweat, as are small amounts of urea (a nitroge- nous waste product of amino acid metabolism). Thisexcretory function of the skin is very minor, however;the kidneys are primarily responsible for removingwaste products from the blood and for maintainingthe body's proper salt-to-water proportion. Blood Vessels Besides the capillaries in the dermis, the other bloodvessels of great importance are the arterioles.Arterioles are small arteries, and the smooth musclein their walls permits them to constrict (close) or dilate (open). This is important in the maintenance ofbody temperature, because blood carries heat, which isa form of energy. In a warm environment the arterioles dilate (vasodilation ), which increases blood flow through the dermis and brings excess heat close to the body surfaceto be radiated to the environment. In a cold environ-ment, however, body heat must be conserved if possi-ble, so the arterioles constrict. The vasoconstriction decreases the flow of blood through the dermis andkeeps heat within the core of the body. This adjustingmechanism is essential for maintaining homeostasis.Regulation of the diameter of the arterioles inresponse to external temperature changes is controlledby the nervous system. These changes can often beseen in light-skinned people. Flushing, especially inthe face, may be observed in hot weather. In cold, theskin of the extremities may become even paler as bloodflow through the dermis decreases. In people with darkskin, such changes are not as readily apparent becausethey are masked by melanin in the epidermis. Vasoconstriction in the dermis may also occur dur- ing stressful situations. For our ancestors, stress usu-ally demanded a physical response: Either stand andght or run away to safety. This is called the \"ght orflight response.\" Our nervous systems are still pro-grammed to respond as if physical activity were neces-sary to cope with the stress situation. Vasoconstrictionin the dermis will shunt, or redirect, blood to morevital organs such as the muscles, heart, and brain. Intimes of stress, the skin is a relatively unimportantorgan and can function temporarily with a minimalblood flow. You have probably heard the expression\"broke out in a cold sweat,\" and may even have felt itin a stressful situation. Such sweating feels coldbecause vasoconstriction in the dermis makes the skinrelatively cool. Blood flow in the dermis may be interrupted by prolonged pressure on the skin. For example, a hospi-tal patient who cannot turn over by herself maydevelop a decubitus ulcer , also called a pressure ulcer or pressure sore. The skin is compressed between theobject outside, such as a bed, and a bony prominencewithin, such as the heel bone or the sacrum in thelower back. Without its blood supply the skin dies,and the dead tissue is a potential site for bacterialinfection. The functions of dermal structures are summarized in T able 5-2.98 The Integumentary System05Scanlon(p3)-ch05 8/17/06 10:44 AM Page 98SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE may also be called the supercial fascia , one of the connective fascia connects the dermis to theunderlying muscles. Its other functions are those of itstissues, as you may recall from Chapter 4. Areolar connective tissue, or loose connective tis- sue, contains collagen and elastin bers and manywhite blood cells that have left capillaries to wanderaround in the tissue fluid between skin and muscles.These migrating white blood cells destroy pathogensthat enter the body through breaks in the skin. Mastcells are specialized connective tissue cells found inareolar tissue; they produce histamine, leukotrienes,and other chemicals that help bring about inflamma-tion, the body's response to damage (inflammation is described in Chapters 10 and 14). The cells (adipocytes) of adipose tissue are special- ized to store fat, and our subcutaneous layer of fatstores excess nutrients as a potential energy source.This layer also cushions bony prominences, such aswhen sitting, and provides some insulation from cold.For people, this last function is relatively minor,because we do not have a thick layer of fat, as do ani-mals such as whales and seals. As mentioned inChapter 4, adipose tissue is involved in the onset orcessation of eating and in the use of insulin by bodycells, and it contributes to inflammation by produc-ing cytokines, chemicals that activate white bloodcells. Just as the epidermis forms a continuous sheet that covers the body, the subcutaneous tissue is a continu-ous layer, though it is internal. If we consider the epi-dermis as the rst line of defense against pathogens,we can consider the subcutaneous tissue a secondaryline of defense. There is, however, a signicantanatomic difference. The cells of the epidermis arevery closely and tightly packed, but the cells andprotein bers of subcutaneous tissue are farther apart,and there is much more tissue fluid. If we imagine theepidermis as a four-lane highway during rush hourwith bumper-to-bumper traffic, the supercial fasciawould be that same highway at three o'clock in themorning, when it is not crowded and cars can movemuch faster. This is an obvious benet for the migrat-ing white blood cells, but may become a disadvantagebecause some bacterial pathogens, once established,can spread even more rapidly throughout subcuta-neous tissue. Group A streptococcus, for example, is a cause of necrotizing fasciitis . Necrotizing means \"to cause death,\" and fasciitis is the inflammation of a fascia, in this case the supercial fascia and the deep fasciaearound muscles. Necrotizing fasciitis is an extremelyserious infection and requires surgical removal of theinfected tissue, or even amputation of an infectedlimb, to try to stop the spread of the bacteria. Thebody's defenses have been overwhelmed because whatis usually an anatomic benet, the \"looseness\" of are-olar connective tissue, has been turned against us andbecome a detriment. The functions of subcutaneous tissue are summa- rized in T able 5-3.

This method of supplying a medica-tion is called transdermal administration . The name is a little misleading because the most difficult partof cutaneous absorption of a drug is absorptionthrough the stratum corneum of the epidermis.Because such absorption is slow, skin patches areuseful for medications needed in small but continu-ous amounts, and over a prolonged period of time. You would expect that such patches should be worn where the epidermis is thin. These sitesinclude the upper arm and the chest. The recom-mended site for a patch to prevent motion sicknessis the skin behind the ear. Also available in patch form are medications for birth control, overactivebladder, high blood pressure, and both systemicand localized pain relief. Medications may also be injected through the skin. Some injections are given subcutaneously, thatis, into subcutaneous tissue (see Box Fig. 5-D).Subcutaneous adipose tissue has a moderate bloodsupply, so the rate of absorption of the drug will bemoderate, but predictable. Insulin is given subcuta-neously. Other injections are intramuscular, andabsorption into the blood is rapid because muscletissue has a very good blood supply.

Both layers of skin become thinnerand more fragile as mitosis in the epidermis slows andbroblasts in the dermis die and are not replaced;repair of even small breaks or cuts is slower. The skinbecomes wrinkled as collagen and elastin bers in thedermis deteriorate. Sebaceous glands and sweat glandsbecome less active; the skin becomes dry, and temper-ature regulation in hot weather becomes more diffi-cult. Hair follicles become inactive and hair on thescalp and body thins. Melanocytes die and are notreplaced; the hair that remains becomes white. Thereis often less fat in the subcutaneous tissue, which maymake an elderly person more sensitive to cold. It isimportant for elderly people (and those who care forthem) to realize that extremes of temperature may beharmful and to take special precautions in very hot or very cold weather. SUMMARY The integumentary system is the outermost organsystem of the body. You have probably noticed thatmany of its functions are related to this location. Theskin protects the body against pathogens and chemi-cals, minimizes loss or entry of water, blocks theharmful effects of sunlight, and produces vitamin D.Sensory receptors in the skin provide informationabout the external environment, and the skin helpsregulate body temperature in response to environ-mental changes. The subcutaneous tissue is a second-ary line of defense against pathogens, a site of fatstorage and of the other metabolic functions of adi-pose tissue.The Integumentary System 101 STUDY OUTLINE The integumentary system consists of the skin and its accessory structures and thesubcutaneous tissue. The two major layers ofthe skin are the outer epidermis and theinner dermis. stratified Stratum germinativum\u2014the layer where mitosis takes place; new cells produce ker-atin and die as they are pushed toward the surface.Defensins are antimicrobial peptides produced when the skin is injured. Vitamin D is formed from cholesterol on exposure to the UV rays of sunlight. 2. Stratum corneum\u2014the outermost layers of dead cells; keratin prevents loss and entry of water andresists entry of pathogens and chemicals. 3. Langerhans cells\u2014phagocytize foreign material, take it to lymph nodes, and stimulate an immuneresponse by lymphocytes. 4. Melanocytes\u2014in the lower epidermis, produce melanin. UV rays stimulate melanin production;melanin prevents further exposure of the stratumgerminativum to UV rays by darkening theskin.Dermis\u2014made of irregular tive andelastin provides elasticity; capillaries in thepapillary layer nourish the stratum germina-tivum (see Fig. 5-1 and Table 5-2)1. Hair follicles\u2014mitosis takes place in the hair root; new cells produce keratin, die, and become the hairshaft. Hair of the scalp provides insulation fromcold for the head; eyelashes keep dust out of eyes;nostril hairs keep dust out of nasal cavities (seeFigs. 5-1 and 5-3). of ngers and toes; mito- sis takes place in the nail root; the nail itself is dead,keratinized cells. Nails protect the ends of the n-gers and toes, enable the ngers to pick up smallobjects, and provide for efficient scratching (seeFig. 5-4). 3. Receptors\u2014detect changes in the skin: touch, pres- sure, heat, cold, and pain; provide informationabout the external environment that initiates appro-priate responses; sensitivity of the skin depends onthe number receptors present. 4. Sebaceous glands\u2014secrete sebum into hair follicles or to the skin surface; sebum inhibits the growth ofbacteria and prevents drying of skin and hair. 5. Ceruminous glands\u2014secrete cerumen in the ear canals; cerumen 8/17/06 10:44 1016. Apocrine sweat glands\u2014modied scent in axillae and genital area; activated by stress andemotions. 7. Eccrine sweat glands\u2014most numerous on face, palms, soles. Activated by high external tempera-ture or exercise; sweat on skin surface is evaporatedby excess body heat; potential disadvantage is dehy-dration. Excretion of small amounts of NaCl andurea is a very minor function. 8. Arterioles\u2014smooth muscle permits constriction or dilation. Vasoconstriction in cold temperaturesdecreases dermal blood flow to conserve heat inthe body core. Vasodilation in warm temperaturesincreases dermal blood flow to bring heat to thesurface to be lost. Vasoconstriction during stressshunts blood away from the skin to more vitalorgans, such as muscles, to permit a physical response, if necessary. Subcutaneous Tissue\u2014also called the super- cial fascia; connects 5-3)1. Areolar tissue\u2014also called loose connective matrix contains tissue fluid and WBCs thatdestroy pathogens that get through breaks in theskin; mast cells produce chemicals that bring aboutinflammation. 2. Adipose tissue\u2014stores fat as potential energy; insula-tion from cold. Other functions: contributes toappetite, the use of insulin, and the activation ofWBCs.102 The Integumentary System REVIEW QUESTIONS 1. Name the parts of the integumentary system. (p. 90) 2.

What comes to mind? Probably that each ofus would be a little heap on the floor, much like a jel-lysh out of water. Such an image is accurate andreflects the most obvious function of the skeleton: tosupport the body. Although it is a framework for thebody, the skeleton is not at all like the wooden beamsthat support a house. Bones are living organs thatactively contribute to the maintenance of the internalenvironment of the body. The skeletal system consists of bones and other structures that make up the joints of the skeleton. Thetypes of tissue present are bone tissue, cartilage, andbrous connective tissue, which forms the ligamentsthat connect bone to bone. FUNCTIONS OF THE SKELETON 1. Provides a framework that supports the body; the muscles that are attached to bones move the skele-ton. 2. Protects some internal organs from mechanical injury; the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, forexample. 3. Contains and protects the red bone marrow, the primary hemopoietic (blood-forming) tissue. 4. Provides a storage site for excess calcium. Calcium may be removed from bone to maintain a normalblood calcium level, which is essential for bloodclotting and proper functioning of muscles andnerves. TYPES OF BONE TISSUE Bone was described as a tissue in Chapter 4. Recall that bone cells are called osteocytes , and the matrix of bone is made of calcium salts and collagen. The calcium salts are calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and cal- cium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2), which give bone the strength required to perform its supportive and pro-tective functions. Bone matrix is non-living, but itchanges constantly, with calcium that is taken frombone into the blood replaced by calcium from the diet.In normal circumstances, the amount of calcium thatis removed is replaced by an equal amount of calciumdeposited. This is the function of osteocytes, to regu-late the amount of calcium that is deposited in, or removed from, the bone matrix. In bone as an organ, two types of bone tissue are present (Fig. 6-1). Compact bone looks solid but is very precisely structured. Compact bone is made ofosteons or haversian systems , microscopic cylinders of bone matrix with osteocytes in concentric ringsaround central haversian canals . In the haversian canals are blood vessels; the osteocytes are in contactwith these blood vessels and with one another throughmicroscopic channels ( canaliculi ) in the matrix. The second type of bone tissue is spongy bone , which does look rather like a sponge with its visibleholes or cavities. Osteocytes, matrix, and blood vesselsare present but are not arranged in haversian systems.The cavities in spongy bone often contain red bone marrow , which produces red blood cells, platelets, and the ve kinds of white blood cells. CLASSIFICATION OF BONES 1.Long bones \u2014the bones of the arms, legs, hands, and feet (but not the wrists and ankles). The shaftof a long bone is the diaphysis , and the ends are called epiphyses (see Fig. 6-1). The diaphysis is made of compact bone and is hollow, forming acanal within the shaft. This marrow canal (or medullary cavity) contains yellow bone marrow , which is mostly adipose tissue. The epiphyses aremade of spongy bone covered with a thin layer ofcompact bone. Although red bone marrow is pres-ent in the epiphyses of children's bones, it is largelyreplaced by yellow bone marrow in adult bones. 2.Short bones \u2014the bones of the wrists and ankles. 3.Flat bones \u2014the ribs, shoulder blades, hip bones, and cranial bones. 4.Irregular bones \u2014the vertebrae and facial bones. Short, flat, and irregular bones are all made of spongy bone covered with a thin layer of compactbone. Red bone marrow is found within the spongybone. The joint surfaces of bones are covered with artic- ular cartilage , which provides a smooth surface. Cov- ering the rest of the bone is the periosteum , a brous connective tissue membrane whose collagen bersmerge with those of the tendons and ligaments that106 Bone tissue.

QUESTION: What is the purpose of the blood vessels in bone tissue?06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 107are attached to the bone. The periosteum anchors these structures and contains both the blood vesselsthat enter the bone itself and osteoblasts that willbecome active if the bone is damaged. EMBRYONIC GROWTH OF BONE During embryonic development, the skeleton is rst made of cartilage and brous connective tissue, whichare gradually replaced by bone. Bone matrix is pro-duced by cells called osteoblasts (a blast cell is a \"grow- ing\" or \"producing\" cell, and osteo means \"bone\"). In the embryonic model of the skeleton, osteoblasts dif-ferentiate from the broblasts that are present. Theproduction of bone matrix, called ossication , begins in a center of ossication in each bone. The cranial and facial bones are rst made of brous connective tissue. In the third month of fetaldevelopment, broblasts (spindle-shaped connectivetissue cells) become more specialized and differentiateinto osteoblasts, which produce bone matrix. Fromeach center of ossication, bone growth radiates out-ward as calcium salts are deposited in the collagen ofthe model of the bone. This process is not completeat birth; a baby has areas of brous connective tissueremaining between the bones of the skull. Theseare called fontanels (Fig. 6-2), which permit com- pression of the baby's head during birth withoutbreaking the still thin cranial bones. The fontanelsalso permit the growth of the brain after birth. Youmay have heard fontanels referred to as \"soft spots,\"and indeed they are. A baby's skull is quite fragile andmust be protected from trauma. By the age of 2 years,all the fontanels have become ossied, and the skullbecomes a more effective protective covering for thebrain. The rest of the embryonic skeleton is rst made of cartilage, and ossication begins in the third month ofgestation in the long bones. Osteoblasts produce bonematrix in the center of the diaphyses of the long bonesand in the center of short, flat, and irregular bones.Bone matrix gradually replaces the original cartilage(Fig. 6-3). The long bones also develop centers of ossication in their epiphyses. At birth, ossication is not yet com-plete and continues throughout childhood. In longbones, growth occurs in the epiphyseal discs at thejunction of the diaphysis with each epiphysis. An epi- physeal disc is still cartilage, and the bone grows inlength as more cartilage is produced on the epiphysisside (see Fig. 6-3). On the diaphysis side, osteoblastsproduce bone matrix to replace the cartilage. Betweenthe ages of 16 and 25 years (influenced by estrogen ortestosterone), all of the cartilage of the epiphysealdiscs is replaced by bone. This is called closure of theepiphyseal discs (or we say the discs are closed), andthe bone lengthening process stops. Also in bones are specialized cells called osteo- clasts (a clastcell is a \"destroying\" cell), which are able to dissolve and reabsorb the minerals of bone matrix,a process called resorption . Osteoclasts are very active in embryonic long bones, and they reabsorbbone matrix in the center of the diaphysis to form themarrow canal . Blood vessels grow into the marrow canals of embryonic long bones, and red bone marrowis established. After birth, the red bone marrow isreplaced by yellow bone marrow. Red bone marrowremains in the spongy bone of short, flat, and irregu-lar bones. For other functions of osteoclasts andosteoblasts, see Box 6-1: Fractures and Their Repair. FACTORS THAT AFFECT BONE GROWTH AND MAINTENANCE 1. Heredity\u2014each person has a genetic potential for height, that is, a maximum height, with genesinherited from both parents. Many genes areinvolved, and their interactions are not well under-stood. Some of these genes are probably those forthe enzymes involved in cartilage and bone pro-duction, for this is how bones grow. 2. Nutrition\u2014nutrients are the raw materials of which bones are made. Calcium, phosphorus, andprotein become part of the bone matrix itself.Vitamin D is needed for the efficient absorption ofcalcium and phosphorus by the small intestine.Vitamins A and C do not become part of bone butare necessary for the process of bone matrix forma-tion (ossication). Without these and other nutri-ents, bones cannot grow properly. Children whoare malnourished grow very slowly and may notreach their genetic potential for height. 3. Hormones\u2014endocrine glands produce hormones that stimulate specic effects in certain cells.108 The Skeletal System (text continued on page 112)06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 Anterior fontanel C D Figure 6-2.

Several types of fractures are depicted in the right arm.A fracture means that a bone has been broken. There are different types of fractures classied as toextent of damage. Simple (closed) \u2014the broken parts are still in nor- mal anatomic position; surrounding tissue damageis minimal (skin is not pierced).Compound (open) \u2014the broken end of a bone has been moved, and it pierces the skin; there maybe extensive damage to surrounding blood vessels,nerves, and muscles.Greenstick \u2014the bone splits longitudinally. The bones of children contain more collagen than doadult bones and tend to splinter rather than breakcompletely.Comminuted \u2014two or more intersecting breaks create several bone fragments.Impacted \u2014the broken ends of a bone are forced into one another; many bone fragments may becreated.Pathologic (spontaneous) \u2014a bone breaks with- out apparent trauma; may accompany bone disor-ders such as osteoporosis. The Repair Process Even a simple fracture involves signicant bone damage that must be repaired if the bone is toresume its normal function. Fragments of dead ordamaged bone must rst be removed. This isaccomplished by osteoclasts, which dissolve andreabsorb the calcium salts of bone matrix. Imaginea building that has just collapsed; the rubble mustbe removed before reconstruction can take place. This is what the osteoclasts do. Then, new bone must be produced. The inner layer of the perios-teum contains osteoblasts that are activated whenbone is damaged. The osteoblasts produce bonematrix to knit the broken ends of the bonetogether. Because most bone has a good blood supply, the repair process is usually relatively rapid, and a sim-ple fracture often heals within 6 weeks. Some partsof bones, however, have a poor blood supply, andrepair of fractures takes longer. These areas are theneck of the femur (the site of a \"fractured hip\") andthe lower third of the tibia. Other factors that influence repair include the age of the person, general state of health, andnutrition. The elderly and those in poor health often have slow healing of fractures. A diet with sufficientcalcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and protein is alsoimportant. If any of these nutrients is lacking, bonerepair will be a slower process. 06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 111Several hormones make important contributions to bone growth and maintenance. These includegrowth hormone, thyroxine, parathyroid hormone,and insulin, which help regulate cell division, pro-tein synthesis, calcium metabolism, and energyproduction. The sex hormones estrogen or testos-terone help bring about the cessation of bonegrowth. The hormones and their specic functionsare listed in T able 6-1. 4. Exercise or \"stress\"\u2014for bones, exercise means bearing weight, which is just what bones are spe-cialized to do. Without this stress (which is nor-mal), bones will lose calcium faster than it isreplaced. Exercise need not be strenuous; it can beas simple as the walking involved in everyday activ-ities. Bones that do not get this exercise, such asthose of patients conned to bed, will become thin-ner and more fragile. This condition is discussedfurther in Box 6-2: Osteoporosis. THE SKELETON The human skeleton has two divisions: the axial skele- ton, which forms the axis of the body, and the appen- dicular skeleton , which supports the appendages or limbs. The axial skeleton consists of the skull, vertebralcolumn, and rib cage. The bones of the arms andlegs and the shoulder and pelvic girdles make up theappendicular skeleton. Many bones are connected toother bones across joints by ligaments, which arestrong cords or sheets of brous connective tissue. The importance of ligaments becomes readily apparentwhen a joint is sprained. A sprain is the stretching oreven tearing of the ligaments of a joint, and though thebones are not broken, the joint is weak and unsteady.We do not often think of our ligaments, but they arenecessary to keep our bones in the proper positions tokeep us upright or to bear weight. There are 206 bones in total, and the complete skeleton is shown in Fig. 6-4. SKULL The skull consists of 8 cranial bones and 14 facial bones. Also in the head are three small bones in eachmiddle ear cavity and the hyoid bone that supports thebase of the tongue. The cranial bones form the brain- case (lined with the meninges) that encloses and pro-tects the brain, eyes, and ears. The names of some ofthese bones will be familiar to you; they are the sameas the terminology used (see Chapter 1) to describeareas of the head. These are the frontal bone, parietalbones (two), temporal bones (two), and occipital bone.The sphenoid bone and ethmoid bone are part of thefloor of the braincase and the orbits (sockets) forthe eyes. The frontal bone forms the forehead and the anterior part of the top of the skull. Parietal means \"wall,\" and the two large parietal bones form the pos- terior top and much of the side walls of the skull. Eachtemporal bone on the side of the skull contains an external auditory meatus (ear canal), a middle ear cav-112 The Skeletal System Table 6-1 HORMONES INVOLVED IN BONE GROWTH AND MAINTENANCE Growth hormone (anterior pituitary gland) Thyroxine (thyroid gland) gland) (ovaries) the rate of mitosis of chondrocytes and osteoblasts Increases the rate of protein synthesis (collagen, cartilage matrix, and enzymes for cartilage and bone formation) Increases the rate of protein synthesis Increases energy production from all food types Increases energy production from glucose Increases the reabsorption of calcium from bones to the blood (raises blood calcium level) Increases the absorption of calcium by the small intestine and kid- neys (to the blood) Decreases the reabsorption of calcium from bones (lowers blood calcium level) Promotes closure of the epiphyses of long bones (growth stops) Helps retain calcium in bones to maintain a strong bone matrix06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 112ity, and an inner ear labyrinth. The occipital bone forms the lower, posterior part of the braincase. Itsforamen magnum is a large opening for the spinalcord, and the two condyles (rounded projections) oneither side articulate with the atlas, the rst cervicalvertebra. The sphenoid bone is said to be shaped like a bat, and the greater wing is visible on the side of theskull between the frontal and temporal bones. Thebody of the bat has a depression called the sella tur-cica, which encloses the pituitary gland. The ethmoidbone vertical projection called galli (\"rooster's comb\") that anchors the cranial meninges.The rest of the ethmoid bone forms the roof andupper walls of the nasal cavities, and the upper part ofthe nasal septum. All of the joints between cranial bones are immov- able joints called sutures . It may seem strange to refer to a joint without movement, but the term joint (or articulation ) is used for any junction of two bones. (The classication of joints will be covered later inThe Skeletal System 113 BOX6-2 OSTEOPOROSIS Normal Bone Osteoporosis A B Box Figure 6-B (A) Normal spongy bone, as in the body of a vertebra. ( B) Spongy bone thinned by osteoporosis.Bone is an active tissue; calcium is constantly being removed to maintain normal blood calcium levels.Usually, however, calcium is replaced in bones at arate equal to its removal, and the bone matrixremains strong. Osteoporosis is characterized by excessive loss of calcium from bones without sufficient replace-ment. Research has suggested that a certain genefor bone buildup in youth is an important factor;less buildup would mean earlier bone thinning.Contributing environmental factors include smok-ing, insufficient dietary intake of calcium, inactivity,and lack of the sex hormones. Osteoporosis is mostcommon among elderly women, because estrogensecretion decreases sharply at menopause (in oldermen, testosterone is still secreted in signicantamounts). Factors such as bed rest or inability toget even minimal exercise will make calcium losseven more rapid.As bones lose calcium and become thin and brit- tle, fractures are much more likely to occur. Amongelderly women, a fractured hip (the neck of thefemur) is an all-too-common consequence of thisdegenerative bone disorder. Such a serious injury isnot inevitable, however, and neither is the thinningof the vertebrae that bows the spines of some eld-erly people. After menopause, women may wish tohave a bone density test to determine the strengthof their bone matrix. Several medications are avail-able that diminish the rate of bone loss. A diet highin calcium and vitamin D is essential for both menand women, as is moderate exercise. Young womenand teenagers should make sure they get adequatedietary calcium to form strong bone matrix,because this will delay the serious effects of osteo-porosis later in life.06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 113this chapter.)

QUESTION: What is the purpose of the foramen magnum? Of the 14 facial bones , only the mandible (lower jaw) is movable; it forms a condyloid joint with each temporal bone. The other joints between facial bonesare all sutures. The maxillae are the two upper jaw bones, which also form the anterior portion of thehard palate (roof of the mouth). Sockets for the rootsof the teeth are found in the maxillae and themandible. The two nasal bones form the bridge of the nose where they articulate with the frontal bone(the rest of the nose is supported by cartilage). Thereis a lacrimal bone at the medial side of each orbit; the lacrimal canal contains the lacrimal sac, a passagewayfor tears. Each of the two zygomatic bones forms the point of a cheek, and articulates with the maxilla,frontal bone, and temporal bone. The two palatine bones are the posterior portion of the hard palate.The plow-shaped vomer forms the lower part of the nasal septum; it articulates with the ethmoid bone. Oneither side of the vomer are the conchae , six scroll- like bones that curl downward from the sides of thenasal cavities; they help increase the surface area of thenasal mucosa. These facial bones are included in T able6-2. Paranasal sinuses are air cavities located sphenoid, and ethmoid bones(Fig. 6-9). As the name paranasal suggests, they open into the nasal cavities and are lined with ciliated epithelium continuous with the mucosa of the nasal cavities. We are aware of our sinuses only when theybecome \"stuffed up,\" which means that the mucusthey produce cannot drain into the nasal cavities. Thismay happen during upper respiratory infections such (text continued on page 119)06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 Figure 6-8. (A) Skull. Superior view with the top of cranium removed.

These sinuses, however, do have functions: They make theskull lighter in weight, because air is lighter than bone,and they provide resonance for the voice, meaningmore air to vibrate and thus deepen the pitch of thevoice. The mastoid sinuses are air cavities in the mastoid process of each temporal bone; they open into themiddle ear. Before the availability of antibiotics, mid-dle ear infections often caused mastoiditis, infection ofthese sinuses. Within each middle ear cavity are three auditory bones : the malleus, incus, and stapes. As part of the hearing process (discussed in Chapter 9), these bonestransmit vibrations from the eardrum to the receptorsin the inner ear (see Fig. 9-7). VERTEBRAL COLUMN The vertebral column (spinal column or backbone) is made of individual bones called vertebrae . The namesof vertebrae indicate their location along the length of the spinal column. There are 7 cervical vertebrae, 12thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral fused into 1 sacrum, and4 to 5 small coccygeal vertebrae fused into 1 coccyx(Fig. 6-10). The seven cervical vertebrae are those within the neck. The rst vertebra is called the atlas , which artic- ulates with the occipital bone to support the skull andforms a pivot joint with the odontoid process of the axis, the second cervical vertebra. This pivot joint allows us to turn our heads from side to side. Theremaining ve cervical vertebrae do not have individ-ual names. The thoracic vertebrae articulate (form joints) with the ribs on the posterior side of the trunk. Thelumbar vertebrae , the largest and strongest bones of the spine, are found in the small of the back. Thesacrum permits the articulation of the two hip bones: the sacroiliac joints . The coccyx is the remnant of tail vertebrae, and some muscles of the perineum(pelvic floor) are anchored to it.The Skeletal System 119 Frontal sinus Ethmoid sinusMaxillary A B Figure 6-9.

( B) Atlas and axis, superior view. ( C) 7th thoracic vertebra, left lateral view. lumbar vertebra, left lat- eral view. QUESTION: Compare the size of the individual thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. What is the reason for this differ- ence? All of the vertebrae articulate with one another in sequence, connected by ligaments, to form a flexiblebackbone that supports the trunk and head. They alsoform the vertebral canal , a continuous tunnel (lined with the meninges) within the bones that contains thespinal cord and protects it from mechanical injury.The spinous and transverse processes are projections for the attachment of the muscles that bend the verte- bral column. The facets of some vertebrae are smallflat surfaces for articulation with other bones, such asthe ribs with the facets of the thoracic vertebrae.The supporting part of a vertebra is its body; the bodies of adjacent vertebrae are separated by discs of brous cartilage. These discs cushion and absorbshock and permit some movement between vertebrae(symphysis joints ). Since there are so many joints, the backbone as a whole is quite flexible (see also Box6-3: Herniated Disc). The normal spine in anatomic position has four natural curves, which are named after the vertebraethat form them. Refer to Fig. 6-10, and notice that thecervical curve is forward, the thoracic curve backward,06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 120BOX6-3 HERNIATED DISC The vertebrae are separated by discs of brous car- tilage that act as cushions to absorb shock. An inter-vertebral disc has a tough outer covering and a softcenter called the nucleus pulposus. Extreme pres-sure on a disc may rupture the outer layer and forcethe nucleus pulposus out. This may occur when aperson lifts a heavy object improperly, that is, usingthe back rather than the legs and jerking upward,which puts sudden, intense pressure on the spine.Most often this affects discs in the lumbar region. Although often called a \"slipped disc,\" the affected disc is usually not moved out of position. Box Figure 6-C Herniated disc. As a result of compression, a ruptured intervertebral disc puts pres- sure on a spinal nerve.The terms herniated disc orruptured disc more accurately describe what happens. The nucleus pul-posus is forced out, often posteriorly, where it putspressure on a spinal nerve. For this reason a herni-ated disc may be very painful or impair function inthe muscles supplied by the nerve. Healing of a herniated disc may occur naturally if the damage is not severe and the person rests andavoids activities that would further compress thedisc. Surgery may be required, however, to removethe portion of the nucleus pulposus that is out ofplace and disrupting nerve functioning. 12106Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 121the lumbar curve forward, and the sacral curve back- ward. These curves center the skull over the rest of thebody, which enables a person to more easily walkupright (see Box 6-4: Abnormalities of the Curves ofthe Spine). RIB CAGE The rib cage consists of the 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum, or breastbone. The three parts of the ster-num are the upper manubrium , the central body , and the lower xiphoid process (Fig. 6-11). All of the ribs articulate posteriorly with the tho- racic vertebrae. The rst seven pairs of ribs are calledtrue ribs ; they articulate directly with the manubrium and body of the sternum by means of costal cartilages.The next three pairs are called false ribs ; their carti-lages join the 7th rib cartilage. The last two pairs are called floating ribs because they do not articulate with the sternum at all (see Fig. 6-10). An obvious function of the rib cage is that it en- closes and protects the heart and lungs. Keep in mind,though, that the rib cage also protects organs in theupper abdominal cavity, such as the liver and spleen.The other important function of the rib cage dependsupon its flexibility: The ribs are pulled upward andoutward by the external intercostal muscles. Thisenlarges the chest cavity, which expands the lungs andcontributes to inhalation. THE SHOULDER AND ARM The shoulder girdles attach the arms to the axial skele-ton. Each consists of a scapula (shoulder blade) andclavicle (collarbone). The scapula is a large, flat bone with several projections (the spine of the scapula, thecoracoid process) that anchor some of the muscles thatmove the upper arm and the forearm. A shallowdepression called the glenoid fossa forms a ball-and- socket joint with the humerus, the bone of the upper arm (Fig. 6-12). Each clavicle articulates laterally with a scapula and medially with the manubrium of the sternum. Inthis position the clavicles act as braces for the scapulaeand prevent the shoulders from coming too far for-ward. Although the shoulder joint is capable of a widerange of movement, the shoulder itself must be rela-tively stable if these movements are to be effective. The humerus is the long bone of the upper arm. In Fig. 6-12, notice the deltoid tubercle (or tuberosity);the triangular deltoid muscle anchored humerus formsa ball-and-socket joint with the scapula. Distally, thehumerus forms a hinge joint with the ulna of the forearm. This hinge joint, the elbow, permits move-ment in one plane, that is, back and forth with no lat-eral movement. The forearm bones are the ulna on the little nger side and the radius on the thumb side. The semilunar notch of the ulna is part of the hinge joint of theelbow; it articulates with the trochlea of the humerus.The radius and ulna articulate proximally to form apivot joint , which permits turning the hand palm up to palm down. You can demonstrate this yourself byholding your arm palm up in front of you, and noting that the radius and ulna are parallel to each other. Then turn your hand palm down, and notice that your122 The Skeletal System BOX6-4 ABNORMALITIES OF THE CURVES OF THE SPINE Scoliosis \u2014an abnormal lateral curvature, which may be congenital, the result of having one leglonger than the other, or the result of chronicpoor posture during childhood while the verte-brae are still growing. Usually the thoracic verte-brae are affected, which displaces the rib cage toone side. In severe cases, the abdominal organsmay be compressed, and the expansion of therib cage during inhalation may be impaired.Kyphosis *\u2014an exaggerated as exaggerated lumbar curve; sometimes referred to as swayback. These abnormal curves are usually the result of degenerative bone diseases such as osteo-porosis or tuberculosis of the spine. If osteoporo-sis, for example, causes the bodies of the thoracicvertebrae to collapse, the normal thoracic curvewill be increased. Most often the vertebral body\"settles\" slowly (rather than collapses suddenly)and there is little, if any, damage to the spinalnerves. The damage to the vertebrae, however,cannot be easily corrected, so these conditionsshould be thought of in terms of preventionrather than cure. *Although descriptive of normal anatomy, the terms kyphosis andlordosis , respectively, are commonly used to describe the abnormal condition associated with each.06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 122upper arm does not move. The radius crosses over the ulna, which permits the hand to perform a great vari-ety of movements without moving the entire arm. The carpals are eight small bones in the wrist; gliding joints between them permit a sliding move- ment. The carpals also articulate with the distal endsof the ulna and radius, and with the proximal ends ofthe metacarpals , the ve bones of the palm of the hand. All of the joints formed by the carpals andmetacarpals make the hand very flexible at the wrist (try this yourself: flexion to extension should be almost 180 degrees), but the thumb is more movable than thengers because of its carpometacarpal joint. This is asaddle joint , which enables the thumb to cross over the palm, and permits gripping. The phalanges are the bones of the ngers. There are two phalanges in each thumb and three in eachof the ngers. Between phalanges are hinge joints , which permit movement in one plane. Importantparts of the shoulder and arm bones are describedin T able 6-3.THE HIP AND LEG The pelvic girdle (or pelvic bone) consists of the twohip bones (coxae or innominate bones), which articu- late with the axial skeleton at the sacrum. Each hipbone has three major parts: the ilium, ischium, andpubis, and these are shown in Fig. 6-13, which depictsboth a male and a female pelvis. The ilium is the flared, upper portion that forms the sacroiliac joint.The ischium is the lower, posterior part that we sit on. The pubis is the lower, most anterior part. The two pubic bones articulate with one another at thepubic symphysis , with a disc of brous cartilage between them. Notice the pubic angle of both themale and female pelvises in Fig. 6-13. The widerfemale angle is an adaptation for childbirth, in that ithelps make the pelvic outlet larger. The acetabulum is the socket in the hip bone that forms a ball-and-socket joint with the femur. Compared to the glenoid fossa of the scapula, theacetabulum is a much deeper socket. This has greatThe Skeletal System 123 Manubrium Body of sternum rib 1st thoracic vertebra2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th 12th Figure 6-11. Rib cage. Anterior view.

Begin at the shoulder and work downward. 12406Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 124functional importance because the hip is a weight- bearing joint, whereas the shoulder is not. Because theacetabulum is deep, the hip joint is not easily dislo-cated, even by activities such as running and jumping(landing), which put great stress on the joint. The femur is the long bone of the thigh. As men- tioned, the femur forms a very movable ball-and-socket joint with the hip bone. At the proximal end ofthe femur are the greater and lesser trochanters, largeprojections that are anchors for muscles. At its distalend, the femur forms a hinge joint , the knee, with the tibia of the lower leg. Notice in Fig. 6-14 that eachbone has condyles, which are the rounded projectionsthat actually form the joint. The patella , or kneecap, is anterior to the knee joint, enclosed in the tendon ofthe quadriceps femoris, a large muscle group of thethigh. The tibia is the weight-bearing bone of the lower leg. You can feel the tibial tuberosity (a bump) andanterior crest (a ridge) on the front of your own leg.The medial malleolus, what we may call the \"innerankle bone,\" is at the distal end. Notice in Fig. 6-14that the bula is not part of the knee joint and does not bear much weight. The lateral malleolus of thebula is the \"outer ankle bone\" you can nd just aboveyour foot. Though not a weight-bearing bone, thebula is important in that leg muscles are attached and anchored to it, and it helps stabilize the ankle. T wobones on one is a much more stable arrangement thanone bone on one, and you can see that the malleoli ofthe tibia and bula overlap the sides of the talus. Thetibia and bula do not form a pivot joint as do theradius and ulna in the forearm; this also contributes tothe stability of the lower leg and foot and the supportof the entire body. The tarsals are the seven bones in the ankle. As you would expect, they are larger and stronger thanthe carpals of the wrist, and their gliding joints do notprovide nearly as much movement. The largest is thecalcaneus , or heel bone; the talus transmits weight between the calcaneus and the tibia. Metatarsals are the ve long bones of each foot, and phalanges are the bones of the toes. There are two phalanges in thebig toe and three in each of the other toes. The pha-langes of the toes form hinge joints with each other.Because there is no saddle joint in the foot, the big toeis not as movable as the thumb. The foot has twomajor arches, longitudinal and transverse, that aresupported by ligaments. These are adaptations forwalking completely upright, in that arches provide forspring or bounce in our steps.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF JOINTS The classication of joints is based on the amount of movement possible. A synarthrosis is an immovablejoint, such as a suture between two cranial bones.An amphiarthrosis is a slightly movable joint, suchas the symphysis joint between adjacent vertebrae. Adiarthrosis is a freely movable joint. This is the largestcategory of joints and includes the ball-and-socketjoint, the pivot, hinge, and others. Examples of eachtype of joint are described in T able 6-5, and many ofthese are illustrated in Fig. 6-15. SYNOVIAL JOINTS All diarthroses, or freely movable joints, are synovialjoints because they share similarities of structure. Atypical synovial joint is shown in Fig. 6-16. On thejoint surface of each bone is the articular cartilage,which provides a smooth surface. The joint capsule,made of brous connective tissue, encloses the joint ina strong sheath, like a sleeve. Lining the joint capsule is the synovial membrane, which secretes synovialfluid into the joint cavity. Synovial fluid is thick andslippery and prevents friction as the bones move. Many synovial joints also have bursae (or bursas), which are small sacs of synovial fluid between the jointand the tendons that cross over the joint. Bursae per-mit the tendons to slide easily as the bones are moved.If a joint is used excessively, the bursae may becomeinflamed and painful; this condition is called bursitis . Some other disorders of joints are described in Box6-5: Arthritis. AGING AND THE SKELETAL SYSTEM With age, bone tissue tends to lose more calcium thanis replaced. Bone matrix becomes thinner, the bonesthemselves more brittle, and fractures are more likelyto occur with mild trauma. Erosion of the articular cartilages of joints is also a common consequence of aging. Joints affected includeweight-bearing joints such as the knees, and active,small joints such as those of the ngers.

Structure of a synovial joint. See text for description.QUESTION: How can you tell that this is a joint between two long bones? Give an example. BOX6-5 ARTHRITIS bacterial and viral infections have been suggested as possibilities. Rheumatoid arthritis often begins in joints of the extremities, such as those of the ngers. Theautoimmune activity seems to affect the synovialmembrane, and joints become painful and stiff.Sometimes the disease progresses to total destruc-tion of the synovial membrane and calcication ofthe joint. Such a joint is then fused and has nomobility at all. Autoimmune damage may alsooccur in the heart and blood vessels, and those withRA are more prone to heart attacks and strokes (RAis a systemic, not a localized, disease). Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is directed at reducing inflammation as much as possible, for it isthe inflammatory process that causes the damage.Therapies being investigated involve selectivelyblocking specic aspects of the immune response,such as antibody production. At present there is nocure for autoimmune diseases.The term arthritis means \"inflammation of a joint.\" Of the many types of arthritis, we will con-sider two: osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a natural consequence of get- ting older. In joints that have borne weight formany years, the articular cartilage is gradually wornaway. The once smooth joint surface becomesrough, and the affected joint is stiff and painful. Asyou might guess, the large, weight-bearing jointsare most often subjected to this form of arthritis. Ifwe live long enough, most of us can expect someosteoarthritis in knees, hips, or ankles. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be a truly crip- pling disease that may begin in early middle ageor, less commonly, during adolescence. It is anautoimmune disease , which means that the immune system mistakenly directs its destructivecapability against part of the body. Exactly whattriggers this abnormal response by the immunesystem is not known with certainty, but certain06Scanlon(p3)-ch06 8/17/06 11:13 AM Page 130Although the normal wear and tear of joints cannot be prevented, elderly people can preserve their bonematrix with exercise (dancing counts) and diets high incalcium and vitamin D. SUMMARY Your knowledge of the bones and joints will be usefulin the next chapter as you learn the actions of the mus-cles that move the skeleton. It is important to remem- ber, however, that bones have other functions as well.As a storage site for excess calcium, bones contributeto the maintenance of a normal blood calcium level.The red bone marrow found in flat and irregularbones produces the blood cells: red blood cells, whiteblood cells, and platelets. Some bones protect vitalorgans such as the brain, heart, and lungs. As you cansee, bones themselves may also be considered vitalorgans.The Skeletal System 131 STUDY OUTLINE The skeleton is made of bone and cartilage and has these functions:1. Is a framework for support, connected by liga- ments, moved by muscles. 2. Protects internal organs from mechanical injury.3. Contains and protects red bone marrow.4. Stores excess calcium; important to regulate blood calcium level. Bone Tissue (see Fig. 6-1) 1. Osteocytes (cells) are found in the matrix of cal- cium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and collagen. 2. Compact bone\u2014haversian systems are present.3. Spongy bone\u2014no haversian systems; Periosteum\u2014brous ligaments; has enter the bone. Classication of Bones 1.

Flat\u2014ribs, pelvic bone, cranial bones (spongy bone covered with compact bone). 4. Irregular\u2014vertebrae, facial bones (spongy bone covered with compact bone).Embryonic Growth of Bone 1. The embryonic skeleton is rst made of other tis- sues that are gradually replaced by bone. Ossica-tion begins in the third month of gestation;osteoblasts differentiate from broblasts and pro-duce bone matrix. 2. Cranial and facial bones are rst made of brous connective tissue; osteoblasts produce bone matrixin bone; bone growthradiates outward; fontanels remain permitcompression of infant skull during birth; fontanelsare calcied by age 2 (see Fig. 6-2). 3. All other bones are rst made of cartilage; in a long bone the rst center of ossication is in the diaph-ysis, other centers develop in the epiphyses. Afterbirth a long bone grows at the epiphyseal discs:Cartilage is produced on the epiphysis side, andbone replaces cartilage on the diaphysis side.Osteoclasts form the marrow cavity by reabsorb-ing bone matrix in the center of the diaphysis (seeFig. 6-3). Factors That Affect Bone Growth and Maintenance1. Heredity\u2014many pairs of genes contribute to genetic potential for height. 2. Nutrition\u2014calcium, phosphorus, and protein be- come part of the bone matrix; vitamin D is neededfor absorption of calcium in the small intestine;vitamins C and A are needed for bone matrix pro-duction 8/17/06 cerned with cell division, protein synthesis, calciummetabolism, and energy production (see T able 6-1). 4. Exercise or stress\u2014weight-bearing bones must bear weight or they will lose calcium and becomebrittle. The Skeleton\u2014206 bones (see Fig. 6-4); bones are connected by ligaments1. Axial\u2014skull, vertebrae, rib cage. Skull\u2014see Figs. 6-5 through 6-8 and T able 6-2. Eight cranial bones form the braincase, which also protects the eyes and ears; 14 facial bonesmake up the face; the immovable jointsbetween these bones are called sutures. Paranasal sinuses are air cavities in the maxil- lae, frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones; theylighten the skull and provide resonance forvoice (see Fig. 6-9). Three auditory bones in each middle ear cav- ity transmit vibrations for the hearing process. Vertebral column\u2014see Fig. 6-10. Individual bones are called vertebrae: 7 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral intoone sacrum), 4 to 5 coccygeal (fused into onecoccyx).

Most of us do, or we may simply enjoy watching good dancers. The grace andcoordination involved in dancing result from theinteraction of many of the organ systems, but the oneyou think of rst is probably the muscular system. There are more than 600 muscles in the human body. Most of these muscles are attached to the bonesof the skeleton by tendons, although a few musclesare attached to the undersurface of the skin. The pri-mary function of the muscular system is to move the skeleton. The muscle contractions required formovement also produce heat, which contributes to themaintenance of a constant body temperature. Theother body systems directly involved in movementare the nervous, respiratory, and circulatory systems. The nervous system transmits the electrochemical impulses that cause muscle cells to contract. The res-piratory system exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxidebetween the air and blood. The circulatory systembrings oxygen to the muscles and takes carbondioxide away. These interactions of body systems are covered in this chapter, which focuses on the skeletal muscles . You may recall from Chapter 4 that there are twoother types of muscle tissue: smooth muscle and car-diac muscle. These types of muscle tissue will be dis-cussed in other chapters in relation to the organs ofwhich they are part. Before you continue, you maynd it helpful to go back to Chapter 4 and review thestructure and characteristics of skeletal muscle tissue.In this chapter we will begin with the gross (large)anatomy and physiology of muscles, then discuss themicroscopic structure of muscle cells and the bio-chemistry of muscle contraction. MUSCLE STRUCTURE All muscle cells are specialized for contraction. Whenthese cells contract, they shorten and pull a bone toproduce movement. Each skeletal muscle is made ofthousands of individual muscle cells, which also may be called muscle bers (see Fig. 7-3 later in this chapter). Depending on the work a muscle is requiredto do, variable numbers of muscle bers contract.When picking up a pencil, for example, only a smallportion of the muscle bers in each nger muscle willcontract. If the muscle has more work to do, such aspicking up a book, more muscle bers will contract to accomplish the task. Muscles are anchored rmly to bones by tendons . Most tendons are rope-like, but some are flat; flattendon is called an aponeurosis . (See Fig. 7-9 later in this chapter for the epicranial aponeurosis, but beforeyou look, decide what epicranial means.) T endons are made of brous connective tissue, which, you mayremember, is very strong and merges with the fascia that covers the muscle and with the periosteum , the brous connective tissue membrane that covers bones.A muscle usually has at least two tendons, eachattached to a different bone. The more immobile orstationary attachment of the muscle is its origin ; the more movable attachment is called the insertion . The muscle itself crosses the joint of the two bones towhich it is attached, and when the muscle contracts itpulls on its insertion and moves the bone in a specicdirection. MUSCLE ARRANGEMENTS Muscles are arranged around the skeleton so as tobring about a variety of movements. The two generaltypes of arrangements are the opposing antagonists and the cooperative synergists . Antagonistic Muscles Antagonists are opponents, so we use the term antag- onistic muscles for muscles that have opposing or opposite functions. An example will be helpful here\u2014refer to Fig. 7-1 as you read the following. The bicepsbrachii is the muscle on the front of the upper arm.The origin of the biceps is on the scapula (there areactually two tendons, hence the name biceps), and theinsertion is on the radius. When the biceps contracts,it flexes the forearm, that is, bends the elbow (see T able 7-2 later in this chapter). Recall that when amuscle contracts, it gets shorter and pulls. Musclescannot push, for when they relax they exert no force.Therefore, the biceps can bend the elbow but cannotstraighten it; another muscle is needed. The tricepsbrachii is located on the back of the upper arm. Its ori-gins (the prex tritells you that there are three of them) are on the scapula and humerus, and its inser-tion is on the ulna. When the triceps contracts andpulls, it extends the forearm, that is, straightens the elbow.138 The Muscular System07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 138Joints that are capable of a variety of movements have several sets of antagonists. Notice how manyways you can move your upper arm at the shoulder, forinstance. Abducting (laterally raising) the arm is thefunction of the deltoid. Adducting the arm is broughtabout by the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi.Flexion of the arm (across the chest) is also a functionof the pectoralis major, and extension of the arm(behind the back) is also a function of the latissimusdorsi. All of these muscles are described and depictedin the tables and gures later in the chapter. Withoutantagonistic muscles, this variety of movements wouldnot be possible. You may be familiar with range-of-motion (or ROM) exercises that are often recommended for patients conned to bed. Such exercises are designedto stretch and contract the antagonistic muscles of ajoint to preserve as much muscle function and jointmobility as possible. Synergistic Muscles Synergistic muscles are those with the same func- tion, or those that work together to perform a partic-ular function. Recall that the biceps brachii flexes theforearm. The brachioradialis, with its origin on thehumerus and insertion on the radius, also flexesthe forearm. There is even a third flexor of the fore-arm, the brachialis. You may wonder why we needthree muscles to perform the same function, and theexplanation lies in the great mobility of the hand. If the hand is palm up, the biceps does most of the workof flexing and may be called the prime mover . When the hand is thumb up, the brachioradialis is in positionto be the prime mover, and when the hand is palmdown, the brachialis becomes the prime mover. If youhave ever tried to do chin-ups, you know that it ismuch easier with your palms toward you than withpalms away from you. This is because the biceps is alarger, and usually much stronger, muscle than is thebrachialis. Muscles may also be called synergists if they help to stabilize or steady a joint to make a more precisemovement possible. If you drink a glass of water, thebiceps brachii may be the prime mover to flex theforearm. At the same time, the muscles of the shoul-der keep that joint stable, so that the water gets toyour mouth, not over your shoulder or down yourchin. The shoulder muscles are considered synergistsfor this movement because their contribution makesthe movement effective. THE ROLE OF THE BRAIN Even our simplest movements require the interactionof many muscles, and the contraction of skeletal mus-cles depends on the brain. The nerve impulses formovement come from the frontal lobes of the cere- brum . The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain; the frontal lobes are beneath the frontal bone. TheThe System 139 Ulna HumerusTriceps Antagonistic muscles. ( A) Extension of the forearm. ( B) Flexion of the forearm.QUESTION: When the biceps contracts, what happens to its length, and what kind of force does it exert?07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 139motor areas of the frontal lobes generate electro- chemical impulses that travel along motor nerves tomuscle bers, causing the muscle bers to contract. For a movement to be effective, some muscles must contract while others relax. When walking, for exam-ple, antagonistic muscles on the front and back of thethigh or the lower leg will alternate their contractionsand relaxations, and our steps will be smooth and effi-cient. This is what we call coordination , and we do not have to think about making it happen. Coordinationtakes place below the level of conscious thought and isregulated by the cerebellum , which is located below the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. MUSCLE TONE Except during certain stages of sleep, most of ourmuscles are in a state of slight contraction; this is whatis known as muscle tone . When sitting upright, for example, the tone of your neck muscles keeps yourhead up, and the tone of your back muscles keeps yourback straight. This is an important function of muscletone for human beings, because it helps us to maintainan upright posture. For a muscle to remain slightlycontracted, only a few of the muscle bers in thatmuscle must contract. Alternate bers contract so thatthe muscle as a whole does not become fatigued. Thisis similar to a pianist continuously rippling her ngersover the keys of the piano\u2014some notes are alwayssounding at any given moment, but the notes that aresounding are always changing. This contraction ofalternate bers, muscle tone, is also regulated by thecerebellum of the brain. Muscle bers need the energy of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in order to contract. When they pro-duce ATP in the process of cell respiration, musclebers also produce heat. The heat generated by nor-mal muscle tone is approximately 25% of the totalbody heat at rest. During exercise, of course, heat pro-duction increases signicantly. EXERCISE Good muscle tone improves coordination. Whenmuscles are slightly contracted, they can react morerapidly if and when greater exertion is necessary.Muscles with poor tone are usually soft and flabby, butexercise will improve muscle tone.There are two general types of exercise: isotonic and isometric. In isotonic exercise , muscles contract and bring about movement. Jogging, swimming, andweight lifting are examples. Isotonic exercise improvesmuscle tone, muscle strength, and, if done repetitivelyagainst great resistance (as in weight lifting), musclesize. This type of exercise also improves cardiovascu-lar and respiratory efficiency, because movementexerts demands on the heart and respiratory muscles.If done for 30 minutes or longer, such exercise may becalled aerobic , because it strengthens the heart and res- piratory muscles as well as the muscles attached to theskeleton. Isotonic contractions are of two kinds, concentric or eccentric. A concentric contraction is the short- ening of a muscle as it exerts force. An eccentric contraction is the lengthening of a muscle as it still exerts force. Imagine lifting a book straight up (or tryit); the triceps brachii contracts and shortens tostraighten the elbow and raise the book, a concentriccontraction. Now imagine slowly lowering the book.The triceps brachii is still contracting even as it islengthening, exerting force to oppose gravity (whichwould make the book drop quickly). This is an eccen-tric contraction. Isometric exercise involves contraction without movement. If you put your palms together and pushone hand against the other, you can feel your armmuscles contracting. If both hands push equally, therewill be no movement; this is isometric contraction.Such exercises will increase muscle tone and musclestrength but are not considered aerobic. When thebody is moving, the brain receives sensory informa-tion about this movement from the joints involved,and responds with reflexes that increase heart rate andrespiration. Without movement, the brain does notget this sensory information, and heart rate andbreathing do not increase nearly as much as theywould during an equally strenuous isotonic exercise. Many of our actions involve both isotonic and iso- metric contractions. Pulling open a door requires iso-tonic contractions of arm muscles, but if the door isthen held open for someone else, those contractionsbecome isometric. Picking up a pencil is isotonic;holding it in your hand is isometric. Walking uphillinvolves concentric isotonic contractions, and may bequite strenuous. Walking downhill seems easier, but isno less complex. The eccentric isotonic contractionsinvolved make each step a precisely aimed and con-140 The Muscular System07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 140trolled fall against gravity. Without such control (which we do not have to think about) a downhill walk would quickly become a roll. These various kinds ofcontractions are needed for even the simplest activi-ties. (With respect to increasing muscle strength, seeBox 7-1: Anabolic Steroids.) MUSCLE SENSE When you walk up a flight of stairs, do you have to look at your feet to be sure each will get to the next step? Most of us don't (an occasional stumble doesn'tcount), and for this freedom we can thank ourmuscle sense. Muscle sense (proprioception ) is the brain's ability to know where our muscles are and whatthey are doing, without our having to consciouslylook at them. Within muscles are receptors called stretch recep- tors (proprioceptors or muscle spindles). The general function of all sensory receptors is to detect changes.The function of stretch receptors is to detect changesin the length of a muscle as it is stretched. The sen-sory impulses generated by these receptors are inter-preted by the brain as a mental \"picture\" of where themuscle is. We can be aware of muscle sense if we choose to be, but usually we can safely take it for granted. In fact,that is what we are meant to do. Imagine what lifewould be like if we had to watch every move to be surethat a hand or foot performed its intended action.Even simple activities such as walking or eating wouldrequire our constant attention. At times, we may become aware of our muscle sense. Learning a skill such as typing or playing theguitar involves very precise movements of the ngers, and beginners will often watch their ngers to be surethey are moving properly. With practice, however,the movements simply \"feel\" right, which means thatthe brain has formed a very good mental picture of thetask. Muscle sense again becomes unconscious, andthe experienced typist or guitarist need not watchevery movement. All sensation is a function of brain activity, and muscle sense is no exception. The impulses for musclesense are integrated in the parietal lobes of the cere- brum (conscious muscle sense) and in the cerebellum(unconscious muscle sense) to be used to promotecoordination. ENERGY SOURCES FOR MUSCLE CONTRACTION Before discussing the contraction process itself, let us look rst at how muscle bers obtain the energy they need to contract. The direct source of energy for mus-cle contraction is ATP . ATP , however, is not stored inlarge amounts in muscle bers and is depleted in a fewseconds. The secondary energy sources are creatine phos- phate and glycogen. Creatine phosphate is, like ATP , an energy-transferring molecule. When it is bro-ken down (by an enzyme) to creatine, phosphate, andenergy, the energy is used to synthesize more ATP .Most of the creatine formed is used to resynthesizecreatine phosphate, but some is converted to creati- nine , a nitrogenous waste product that is excreted by the kidneys. The most abundant energy source in muscle bersThe Muscular System 141 BOX7-1 ANABOLIC STEROIDS will increase muscle size, but there are hazards, some of them very serious. Side effects of suchself-medication include liver damage, kidney dam-age, disruption of reproductive cycles, andmental changes such as irritability and aggres-siveness. Female athletes may develop increased growth of facial and body hair and may become sterile as aresult of the effects of a male hormone on their ownhormonal cycles.Anabolic steroids are synthetic drugs very similar in structure and action to the male hormone testos- terone . Normal secretion of testosterone, begin- ning in males at puberty, increases muscle size andis the reason men usually have larger muscles thando women. Some athletes, both male and female, both amateur and professional, take anabolic steroids tobuild muscle mass and to increase muscle strength.There is no doubt that the use of anabolic steroids07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 141is glycogen . When glycogen is needed to provide energy for sustained contractions (more than a fewseconds), it is rst broken down into the glucose mol- ecules of which it is made. Glucose is then further bro-ken down in the process of cell respiration to produceATP , and muscle bers may continue to contract. Recall from Chapter 2 our simple reaction for cell respiration: Glucose /H11001O 2CO2/H11001H2O /H11001ATP /H11001heat Look rst at the products of this reaction. ATP will be used by the muscle bers for contraction. The heatproduced will contribute to body temperature, and ifexercise is strenuous, will increase body temperature.The water becomes part of intracellular water, and thecarbon dioxide is a waste product that will be exhaled. Now look at what is needed to release energy from glucose: oxygen. Muscles have two sources of oxygen.The blood delivers a continuous supply of oxygenfrom the lungs, which is carried by the hemoglobin in red blood cells. Within muscle bers themselves thereis another protein called myoglobin , which stores some oxygen within the muscle cells. Both hemoglo-bin and myoglobin contain the mineral iron, whichenables them to bond to oxygen. (Iron also makesboth molecules red, and it is myoglobin that givesmuscle tissue a red or dark color.) During strenuous exercise, the oxygen stored in myoglobin is quickly used up, and normal circulationmay not deliver oxygen fast enough to permit thecompletion of cell respiration. Even though the respi-ratory rate increases, the muscle bers may literallyrun out of oxygen. This state is called oxygen debt , and in this case, glucose cannot be completely brokendown into carbon dioxide and water. If oxygen is notpresent (or not present in sufficient amounts), glucoseis converted to an intermediate molecule called lactic acid, which causes muscle fatigue . In a state of fatigue, muscle bers cannot contract efficiently, and contraction may become painful. T o bein oxygen debt means that we owe the body some oxy-gen. Lactic acid from muscles enters the blood andcirculates to the liver, where it is converted to pyruvicacid, a simple carbohydrate (three carbons, abouthalf a glucose molecule). This conversion requires ATP , and oxygen is needed to produce the necessary ATP in the liver. This is why, after strenuous exercise,the respiratory rate and heart rate remain high for atime and only gradually return to normal. Anothername proposed for this state is recovery oxygen uptake , which is a little longer but also makes sense.Oxygen uptake means a faster and deeper respiratory rate. What is this uptake for? For recovery from stren-uous exercise. MUSCLE FIBER\u2014 MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE We will now look more closely at a muscle ber, keep-ing in mind that there are thousands of these cylindri-cal cells in one muscle. Each muscle ber has its ownmotor nerve ending; the neuromuscular junction is where the motor neuron terminates on the muscleber (Fig. 7-2). The axon terminal is the enlarged tip of the motor neuron; it contains sacs of the neuro-transmitter acetylcholine (ACh). The membrane of the muscle ber is the sarcolemma , which contains receptor sites for acetylcholine, cholinesterase . The synapse (or synaptic cleft) is the small space between the axon terminal and thesarcolemma. Within the muscle ber are thousands of individual contracting units called sarcomeres , which are arranged end to end in cylinders called myobrils . The structure of a sarcomere is shown in Fig. 7-3:The Z lines are the end boundaries of a sarcomere.Filaments of the protein myosin are in the center of the sarcomere, and laments of the protein actin are at the ends, attached to the Z lines. Myosin lamentsare anchored to the Z lines by the protein titin. Myosin and actin are the contractile proteins of a muscle ber. Their interactions produce muscle con-traction. Also present are two inhibitory proteins, tro- ponin and tropomyosin , which are part of the actin laments and prevent the sliding of actin and myosinwhen the muscle ber is relaxed. Surrounding the sarcomeres is the sarcoplasmic reticulum , the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. reticulum is a reservoir for calciumions (Ca /H110012), which are essential for the contraction process. All of these parts of a muscle ber are involved in the contraction process. Contraction begins when anerve impulse arrives at the axon terminal and stimu-lates the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine gener-ates electrical changes (the movement of ions) at thesarcolemma of the muscle ber. These electricalchanges initiate a sequence of events within the mus-cle ber that is called the sliding lament mecha- nism of muscle contraction. We will begin our discussion with the sarcolemma.142 The Muscular System07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 142SARCOLEMMA\u2014POLARIZATION When a muscle ber is relaxed, the sarcolemma is polarized (has a resting potential), which refers to adifference in electrical charges between the outsideand the inside. During polarization , the outside of the sarcolemma has a positive charge relative to theinside, which is said to have a negative charge. Sodium ions (Na /H11001) are more abundant outside the cell, and potassium ions (K/H11001) and negative ions are more abun- dant inside (Fig. 7-4). The Na/H11001ions outside tend to diffuse into the cell, and the sodium pump transfers them back out. The K/H11001ions inside tend to diffuse outside, and the potas-The Muscular System 143 AChMuscle fiberSynaptic cleftVesicles of T tubule Figure 7-2.

QUESTION: What is the unit of contraction of a muscle ber? 14407Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 144sium pump returns them inside. Both of these pumps are active transport mechanisms, which, you mayrecall, require ATP . Muscle bers use ATP to maintaina high concentration of Na /H11001ions outside the cell and a high concentration of K/H11001inside. The pumps, there- fore, maintain polarization and relaxation until a nerveimpulse stimulates a change. SARCOLEMMA\u2014DEPOLARIZATION When a nerve impulse arrives at the axon terminal, itcauses the release of acetylcholine, which diffusesacross the synapse and bonds to ACh receptors on the sarcolemma. By doing so, acetylcholine makes the sarcolemma very permeable to Na /H11001ions, which rush into the cell. This makes the inside of the sarcolemmapositive relative to the outside, which is now consid- ered negative. This reversal of charges is called depo- larization . The electrical impulse thus generated (called an action potential) then spreads along theentire sarcolemma of a muscle ber. The sarcolemma has inward folds called T tubules (transverse tubules, shown in Fig. 7-2), which carry the action potential tothe interior of the muscle cell. Depolarization initiateschanges within the cell that bring about contraction.The electrical changes that take place at the sar-colemma are summarized in T able 7-1 and shown and ion concentrations at the sarcolemma.

N a/H11001ions are more abundant outside the cell; as they diffuseinward, the sodium pumpreturns them outside. K /H11001ions are more abundant Inside the cell; as they diffuseout, the potassium pumpreturns them inside. ACh makes the sarcolemma very permeable to Na /H11001ions, which rush into the cell. Reversal of charges on the sar- colemma: now ( /H11002) outside and (/H11001) inside. The reversal of charges spreads along the entire sarcolemma Cholinesterase at the sar- per- meable to K/H11001ions, which rush out of the cell. Restoration of charges on the sarcolemma: ( /H11001) outside and (/H11002) inside. The sodium and potassium pumps return Na/H11001ions outside and K/H11001ions inside. The muscle ber is now able to respond to ACh released byanother nerve impulse arriving at the axon terminal.07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 145CONTRACTION\u2014THE SLIDING FILAMENT MECHANISM All of the parts of a muscle ber and the electrical changes described earlier are involved in the contrac-tion process, which is a precise sequence of eventscalled the sliding lament mechanism. In summary, a nerve impulse causes depolarization of a muscle ber, and this electrical change enables themyosin laments to pull the actin laments toward thecenter of the sarcomere, making the sarcomereshorter. All of the sarcomeres shorten and the muscleber contracts. A more detailed description of thisprocess is the following: 1. A nerve impulse arrives at the axon terminal; acetylcholine is released and diffuses the sarcolemma more per- meable to Na /H11001ions, which rush into the cell. 3. The sarcolemma depolarizes, becoming negative outside and positive inside. The T tubules bringthe reversal of charges to the interior of the mus-cle cell. 4. Depolarization stimulates the release of Ca /H110012ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca/H110012ions bond to the troponin-tropomyosin complex, whichshifts it away from the actin laments. 5. Myosin splits ATP to release its energy; bridges on the myosin attach to the actin laments andpull them toward the center of the sarcomere,thus making the sarcomere shorter (Fig. 7-5).6. All of the sarcomeres in a muscle ber shorten\u2014 the entire muscle ber contracts. 7. The sarcolemma repolarizes: K /H11001ions leave the cell, restoring a positive charge outside and a neg-ative charge inside. The pumps then return Na /H11001 ions outside and K/H11001ions inside. 8. Cholinesterase in the sarcolemma inactivates acetylcholine. 9. Subsequent nerve impulses will prolong contrac- tion (more acetylcholine is released). 10. When there are no further impulses, the muscle ber will relax and return to its original length. Steps 1 through 8 of this sequence describe a single muscle ber contraction (called a twitch ) in response to a single nerve impulse. Because all of this takes placein less than a second, useful movements would not bepossible if muscle bers relaxed immediately aftercontracting. Normally, however, nerve impulses arrivein a continuous stream and produce a sustained con-traction called tetanus , which is a normal state not to be confused with the disease tetanus (see Box 7-2:T etanus and Botulism). When in tetanus, musclebers remain contracted and are capable of effectivemovements. In a muscle such as the biceps brachii thatflexes the forearm, an effective movement means thatmany of its thousands of muscle bers are in tetanus,a sustained contraction. As you might expect with such a complex process, muscle contraction may be impaired in many different ways. Perhaps the most obvious is the loss of nerveimpulses to muscle bers, which can occur whennerves or the spinal cord are severed, or when a stroke146 The Muscular System BOX7-2 TETANUS AND BOTULISM tetanus the cause of death is spasm of the respira- tory muscles. Botulism is usually a type of food poisoning, but it is not characterized by typical food poisoningsymptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting. The neuro-toxin produced by the botulism bacteria ( Clostridium botulinum ) prevents the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Without acetylcholine, muscle bers cannot contract, and muscles becomeparalyzed. Early symptoms of botulism includeblurred or double vision and difficulty speaking orswallowing. Weakness and paralysis spread to othermuscle groups, eventually affecting all voluntarymuscles. Without rapid treatment with the antitoxin(the specic antibody to this toxin), botulism is fatalbecause of paralysis of the respiratory muscles.Some bacteria cause disease by producing toxins. A neurotoxin is a chemical that in some way dis- rupts the normal functioning of the nervous system.Because skeletal muscle contraction depends onnerve impulses, the serious consequences for theindividual may be seen in the muscular system. Tetanus is characterized by the inability of mus- cles to relax. The toxin produced by the tetanusbacteria ( Clostridium tetani ) affects the nervous sys- tem in such a way that muscle bers receive toomany impulses, and muscles go into spasms. Lock-jaw, the common name for tetanus, indicates oneof the rst symptoms, which is difficulty openingthe mouth because of spasms of the masseter mus-cles. Treatment requires the antitoxin (an antibodyto the toxin) to neutralize the toxin. In untreated07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 146(cerebrovascular accident ) occurs in the frontal lobes of the cerebrum. Without nerve impulses, skele-tal muscles become paralyzed , unable to contract. Paralyzed muscles eventually atrophy , that is, become smaller from lack of use. Other disorders that affectmuscle functioning are discussed in Box 7-3: MuscularDystrophy and Box 7-4: Myasthenia Gravis. RESPONSES TO EXERCISE\u2014 MAINTAINING HOMEOSTASIS Although entire textbooks are devoted to exercisephysiology, we will discuss it only briefly here as anexample of the body's ability to maintain homeostasis.Engaging in moderate or strenuous exercise is a phys- iological stress situation, a change that the body mustcope with and still maintain a normal internal envi-ronment, that is, homeostasis. Some of the body's responses to exercise are dia- grammed in Fig. 7-6; notice how they are related tocell respiration. As you can see, the respiratory andcardiovascular systems make essential contributions to exercise. The integumentary system also has a role, since it eliminates excess body heat. Although notshown, the nervous system is also directly involved, aswe have seen. The brain generates the impulses formuscle contraction, coordinates those contractions,and regulates heart rate, breathing rate, and the diam-eter of blood vessels.

QUESTION: During contraction, which laments do the pulling?07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 147BOX7-3 MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY Muscular dystrophy is really a group of genetic diseases in which muscle tissue is replaced bybrous connective tissue or by fat. Neither of thesetissues is capable of contraction, and the result isprogressive loss of muscle function. The most com-mon form is Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, inwhich the loss of muscle function affects not onlyskeletal muscle but also cardiac muscle. Death usu-ally occurs before the age of 20 due to heart failure,and at present there is no cure. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is a sex- linked (or X-linked) trait , which means that the gene for it is on the X chromosome and is recessive.The female sex chromosomes are XX. If one X chro-mosome has a gene for muscular dystrophy, andthe other X chromosome has a dominant gene fornormal muscle function, the woman will not havemuscular dystrophy but will be a carrier who maypass the muscular dystrophy gene to her children.The male sex chromosomes are XY, and the Y has no gene at all for muscle function, that is, no geneto prevent the expression of the gene on the Xchromosome. If the X chromosome has a gene formuscular dystrophy, the male will have the disease.This is why Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is morecommon in males; the presence of only one genemeans the disease will be present. The muscular dystrophy gene on the X chromo- some has been located, and the protein the genecodes for has been named dystrophin . Dystrophin is necessary for the stability of the sarcolemma andthe proper movement of ions. Treatments for mus-cular dystrophy that are being investigated includethe injection of normal muscle cells or stem cellsinto affected muscles, and the insertion (usingviruses) of normal genes for dystrophin intoaffected muscle cells.

Responses of the body during exercise. QUESTION: Name all the organ systems depicted here. BOX7-4 MYASTHENIA GRAVIS which acetylcholine bonds and stimulates the entry of Na/H11001ions. Without these receptors, the acetyl- choline released by the axon terminal cannot causedepolarization of a muscle ber. Treatment of myasthenia gravis may involve anticholinesterase medications. Recall that cholin-esterase is present in the sarcolemma to inactivateacetylcholine and prevent continuous, unwantedimpulses. If this action of cholinesterase is inhibited,acetylcholine remains on the sarcolemma for alonger time and may bond to any remaining recep-tors to stimulate depolarization and contraction.Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by extreme muscle fatigue even afterminimal exertion. Women are affected more often than are men, and symptoms usually begin in middle age. Weakness may rst be noticed in the facial orswallowing muscles and may progress to other mus-cles. Without treatment, the respiratory muscles willeventually be affected, and respiratory failure is thecause of death. In myasthenia gravis, the autoantibodies (self- antibodies) destroy the acetylcholine receptors on the sarcolemma. These receptors are the sites to 14807Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 148of stairs, hurry to catch a bus, or just go dancing, you might reflect a moment on all of the things that areactually happening to your body . . . after you catch your breath. AGING AND THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM With age, muscle cells die and are replaced by brousconnective tissue or by fat. Regular exercise, however,delays atrophy of muscles. Although muscles becomeslower to contract and their maximal strength de-creases, exercise can maintain muscle functioning at alevel that meets whatever a person needs for dailyactivities. The lifting of small weights is recom-mended as exercise for elderly people, women as wellas men. Such exercise also benets the cardiovascular,respiratory, and skeletal systems. The loss of muscle bers also contributes to a loss of proprioception, because the brain is getting lessinformation about where and how the body is posi-tioned. The loss of muscle sense contributes tounsteadiness in elderly people and to an impairedsense of balance, which in turn may lead to a fall.Simple awareness of this may help an elderly personprevent such accidents. MAJOR MUSCLES OF THE BODY The actions that muscles perform are listed in T able7-2 and some are shown in Fig. 7-7. Most are in pairsas antagonistic functions. After the brief summaries of the muscles of each body area that follow, the major muscles are shown inFig. 7-8. They are listed, according to body area, inT ables 7-3 through 7-7, with associated Figs. 7-9through 7-13, respectively. When you study the dia-grams of these muscles, and the tables that accompanythem, keep in mind the types of joints formed by thebones of their origins and insertions. Muscles pullbones to produce movement, and if you can rememberthe joints involved, you can easily learn the locationsand actions of the muscles. The name of the muscle may also be helpful, and again, many of the terms are ones you have alreadylearned. Some examples: \"abdominis\" refers to anabdominal muscle, \"femoris\" to a thigh muscle,\"brachii\" to a muscle of the upper arm, \"oculi\" to anThe Muscular System 149 eye muscle, and so on. Other parts of muscle namesmay be words such as \"longus\" or \"maximus\" thattell you about size, or \"flexor\" that tells you aboutfunction.

The muscles for smiling or frown-ing or raising our eyebrows in disbelief are anchoredto the bones of the head or to the undersurface of theskin of the face. The masseter is an important chewingmuscle in that it raises the mandible (closes the jaw). Flexion FlexionExtension Extension AbductionAdductionAbduction AdductionFigure 7-7. Actions of muscles.

Some form the wall ofthe trunk and bend the trunk, such as the rectus abdo-minis (f lexion) and the sacrospinalis group (exten-sion). The trapezius (both together form the shape ofa trapezoid) is a large muscle that can raise (shrug) theshoulder or pull it back, and can help extend the head.Other muscles found on the trunk help move the armat the shoulder. The pectoralis major is a large muscleof the chest that pulls the arm across the chest (flexionand adduction). On the posterior side of the trunk, thelatissimus dorsi pulls the arm downward and behindthe back (extension and adduction). These muscleshave their origins on the bones of the trunk, the ster-num, the or vertebrae, which are strong, stableanchors. Another set of muscles forms the pelvic floor,where the muscles support the pelvic organs and assistwith urination and defecation. Yet another category isthe muscles that are concerned with breathing. Theseare the intercostal muscles between the ribs and thediaphragm that separates the thoracic and abdominalcavities (see Fig. 15-6). MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER AND ARM The triangular deltoid muscle covers the point of the shoulder like a cap, and can pull the humerus to theside (abduction), forward (flexion), or backward (extension). You already know the functions of thebiceps brachii and triceps brachii, the muscles thatform the bulk of the upper arm. Other muscles par-tially in the upper arm help bend the elbow (flexion).The muscles that form the bulk of the forearm are theflexors and extensors of the hand and ngers. You candemonstrate this yourself by clasping the middle ofyour right forearm with your left hand, then movingyour right hand at the wrist and closing and opening ast; you can both feel and see the hand and ngermuscles at work. MUSCLES OF THE HIP AND LEG The hip muscles that move the thigh are anchored tothe pelvic bone and cross the hip joint to the femur.Among these are the gluteus maximus (extension),gluteus medius (abduction), and iliopsoas (flexion).The muscles that form the thigh include the quadri-ceps group anteriorly and the hamstring groupposteriorly. For most people, the quadriceps isstronger than the hamstrings, which is why athletesmore often have a \"pulled hamstring\" rather than a\"pulled quadriceps.\" Movement of the knee jointdepends on thigh muscles and lower leg muscles.Movement of the foot depends on lower leg musclessuch as the gastrocnemius (dorsiflexion or the body.

Respiratory\u2014exchanges O 2and CO2between the air and blood.5. Circulatory\u2014transports O2to muscles and removes CO2. Muscle Structure 1.

Varying movements require contrac-07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:45 AM Page 159tion of variable numbers of muscle bers in a muscle. 3. T endons attach muscles to bone; the origin is the more stationary bone, the insertion is the moremovable bone. A tendon merges with the fascia ofa muscle and the periosteum of a bone; all are madeof brous connective tissue. Muscle Arrangements 1. Antagonistic muscles have opposite functions. A muscle pulls when it contracts, but exerts no forcewhen it relaxes and it cannot push. When one mus-cle pulls a bone in one direction, another muscle isneeded to pull the bone in the other direction (seealso T able 7-2 and Fig. 7-1). 2. Synergistic muscles have the same function and alternate as the prime mover depending on theposition of the bone to be moved. Synergists alsostabilize a joint to make a more precise movementpossible. 3. The frontal lobes of the cerebrum generate the impulses necessary for contraction of skeletal mus-cles. The cerebellum regulates coordination. Muscle Tone\u2014the state of slight contraction present in muscles1. Alternate bers contract to prevent muscle fatigue; regulated by the cerebellum. 2. Good tone helps maintain posture, produces 25% of body heat (at rest), and improves coordination. 3. Isotonic exercise involves contraction with move- ment; improves tone and strength and improvescardiovascular and respiratory efficiency (aerobicexercise). Concentric contraction\u2014muscle exerts force while shortening. Eccentric contraction\u2014muscle exerts force while lengthening. 4. Isometric exercise involves contraction without movement; improves tone and strength but is notaerobic. Muscle Sense\u2014proprioception: knowing where our muscles are without lookingat them1. Permits us to perform everyday activities without having to concentrate on muscle position. 2. Stretch receptors (proprioceptors) in muscles respond to stretching and generate impulses thatthe brain interprets as a mental \"picture\" of wherethe muscles are. Parietal lobes: conscious muscle sense; cerebellum: unconscious muscle sense usedto promote coordination. Energy Sources for Muscle Contraction 1. ATP is the direct source; the ATP stored in muscles lasts only a few seconds. 2. Creatine phosphate is a secondary energy source; is broken down to creatine /H11001phosphate /H11001energy. The energy is used to synthesize more ATP . Somecreatine is converted to creatinine, which must beexcreted by the kidneys. Most creatine is used forthe resynthesis of creatine phosphate. 3. Glycogen is the most abundant energy source and is rst broken down to glucose. Glucose is brokendown in cell respiration: Glucose /H11001O 2CO2/H11001H2O /H11001ATP /H11001heat ATP used for contraction; heat contributes to body temperature; H2O becomes part of intracellu- lar fluid; CO2is eventually exhaled. 4. Oxygen is essential for the completion of cell res- piration. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carriesoxygen to muscles; myoglobin stores oxygen inmuscles; both of these proteins contain iron, whichenables them to bond to oxygen. 5. Oxygen debt (recovery oxygen uptake): Muscle bers run out of oxygen during strenuous exercise,and glucose is converted to lactic acid, which causesfatigue. Breathing rate remains high after exerciseto deliver more oxygen to the liver, which convertslactic acid to pyruvic acid, a simple carbohydrate(ATP required). Muscle structure junction: axon terminal sar- colemma; synapse space between. Theaxon terminal acetylcholine (a neurotrans-mitter), and the sarcolemma contains cholinesterase(an inactivator) (see Fig. 7-2). 2. Sarcomeres are the contracting units of a muscle ber. Myosin and actin laments are the contract-ing proteins of sarcomeres. T roponin and tropo-myosin are proteins that inhibit the sliding ofmyosin and actin when the muscle ber is relaxed(see Figs. 7-3 and 7-5). 3. The sarcoplasmic reticulum surrounds the sarco- meres and is a reservoir for calcium ions. 4. Polarization (resting potential): When the muscle ber is relaxed, the sarcolemma has a ( /H11001) charge160 The Muscular System07Scanlon(p3)-ch07 8/17/06 10:46 AM Page 1601.

The Na/H11001and K/H11001pumps maintain these relative concentrations on eitherside of the sarcolemma (see T able 7-1 and Fig.7-4). 5. Depolarization: This process is started by a nerve impulse. Acetylcholine released by the axon termi-nal makes the sarcolemma very permeable to Na /H11001 ions, which enter the cell and cause a reversal ofcharges to ( /H11002) outside and ( /H11001) larization spreads along the entire sarcolemma andinitiates the contraction process.

Because children arecurious, such warnings often go unheeded. Theresult? T ouching a hot stove brings about an immedi-ate response of pulling away and a vivid memory ofpainful ngers. This simple and familiar experienceillustrates the functions of the nervous system : 1. T o detect changes and feel sensations 2. T o initiate appropriate responses to changes3. T o organize information for immediate use and store it for future use The nervous system is one of the regulating sys- tems (the endocrine system is the other and is dis-cussed in Chapter 10). Electrochemical impulses ofthe nervous system make it possible to obtain infor-mation about the external or internal environmentand do whatever is necessary to maintain homeostasis.Some of this activity is conscious, but much of it hap-pens without our awareness. NERVOUS SYSTEM DIVISIONS The nervous system has two divisions. The central nervous system (CNS ) consists of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS ) consists of cranial nerves and spinal nerves. The PNS includes the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The peripheral nervous system relays information to and from the central nervous system, and the brainis the center of activity that integrates this informa-tion, initiates responses, and makes us the individualswe are. NERVE TISSUE Nerve tissue was briefly described in Chapter 4, so wewill begin by reviewing what you already know andthen add to it. Nerve cells are called neurons , or nerve bers . Whatever their specic functions, all neurons have thesame physical parts. The cell body contains the nucleus (Fig. 8-1) and is essential for the continuedlife of the neuron. As you will see, neuron cell bodiesare found in the central nervous system or close to itin the trunk of the body. In these locations, cell bodies are protected by bone. There are no cell bodies in thearms and legs, which are much more subject to injury. Dendrites are processes (extensions) that transmit impulses toward the cell body. The one axon of a neu- ron transmits impulses away from the cell body. It isthe cell membrane of the dendrites, cell body, andaxon that carries the electrical nerve impulse. In the peripheral nervous system, axons and den- drites are \"wrapped\" in specialized cells calledSchwann cells (see Fig. 8-1). During embryonic development, Schwann cells grow to surround theneuron processes, enclosing them in several layers ofSchwann cell membrane. These layers are the myelin sheath ; myelin is a phospholipid that electrically insu- lates neurons from one another. Without the myelinsheath, neurons would short-circuit, just as electricalwires would if they were not insulated (see Box 8-1:Multiple Sclerosis). The spaces between adjacent Schwann cells, or seg- ments of the myelin sheath, are called nodes ofRanvier (neurobril nodes). These nodes are the partsof the neuron cell membrane that depolarize when anelectrical impulse is transmitted (see \"The NerveImpulse\" section, on pages 171-172). The nuclei and cytoplasm of the Schwann cells are wrapped around the outside of the myelin sheath andare called the neurolemma , which becomes very important if nerves are damaged. If a peripheral nerveis severed and reattached precisely by microsurgery,the axons and dendrites may regenerate through thetunnels formed by the neurolemmas. The Schwanncells are also believed to produce a chemical growthfactor that stimulates regeneration. Although this re-generation may take months, the nerves may eventu-ally reestablish their proper connections, and theperson may regain some sensation and movement in the once-severed limb. In the central nervous system, the myelin sheaths are formed by oligodendrocytes , one of the neu- roglia (glial cells ), the specialized cells found only in the brain and spinal cord. Because no Schwann cellsare present, however, there is no neurolemma, andregeneration of neurons does not occur. This is whysevering of the spinal cord, for example, results in per-manent loss of function. Another kind of neuroglia aremicroglia ,which are constantly moving, phagocytiz- ing cellular debris, damaged cells, and pathogens.166 The Nervous System08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 166Yet another is the astrocyte (liter- ally, \"star cell\"). In the embryo, these cells provide aframework for the migrating neurons that will formthe brain. Thereafter, the extensions of astrocytes arewrapped around brain capillaries and contribute to theblood-brain barrier , which prevents potentially harmful waste products in the blood from diffusingout into brain tissue. These waste products are normalin the blood and tissue fluid, but brain tissue is muchmore sensitive to even low levels of them than are other tissues such as muscle tissue or connective tis-sue. The capillaries of the brain also contribute to thisbarrier, because they are less permeable than are othercapillaries. A disadvantage of the blood-brain barrieris that some useful medications cannot cross it, andthe antibodies produced by lymphocytes cross onlywith difficulty.

SYNAPSES Neurons that transmit impulses to other neurons donot actually touch one another. The small gap or spacebetween the axon of one neuron and the dendrites orcell body of the next neuron is called the synapse . Within the synaptic knob (terminal end) of the presy-naptic axon is a chemical neurotransmitter that is released into the synapse by the arrival of an electricalnerve impulse (Fig. 8-2). The neurotransmitter dif-fuses across the synapse, combines with specic recep-tor sites on the cell membrane of the postsynapticneuron, and there generates an electrical impulse thatis, in turn, carried by this neuron's axon to the nextsynapse, and so forth. A chemical inactivator at the cell body or dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron quickly inactivates the neurotransmitter. This pre- vents unwanted, continuous impulses, unless a newimpulse from the rst neuron releases more neuro-transmitter. Many synapses are termed excitatory, because the neurotransmitter causes the postsynaptic neuron todepolarize (become more negative outside as Na /H11001ions enter the cell) and transmit an electrical impulse toanother neuron, muscle cell, or gland. Some synapses,however, are inhibitory, meaning that the neurotrans-mitter causes the postsynaptic neuron to hyperpolar-ize (become even more positive outside as K /H11001ions leave the cell or Cl/H11002ions enter the cell) and therefore nottransmit an electrical impulse. Such inhibitory synapses are important, for example, for slowing theheart rate, and for balancing the excitatory impulsestransmitted to skeletal muscles. With respect to theskeletal muscles, this inhibition prevents excessivecontraction and is important for coordination.168 The Nervous System BOX8-1 MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS protect the axon. Because loss of myelin may occur in many parts of the central nervous system,the symptoms vary, but they usually include muscleweakness or paralysis, numbness or partial lossof sensation, double vision, and loss of spinalcord reflexes, including those for urination anddefecation. The rst symptoms usually appear between the ages of 20 and 40 years, and the disease mayprogress either slowly or rapidly. Some MS patientshaveremissions , periods of time when their symp- toms diminish, but remissions and progression ofthe disease are not predictable. There is still no curefor MS, but therapies include suppression of theimmune response, and interferon, which seems toprolong remissions in some patients. The possibilityof stimulating remyelination of neurons is alsobeing investigated.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating dis- ease; that is, it involves deterioration of the myelinsheath of neurons in the central nervous system.Without the myelin sheath, the impulses of theseneurons are short-circuited and do not reach theirproper destinations, and the neuron axons aredamaged and gradually die. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder that may be triggered by a virus or bacterial infec-tion. Research has also uncovered a genetic com-ponent to some clusters of MS cases in families.Exactly how such genes would increase a person'ssusceptibility to an autoimmune disease is notyet known. In MS, the autoantibodies destroythe oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing neu-roglia of the central nervous system, which resultsin the formation of scleroses, or plaques of scartissue, that do not provide electrical insulation or Table 8-1 NEUROGLIA Name Function Oligodendrocytes MicrogliaAstrocytesEpendyma Produce the myelin sheath to electrically insulate neurons of the CNS.

A nerve impulse cannot gobackward across a synapse because there is no neuro-transmitter released by the dendrites or cell body.Neurotransmitters can be released only by a neuron'saxon, which does not have receptor sites for it, as doesthe postsynaptic membrane. Keep this in mind whenwe discuss the types of neurons later in the chapter. An example of a neurotransmitter is acetylcholine , which is found at neuromuscular junctions, in theCNS, and in much of the peripheral nervous system.Acetylcholine usually makes a postsynaptic membranemore permeable to Na /H11001ions, which brings about depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. Cholin-esterase is the inactivator of acetylcholine. There are many other neurotransmitters, especially in the cen- tral nervous system. These include dopamine, GABA,norepinephrine, glutamate, and serotonin. Each ofthese neurotransmitters has are into theneurons that secreted them; this process is calledreuptake and also terminates the effect of the trans- mitter. The complexity and variety of synapses make them frequent targets of medications. For example, drugsthat alter mood or behavior often act on specic neu-rotransmitters in the brain, and antihypertensivedrugs affect synapse transmission at the smooth mus-cle of blood Nervous 169 Na+ Impulse transmission at a synapse. The arrow indicates the direction of the electrical impulse. QUESTION: Is this an excitatory synapse or an your answer.08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 AM Page 169TYPES OF NEURONS Neurons may be classied into three groups: sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons (Fig. 8-3).Sensory neurons (or afferent neurons ) carry im- pulses from receptors to the central nervous system.Receptors detect external or internal changes and send the information to the CNS in the form ofimpulses by way of the afferent neurons. The centralnervous system interprets these impulses as a sensa-tion. Sensory neurons from receptors in skin, skeletal muscles, and joints are called somatic ; those from receptors in internal organs are called visceral sensory neurons. Motor neurons (or efferent neurons ) carry impulses from the central nervous system to effectors . The two types of effectors are muscles and glands. Inresponse to impulses, muscles contract or relax andglands secrete. Motor neurons linked to skeletal mus-cle are called somatic; those to smooth muscle, cardiacmuscle, and glands are called visceral.170 The Nervous System Dorsal root Dorsal root ganglion Cell body of sensory neuron Dendrite of sensory neuron Receptor Ventral root Axon of motor Cross-section of the spinal cord and the three types of neurons. Spinal nerve roots and their neurons are shown on the left side. Spinal nerve tracts are shown in the white matter on the right side. All tracts and nerves are bilateral (both sides).QUESTION: The dorsal column is an ascending tract, and the corticospinal tract is descending. Explain what this means.08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 170Sensory and motor neurons make up the peripheral nervous system. Visceral motor neurons form theautonomic nervous system, a specialized subdivisionof the PNS that will be discussed later in this chapter. Interneurons are found entirely within the central nervous system. They are arranged so as to carry onlysensory or motor impulses, or to integrate these func-tions. Some interneurons in the brain are concernedwith thinking, learning, and memory. A neuron carries impulses in only one direction. This is the result of the neuron's structure and loca-tion, as well as its physical arrangement with otherneurons and the resulting pattern of synapses. Thefunctioning nervous system, therefore, is an enormousnetwork of \"one-way streets,\" and there is no dangerof impulses running into and canceling one anotherout. NERVES AND NERVE TRACTS A nerve is a group of axons and/or dendrites of many neurons, with blood vessels and connective tissue.Sensory nerves are made only of sensory neurons. The optic nerves for vision and olfactory nerves forsmell are examples of nerves with a purely sensoryfunction. Motor nerves are made only of motor neu- rons; autonomic nerves are motor nerves. A mixed nerve contains both sensory and motor neurons. Most of our peripheral nerves, such as the sciatic nerves inthe legs, are mixed nerves. The term nerve tract refers to groups of neurons within the central nervous system. All the neurons ina nerve tract are concerned with either sensory or motor activity. These tracts are often referred to as white matter ; the myelin sheaths of the neurons give them a white color. THE NERVE IMPULSE The events of an electrical nerve impulse are the sameas those of the electrical impulse generated in musclebers, which is discussed in Chapter 7. Stated simply,a neuron not carrying an impulse is in a state of polar- ization , with Na /H11001ions more abundant outside the cell, and K/H11001ions and negative ions more abundant inside the cell. The neuron has a positive charge onthe outside of the cell membrane and a relative nega-tive charge inside. A stimulus (such as a neurotrans-mitter) makes the membrane very permeable to Na /H11001 ions, which rush into the cell. This brings about depolarization , a reversal of charges on the mem- brane. The outside now has a negative charge, and theinside has a positive charge. As soon as depolarization takes place, the neuron membrane becomes very permeable to K /H11001ions, which rush out of the cell. This restores the positive chargeoutside and the negative charge inside, and is calledrepolarization . (The term action potential refers to depolarization followed by repolarization.) Then thesodium and potassium pumps return Na /H11001ions outside and K/H11001ions inside, and the neuron is ready to respond to another stimulus and transmit another impulse. Anaction potential in response to a stimulus takes placevery rapidly and is measured in milliseconds. An indi-vidual neuron is capable of transmitting hundreds ofaction potentials (impulses) each second. A summaryof the events of nerve impulse transmission is given inT able 8-2. T ransmission of electrical impulses is very rapid. The presence of an insulating myelin sheath increasesthe velocity of impulses, since only the nodes ofRanvier depolarize. This is called saltatory conduc- tion. Many of our neurons are capable of transmitting impulses at a speed of many meters per second.Imagine a person 6 feet (about 2 meters) tall who stubshis toe; sensory impulses travel from the toe to thebrain in less than a second (crossing a few synapsesalong the way). You can see how the nervous systemcan communicate so rapidly with all parts of the body,and why it is such an important regulatory system. At synapses, nerve impulse transmission changes from electrical to chemical and depends on the releaseof neurotransmitters. Although diffusion acrosssynapses is slow, the synapses are so small that thisdoes not signicantly affect the velocity of impulses ina living person. THE SPINAL CORD The spinal cord transmits impulses to and from the brain and is the integrating center for the spinal cordreflexes. Although this statement of functions is verybrief and sounds very simple, the spinal cord is ofgreat importance to the nervous system and to thebody as a whole. Enclosed within the vertebral canal and the menin- ges, the spinal cord is well protected from mechanicalThe Nervous System 17108Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 171injury. In length, the spinal cord extends from the foramen magnum of the occipital bone to the discbetween the rst and second lumbar vertebrae. A cross-section of the spinal cord is shown in Fig. 8-3; refer to it as you read the following. The internalgray matter is shaped like the letter H; gray matter consists of the cell bodies of motor neurons andinterneurons. The external white matter is made of myelinated axons and dendrites of interneurons.These nerve bers are grouped into nerve tracts basedon their functions. Ascending tracts (such as the dor- sal columns and spinothalamic tracts) carry sensoryimpulses to the brain. Descending tracts (such as the corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts) carry motorimpulses away from the brain. Lastly, nd the central canal ; this contains cerebrospinal fluid and is con- tinuous with cavities in the brain called ventricles. SPINAL NERVES There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves , those that emerge from the spinal cord. The nerves are named accordingto their respective vertebrae: 8 cervical pairs, 12 tho-racic pairs, 5 lumbar pairs, 5 sacral pairs, and 1 verysmall coccygeal pair. These are shown in Fig. 8-4;notice that each nerve is designated by a letter and anumber. The 8th cervical nerve is C8, the 1st thoracicnerve is T1, and so on. In general, the cervical nerves supply the back of the head, neck, shoulders, arms, and diaphragm (thephrenic nerves). The rst thoracic nerve also con-tributes to nerves in the arms. The remaining thoracicnerves supply the trunk of the body. The lumbar andsacral nerves supply the hips, pelvic cavity, and legs.Notice that the lumbar and sacral nerves hang belowthe end of the spinal cord (in order to reach theirproper openings to exit from the vertebral canal); thisis called the cauda equina , literally, the \"horse's tail.\" Some of the important peripheral nerves and their destinations are listed in T able 8-3. Each spinal nerve has two roots, which are neurons entering or leaving the spinal cord (see Fig. 8-3). Thedorsal root is made of sensory neurons that carry impulses into the spinal cord. The dorsal root gan- glion is an enlarged part of the dorsal root that con- tains the cell bodies of the sensory neurons. The termganglion means a group of cell bodies outside the CNS. These cell bodies are within the vertebral canaland are thereby protected from injury (see Box 8-2:Shingles). The ventral root is the motor root; it is made of the axons of motor neurons carrying impulses fromthe spinal cord to muscles or glands. The cell bodiesof these motor neurons, as mentioned previously, arein the gray matter of the spinal cord. When the twonerve roots merge, the spinal nerve thus formed is amixed nerve. SPINAL CORD REFLEXES When you hear the term reflex , you may think of an action that \"just happens,\" and in part this is so. Areflex is an involuntary response to a stimulus, that is,172 The Nervous System Table 8-2 THE NERVE IMPULSE State or Event Description Polarization (the neuronis not carrying an electricalimpulse) Depolarization (generatedby a stimulus) Propagation of the impulsefrom pointof Repolarization (immediately followsdepolarization) Neuron membrane has a ( /H11001) charge outside and a ( /H11002) charge inside. N a /H11001ions are more abundant out- side the cell. K/H11001ions and negative ions are more abundant inside the cell. Sodium and potassium pumps maintain these ion concentrations. Neuron membrane becomes very permeable to Na/H11001ions, which rush into the cell. The neuron membrane then has a (/H11002) charge outside and a ( /H11001) charge inside. Depolarization of part of the membrane makes adjacent mem- brane very permeable to Na/H11001ions, and subsequent depolarization, which similarly affects the next part of the membrane, and so on. The depolarization continues along the membrane of the neu- ron to the end of the axon. Neuron membrane becomes very permeable to K/H11001ions, which rush out of the cell. This restores the (/H11001) charge outside and ( /H11002) charge inside the membrane. The Na/H11001ions are returned outside and the K/H11001ions are returned inside by the sodium and potas- sium pumps. The neuron is now able to respond to another stimulus andgenerate another impulse.08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 172173 Spinal cord Phrenic nerve Intercostal nerves Radial nerve Median and spinal nerves. The distribu-tion of spinal nerves is shown only on the left side. The nerve plexuses are labeled on theright side. A nerve plexus is anetwork of neurons from sev-eral segments of the spinal cord that combine to form nerves to specic parts of the body. Forexample, the radial and ulnarnerves to the arm emerge fromthe brachial plexus (see also Table 8-3). QUESTION: Where cord end? Why is thisimportant clinically?08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 173an automatic action stimulated by a specic change of some kind. Spinal cord reflexes are those that do not depend directly on the brain, although the brain mayinhibit or enhance them. We do not have to thinkabout these reflexes, which is very important, as youwill see. Reflex Arc A reflex arc is the pathway that nerve impulses travelwhen a reflex is elicited, and there are ve essentialparts:1.Receptors \u2014detect a change (the stimulus) and generate impulses. 2.Sensory neurons \u2014transmit impulses from recep- tors to the nervous system \u2014contains one or more synapses (interneurons may be part of the pathway). 4.Motor neurons \u2014transmit impulses from the CNS to the effector. 5.Effector \u2014performs its characteristic action. Let us now look at the reflex arc of a specic reflex, the patellar (or knee-jerk) reflex , with which you are174 The Nervous System Table 8-3 MAJOR PERIPHERAL NERVES Spinal Nerves Nerve That Contribute Distribution arm, forearm, and hand; thumb and rst 2 ngers Skin and muscles of anterior arm, forearm, and hand Skin and muscles of medial arm, forearm, and hand; little nger and ring nger Intercostal muscles, abdominal muscles; skin of trunk Skin and muscles of anterior thigh, medial leg, and foot Skin and muscles of posterior thigh, leg and foot BOX8-2 SHINGLES Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox: the herpes varicella-zoster virus.Varicella is chickenpox, which many of us probablyhad as children (there is now a vaccine). When aperson recovers from chickenpox, the virus maysurvive in a dormant (inactive) state in the dorsalroot ganglia of some spinal nerves. For most peo-ple, the immune system is able to prevent reactiva-tion of the virus. With increasing age, however, theimmune system is not as effective, and the virusmay become active and cause zoster, or shingles. The virus is present in sensory neurons, often those of the trunk, but the damage caused by thevirus is seen in the skin over the affected nerve. Theraised, red lesions of shingles are often very painfuland follow the course of the nerve on the skin exter-nal to it. Pain may continue even after the rash heals; this is postherpetic neuralgia. Occasionally the virus may affect a cranial nerve and cause facialparalysis called Bell's palsy (7th cranial) or extensivefacial lesions, or, rarely, blindness. Although not acure, some antiviral medications lessen the duration of the illness. A vaccine is being developed foradults. Though it may not completely prevent shin-gles, it is expected to lessen the chance of posther-petic neuralgia. Box Figure 8-A Lesions of shingles on skin of trunk.

In this reflex, a tap on the patellar tendon just below the kneecap causes extension of thelower leg. This is a stretch reflex , which means that a muscle that is stretched will automatically contract.Refer now to Fig. 8-5 as you read the following: In the quadriceps femoris muscle are (1) stretch receptors that detect the stretching produced by strik-ing the patellar tendon. These receptors generateimpulses that are carried along (2) sensory neurons inthe femoral nerve to (3) the spinal cord. In the spinalcord, the sensory neurons synapse with (4) motor neu-rons (this is a two-neuron reflex). The motor neuronsin the femoral nerve carry impulses back to (5) thequadriceps femoris, the effector, which contracts andextends the lower leg. The patellar reflex is one of many used clinically to determine whether the nervous system is functioningproperly. If the patellar reflex were absent in a patient,the problem could be in the thigh muscle, the femoralnerve, or the spinal cord. Further testing would beneeded to determine the precise break in the reflexarc. If the reflex is normal, however, that means thatall parts of the reflex arc are intact. So the testing ofreflexes may be a rst step in the clinical assessment ofneurologic damage. You may be wondering why we have such reflexes, these stretch reflexes. What is their importance in our everyday lives? Imagine a person standing upright\u2014isthe body perfectly still? No, it isn't, because gravity exerts a downward pull. However, if the body tilts tothe left, the right sides of the leg and trunk arestretched, and these stretched muscles automaticallycontract and pull the body upright again. This is thepurpose of stretch reflexes; they help keep us uprightwithout our having to think about doing so. If thebrain had to make a decision every time we swayed abit, all our concentration would be needed just toremain standing. Since these are spinal cord reflexes,the brain is not directly involved. The brain maybecome aware that a reflex has taken place, but thatinvolves another set of neurons carrying impulses tothe brain. Flexor reflexes (or withdrawal reflexes ) are another type of spinal cord reflex. The stimulus issomething painful and potentially harmful, and theresponse is to pull away from it. If you inadvertentlytouch a hot stove, you automatically pull your handaway. Flexor reflexes are three-neuron reflexes,because sensory neurons synapse with inthe spinal cord, which in turn synapse with motorneurons. Again, however, the brain does not have tomake a decision to protect the body; the flexor reflexdoes that automatically (see Box 8-3: Spinal CordInjuries). The brain may know that the reflex hastaken place, and may even learn from the experience,but that requires different neurons, not the reflex arc.The Nervous System 175 Gray matterBiceps femoris muscle (relaxes) (4) Motor neuron (3) Synapse ganglion Figure 8-5.

See text fordescription.QUESTION: Why is this reflex called a stretch reflex?08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 175THE BRAIN The brain consists of many parts that function as an integrated whole. The major parts are the medulla,pons, and midbrain (collectively called the brain stem ), the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, the thala- mus, and the cerebrum. These parts are shown in Fig.8-6. We will discuss each part separately, but keep inmind that they are all interconnected and worktogether. VENTRICLES The ventricles are four cavities within the brain: two lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the fourthventricle (Fig. 8-7). contains plexus , which cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) from blood plasma. Cere- brospinal fluid is the tissue fluid of the central nervoussystem; its circulation and functions will be discussedin the section on meninges. MEDULLA The medulla extends from the spinal cord to the pons and is anterior to the cerebellum. Its functions arethose we think of as vital (as in \"vital signs\"). The medulla contains cardiac centers that regulate heartrate, vasomotor centers that regulate the diameter ofblood vessels and, thereby, blood pressure, and respi-ratory centers that regulate breathing. You can see why a crushing injury to the occipital bone may be rapidly fatal\u2014we cannot survive without the medulla.Also in the medulla are reflex centers for coughing,sneezing, swallowing, and vomiting. PONS The pons bulges anteriorly from the upper part of the medulla. Within the pons are two respiratory centersthat work with those in the medulla to produce a nor-mal breathing rhythm. (The function of all the respi-ratory centers is discussed in Chapter 15.) The manyother neurons in the pons ( pons is from the Latin for \"bridge\") connect the medulla with other parts of thebrain. MIDBRAIN The midbrain extends from the pons to the hypothal- amus and encloses the cerebral aqueduct , a tunnel that connects the third and fourth ventricles. Several176 The Nervous System BOX8-3 SPINAL CORD INJURIES need to urinate or defecate. Nor will voluntary con- trol of these reflexes be possible, because inhibitingimpulses from the brain can no longer reach thelower segments of the spinal cord. Potentially less serious injuries are those in which the spinal cord is crushed rather than severed, andtreatment is aimed at preserving whatever functionremains. Minimizing inflammation and stimulatingthe production of nerve growth factors are aspectsof such treatment. Perhaps the most challenging research is the attempt to stimulate severed spinal cords to regen-erate. Partial success has been achieved in ratsand mice, with Schwann cells transplanted fromtheir peripheral nerves and nerve growth factorsproduced by genetically engineered cells. The useof stem cells has also been successful in rats. Theresearchers caution, however, that it will take sometime before their procedures will be tested onpeople.Injuries to the spinal cord are most often caused by auto accidents, falls, and gunshot wounds. Themost serious injury is transection, or severing, of thespinal cord. If, for example, the spinal cord is sev-ered at the level of the 8th thoracic segment, therewill be paralysis and loss of sensation below thatlevel. Another consequence is spinal shock, the at-least-temporary loss of spinal cord reflexes. In thisexample, the spinal cord reflexes of the lower trunkand legs will not occur. The stretch reflexes andflexor reflexes of the legs will be at least temporar-ily abolished, as will the urination and defecationreflexes. Although these reflexes do not dependdirectly on the brain, spinal cord neurons dependon impulses from the brain to enhance their ownability to generate impulses. As spinal cord neurons below the injury recover their ability to generate impulses, these reflexes,such as the patellar reflex, often return. Urinationand defecation reflexes may also be reestablished,but the person will not have an awareness of the08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8-6. (A) Midsagittal section of the brain as seen from the left side.

QUESTION: Find the corpus callosum in parts A and B, and describe its shape. What is its function?08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 177different kinds of reflexes are integrated in the mid- brain, including visual and auditory reflexes. If you seea wasp flying toward you, you automatically duck or twist away; this is a visual reflex, as is the coordinated movement of the eyeballs. T urning your head (ear) toa sound is an example of an auditory reflex. The mid-brain is also concerned with what are called rightingreflexes, those that keep the head upright and main-tain balance or equilibrium. CEREBELLUM The cerebellum is separated from the medulla and pons by the fourth ventricle and is inferior to theoccipital lobes of the cerebrum. As you already know,many of the functions of the cerebellum are concernedwith movement. These include coordination, regula-tion of muscle tone, the appropriate trajectory andendpoint of movements, and the maintenance of pos-ture and equilibrium. Notice that these are all invol-untary; that is, the cerebellum functions below thelevel of conscious thought. This is important to permitthe conscious brain to work without being overbur-dened. If you decide to pick up a pencil, for example,the impulses for arm movement come from the cere- brum. The cerebellum then modies these impulses sothat your arm and nger movements are coordinated,and you don't reach past the pencil. The cerebellum seems also to be involved in certain sensory functions. For example, if you close your eyesand someone places a tennis ball in one hand and abaseball in the other, could you tell which was which?Certainly you could, by the \"feel\" of each: the textureand the weight or heft. If you pick up a plastic con-tainer of coffee (with a lid on it) could you tell if thecup is full, half-full, or empty? Again, you certainlycould. Do you have to think about it? No. The cere-bellum is, in part, responsible for this ability. T o regulate equilibrium, the cerebellum (and mid- brain) uses information about gravity and movementprovided by receptors in the inner ears. These recep-tors are discussed further in Chapter 9. HYPOTHALAMUS Located superior to the pituitary gland and inferior tothe thalamus, the hypothalamus is a small area of the brain with many diverse functions:178 The Nervous System Lateral ventricles aqueduc cord MedullaPonsTemporal lobeThird ventricle Figure 8-7. Ventricles of the brain as projected into the interior of the brain, which is seen from the left side. QUESTION: Describe the extent of each lateral ventricle.08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 1781. Production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin ; these hormones are then stored in the posterior pituitary gland. ADH enables the kidneysto reabsorb water back into the blood and thushelps maintain blood volume. Oxytocin causes con-tractions of the uterus to bring about labor anddelivery. 2. Production of releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) that stimulate the secretion ofhormones by the anterior pituitary gland. Becausethese hormones are covered in Chapter 10, a singleexample will be given here: The hypothalamus pro-duces growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitarygland to secrete growth hormone (GH). 3. Regulation of body temperature by promoting responses such as sweating in a warm environmentor shivering in a cold environment (see Chapter17). 4. Regulation of food intake; the hypothalamus is believed to respond to changes in blood nutrientlevels, to chemicals secreted by fat cells, and to hor-mones secreted by the gastrointestinal tract. Forexample, during a meal, after a certain duration ofdigestion, the small intestine produces a hormonethat circulates to the hypothalamus and bringsabout a sensation of satiety, or fullness, and we tendto stop eating. 5. Integration of the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, which in turn regulates the activityof organs such as the heart, blood vessels, andintestines. This will be discussed in more detaillater in this chapter. 6. Stimulation of visceral responses during emotional situations. When we are angry, heart rate usuallyincreases. Most of us, when embarrassed, will blush,which is vasodilation in the skin of the face. Theseresponses are brought about by the autonomicnervous system when the hypothalamus perceives achange in emotional state. The neurologic basis ofour emotions is not well understood, and the vis-ceral responses to emotions are not something mostof us can control. 7. Regulation of body rhythms such as secretion of hormones, sleep cycles, changes in mood, or men-tal alertness. This is often referred to as our bio-logical clock, the rhythms as circadian rhythms,meaning \"about a day.\" If you have ever had to stayawake for 24 hours, you know how disorienting itcan be, until the hypothalamic biological clock hasbeen reset.THALAMUS The thalamus is superior to the hypothalamus and inferior to the cerebrum. The third ventricle is a nar-row cavity that passes through both the thalamus andhypothalamus. Many of the functions of the thalamusare concerned with sensation. Sensory impulses to thebrain (except those for the sense of smell) follow neu-ron pathways that rst enter the thalamus, whichgroups the impulses before relaying them to the cere-brum, where sensations are felt. For example, holdinga cup of hot coffee generates impulses for heat, touchand texture, and the shape of the cup (muscle sense),but we do not experience these as separate sensations.The thalamus integrates the impulses from the cuta-neous receptors and from the cerebellum, that is, putsthem together in a sort of electrochemical package, sothat the cerebrum feels the whole and is able to inter-pret the sensation quickly. Some sensations, especially unpleasant ones such as pain, are believed to be felt by the thalamus. However,the thalamus cannot localize the sensation; that is, itdoes not know where the painful sensation is. Thesensory areas of the cerebrum are required for local-ization and precise awareness. The thalamus may also suppress unimportant sensations. If you are reading an enjoyable book, youmay not notice someone coming into the room. Bytemporarily blocking minor sensations, the thalamuspermits the cerebrum to concentrate on importanttasks. Parts of the thalamus are also involved in alertness and awareness (being awake and knowing we are), andothers contribute to memory. For these functions, asfor others, the thalamus works very closely with thecerebrum. CEREBRUM The largest part of the human brain is the cerebrum , which consists of two hemispheres separated by thelongitudinal ssure. At the base of this deep groove isthe corpus callosum , a band of 200 million neurons that connects the right and left hemispheres. Withineach hemisphere is a lateral ventricle. The surface of the cerebrum is gray matter called the cerebral cortex . Gray matter consists of cell bod- ies of neurons, which carry out the many functions ofthe cerebrum. Internal to the gray matter is whitematter, made of myelinated axons and dendrites thatconnect the lobes of the cerebrum to one another andto all other parts of the brain.The Nervous System 17908Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 179In the human brain the cerebral cortex is folded extensively. The folds are called convolutions or gyri and the grooves between them are ssures or sulci (you can see the folding of the cortex in the frontal section of the brain in Fig. 8-6). This fold-ing permits the presence of millions more neurons inthe cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex of an animalsuch as a dog or cat does not have this extensivefolding. This difference enables us to read, speak,do long division, write poetry and songs, and doso many other \"human\" things that dogs and cats can-not do. The cerebral cortex is divided into lobes that have the same names as the cranial bones external to them.Therefore, each hemisphere has a frontal been mapped; that is, certain areasare known to be associated with specic functions. Wewill discuss the functions of the cerebrum according tothese mapped areas.Frontal Lobes Within the frontal lobes are the motor areas that generate the impulses for voluntary movement. Thelargest portions are for movement of the hands andface, those areas with many muscles capable of veryne or precise movements. It is the large size of themotor area devoted to them that gives these musclestheir precision. The left motor area controls move-ment on the right side of the body, and the rightmotor area controls the left side of the body. This iswhy a patient who has had a cerebrovascular accident,or stroke, in the right frontal lobe will have paralysisof muscles on the left side (see Box 8-4: Cerebrovas-cular Accidents). Anterior to the motor areas are the premotor areas , which are concerned with learned motor skills that require a sequence of movements. T ying shoe-laces, for example, seems almost automatic to us; weforget having learned it. It is not a reflex, however;180 The Nervous System Frontal lobePremotor areaMotor area General sensory area Sensory association area Parietal Occipital lobe Visual area Auditory area Temporal association are a Motor speech areaOrbitofrontalcortex Figure 8-8. Left cerebral hemisphere showing some of the functional areas that have been mapped.QUESTION: What sensations are felt in the general sensory area?08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 180rather the premotor cortex has learned the sequence so well that we are able to repeat it without con-sciously thinking about it. The parts of the frontal lobes just behind the eyes are the prefrontal or orbitofrontal cortex . This area is concerned with things such as keeping emotionalresponses appropriate to the situation, realizing thatthere are standards of behavior (laws or rules of agame or simple courtesy) and following them, andanticipating and planning for the future. An examplemay be helpful to put all this together: Someone withdamage to the prefrontal area might become enragedif his pen ran out of ink during class, might throw thepen at someone, and might not think that a pen will beneeded tomorrow and that it is time to go buy one. Asyou can see, the prefrontal cortex is very important forsocial behavior, and greatly contributes to what makesus human. Also in the frontal lobe, usually only the left lobe for most right-handed people, is Broca's motor speech area, which controls the movements of the mouth involved in speaking.Parietal Lobes The general sensory areas in the parietal lobes receive impulses from receptors in the skin and feeland interpret the cutaneous sensations. The left area isfor the right side of the body and vice versa. Theseareas also receive impulses from stretch receptors inmuscles for conscious muscle sense. The largest por-tions of these areas are for sensation in the hands andface, those parts of the body with the most cutaneousreceptors and the most muscle receptors. The taste areas , which overlap the parietal and temporal lobes, receive impulses from taste buds on the tongue andelsewhere in the oral cavity. Temporal Lobes The olfactory areas in the temporal lobes receive impulses from receptors in the nasal cavities for thesense of smell. The olfactory association area learnsthe meaning of odors such as the smell of sour milk, orre, or brownies baking in the oven, and enables thethinking cerebrum to use that information effectively.The Nervous System 181 BOX8-4 CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENTS they cause is very widespread or affects vital centers in the medulla or pons. For CVAs of the thrombus type, a clot-dissolving drug may help reestablish blood flow. To be effec-tive, however, the drug must be administeredwithin 3 hours of symptom onset (see also Box11-7). Recovery from a CVA depends on its location and the extent of damage, as well as other factors.One of these is the redundancy of the brain.Redundancy means repetition or exceeding whatis necessary; the cerebral cortex has many moreneurons than we actually use in daily activities.The characteristic of plasticity means that theseneurons are available for use, especially in youngerpeople (less than 50 years of age). When a patientrecovers from a disabling stroke, what has oftenhappened is that the brain has established newpathways, with previously little-used neurons nowcarrying impulses \"full time.\" Such recovery ishighly individual and may take months. Yet anotherimportant factor is that CVA patients be started onrehabilitation therapy as soon as their conditionpermits.Acerebrovascular accident (CVA), or stroke , is damage to a blood vessel in the brain, resulting inlack of oxygen to that part of the brain. Possibletypes of vessel damage are thrombosis or hemor-rhage. Athrombus is a blood clot, which most often is a consequence of atherosclerosis, abnormal lipiddeposits in cerebral arteries. The rough surfacestimulates clot formation, which obstructs theblood flow to the part of the brain supplied bythe artery. The symptoms depend on the part of thebrain affected and may be gradual in onset if clotformation is slow. Approximately 80% of CVAs areof this type. A hemorrhage, the result of arteriosclerosis or aneurysm of a cerebral artery, allows blood out into brain tissue, which destroys brain neurons byputting excessive pressure on them as well asdepriving them of oxygen. Onset of symptoms inthis type of CVA is usually rapid. If, for example, the CVA is in the left frontal lobe, paralysis of the right side of the body will occur. Speech may also be affected if the speech areas areinvolved. Some CVAs are fatal because the damage08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 181The auditory areas , as their name suggests, receive impulses from receptors in the inner ear for hearing.The auditory association area is quite large. Part of itis concerned with the meanings of words we hear, thatis, with speech. Other parts are for the interpretationof sounds such as thunder during a storm, an ambu-lance siren, or a baby crying. Without proper interpre-tation, we would hear the sound but would not knowwhat it meant, and could not respond appropriately. Also in the temporal and parietal lobes in the left hemisphere (for most of us) are other speech areasconcerned with the thought that precedes speech.Each of us can probably recall (and regret) times whenwe have \"spoken without thinking,\" but in actualitythat is not possible. The thinking takes place very rap-idly and is essential in order to be able to speak (seeBox 8-5: Aphasia). Occipital Lobes Impulses from the retinas of the eyes travel along theoptic nerves to the visual areas in the occipital lobes . These areas \"see.\" The visual association areas inter-pret what is seen, and enable the thinking cerebrum touse the information. Imagine looking at a clock.Seeing the clock is far different from being able tointerpret it. At one time we learned to interpret theclock face and hands, and now we do not have to con-sciously decide what time the clock is reading. We cansimply use that information, such as hurrying a bit soas not to be late to class. Other parts of the occipital lobes are concerned with spatial relationships; thingssuch as judging distance and seeing in three dimen-sions, or the ability to read a map and relate it to thephysical world. The cerebral cortex has the characteristic of neural plasticity , the ability to adapt to changing needs, to recruit different neurons for certain functions, as mayoccur during childhood or recovery from a stroke.Another example is the visual cortex of a person whois born blind. The neurons in the occipital lobes thatwould have been used for vision will often be used foranother function; some may become part of an audi-tory area that is used to localize sounds and estimatetheir distance. Those of us who can see may not relyon hearing for localization; we simply look at wherewe think the sound came from. A blind person cannotdo this, and may have an extensive mental catalogue ofsounds, meanings of sounds, distances of sounds, andso on, some of these in the part of the cortex that nor-mally is for vision. The younger the person, the more plastic the brain. The brains of children are extraordinarily adaptable.As we get older, this ability diminishes, but is stillpresent. Association Areas As you can see in Fig. 8-8, many parts of the cerebralcortex are not concerned with movement or a particu-182 The Nervous System BOX8-5 APHASIA Auditory aphasia is \" word deafness ,\" caused by damage to an interpretation area. The personcan still hear but cannot comprehend what thewords mean. Visual aphasia is \" word blindness \"; the person can still see perfectly well, but can-not make sense of written words (the person retainsthe ability to understand spoken words). Imaginehow you would feel if wms qsbbcljw jmqr rfcyzgjgrw rm pcyb. Frustrating isn't it? You knowthat those symbols are letters, but you cannot\"decode\" them right away. Those \"words\"were formed by shifting the alphabet two letters(A/H11005C, B /H11005D, C /H11005E, etc.), and would normally be read as: \"you suddenly lost the ability to read.\" That may give you a small idea of what word blind- ness is like.Our use of language sets us apart from other animals and involves speech, reading, and writing.Language is the use of symbols (words) to desig-nate objects and to express ideas. Damage tothe speech areas or interpretation areas of thecerebrum may impair one or more aspects of a per-son's ability to use language; this is called aphasia . Aphasia may be a consequence of a cerebrovas- cular accident, or of physical trauma to the skulland brain such as a head injury sustained in anautomobile accident. If the motor speech (Broca's)area is damaged, the person is still able to under-stand written and spoken words and knows whathe wants to say, but he cannot say it. Without coor-dination and impulses from the motor speech area,the muscles used for speech cannot contract toform words properly.08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 182lar sensation. These may be called association areas and perhaps are what truly make us individuals. It isprobably these areas that give each of us a personality,a sense of humor, and the ability to reason and uselogic. Learning and memory are also functions ofthese areas. Although much has been learned about the forma- tion of memories, the processes are still incompletelyunderstood and mostly beyond the scope of this book.Briefly, however, we can say that memories of thingssuch as people or books or what you did last summerinvolve the hippocampus (from the Greek for \"seahorse,\" because of its shape), part of the temporallobe on the floor of the lateral ventricle. The two hip-pocampi seem to collect information from many areasof the cerebral cortex. When you meet a friend, forexample, the memory emerges as a whole: \"Here'sFred,\" not in pieces. People whose hippocampi aredamaged cannot form new memories that last morethan a few seconds. The right hippocampus is also believed to be involved in spatial cognition (literally: \"space think-ing\"). For example, if you are in school and a friendasks you the shortest way to your home, you will prob- ably quickly form a mental map. You can see how much memory that involves (streets, landmarks, andso on), but the hippocampus can take it a step furtherand make your memories three-dimensional and men-tally visible. You can see your way home. That is spa-tial cognition. It is believed that most, if not all, of what we haveexperienced or learned is stored somewhere in the brain. Sometimes a trigger may bring back memories;a certain scent or a song could act as possible triggers.Then we nd ourselves recalling something from thepast and wondering where it came from. The loss of personality due to destruction of brain neurons is perhaps most dramatically seen inAlzheimer's disease (see Box 8-6: Alzheimer's Disease). Basal Ganglia The basal ganglia are paired masses of gray matter within the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres(see Fig. 8-6). Their functions are certain subcon-scious aspects of voluntary movement, and they workwith the cerebellum. The basal ganglia help regulatemuscle tone, and they coordinate accessory move-ments such as swinging the arms when walking or ges-turing while speaking. The most common disorder ofthe basal ganglia is Parkinson's disease (see Box 8-7:Parkinson's Disease). Corpus Callosum As mentioned previously, the corpus callosum is a band of nerve bers that connects the left and rightcerebral hemispheres. This enables each hemisphereto know of the activity of the other. This is especiallyimportant for people because for most of us, the lefthemisphere contains speech areas and the right hemi-sphere does not. The corpus callosum, therefore, letsThe Nervous System 183 BOX8-6 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE of another protein called beta-amyloid that are damaging to neurons. A defective gene has been found in some patients who have late-onset Alzheimer's disease,the most common type. Yet another gene seems totrigger increased synthesis of beta-amyloid. Someresearch is focused on the interaction of thesegenes and on inflammation as a contributing factorto this type of brain damage. It is likely that the treatment of Alzheimer's dis- ease will one day mean delaying its onset with avariety of medications, each targeted at a differentaspect of this complex disease. Early diagnosis willbe very important, and this is yet another avenue ofresearch.In the United States, Alzheimer's disease , a pro- gressive, incurable form of mental deterioration,affects approximately 5 million people and is thecause of 100,000 deaths each year. The rst symp-toms, which usually begin after age 65, are mem-ory lapses and slight personality changes. As thedisease progresses, there is total loss of memory,reasoning ability, and personality, and those withadvanced disease are unable to perform even thesimplest tasks or self-care. Structural changes in the brains of Alzheimer's patients may be seen at autopsy. Neurobrillarytangles are abnormal brous proteins found in cellsof the cerebral cortex in areas important for mem-ory and reasoning. Also present are plaques made08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 183the left hemisphere know what the right hemisphere is thinking about, and the right hemisphere know whatthe left hemisphere is thinking and talking about. Abrief example may be helpful. If you put your left handbehind your back and someone places a pencil in yourhand (you are not looking at it) and asks you what it is,would you be able to say? Yes, you would. You wouldfeel the shape and weight of the pencil, nd the pointand the eraser. The sensory impulses from your lefthand are interpreted as \"pencil\" by the general sensoryarea in your right parietal lobe. Your right hemisphereprobably cannot speak, but its thoughts can be con-veyed by way of the corpus callosum to the left hemi-sphere, which does have speech areas. Your lefthemisphere can say that you are holding a pencil.Other aspects of the \"division of labor\" of our cerebralhemispheres are beyond the scope of this book, but itis a fascinating subject that you may wish to explorefurther.MENINGES AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID The connective tissue membranes that cover the brainand spinal cord are called meninges ; the three layers are illustrated in Fig. 8-9. The thick outermost layer,made of brous connective tissue, is the dura mater (Latin for \"tough mother\"), which lines the skull andvertebral canal. The middle arachnoid membrane (arachnids are spiders) is made of web-like strands ofconnective tissue. The innermost pia mater (Latin for \"gentle mother\") is a very thin membrane on the sur-face of the spinal cord and brain. Between the arach-noid and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space , which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the tissuefluid of the central nervous system. Recall the ventricles (cavities) of the brain: two lat- eral ventricles, the and ven-tricle. contains a choroid plexus, a capillarynetwork that forms cerebrospinal fluid from bloodplasma. This is a continuous process, and the cere-brospinal fluid then circulates in and around the cen-tral nervous system (Fig. 8-10). From the lateral and third ventricles, cerebrospinal fluid flows through the fourth ventricle, then to thecentral canal of the spinal cord, and to the cranial andspinal subarachnoid spaces. As more cerebrospinalfluid is formed, you might expect that some must be reabsorbed, and that is just what happens. From the cranial subarachnoid space, cerebrospinal fluid is reab-sorbed the blood within the double-layered cranial dura mater). The cerebrospinalfluid becomes blood plasma again, and the rate ofreabsorption normally equals the rate of production. Since cerebrospinal fluid is tissue fluid, one of its functions is to bring nutrients to CNS neurons and toremove waste products to the blood as the fluid isreabsorbed. The other function of cerebrospinal fluidis to act as a cushion for the central nervous system.The brain and spinal cord are enclosed in fluid-lledmembranes that absorb shock. You can, for example,shake your head vigorously without harming yourbrain. Naturally, this protection has limits; very sharpor heavy blows to the skull will indeed cause damageto the brain. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid may be used in the diagnosis of certain diseases (see Box 8-8: LumbarPuncture).184 The Nervous System BOX8-7 PARKINSON'S DISEASE Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the basal ganglia whose cause is unknown, and thoughthere is a genetic component in some families, itis probably not the only factor. The disease usu-ally begins after the age of 60. Neurons in thebasal ganglia that produce the neurotransmitterdopamine begin to degenerate and die, and thedeciency of dopamine causes specic kindsof muscular symptoms. Tremor, or involuntaryshaking, of the hands is probably the most com-mon symptom. The accessory movements regu-lated by the basal ganglia gradually diminish,and the affected person walks slowly withoutswinging the arms. A mask-like face is character-istic of this disease, as the facial muscles becomerigid. Eventually all voluntary movements be-come slower and much more difficult, and bal-ance is seriously impaired. Dopamine itself cannot be used to treat Parkinson's disease because it does not cross theblood-brain barrier. A substance called L-dopa does cross and can be converted to dopamine bybrain neurons. Unfortunately, L-dopa begins to lose its therapeutic effectiveness within a fewyears. Other medications in use do not provide a cure. Some researchers suggest that implants ofstem cells may offer the best hope of meaningfultherapy.08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 184185 Central canal Pia mater Arachnoid membrane Dura materGray matter White matter Spinal of meninges.

The name cranial indicates their origin, and many of them do carry impulses for functions involv-ing the head. Some, however, have more far-reaching destinations. The impulses for the senses of smell, taste, sight, hearing, and equilibrium are all carried by cranialnerves to their respective sensory areas in the brain.Some cranial nerves carry motor impulses to musclesof the face and eyes or to the salivary glands. The186 The Nervous 8-10. Formation, circulation, and reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid. See text for description. QUESTION: In this pathway, where is the CSF reabsorbed, and into what?08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 sively to the larynx, heart, stomach and intestines, andbronchial tubes. The functions of the cranial nerves are summarized in T able 8-4. THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM The autonomic nervous system (ANS ) is actually part of the peripheral nervous system in that it consistsof motor portions of some cranial and spinal nerves.Because its functioning is so specialized, however, theautonomic nervous system is usually discussed as aseparate entity, as we will do here. Making up the autonomic nervous system are vis- ceral motor neurons to smooth muscle, cardiac mus- cle, and glands. These are the visceral effectors ; muscle will either contract or relax, and glands willeither increase or decrease their secretions. The ANS has two divisions: sympathetic andparasympathetic . Often, they function in opposition to each other, as you will see. The activity of both divi-sions is integrated by the hypothalamus, whichensures that the visceral effectors will respond appro-priately to the situation. AUTONOMIC PATHWAYS An autonomic nerve pathway from the central nervoussystem to a visceral effector consists of two motorneurons that synapse in a ganglion outside the CNS(Fig. 8-12). The rst neuron is called the pregan- glionic neuron , from the CNS to the ganglion. The second neuron is called the postganglionic neuron , from the ganglion to the visceral effector. The gangliaare actually the cell bodies of the postganglionicneurons. SYMPATHETIC DIVISION Another name for the sympathetic division is thora-columbar division, which tells us where the sympa-thetic preganglionic neurons originate. Their cellThe Nervous System 187 BOX8-8 LUMBAR PUNCTURE Box Figure 8-B Cerebrospinal fluid from a patient with meningitis. The bacteria are streptococci, found in pairs. The large cells are WBCs. ( /H11003500) (From Sacher, RA, and McPherson, RA: Widmann's Clinical Interpretation of Laboratory Tests, ed. 11. FA Davis, Philadelphia, 2000, Plate52, with permission.)Alumbar puncture (spinal tap) is a diagnostic procedure that involves the removal of cere-brospinal fluid to determine its pressure and con-stituents. As the name tells us, the removal, using asyringe, is made in the lumbar area. Because thespinal cord ends between the 1st and 2nd lumbarvertebrae, the needle is usually inserted betweenthe 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae. The meningealsac containing cerebrospinal fluid extends to theend of the lumbar vertebrae, permitting access tothe cerebrospinal fluid with little chance of damag-ing the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid is a circulating fluid and has a normal pressure of 70 to 200 mmH 2O. An abnor- mal pressure usually indicates an obstruction in cir-culation, which may be caused by infection, atumor, or mechanical injury. Other diagnostictests would be needed to determine the precisecause. Perhaps the most common reason for a lumbar puncture is suspected meningitis , which may be caused by several kinds of bacteria. If the patientdoes have meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid will becloudy rather than clear and will be examined forthe presence of bacteria and many white bloodcells. A few WBCs in CSF is normal, because WBCs are found in all tissue fluid. Another abnormal constituent of cerebrospinal fluid is red blood cells. Their presence indicatesbleeding somewhere in the central nervous system.There may be many causes, and again, further test-ing would be necessary.08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 187188 The Nervous System Optic chiasma Figure 8-11.

Their axons extend to the sympathetic ganglia, most of which arelocated in two chains just outside the spinal column(see Fig. 8-12). Within the synapses effectors. arrangement has importance:The sympathetic division brings about widespreadresponses in many organs.The sympathetic division is dominant in stressful situations, which include anger, fear, or anxiety, aswell as exercise. For our prehistoric ancestors, stress-ful situations often involved the need for intense phys-ical activity\u2014the \"ght or flight response.\" Ournervous systems haven't changed very much in 50,000years, and if you look at T able 8-5, you will see thekinds of responses the sympathetic division stimulates.The heart rate increases, vasodilation in skeletal mus-cles supplies them with more oxygen, the bronchiolesdilate to take in more air, and the liver changes glyco-gen to glucose to supply energy. At the same time,08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 188digestive secretions decrease and peristalsis slows; these are not important in a stress situation.Vasoconstriction in the skin and viscera shunts bloodto more vital organs such as the heart, muscles, andbrain. All of these responses enabled our ancestors tostay and ght or to get away from potential danger.Even though we may not always be in life-threateningsituations during stress (such as guring out ourincome taxes), our bodies are prepared for just that. PARASYMPATHETIC DIVISION The other name for the parasympathetic division isthe craniosacral division. The cell bodies of parasym-pathetic preganglionic neurons are in the brain stemand the sacral segments of the spinal cord. Their axonsare in cranial nerve pairs 3, 7, 9, and 10 and in somesacral nerves and extend to the parasympathetic gan-glia. These ganglia are very close to or actually in thevisceral effector (see Fig. 8-12), and contain the post-ganglionic cell bodies, with very short axons to thecells of the effector. In the parasympathetic division, one preganglionic neuron synapses with just a few postganglionic neuronsto only one effector. With this anatomic arrangement,very localized (one organ) responses are possible.The parasympathetic division dominates in relaxed (non-stress) situations to promote normal functioningof several organ systems. Digestion will be efficient,with increased secretions and peristalsis; defecationand urination may occur; and the heart will beat at anormal resting rate. Other functions of this divisionare listed in T able 8-5. Notice that when an organ receives both sympa- thetic and parasympathetic impulses, the responses areopposites. Such an arrangement makes maintaining anappropriate level of activity quite simple, as in chang-ing the heart rate to meet the needs of a situation.Notice also that some visceral effectors receive onlysympathetic impulses. In such cases, the oppositeresponse is brought about by a decrease in sympatheticimpulses. Secretion by the sweat glands is an example. NEUROTRANSMITTERS Recall that neurotransmitters enable nerve impulses tocross synapses. In pathways there are twosynapses: one between preganglionic and postgan-glionic neurons, and the second between postgan-glionic neurons and visceral effectors.

Most sympa-thetic postganglionic release transmitternorepinephrine synapses with the effector cells. Norepinephrine is O- methyl transferase (COMT) or monoamine oxidase(MAO), or it may be removed from the synapse byreuptake. AGING AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM The aging brain does lose neurons, but this is only asmall percentage of the total and not the usual cause ofmental impairment in elderly people. (Far more com-mon causes are depression, malnutrition, hypotension,and the side effects of medications.) Some forgetful-ness is to be expected, however, as is a decreased abil-ity for rapid problem solving, but most memory should remain intact. Voluntary movements becomeslower, as do reflexes and reaction time. Think of driv-ing a car, an ability most of us take for granted. For elderly people, with their slower perceptions and reac-tion times, greater consciousness of driving is necessary. As the autonomic nervous system ages, dry eyes and constipation may become problems. T ransient hypo-tension may be the result of decreased sympatheticstimulation of vasoconstriction. In most cases, how-ever, elderly people who are aware of these aspects ofaging will be able to work with their physicians ornurses to adapt to them. SUMMARY The nervous system regulates many of our simplestand our most complex activities. The impulses gener-ated and carried by the nervous system are an exampleof the chemical level of organization of the body.These nerve impulses then regulate the functioning oftissues, organs, and organ systems, which permits us toperceive and respond to the world around us and thechanges within us. The detection of such changes isthe function of the sense organs, and they are the sub-ject of our next chapter.The Nervous System 191 Table 8-5 FUNCTIONS OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM Organ Sympathetic Response Parasympathetic Response Heart (cardiac muscle) Bronchioles (smooth muscle)Iris (smooth muscle)Salivary and intestines bladder (smooth muscle)Internal urethral sphincterLiverPancreasSweat glands Blood vessels in skin and viscera (smooth muscle) Blood vessels in skeletal muscle (smooth muscle) Adrenal glands Increase rate Dilate Pupil dilates Decrease secretion Decrease peristalsis Decrease secretion Contracts to prevent defecation Relaxes to prevent urination Contracts to prevent urination Changes glycogen to glucose rate (to normal) Constrict (to normal) Pupil constricts (to normal) Increase secretion (to normal) Increase peristalsis for normal digestion Increase secretion for normal digestion Relaxes to permit defecation Contracts for normal urination Relaxes to permit urination None Secretes insulin and digestive enzymes None None None None08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 191192 The Nervous System STUDY OUTLINE Functions of the Nervous System 1. Detect changes and feel sensations.2. Initiate responses to changes.3. Organize and store information. Nervous System Divisions 1. Central nervous system (CNS)\u2014brain and spinal cord. 2. Peripheral nervous system (PNS)\u2014cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Nerve Tissue\u2014neurons (nerve bers) and specialized cells (Schwann, neuroglia)1. Neuron cell body contains the nucleus; cell bodies are in the CNS or in the trunk and are protected bybone. 2. Axon carries impulses away from the cell body; dendrites carry impulses toward the cell body. 3. Schwann cells in PNS: Layers of cell membrane form the myelin sheath to electrically insulate neu-rons; nodes of Ranvier are spaces between adjacentSchwann cells. Nuclei and cytoplasm of Schwanncells form the neurolemma, which is essential forregeneration of damaged axons or able 8-1). 5. Synapse\u2014the space between the axon of one neu- ron and the dendrites or cell body of the next neu-ron. A neurotransmitter carries the impulse acrossa synapse and is then destroyed by a chemical inac-tivator. Synapses make impulse transmission oneway in the living person. Types of Neurons\u2014nerve bers 1. Sensory\u2014carry impulses from receptors to the CNS; may be somatic (from skin, skeletal muscles,joints) or visceral (from internal organs). 2. Motor\u2014carry impulses from the CNS to effectors; may be somatic (to skeletal muscle) or visceral (tosmooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands). Visceralmotor neurons make up the autonomic nervoussystem. 3. Interneurons\u2014entirely within the CNS. Nerves and Nerve Tracts 1. Sensory nerve\u2014made only of sensory neurons.2. Motor nerve\u2014made only of motor neurons.3. Mixed nerve\u2014made of both sensory and motor neurons. 4. Nerve tract\u2014a nerve within the CNS; also called white matter. The Nerve Impulse\u2014see Table 8-2 1. Polarization\u2014neuron membrane has a ( /H11001) charge outside and a ( /H11002) charge inside. 2. Depolarization\u2014entry of Na /H11001ions and reversal of charges on either side of the membrane. 3. Impulse transmission is rapid, often several meters per second. Saltatory conduction\u2014in a myelinated neuron only the nodes of Ranvier depolarize; increasesspeed of impulses. The Spinal Cord 1. Functions: transmits impulses to and from the brain, and integrates the spinal cord reflexes. 2. Location: within the vertebral canal; extends from the foramen magnum to the disc between the 1stand 2nd lumbar vertebrae. 3. Cross-section: internal H-shaped gray matter con- tains cell bodies of motor neurons and interneu-rons; external white matter is the myelinated axonsand dendrites of interneurons. 4. Ascending tracts carry sensory impulses to the brain; descending tracts carry motor impulses awayfrom the brain. 5. Central canal contains cerebrospinal fluid and is continuous with the ventricles of the brain. Spinal Nerves\u2014see Table 8-3 for major peripheral nerves1. Eight cervical pairs to head, neck, shoulder, arm, and diaphragm; 12 thoracic pairs to trunk; 5 lum-bar pairs and 5 sacral pairs to hip, pelvic cavity, andleg; 1 very small coccygeal pair. 2. Cauda equina\u2014the lumbar and sacral nerves that extend below the end of the spinal cord. 3. Each spinal nerve has two roots: dorsal or sensory root; dorsal root neurons; ventral or motor root; the tworoots unite to form a mixed spinal nerve. Spinal Cord Reflexes\u2014do not depend directly on the brain1. A reflex is an involuntary response to a stimulus.2. Reflex arc\u2014the pathway of nerve impulses during a08Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 192reflex: (1) receptors, (2) sensory neurons, (3) CNS with one or more synapses, (4) motor neurons,(5) effector that responds. 3. Stretch reflex\u2014a muscle that is stretched will con- tract; these reflexes help keep us upright againstgravity. The patellar reflex is also used clinically toassess neurologic functioning, as are many otherreflexes (Fig. 8-5). 4. Flexor reflex\u2014a painful stimulus will cause with- drawal of the body part; these reflexes are protec-tive. The Brain\u2014many parts that function as an integrated whole; see Figs. 8-6 and 8-8 forlocations1. Ventricles\u2014four that forms cerebrospinalfluid (Figs. 8-6 and 8-7). 2. Medulla\u2014regulates the vital functions of heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure; regulatesreflexes of coughing, sneezing, swallowing, andvomiting. 3. Pons\u2014contains respiratory centers that work with those in the medulla. 4. Midbrain\u2014contains centers for visual reflexes, auditory reflexes, and righting (equilibrium)reflexes. 5. Cerebellum\u2014regulates coordination of voluntary movement, muscle tone, stopping movements, andequilibrium; contributes to sensations involvingtexture and weight. 6. Hypothalamus\u2014produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which increases water reabsorption by thekidneys; produces oxytocin, which promotes uter-ine contractions for labor and delivery; producesreleasing hormones that regulate the secretions ofthe body of the autonomic nervous system (ANS);promotes visceral responses to emotional situa-tions; acts as a biological clock that regulates bodyrhythms. 7. Thalamus\u2014groups sensory impulses as to body part before relaying them to the cerebrum; aware-ness of pain but inability to localize; suppressesunimportant sensations to permit concentration;contributes to alertness and awareness, and tomemory. 8. Cerebrum\u2014two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum, which permits communicationbetween the hemispheres. The cerebral cortex isthe surface gray matter, which consists of cell bod- ies of neurons and is folded extensively into convo-lutions. The internal white matter consists of nervetracts that connect the lobes of the cerebrum to oneanother and to other parts of the brain. Frontal lobes\u2014motor areas initiate voluntary movement; premotor area regulates sequences of Broca's motor hemisphere) regulates the movementsinvolved in speech. Parietal lobes\u2014general sensory area feels and interprets the cutaneous senses and consciousmuscle sense; taste area extends into temporallobe, for sense of taste; speech areas (left hemi-sphere) for thought before speech. T emporal lobes\u2014auditory areas for hearing and interpretation; olfactory areas for sense of smelland interpretation; speech speech. Occipital lobes\u2014visual areas vision; interpre- tation areas for spatial relationships. Association areas\u2014in all lobes, for abstract thinking, reasoning, learning, memory, andpersonality. The hippocampi are essential for the formation of memories. Neural plasticity is the ability of the brain to adapt to changingneeds. Basal ganglia\u2014gray matter within the cerebral hemispheres; regulate accessory movements andmuscle tone. Meninges and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) (see Figs. 8-9 andspinal cord. 2. Subarachnoid space contains CSF , the tissue fluid of the CNS. 3. CSF is formed continuously in the ventricles of the brain by choroid plexuses, from bloodplasma. 4. CSF circulates from the ventricles to the central canal of the spinal cord and to the cranial andspinal subarachnoid spaces. 5. CSF is reabsorbed from the cranial subarachnoid space through arachnoid villi into blood in thecranial venous sinuses. The rate of reabsorptionequals the rate of production.The Nervous System 19308Scanlon(p3)-ch08 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 1936. As tissue fluid, CSF brings nutrients to CNS neu- rons and removes waste products. CSF also acts asa shock absorber to cushion the CNS. Cranial Nerves\u201412 pairs of nerves that emerge from the brain (see Fig. 8-11)1. Concerned with vision, hearing and equilibrium, taste and smell, and many other functions. 2. See T able 8-4 for the functions of each pair. The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) (see Fig. 8-12 and Table 8-5)1. Has two divisions: sympathetic and parasympa- thetic; their functioning is integrated by the hypo-thalamus. 2. Consists of motor neurons to visceral effectors: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands. 3. An ANS pathway consists of two neurons that synapse in a ganglion: Preganglionic to the effectors Most sympathetic ganglia are in two chains just outside the vertebral column; parasympa-thetic ganglia are very near or in the visceraleffectors. 4. Neurotransmitters: acetylcholine is released by all or MAO. 5. Sympathetic division\u2014dominates during stress sit- uations; responses prepare the body to meet physi-cal demands. 6. Parasympathetic division\u2014dominates in relaxed situations to permit normal functioning.194 The Nervous System REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

Thesenses of taste and smell enable us to enjoy the flavorof our food or warn us that food has spoiled and maybe dangerous to eat. Our sense of equilibrium keeps usupright. We also get information from our sensesabout what is happening inside the body. The pain ofa headache, for example, prompts us to do somethingabout it, such as take aspirin. In general, this is thepurpose of sensations: to enable the body to respondappropriately to ever-changing situations and main-tain homeostasis. SENSORY PATHWAY The impulses involved in sensations follow very pre-cise pathways, which all have the following parts: 1.Receptors \u2014detect changes ( stimuli ) and generate impulses. Receptors are usually very specic withrespect to the kinds of changes they respond to.Those in the retina detect light rays, those in thenasal cavities detect vapors, and so on. Once a spe-cic stimulus has affected receptors, however, theyall respond in the same way by generating electri-cal nerve impulses. 2.Sensory neurons \u2014transmit impulses from recep- tors to the central nervous system. These sensoryneurons are found in both spinal nerves and cranialnerves, but each carries impulses from only onetype of receptor. 3.Sensory tracts \u2014white matter in the spinal cord or brain that transmits the impulses to a specic partof the brain. 4.Sensory areas \u2014most are in the cerebral cortex. These areas feel and interpret the sensations.Learning to interpret sensations begins in infancy,without our awareness of it, and continues through-out life. CHARACTERISTICS OF SENSATIONS Certain characteristics of sensations will help youunderstand how the sensory areas work with informa-tion from the receptors. 1.Projection \u2014the sensation seems to come from the area where the receptors were stimulated. If youtouch this book, the sensation of touch seems to be in your hand but is actually being felt by your cere-bral cortex. That it is indeed the brain that feelssensations is demonstrated by patients who feelphantom pain after amputation of a limb. After loss of a hand, for example, the person may still feelthat the hand is really there. Why does this hap-pen? The receptors in the hand are no longer pres-ent, but the severed nerve endings continue togenerate impulses. These impulses arrive in theparietal lobe area for the hand, and the brain doeswhat it has always done and creates the projection,the feeling that the hand is still there. For mostamputees, phantom pain diminishes as the severednerves heal, but the person often experiences aphantom \"presence\" of the missing part. This maybe helpful when learning to use an articial limb. 2.Intensity \u2014some sensations are felt more distinctly and to a greater degree than are others. A weakstimulus such as dim light will affect a small num-ber of receptors, but a stronger stimulus, such asbright sunlight, will stimulate many more recep-tors. When more receptors are stimulated, moreimpulses will arrive in the sensory area of the brain.The brain \"counts\" the impulses and projects amore intense sensation. 3.Contrast \u2014the effect of a previous or simultaneous sensation on a current sensation, which may thenbe exaggerated or diminished. Again, this is a func-tion of the brain, which constantly compares sensa-tions. If, on a very hot day, you jump into aswimming pool, the water may feel quite cold atrst. The brain compares the new sensation to theprevious one, and since there is a signicant differ-ence between the two, the water will seem colderthan it actually is. 4.Adaptation \u2014becoming unaware of a continuing stimulus. Receptors detect changes, but if the stim-ulus continues it may not be much of a change, andthe receptors will generate fewer impulses. Thewater in the swimming pool that seemed cold atrst seems to \"warm up\" after a few minutes. Thewater has not changed temperature, and the recep-tors for cold have no changes to detect, thereforethey generate fewer impulses. The sensation ofcold lessens, and we interpret or feel that asincreasing warmth. For another example, look atyour left wrist (or perhaps the right one). Many ofus wear a watch and are probably unaware of its198 The Senses09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 198presence on the arm most of the time. The cuta- neous receptors for touch or pressure adapt veryquickly to a continuing stimulus, and if there is nochange, there is nothing for the receptors to detect. 5.After-image \u2014the sensation remains in the con- sciousness even after the stimulus has stopped. Afamiliar example is the bright after-image seen afterwatching a flashbulb go off. The very bright lightstrongly stimulates receptors in the retina, whichgenerate many impulses that are perceived as anintense sensation that lasts longer than the actualstimulus. CUTANEOUS SENSES The dermis of the skin and the subcutaneous tissuecontain receptors for the sensations of touch, pressure,heat, cold, and pain. The receptors for pain, heat, and cold are free nerve endings , which also respond to any intense stimulus. Intense pressure, for example,may be felt as pain. The receptors for touch and pres-sure are encapsulated nerve endings , meaning that there is a cellular structure around the nerve ending(Fig. 9-1). The cutaneous senses provide us with informa- tion about the external environment and also aboutthe skin itself. Much of the information about theenvironment is not of great importance and isprocessed at a subconscious level (suppressed by thethalamus), though we can choose to be aware of it. Forexample, could you distinguish a cotton T-shirt fromdenim jeans by touch alone? Probably, but you mightnot realize that you can do that until you try it by, say,sorting laundry in the dark. If you were walking bare-foot, could you tell if you were walking on a carpet, aThe Senses 199 Free nerve endings (temperature receptor) Merkel disc (touch receptor) Ruffini corpuscle (pressure receptor)Meissner corpuscle (touch receptor)Pacinian endings (pain receptor) Figure 9-1. Cutaneous receptors in a section of the skin. Free nerve endings and encap- sulated nerve endings are shown.QUESTION: In which layers are most of the cutaneous receptors located?09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 199wood floor, concrete, or beach sand? Yes, you could. But are we usually aware of the sensation from thesoles of our feet? If all is going well, probably not.Some people with diabetes develop diabetic neuropa- thy, damage to nerves that impairs sensation, and they may say that a wood floor feels like walking on cottonballs or that the buttons of a shirt feel too large or toosmall. They are aware of such odd sensations simplybecause the feelings are odd. For most of us, the touchof the wood floor is not brought to awareness becauseit is what the brain expects from past experience,but if the floor has splinters or if the beach sand is hot,we are certainly aware. This is information we canbring to our conscious minds if necessary, but usuallydo not. As for the skin itself, if you have ever had poison ivy or chickenpox, you may remember the itching sensa-tion of the rash. An itch is actually a mild pain sensa-tion, which may become real pain if not scratched.Why does scratching help relieve some itches, besidesby removing an external irritant? One proposedmechanism is that scratching is a bit more painful thanthe itch, and the impulses it generates can distract thebrain from the impulses from the itch. Scratching willnot help relieve the itch of poison ivy, chickenpox, ora mosquito bite, however, because the irritating chem-icals are in the skin, not on it. In such cases, scratch-ing may do more damage and worsen inflammation atthe site. The sensory areas for the skin are in the parietal lobes. You may recall from Chapter 5 that the sensi-tivity of an area of skin is determined by the numberof receptors present. The number of receptors corre-sponds to the size of the sensory area in the cerebralcortex. The largest parts of this sensory cortex are forthe parts of the skin with the most receptors, that is,the hands and face. As mentioned previously, sensory areas are not merely passive recipients of impulses. Consider thesensation of wetness. It is a distinct sensation, butthere are no receptors for \"wet\" in the skin. Wheredoes the sensation come from? Where all sensationcomes from: the brain. The parietal lobes have learnedto associate the simultaneous reception of temperatureand pressure impulses with \"wet.\" You can demon-strate this for yourself by putting on a plastic gloveand dunking your ngers in a cup of water. Your n-gers will feel wet, though they are perfectly dry insidethe glove. Wetness is a learned sensation, created bythe brain.REFERRED PAIN Free nerve endings are also found in internal organs.The smooth muscle of the small intestine, for exam-ple, has free nerve endings that are stimulated byexcessive stretching or contraction; the resulting painis called visceral pain. Sometimes pain that originatesin an internal organ may be felt in a cutaneous area;this is called referred pain . The pain of a heart attack (myocardial infarction) may be felt in the left arm andshoulder, or the pain of gallstones may be felt in theright shoulder. This referred pain is actually a creation of the brain. Within the spinal cord are sensory tractsthat are shared by cutaneous impulses and visceralimpulses. Cutaneous impulses are much more fre-quent, and the brain correctly projects the sensation tothe skin. When the impulses come from an organ suchas the heart, however, the brain may still project thesensation to the \"usual\" cutaneous area. The brainprojects sensation based on past experience, and cuta-neous pain is far more common than visceral pain.Knowledge of referred pain, as in the examples men-tioned earlier, may often be helpful in diagnosis. MUSCLE SENSE Muscle sense (also called proprioception or kines-thetic sense) was discussed in Chapter 7 and will bereviewed only briefly here. Stretch receptors (alsocalled proprioceptors or muscle spindles) detectstretching of muscles and generate impulses, whichenable the brain to create a mental picture to knowwhere the muscles are and how they are positioned.Conscious muscle sense is felt by the parietal lobes.Unconscious muscle sense is used by the cerebellumto coordinate voluntary movements. We do not haveto see our muscles to be sure that they are performingtheir intended actions. Muscle sense also contributesto our ability to distinguish the shape of objects. SENSE OF TASTE The receptors for taste are found in taste buds , most of which are in papillae on the tongue (Fig. 9-2). These chemoreceptors detect chemicals in solution in the mouth. The chemicals are foods and the solventis saliva (if the mouth is very dry, taste is very200 The Senses09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:48 AM Page 200201 Figure 9-2. Structures concerned with the senses of smell and taste, shown in a mid- sagittal section of the head.QUESTION: If we sniff something pungent, why can we often taste it as well? (Follow the inhaled air.)09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 201indistinct). There are ve (perhaps more) general types of taste receptors: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, andsavory. Savory (also called umami or glutamate) is ataste like grilled meat. We experience many more dif-ferent tastes, however, because foods are often com-plex chemicals that stimulate different combinationsof receptors, and the sense of smell also contributes toour perception of food. Some taste preferences have been found to be genetic. People with more than the average number oftaste buds nd broccoli very bitter, whereas peoplewith fewer taste buds may like the taste. The impulses from taste buds are transmitted by the facial and glossopharyngeal (7th and 9th cranial)nerves to the taste areas in the parietal-temporal cor-tex. The sense of taste is important because it makeseating enjoyable. Some medications may interferewith the sense of taste, and this sense becomes lessacute as we get older. These may be contributing fac-tors to poor nutrition in certain patients and in theelderly. SENSE OF SMELL The receptors for smell ( olfaction ) are chemorecep- tors that detect vaporized chemicals that have been sniffed into the upper nasal cavities (see Fig. 9-2). Justas there are specic taste receptors, there are alsospecic scent receptors, and research indicates thathumans have several hundred different receptors.When stimulated by vapor molecules, olfactory re- ceptors generate impulses carried by the olfactory nerves (1st cranial) through the ethmoid bone to theolfactory bulbs. The pathway for these impulses endsin the olfactory areas of the temporal lobes. Vaporsmay stimulate many combinations of receptors, and ithas been estimated that the human brain is capable ofdistinguishing among 10,000 different scents. That may seem impressive, but the human sense of smell is very poorly developed compared to thoseof other animals. Dogs, for example, have a sense ofsmell about 2000 times more acute than that of peo-ple. (It has been said that most people live in a worldof sights, whereas dogs live in a world of smells.) Asmentioned earlier, however, much of what we call tasteis actually the smell of food. If you have a cold andyour nasal cavities are stuffed up, food just doesn'ttaste as good as it usually does. Adaptation occurs rel-atively quickly with odors. Pleasant scents may besharply distinct at rst but rapidly seem to dissipate or fade, and even unpleasant scents may fade with longexposure. HUNGER AND THIRST Hunger and thirst may be called visceral sensations , in that they are triggered by internal changes. Hungeris a sensation that seems to be far more complex thanwas rst thought, but thirst seems to be somewhatsimpler. The receptors for both senses are specializedcells in the hypothalamus. Receptors for hunger arebelieved to detect changes in blood nutrient levels, theblood levels of hormones from the stomach and smallintestine, and a hormone released by adipose tissue; allof these chemical signals are collected by the hypo-thalamus. The receptors for thirst detect changes inthe body water content, which is actually the water-to-salt proportion. Naturally we do not feel these sensations in the hypothalamus: They are projected. Hunger is pro-jected to the stomach, which contracts. Thirst is pro-jected to the mouth and pharynx, and less saliva isproduced. If not satised by eating, the sensation of hunger gradually diminishes, that is, adaptation occurs. Thereason is that after blood nutrient levels decrease, theybecome stable as fat in adipose tissue is used forenergy. With little or no digestive activity in the gas-trointestinal tract, secretion of hormones diminishes.With no sharp fluctuations of the chemical signals, thereceptors in the hypothalamus have few changes todetect, and hunger becomes much less intense. In contrast, the sensation of thirst, if not satised by drinking, continues to worsen. There is no adaptation.As body water is lost, the amount keeps decreasingand does not stabilize. Therefore, there are constantchanges for the receptors to detect, and prolongedthirst may be painful. THE EYE The eye contains the receptors for vision and arefracting system that focuses light rays on the recep-tors in the retina. We will begin our discussion, how-ever, with the accessory structures of the eye, thenlater return to the eye itself and the physiology ofvision.202 The Senses09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 202EYELIDS AND THE LACRIMAL APPARATUS The eyelids contain skeletal muscle that enables the eyelids to close and cover the front of the eyeball.Eyelashes along the border of each eyelid help keepdust out of the eyes. The eyelids are lined with a thinmembrane called the conjunctiva , which is also folded over the white of the eye and merges with thecorneal epithelium. Inflammation of this membrane,called conjunctivitis , may be caused by allergies or by certain bacteria or viruses, and makes the eyes red,itchy, and watery. Tears are produced by the lacrimal glands , located at the upper, outer corner of the eyeball,within the orbit (Fig. 9-3). Secretion of tears occursconstantly, but is increased by the presence of irri-tating chemicals (onion vapors, for example) or dust,and in certain emotional situations (sad or happy).Small ducts take tears to the anterior of the eyeball,and blinking spreads the tears and washes the surfaceof the eye. T ears are mostly water, with about 1%sodium chloride, similar to other body fluids. T earsalso contain lysozyme , an enzyme that inhibits the growth of most bacteria on the wet, warm surfaceof the eye. At the medial corner of the eyelids aretwo small openings into the superior and inferiorlacrimal canals. These ducts take tears to the lacrimal sac (in the lacrimal bone), which leads to the nasolacrimal duct , which empties tears into the nasal cavity. This is why crying often makes the noserun. EYEBALL Most of the eyeball is within and protected by theorbit , formed by the lacrimal, maxilla, zygomatic, frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones. The six extrin- sic muscles of the eye (Fig. 9-4) are attached to this bony socket and to the surface of the eyeball. Thereare four rectus (straight) muscles that move the eyeballup and down or side to side; the name tells you whichdirection. The medial rectus muscle, for example,pulls the eyeball medially, as if to look at the nose. Thetwo oblique (slanted) muscles rotate the eye. The cra-nial nerves that innervate these muscles are the oculo-motor, trochlear, and abducens (3rd, 4th, and 6thcranial nerves, respectively). The very rapid and com-plex coordination of these muscles in both eyes is, for-tunately, not something we have to think about. Theconvergence of both eyes on an object is very impor-tant to ensure a single image (that is, to prevent dou-ble vision) and to give us depth perception and athree-dimensional world.The Senses 203 eye.QUESTION: Where do tears usually end up?09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 203Layers of the Eyeball In its wall, the eyeball has three layers: the outer sclera, middle choroid layer, and inner retina (Fig.9-5). The sclera is the thickest layer and is made of brous connective tissue that is visible as the white ofthe eye. The most anterior portion is the cornea , which differs from the rest of the sclera in that it istransparent. The cornea has no capillaries, covers theiris and pupil inside the eye, and is the rst part of theeye that refracts , or bends, light rays. The choroid layer contains blood vessels and a dark blue pigment (derived from melanin) thatabsorbs light within the eyeball and thereby preventsglare (just as does the black interior of a camera). Theanterior portion of the choroid is modied into morespecialized structures: the ciliary body and the iris.The ciliary body (muscle) is a circular muscle that surrounds the edge of the lens and is connected to thelens by suspensory ligaments . The lens is made of a transparent, elastic protein, and, like the cornea, hasno capillaries (see Box 9-1: Cataracts). The shape ofthe lens is changed by the ciliary muscle, whichenables the eye to focus light from objects at varyingdistances from the eye. Just in front of the lens is the circular iris, the col- ored part of the eye; its pigment is a form of melanin.What we call \"eye color\" is the color of the iris and is a genetic characteristic, just as skin color is. T wo setsof smooth muscle bers in the iris change the diame-ter of the pupil , the central opening. Contraction of the radial bers dilates the pupil; this is a sympatheticresponse. Contraction of the circular bers constrictsthe pupil; this is a parasympathetic response constriction is a reflex thatprotects the retina from intense light or that permitsmore acute near vision, as when reading. The retina lines the posterior two-thirds of the eyeball and contains the visual receptors, the rods andcones (Fig. 9-6). Rods detect only the presence of light, whereas cones detect colors, which, as you may know from physics, are the different wavelengths ofvisible light. Rods are proportionally more abundanttoward the periphery, or edge, of the retina. Our bestvision in dim light or at night, for which we dependon the rods, is at the sides of our visual elds. Conesare most abundant in the center of the retina, espe-cially an area called the macula lutea directly behind the center of the lens on what is called the visual axis.The fovea , which contains only cones, is a small depression in the macula and is the area for best colorvision. An important cause of vision loss for people over 65 years of age is age-related macular degeneration204 The Senses Extrinsic mus- cles of eye.

In the dry form ofAMD, small fatty deposits impair circulation to themacula, and cells die from lack of oxygen. In the wetform of AMD, abnormal blood vessels begin leaking into the retina, and cells in the macula die from thedamaging effects of blood outside its vessels.

Small cataracts may be destroyedby laser surgery. Articial lenses are available, andmay be surgically implanted to replace an exten- sively cloudy lens. The artificial lens is not adjustable, however, and the person may requireglasses or contact lenses for vision at certaindistances.The lens of the eye is normally transparent but may become opaque; this cloudiness or opacity is calledacataract . Cataract formation is most common among elderly people. With age, the proteins of the lens break down and lose their transparency. Long- term exposure to ultraviolet light (sunlight) seems tobe a contributing factor, as is smoking. The cloudy lens does not refract light properly,09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 205the retina we use most: for reading, for driving, for recognizing people, and for any kind of close work.People of all ages should be aware of this conditionand that smoking and exposure to ultraviolet rays are risk factors. When light strikes the retina, the rods and cones generate impulses. These impulses are carried by gan- glion neurons , which all converge at the optic disc(see Figs. 9-5 and 9-6) and pass through the wall of the eyeball as the optic nerve . There are no rods or cones in the optic disc, so this part of the retina issometimes called the \"blind spot.\" We are not awareof a blind spot in our eld of vision, however, in partbecause the eyes are constantly moving, and in partbecause the brain \"lls in\" the blank spot to create a\"complete\" picture.206 The Senses Sclera ChoroidPigment cells Bipolar neurons Ganglion neurons Light wavesCone Rod Optic nerveOptic nerve fibers Figure 9-6. Microscopic structure of the retina in the area of the optic disc. See text for description. QUESTION: Which type of neuron forms the optic nerve? Which cells are the photo- receptors?09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 206Cavities of the Eyeball There are two cavities within the eye: the posterior cavity and the anterior cavity. The larger, posterior cavity is found between the lens and retina and con- tains vitreous humor (or vitreous body). This semi- solid substance keeps the retina in place. If the eyeballis punctured and vitreous humor is lost, the retina mayfall away from the choroid; this is one possible causeof a detached retina . The anterior cavity is found between the back of the cornea and the front of the lens, and containsaqueous humor , the tissue fluid of the eyeball. Aqueous humor is formed by capillaries in the ciliarybody, flows anteriorly through the pupil, and is reab-sorbed by the canal of Schlemm (small veins also called the scleral venous sinus) at the junction of theiris and cornea. Because aqueous humor is tissue fluid,you would expect it to have a nourishing function, andit does. Recall that the lens and cornea have no capil-laries; they are nourished by the continuous flow ofaqueous humor (see Box 9-2: Glaucoma). PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION For us to see, light rays must be focused on the retina,and the resulting nerve impulses must be trans-mitted to the visual areas of the cerebral cortex in thebrain.Refraction of light rays is the deflection or bend- ing of a ray of light as it passes through one object andinto another object of greater or lesser density. Therefraction of light within the eye takes place in the fol-lowing pathway of structures: the cornea, aqueoushumor, lens, and vitreous humor. The lens is the onlyadjustable part of the refraction system. When lookingat distant objects, the ciliary muscle is relaxed and thelens is elongated and thin. When looking at nearobjects, the ciliary muscle contracts to form a smallercircle, the elastic lens recoils and bulges in the middle,and has greater refractive power (see Box 9-3: Errorsof Refraction). When light rays strike the retina, they stimulate chemical reactions in the rods and cones. In rods, thechemical rhodopsin breaks down to form scotopsin and retinal (a derivative of vitamin A). This chem-ical reaction generates an electrical impulse, andrhodopsin is then resynthesized in a slower reaction.Adaptation to darkness, such as going outside at night,takes a little while because being in a well-lit area hasbroken down most of the rhodopsin in the rods, andresynthesis of rhodopsin is slow. The opposite situa-tion, perhaps being suddenly awakened by a brightlight, can seem almost painful. What happens is this:In darkness the rods have resynthesized a full supply ofrhodopsin, and the sudden bright light breaks downall the rhodopsin at the same time. The barrage ofThe Senses 207 BOX9-2 GLAUCOMA cannot easily integrate with the normal image of the other eye. When both eyes are affected, theperson may not become aware of the gradual lossof peripheral vision, because close work such asreading does not require the edges of the visualelds. Glaucoma may often be controlled with medica- tions that constrict the pupil and flatten the iris, thus opening up access to the canal of Schlemm. Ifthese or other medications are not effective, lasersurgery may be used to create a larger drainagecanal. Anyone over the age of 40 should have a test for glaucoma; anyone with a family history of glau-coma should have this test annually, as should thosewith diabetes or high blood pressure. If diagnosedearly, glaucoma is treatable, and blindness can usu-ally be prevented.The presence of aqueous humor in the anterior cav- ity of the eye creates a pressure called intraocularpressure. An increase in this pressure is an impor-tant risk factor for glaucoma , which is now dened as a group of disorders that damage the optic nerveand cause loss of vision. Other risk factors includehigh blood pressure and diabetes. In the mostcommon form of glaucoma, aqueous humor is notreabsorbed properly into the canal of Schlemm.Increased pressure in the anterior cavity is transmit-ted to the lens, the vitreous humor, and the retinaand optic nerve. As pressure on the retina increases,halos may be seen around bright lights, and periph-eral vision is lost. Frequently, however, there are nosymptoms. A person with glaucoma may not noticethe shrinking visual eld in one eye before vision loss is far advanced. This happens because the brain will suppress a faulty image from one eye that it09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 207208 BOX9-3 ERRORS OF REFRACTION Normal visual acuity is referred to as 20/20; that is, the eye should and does clearly see an object 20feet away. Nearsightedness (myopia ) means that the eye sees near objects well but not distantones. If an eye has 20/80 vision, this means thatwhat the normal eye can see at 80 feet, the near-sighted eye can see only if the object is brought to20 feet away. The nearsighted eye focuses imagesfrom distant objects in front of the retina, becausethe eyeball is too long or the lens too thick. Thesestructural characteristics of the eye are hereditary.Correction requires a concave lens to spread outlight rays before they strike the eye. Farsightedness (hyperopia ) means that the eye sees distant objects well. Such an eye may havean acuity of 20/10, that is, it sees at 20 feet what the normal eye can see only at 10 feet. The farsightedeye focuses light from near objects \"behind\" theretina, because the eyeball is too short or the lenstoo thin. Correction requires a convex lens to con-verge light rays before they strike the eye. As we get older, most of us will become more far- sighted ( presbyopia ). As the aging lens loses its elasticity, it is not as able to recoil and thicken for nearvision, and glasses for reading are often necessary. Astigmatism is another error of refraction, caused by an irregular curvature of the cornea orlens that scatters light rays and blurs the image onthe retina. Correction requires a lens ground specif-ically for the curvature of the individual eye. Normal eye Nearsighted FarsightedAstigmatic Corrected Corrected Box Figure 9-A Errors of refraction compared to normal eye.

A few minuteslater the bright light seems ne because the rods arerecycling their rhodopsin slowly, and it is not breakingdown all at once. Chemical reactions in the cones, also involving retinal, are brought about by different wavelengths oflight. It is believed that there are three types of cones:red-absorbing, blue-absorbing, and green-absorbingcones. Each type absorbs wavelengths over about athird of the visible light spectrum, so red cones,for example, absorb light of the red, orange, andyellow wavelengths. The chemical reactions in conesalso generate electrical impulses (see Box 9-4: NightBlindness and Color Blindness). The impulses from the rods and cones are trans- mitted to ganglion neurons (see Fig. 9-6); these con- verge at the optic disc and become the optic nerve , which passes posteriorly through the wall of the eye-ball. Ganglion neurons also seem to have a photo-receptor chemical (called melanopsin) that maycontribute to the daily resetting of our biologicalclocks.The optic nerves from both eyes come together at the optic chiasma (or chiasm), just in front of the pituitary gland (see Fig. 8-11). Here, the medial bersof each optic nerve cross to the other side. This cross-ing permits each visual area to receive impulses fromboth eyes, which is important for binocular vision. The visual areas are in the occipital lobes of the cerebral cortex. Although each eye transmits a slightlydifferent picture (look straight ahead and close oneeye at a time to see the difference between the two pic-tures), the visual areas put them together, or integratethem, to make a single image that has depth and threedimensions. This is called binocular vision . The visual areas also right the image, because the image onthe retina is upside down. The image on lm in a cam-era is also upside down, but we don't even realize thatbecause we look at the pictures right side up. Thebrain just as automatically ensures that we see ourworld right side up. Also for near vision, the pupils constrict to block out peripheral light rays that would otherwise blur theimage, and the eyes converge even further to keep theimages on the corresponding parts of both retinas. The Senses 209 BOX9-4 NIGHT BLINDNESS AND COLOR BLINDNESS color blindness on his X chromosome has no gene at all for color vision on his Y chromosome and willbe color blind.Night blindness , the inability to see well in dim light or at night, is usually caused by a deciency ofvitamin A, although some night blindness mayoccur with aging. Vitamin A is necessary for the syn-thesis of rhodopsin in the rods. Without sufficientvitamin A, there is not enough rhodopsin present torespond to low levels of light. Color blindness is a genetic disorder in which one of the three sets of cones is lacking or non-functional. Total color blindness, the inability to seeany colors at all, is very rare. The most commonform is red-green color blindness, which is theinability to distinguish between these colors. Ifeither the red cones or green cones are nonfunc-tional, the person will still see most colors, but willnot have the contrast that the non-working set ofcones would provide. So red and green shades willlook somewhat similar, without the denite differ-ence most of us see. This is a sex-linked trait; therecessive gene is on the X chromosome. A womanwith one gene for color blindness and a gene fornormal color vision on her other X chromosome willnot be color blind but may pass the gene for colorblindness to her children. A man with a gene for Box Figure 9-B Example of color patterns used to detect color blindness.09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 209The importance of pupil constriction can be demon- strated by looking at this page through a pinhole in apiece of paper. You will be able to read with the pagemuch closer to your eye because the paper blocks outlight from the sides. The importance of convergence can be demon- strated by looking at your nger placed on the tip ofyour nose. You can feel your eyes move medially(\"cross\") in maximum convergence. If the eyes don'tconverge, the result is double vision; the brain cannotmake the very different images into one, and settlesfor two. This is temporary, however, because the braindoes not like seeing double and will eventually sup-press one image. You have probably heard of the condition called \"lazy eye\" (the formal name is strabismus ), in which a person's eyes (the visual axis of each) cannot bedirected at precisely the same point. T rue convergenceis not possible and, if untreated, the brain simply willnot use the lazy eye image. That eye may stop focus-ing and become functionally blind because the brain isignoring the nerve impulses from it. Such loss ofvision is called amblyopia . Correction of a lazy eye may involve eye exercises (to make the lazy eyestraighten out), a patch over the good eye (to make thelazy eye straighten out and take over), or surgery tocorrect an imbalance of the extrinsic muscles. You canshow yourself the benets of converging eyes the nexttime you are a passenger in a car ( notthe driver). As the car is moving, close one eye. Does the oncominglandscape seem to flatten out, lose dimension? This isloss of depth perception and some of the three dimen-sionality that our brains provide. THE EAR The ear consists of three areas: the outer ear, the mid-dle ear, and the inner ear (Fig. 9-7). The ear containsthe receptors for two senses: hearing and equilib- rium . These receptors are all found in the inner ear. OUTER EAR The outer ear consists of the auricle and the ear canal. The auricle , or pinna , is made of cartilage cov- ered with skin. For animals such as dogs, whose earsare movable, the auricle may act as a funnel for soundwaves. For people, however, the flat and stationaryauricle is not important. Hearing would not be nega-tively affected without it, although those of us who wear glasses would have our vision impaired withoutour auricles. The ear canal is lined with skin that con- tains ceruminous glands. It may also be called theexternal auditory meatus , and is a tunnel into the temporal bone, curving slightly forward and down. MIDDLE EAR The middle ear is an air-lled cavity in the temporal bone. The eardrum , or tympanic membrane , is stretched across the end of the ear canal and vibrateswhen sound waves strike it. These vibrations aretransmitted to the auditory bones: transmits vibrations to the fluid-lled inner ear at theoval window . The eustachian tube (auditory tube) extends from the middle ear to the nasopharynx and permits air toenter or leave the middle ear cavity. The air pressurein the middle ear must be the same as the externalatmospheric pressure in order for the eardrum tovibrate properly. You may have noticed your ears\"popping\" when in an airplane or when driving to ahigher or lower altitude. Swallowing or yawning cre-ates the \"pop\" by opening the eustachian tubes andequalizing the air pressures. The eustachian tubes of children are short and nearly horizontal and may permit bacteria to spreadfrom the pharynx to the middle ear. This is why otitis media may be a complication of a strep throat. INNER EAR Within the temporal bone, the inner ear is a cavity called the bony labyrinth (a labyrinth is a series of interconnecting paths or tunnels, somewhat like amaze but without dead ends; see Fig. 9-7), which islined with membrane called the membranous labyrinth . Perilymph is the fluid found between bone and membrane, and endolymph is the fluid within the membranous structures of the inner ear. These struc-tures are the cochlea, concerned with hearing, and theutricle, saccule, and semicircular canals, all concernedwith equilibrium (Fig. 9-8). Cochlea The cochlea is shaped like a snail shell with two-and- a-half structural turns. Internally, the cochlea is parti-tioned canals. IncusEardrumMastoid sinusC Figure 9-7.

What is second?09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 211is the cochlear duct, the floor of which is the basilar membrane that supports the receptors for hearing inthe organ of Corti (spiral organ ). The receptors are called hair cells (their projections are not \"hair,\" ofcourse, but rather are specialized microvilli calledstereocilia), which contain endings of the cochlearbranch of the 8th cranial nerve. Overhanging the haircells is the tectorial membrane (Fig. 9-9). Very simply, the process of hearing involves the transmission of vibrations and the generation of nerveimpulses. When sound waves enter the ear canal,vibrations are transmitted the following sequenceof structures: eardrum, andendolymph within the cochlea. Imagine the vibrationsin the fluids as ripples or waves. The basilar mem-brane ripples and pushes the hair cells of the organ ofCorti against the tectorial membrane. When the haircells bend, they generate impulses that are carried by the 8th cranial nerve to the brain. As you may recall,the auditory areas are in the temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex. It is here that sounds are heard andinterpreted (see Box 9-5: Deafness). The auditory areas also enable us to determine from which direction a sound is coming. Simplystated, the auditory areas count and compare the num- ber of impulses coming from each inner ear. Forexample, if more impulses arrive from the left cochleathan from the right one, the sound will be projected tothe left. If the source of a sound is directly above yourhead, the sound may seem to come from all directions,because each auditory area is receiving approximatelythe same number of impulses and cannot project thesensation to one side or the other. The nal structure in the hearing pathway is the round window (see Fig. 9-8). The membrane-covered212 The Senses Semicircular canals Inner ear structures.

When the stapes pushes in thefluid at the oval window, the round window bulgesout, which prevents damage to the hair cells. Utricle and Saccule The utricle and saccule are membranous sacs an area called the vestibule , between the cochlea and semicircular canals. Within the utricle and saccule arehair cells embedded in a gelatinous membrane withtiny crystals of calcium carbonate called otoliths . Gravity pulls on the otoliths and bends the hair cellsas the position of the head changes (Fig. 9-10). Theimpulses generated by these hair cells are carried bythe vestibular portion of the 8th cranial nerve to thecerebellum, midbrain, and the temporal lobes ofthe cerebrum. The cerebellum and midbrain use this information to maintain equilibrium at a subconscious level. Wecan, of course, be aware of the position of the head,and it is the cerebrum that provides awareness.214 The Senses BOX9-5 DEAFNESS measles). Deterioration of the hair cells in the cochlea is a natural consequence of aging, and theacuity of hearing diminishes as we get older. Forexample, it may be more difficult for an elderly per-son to distinguish conversation from backgroundnoise. Chronic exposure to loud noise acceleratesdegeneration of the hair cells and onset of this typeof deafness. Listening to music by way of earphonesis also believed to increase the risk of this type ofdamage.Central deafness \u2014damage to the auditory areas in the temporal lobes.

At thebase of each is an enlarged portion called the ampulla(see Fig. 9-8), which contains hair cells (the crista) thatare affected by movement. As the body moves for-ward, for example, the hair cells are bent backwardat rst and then straighten (see Fig. 9-10). The bend-ing of the hair cells generates impulses carried by thevestibular branch of the 8th cranial nerve to thecerebellum, midbrain, and temporal lobes of the cere-brum. These impulses are interpreted as starting or stopping, and accelerating or decelerating, or chang-ing direction, and this information is used to maintainequilibrium while we are moving (see Box 9-6: MotionSickness). In summary then, the utricle and saccule provide information about the position of the body at rest,while the semicircular canals provide informationabout the body in motion. Of course, there is some overlap, and the brain puts all the information together to create a single sense of body position.The Senses 215 Utricle Saccule Otoliths cells8th cranial nerve1.

QUESTION: In part A, what causes the hair cells to bend?

The aortic arch , which receives blood pumped by the left ventricle of theheart, curves over the top of the heart. The left andright carotid arteries are branches of the aortic arch that take blood through the neck on the way to thebrain. In each of these vessels are pressoreceptors andchemoreceptors (see Fig. 12-7). Pressoreceptors in the carotid sinuses aortic sinus detect changes in blood pressure. Chemorecep- tors in the carotid bodies and the aortic body detect changes in the oxygen and carbon dioxide content andthe pH of blood. The impulses generated by thesereceptors do not give rise to sensations that we feel butrather are information used to make any necessarychanges in respiration or circulation. We will returnto this in later chapters, so one example will sufficefor now. If the blood level of oxygen decreases signicantly, this change (hypoxia) is detected by carotid and aorticchemoreceptors. The sensory impulses are carried bythe glossopharyngeal (9th cranial) and vagus (10thcranial) nerves to the medulla. Centers in the medullamay then increase the respiratory rate and the heartrate to obtain and circulate more oxygen. These arethe respiratory and cardiac reflexes that were men- tioned in Chapter 8 as functions of the glossopha- ryngeal and vagus nerves. The importance of thesereflexes is readily apparent: to maintain normal bloodlevels of oxygen and carbon dioxide and to maintainnormal blood pressure.AGING AND THE SENSES All of the senses may be diminished in old age. In theeye, cataracts may make the lens opaque. The lensalso loses its elasticity and the eye becomes morefarsighted, a condition called presbyopia. The riskof glaucoma increases, and elderly people should betested for it because treatment is available that canprevent blindness. Macular degeneration, in whichcentral vision becomes impaired rst, is a major causeof vision loss for people over 65. Reading and closework of any kind become difficult. In the ear, cumulative damage to the hair cells in the organ of Corti usually becomes apparent sometime after the age of 60. Hair cells that have beendamaged in a lifetime of noise cannot be replaced(regrowth of cochlear hair cells has been stimulated inguinea pigs, but not yet in people). The deafness ofold age ranges from slight to profound; very oftenhigh-pitched sounds are lost rst, while hearingmay still be adequate for low-pitched sounds. Thesense of equilibrium may be diminished; the body isslower to react to tilting, and falls may become morefrequent. Both taste and smell become less acute with age, which may contribute to poor nutrition in elderlypeople. SUMMARY Changes take place all around us as well as withinus. If the body could not respond appropriately toenvironmental and internal changes, homeostasiswould soon be disrupted, resulting in injury, illness, oreven death. T o respond appropriately to changes, thebrain must know what they are. Conveying this infor-mation to our brains is the function of our senses.Although we may sometimes take our senses forgranted, we could not survive for very long withoutthem. You have just read about the great variety of inter- nal and external changes that are detected by the senseorgans. You are also familiar with the role of the nerv-ous system in the regulation of the body's responses.In the next chapter we will discuss the other regula-tory system, the endocrine system. The hormonesof the endocrine glands are produced in response tochanges, and their regulatory effects all contribute tohomeostasis.216 The Senses BOX9-6 MOTION SICKNESS Motion sickness is characterized by cold sweats, hyperventilation, nausea, and vomiting when theperson is exposed to repetitive motion that isunexpected or unfamiliar, or that cannot be con-trolled. Seasickness is a type of motion sickness,as is carsickness (why children are carsick moreoften than adults is not known). Some people are simply not affected by the rolling of a ship or train; for others, the constantstimulation of the receptors for position rstbecomes uncomfortable, then nauseating. Forthose who know they are susceptible to motionsickness, medications are available for use beforetraveling by plane, train, boat, or car.09Scanlon(p3)-ch09 8/17/06 10:49 AM Page 216Purpose of Sensations\u2014to detect changes in the external or internal environment toenable the body to respond appropriatelyto maintain homeostasis Sensory Pathway\u2014pathway of impulses for a sensation1.

The other regulating system of the body isthe endocrine system , which consists of endocrineglands that secrete chemicals called hormones . These glands, and the names of the hormones they secrete,are shown in Fig. 10-1. Endocrine glands are ductless; that is, they do not have ducts to take their secretions to specic 10-1. The endocrine system. Locations of many endocrine glands. Both male and female gonads (testes and ovaries) are shown. QUESTION: Why is the location of the thyroid gland not really important for its function?10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 224Instead, hormones are secreted directly into capillaries and circulate in the blood throughout the body. Eachhormone then exerts very specic effects on certainorgans, called target organs or target tissues . Some hormones, such as insulin and thyroxine, have manytarget organs. Other hormones, such as calcitonin andsome pituitary gland hormones, have only one or afew target organs. In general, the endocrine system and its hormones help regulate growth, the use of foods to produceenergy, resistance to stress, the pH of body fluids andfluid balance, and reproduction. In this chapter we willdiscuss the specic functions of the hormones andhow each contributes to homeostasis. CHEMISTRY OF HORMONES With respect to their chemical structure, hormonesmay be classied into three groups: amines, proteins,and steroids. 1.Amines \u2014these simple hormones are structural variations of the amino acid tyrosine. This groupincludes thyroxine from the thyroid norepinephrine from the adrenalmedulla. 2.Proteins \u2014these hormones are chains of amino acids. Insulin from the pancreas, growth hormonefrom the anterior pituitary gland, and calcitoninfrom the thyroid gland are all proteins. Shortchains of amino acids may be called peptides . Antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin, synthesized bythe hypothalamus, are peptide hormones. 3.Steroids \u2014cholesterol is the precursor for the steroid hormones, which include cortisol and aldos-terone from the adrenal cortex, and REGULATION OF HORMONE SECRETION Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands whenthere is a need for them, that is, for their effects ontheir target organs. The cells of endocrine glandsrespond to changes in the blood or perhaps to otherhormones in the blood. These stimuli are the infor-mation they use to increase or decrease secretion of their own hormones. When a hormone brings aboutits effects, the stimulus is reversed, and secretion ofthe hormone decreases until the stimulus reoccurs.You may recall from Chapter 1 that this is a negativefeedback mechanism, and the mechanism for thyrox-ine was depicted in Fig. 1-3. Let us use insulin as a dif-ferent example here. Insulin is secreted by the pancreas when the blood glucose level is high; that is, hyperglycemia is thestimulus for secretion of insulin. Once circulatingin the blood, insulin enables cells to remove glucosefrom the blood so that it can be used for energyproduction and enables the liver to store glucoseas glycogen. As a result of these actions of insulin,the blood glucose level decreases, reversing the stim-ulus for secretion of insulin. Insulin secretion thendecreases until the blood glucose level increasesagain. In any hormonal negative feedback mechanism , information about the effects of the hormone is \"fedback\" to the gland, which then decreases its secretionof the hormone. This is why the mechanism is called\"negative\": The effects of the hormone reverse thestimulus and decrease the secretion of the hormone.The secretion of many other hormones is regulated ina similar way. The hormones of the anterior pituitary gland are secreted in response to releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) secreted by the hypothalamus.You may recall this from Chapter 8. Growth hormone,for example, is secreted in response to growth hor-mone-releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypo-thalamus. As growth hormone exerts its effects, thesecretion of GHRH decreases, which in turn decreasesthe secretion of growth hormone. This is another typeof negative feedback mechanism. For each of the hormones to be discussed in this chapter, the stimulus for its secretion will also be men-tioned. Some hormones function as an antagonistic pair to regulate a particular aspect of blood chemistry; these mechanisms will also be covered. THE PITUITARY GLAND The pituitary gland (or hypophysis the Figure 10-2. Hormones of the pituitary gland and their target organs. QUESTION: Which pituitary hormones have other endocrine glands as their target organs? Despite its small size, the pituitary gland regulates many body functions. Its two major portions are theposterior pituitary gland ( neurohypophysis ), which is an extension of the nerve tissue of the hypothalamus,and the anterior pituitary gland ( adenohypophysis ),which is separate glandular tissue. All of the hormones of the pituitary gland and their target organs areshown in Fig. 10-2. It may be helpful for you to lookat this summary picture before you begin reading thefollowing sections.10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page of the posterior pituitary gland are actually produced by the hypothalamus and simplystored in the posterior pituitary until needed. Theirrelease is stimulated by nerve impulses from the hypo-thalamus (Fig. 10-3). Antidiuretic Hormone Antidiuretic hormone vaso- ) increases the reabsorption of water by kidney tubules, which decreases the amount of urine formed.The water is reabsorbed into the blood, so as urinaryoutput is decreased, blood volume is increased, whichhelps maintain normal blood pressure. ADH alsodecreases sweating, but the amount of water con-served is much less than that conserved by the kidneys. The stimulus for secretion of ADH is decreased water content of the body. If too much water is lostthrough sweating or diarrhea, for example, osmore- ceptors in the hypothalamus detect the increased \"saltiness\" of body fluids. The hypothalamus thentransmits impulses to the posterior pituitary toincrease the secretion of ADH and decrease the loss ofmore water in urine. Any type of dehydration stimulates the secretion of ADH to conserve body water. In the case of severehemorrhage, ADH is released in large amounts andwill also cause vasoconstriction, especially in arteri-oles, which will help to raise or at least maintain bloodpressure. This function gives ADH its other name,vasopressin . Ingestion of alcohol inhibits the secretion of ADH and increases urinary output. If alcohol intake is exces-sive and fluid is not replaced, a person will feel thirstyand dizzy the next morning. The thirst is due to theloss of body water, and the dizziness is the result oflow blood pressure.The Endocrine System 227 Hypothalamus Releasing hormones Capillaries in hypothalamus Hypophyseal portal veins Capillaries in anterior pituitary gland. ( pituitary stores hormones produced in the hypothalamus. ( B) Releasing hormones of the hypothalamus circulate directly to the anterior pituitary and influence its secretions. Notice the two networks of capillaries. QUESTION: In part A, name the hormones of the posterior pituitary. In part B, Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy and stimulates release of milk fromthe mammary glands. As labor begins, the cervix of the uterus is stretched, which generates sensory impulses to thehypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the posteriorpituitary to release oxytocin. Oxytocin then causesstrong contractions of the smooth muscle (myo-metrium) of the uterus to bring about delivery of thebaby and the placenta. The secretion of oxytocin isone of the few positive feedback mechanisms withinthe body, and the external brake or shutoff of thefeedback cycle is delivery of the baby and the placenta. It has been discovered that the placenta itself secretes oxytocin at the end of gestation and in anamount far higher than that from the posterior pitu-itary gland. Research is continuing to determine theexact mechanism and precise role of the placenta inlabor. When a baby is breast-fed, the sucking of the baby stimulates sensory impulses from the mother's nippleto the hypothalamus. Nerve impulses from the hypo-thalamus to the posterior pituitary cause the release ofoxytocin, which stimulates contraction of the smoothmuscle cells around the mammary ducts. This releaseof milk is sometimes called the \"milk let-down\" reflex.The hormones of the posterior pituitary are summa-rized T able 10-1. Both ADH and oxytocin are peptide hormones with similar structure, having nine amino acids each.And both have been found to influence aspects ofbehavior such as nurturing and trustfulness. Certainbrain cells have receptors for vasopressin, and they seem to be involved in creating the bonds that sustainfamily life. T rust is part of many social encounterssuch as friendship, school, sports and games, and buy-ing and selling, as well as family life. These two smallhormones seem to have some influence on us mentallyas well as physically. ANTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND The hormones of the anterior pituitary gland regu- late many body functions. They are in turn regulatedby releasing hormones from the hypothalamus. These releasing hormones are secreted into capillariesin the hypothalamus and pass through the hypophy- seal portal veins to another capillary network in the anterior pituitary gland. Here, the releasing hormonesare absorbed and stimulate secretion of the anteriorpituitary hormones. This small but specialized path-way of circulation is shown in Fig. 10-3. This pathwaypermits the releasing hormones to rapidly stimulatethe anterior pituitary, without having to pass throughgeneral circulation. Growth Hormone Growth hormone (GH) is also called somatotropin , and it does indeed promote growth (see Fig. 10-4).GH stimulates cells to produce insulin-like growth fac-tors (IGFs), intermediary molecules that bring aboutthe functions of GH. Growth hormone increases thetransport of amino acids into cells, and increases therate of protein synthesis. Amino acids cannot be storedin the body, so when they are available, they must be228 The Endocrine System Table 10-1 HORMONES OF GLAND vasopressin) Oxytocin Increases water reabsorption by the kidney tubules (water returns to the blood) Decreases sweating Causes vasoconstriction (in large amounts) Promotes contraction of myometrium of uterus (labor) Promotes release of milk from mammary glandsDecreased water content in the body (alcohol inhibits secretion) Nerve impulses from hypothalamus, the result of stretching of cervix or stimulation of nipple Secretion from placenta at end of gestation\u2014 stimulus unknown10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 228used in protein synthesis. Excess amino acids are changed to carbohydrates or fat, for energy storage.Growth hormone ensures that amino acids will be usedfor whatever protein synthesis is necessary, before theamino acids can be changed to carbohydrates. Growthhormone also stimulates cell division in those tissuescapable of mitosis. These functions contribute to thegrowth of the body during childhood, especiallygrowth of bones and muscles. You may now be wondering if GH is secreted in adults, and the answer is yes. The use of amino acidsfor the synthesis of proteins is still necessary. Even ifthe body is not growing in height, some tissues willrequire new proteins for repair or replacement. GHalso stimulates the release of fat from adipose tissueand the use of fats for energy production. This is important any time we go for extended periods with- out eating, no matter what our ages. The secretion of GH is regulated by two releasing hormones from the hypothalamus. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which increases thesecretion of GH, is produced during hypoglycemiaand during exercise. Another stimulus for GHRH is ahigh blood level of amino acids; the GH then secretedwill ensure the conversion of these amino acids intoprotein. Somatostatin may also be called growth hor- mone inhibiting hormone (GHIH), and, as its nametells us, it decreases the secretion of GH. Somatostatinis produced during hyperglycemia. Disorders of GHsecretion are discussed in Box 10-1.The Endocrine System 229 Increases use of fats for energyIncreases protein synthesisIncreases mitosisBone and muscle Liver and other viscera ATPGHAnterior pituitary Figure 10-4. Functions of growth hormone. QUESTION: Which functions of growth hormone directly help bones and muscles to grow?10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 229Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH ) is also called thyrotropin, and its target organ is the thyroid gland.TSH stimulates the normal growth of the thyroid andthe secretion of thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T3). The functions of these thyroid hormones will be covered later in this chapter. The secretion of TSH is stimulated by thyrotropin- releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.When metabolic rate (energy (ACTH ) increased bycorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) thehypothalamus. CRH is produced in any type of phys-iological stress situation such as injury, disease, exer-cise, or hypoglycemia (being hungry is stressful). Prolactin Prolactin , as its name suggests, is responsible for lac- tation. More precisely, prolactin initiates and main-tains milk the mammary glands. of secretion prolactin hormone (PIH) from the hypo-thalamus. The mammary glands must rst be actedupon by other hormones such as estrogen and proges-terone, which are secreted in large amounts by the placenta during pregnancy. Then, after delivery of thebaby, prolactin secretion increases and milk is pro-duced. If the mother continues to breast-feed, pro-lactin levels remain high. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH ) is one of the gonadotropic hormones; that is, it has its effects onthe gonads: the ovaries or testes. FSH is named forone of its functions in women. Within the ovaries areovarian follicles that contain potential ova (egg cells).FSH stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles; that is,it initiates egg development in cycles the testes. The secretion of is stimulated (GnRH ). FSH secretion is decreased by inhibin, a hormone produced by the ovaries or testes. Luteinizing Hormone Luteinizing hormone (LH) is another gonadotropic hormone. In women, LH is responsible for ovulation,the release of a mature ovum from an ovarian follicle.LH then stimulates that follicle to develop into thecorpus luteum, which secretes progesterone, alsounder the influence of LH. In men, LH stimulates theinterstitial cells of the testes to secrete testosterone.230 The Endocrine System BOX10-1 DISORDERS OF GROWTH HORMONE nothave this condition; they are tall as a result of their genetic makeup and good nutrition. In an adult, hypersecretion of GH is caused by a pituitary tumor, and results in acromegaly . The long bones cannot grow because the epiphysealdiscs are closed, but the growth of other bones isstimulated. The jaw and other facial bones becomedisproportionately large, as do the bones of thehands and feet. The skin becomes thicker, and thetongue also grows and may protrude. Other conse-quences include compression of nerves by abnor-mally growing bones and growth of the articularcartilages, which then erode and bring on arthritis.Treatment of acromegaly requires surgical removalof the tumor or its destruction by radiation.A deciency or excess of growth hormone (GH) during childhood will have marked effects on thegrowth of a child. Hyposecretion of GH results inpituitary dwarsm , in which the person may attain a nal height of only 3 to 4 feet but will havenormal body proportions. GH can now be pro-duced using genetic engineering and may be usedto stimulate growth in children with this disorder.GH will not increase growth of children with thegenetic potential for short stature. Reports that GHwill reverse the effects of aging are simply not true. Hypersecretion of GH results in giantism (or gigantism), in which the long bones grow exces-sively and the person may attain a height of 8 feet.Most very tall people, such as basketball players, do10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 230(LH is also called ICSH, interstitial cell stimulating hormone.) Secretion of LH is also regulated by GnRH from the hypothalamus. We will return to FSH and LH, aswell as a discussion of the sex hormones, in Chapter20. The hormones of the anterior pituitary are summa- rized in T able 10-2. THYROID GLAND The thyroid gland is located on the front and sides of the trachea just below the larynx. Its two lobes areconnected by a middle piece called the isthmus. Thestructural units of the thyroid gland are thyroid folli-cles, which produce thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothy- ronine (T3). Iodine is necessary for the synthesis of these hormones; thyroxine contains four atoms ofiodine, and T 3contains three atoms of iodine.The third hormone produced by the thyroid gland is calcitonin , which is secreted by parafol- licular cells. Its function is very different from thoseof thyroxine and T 3, which you may recall from Chapter 6. THYROXINE AND T3 Thyroxine (T4) and T3have the lation of energy production and protein synthesis,which contribute to growth of the body and to normalbody functioning throughout life (Fig. 10-5). Thyrox-ine and T 3increase cell respiration of all food types (carbohydrates, fats, and excess amino acids) andthereby increase energy and heat production. Theyalso increase the rate of protein synthesis within cells.Normal production of thyroxine and T 3is essential for physical growth, normal mental development, andmaturation of the reproductive system. These hor-mones are the most important day-to-day regulatorsof metabolic rate; their activity is reflected in the func-The Endocrine System 231 Table 10-2 HORMONES OF THE ANTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND Hormone Function(s) Regulation of Secretion Increases rate of mitosis Increases amino acid transport into cells Increases rate of protein synthesis Increases use of fats for energy Increases secretion of thyroxine and T 3 by thyroid gland Increases secretion of cortisol by the adrenal cortex Stimulates production by the mam- mary glands In women: Initiates growth of ova in ovarian follicles Increases secretion of estrogen by follicle cells In men: Initiates sperm production in the testes In women: Causes ovulation Causes the ruptured ovarian follicle to become the corpus luteum Increases secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum In men: Increases secretion of testosterone AM Page 231tioning of the brain, muscles, heart, and virtually all other organs.

Secretion of and T also Fig. 1-3). When themetabolic rate (energy production) decreases, this change is detected by the hypothalamus, whichsecretes thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). TRHstimulates the anterior TSH,which stimulates the thyroid to release thyroxine andT 3, which raise the metabolic rate by increasing energy production. This negative feedback mecha-nism then shuts off TRH from the hypothalamus untilthe metabolic decreases again.232 The System Thyroid and T4 3 Increase cell respiration of all foodsIncrease protein synthesis Glucose Fats Excess amino acidsATPBone and muscle Liver and viscera Brain Reproductive organs Figure 10-5.

QUESTION: Which functions of thyroxine help bones and muscles to grow and maintain their own functions?10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 232CALCITONIN Calcitonin decreases the reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from the bones to the blood, therebylowering blood levels of these minerals. This function of calcitonin helps maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phosphate and also helps maintaina stable, strong bone matrix. It is believed thatcalcitonin exerts its most important effects duringchildhood, when bones are growing. A form of calci-tonin obtained from salmon is used to help treatosteoporosis. The stimulus for secretion of calcitonin is hyper- calcemia , that is, a high blood calcium level. When blood calcium is high, calcitonin ensures that no morecalcium will be removed from bones until there is areal need for more calcium in the blood (Fig. 10-6).The hormones of the thyroid gland are summarized inT able 10-3. PARATHYROID GLANDS There are four parathyroid glands : two on the back of each lobe of the thyroid gland (Fig. 10-7). The hor-mone they produce is called parathyroid hormone. PARATHYROID HORMONE Parathyroid hormone (PTH ) is an antagonist to cal- citonin and is important for the maintenance of nor-mal blood levels of calcium and phosphate. The targetorgans of PTH are the bones, small intestine, and kid- neys. PTH increases the reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from bones to the blood, thereby raisingtheir blood levels. Absorption of calcium and phos-phate from food in the small intestine, which alsorequires vitamin D, is increased by PTH. This tooraises the blood levels of these minerals. In the kid- neys, PTH stimulates the activation of vitamin D andincreases the reabsorption of calcium and the excre-tion of phosphate (more than is obtained from bones).Therefore, the overall effect of PTH is to raise theblood calcium level and lower the blood phosphatelevel. The functions of PTH are summarized in T able10-4. Secretion of PTH is stimulated by hypocalcemia , a low blood calcium level, and inhibited by hypercal-cemia. The antagonistic effects of PTH and calcitoninare shown in Fig. 10-6. T ogether, these hormonesmaintain blood calcium within a normal range.Calcium in the blood is essential for the process ofblood clotting and for normal activity of neurons andmuscle cells. As you might expect, a sustained hypersecretion of PTH, such as is caused by a parathyroid tumor, wouldremove calcium from bones and weaken them. It hasbeen found, however, that an intermittent, brief excessof PTH, such as can occur by injection, will stimulatethe formation of more bone matrix, rather than matrixreabsorption. This may seem very strange\u2014the oppo-site of what we would expect\u2014but it shows how muchwe have yet to learn about the body. PTH is beinginvestigated as a possible way to help prevent osteo-porosis.

GLUCAGON Glucagon stimulates the liver to change glycogen to glucose (this process is called glycogenolysis , which literally means \"glycogen breakdown\") and to increasethe use of fats and excess amino acids for energy pro-duction. The process of gluconeogenesis (literally, \"making new glucose\") is the conversion of excessamino acids into simple carbohydrates that may enterthe reactions of cell respiration. The overall effect ofglucagon, therefore, is to raise the blood glucose leveland to make all types of food available for energyproduction. The secretion of glucagon is stimulated by hypo- glycemia , a low blood glucose level. Such a state may occur between meals or during physiological stress sit-uations such as exercise (Fig. 10-8). INSULIN Insulin increases the transport of glucose from the blood into cells by increasing the permeability ofcell membranes to glucose. (Brain, liver, and kidneycells, however, are not dependent on insulin forglucose intake.) Once inside cells, glucose is used inThe Endocrine System 235 Larynx Thyroid Parathyroid glands Parathyroid glands in posterior view, on lobes of the thyroid gland.QUESTION: Which of the target organs of PTH may be called a reservoir, and what do they store? BOX10-2 DISORDERS OF THYROXINE (energy production) decreases, resulting in lethargy, muscular weakness, slow heart rate, a feeling ofcold, weight gain, and a characteristic puffiness ofthe face. The administration of thyroid hormoneswill return the metabolic rate to normal. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hypersecretion of thyroxine. Theautoantibodies seem to bind to TSH receptors onthe thyroid cells and stimulate secretion of excessthyroxine. The symptoms are those that would beexpected when the metabolic rate is abnormallyelevated: weight loss accompanied by increasedappetite, increased sweating, fast heart rate, feelingof warmth, and fatigue. Also present may be goiterand exophthalmos, which is protrusion of the eyes.Treatment is aimed at decreasing the secretion ofthyroxine by the thyroid, and medications orradioactive iodine may be used to accomplish this.Iodine is an essential component of thyroxine (and T 3), and a dietary deciency of iodine causes goi- ter. In an attempt to produce more thyroxine, the thyroid cells become enlarged, and hence the thy-roid gland enlarges and becomes visible on thefront of the neck. The use of iodized salt has madegoiter a rare condition in many parts of the world. Hyposecretion of thyroxine in a newborn has devastating effects on the growth of the child.Without thyroxine, physical growth is diminished,as is mental development. This condition is calledcretinism , characterized by severe physical and mental retardation. If the thyroxine deciency isdetected shortly after birth, the child may betreated with thyroid hormones to promote normaldevelopment. Hyposecretion of thyroxine in an adult respiration to produce energy. The liver and skele- tal muscles also change glucose to glycogen ( glycoge- nesis , which means \"glycogen production\") to be stored for later use. Insulin is also important in themetabolism of other food types; it enables cells to takein fatty acids and amino acids to use in the synthesis oflipids and proteins ( notenergy production). Without insulin, blood levels of lipids tend to rise and cells accu-mulate excess fatty acids. With respect to blood glu-cose, insulin decreases its level by promoting the use ofglucose for energy production. The antagonistic func-tions of insulin and glucagon are shown in Fig. 10-8. Insulin is a vital hormone; we cannot survive for very long without it. A deciency of insulin or in itsfunctioning is called diabetes mellitus , which is dis- cussed in Box 10-3: of insulin is stimulated by hyper- glycemia , a high blood glucose level. This state occurs after eating, especially of meals high in carbo-hydrates. As glucose is absorbed from the small intes-tine into the blood, insulin is secreted to enable cellsto use the glucose for immediate energy. At the sametime, any excess glucose will be stored in the liver andmuscles as glycogen.You will also notice in Fig. 16-7 the cells called delta cells. These produce the hormone somatostatin,which is identical to growth hormone-inhibiting hor-mone from the hypothalamus. Pancreatic somato-statin acts locally to inhibit the secretion of insulin andglucagon, and it seems to slow the absorption of theend products of digestion in the small intestine. Thehormones of the pancreas are summarized in T able10-5. ADRENAL GLANDS The two adrenal glands are located one on top of each kidney, which gives them their other name ofsuprarenal glands . Each adrenal gland consists of two parts: an inner adrenal medulla and an outer adrenalcortex. The hormones produced by each part havevery different functions.

Epinephrine , secreted in larger amounts, increases the heart rate and force of contraction and stimulatesvasoconstriction in skin and viscera and vasodilation inskeletal muscles. It also dilates the bronchioles,decreases peristalsis, stimulates the liver to change glycogen to glucose, increases the use of fats forenergy, and increases the rate of cell respiration. Manyof these effects do indeed seem to be an echo of sym-pathetic responses, don't they? Responding to stress isso important that the body acts redundantly (that is,exceeds what is necessary, or repeats itself) and hasboth a nervous mechanism and a hormonal mecha-nism. Epinephrine is actually more effective than sym-pathetic stimulation, however, because the hormoneincreases energy production and cardiac output to agreater extent. The hormones of the adrenal medullaare summarized in T able 10-6, and their in Fig. 10-9.

The long-term effects of hyperglycemia produce distinctive vascular changes. The capillary wallsthicken, and exchange of gases and nutrientsdiminishes. The most damaging effects are seen inthe skin (especially of the feet), the retina (diabeticretinopathy), and the kidneys. Poorly controlleddiabetes may lead to dry gangrene, blindness, andsevere kidney damage. Atherosclerosis is common,because faulty triglyceride metabolism is linked tofaulty glucose metabolism. Neuropathy (damage tonerves) leads to impaired cutaneous sensation anddifficulty with ne movements, such as buttoning ashirt. It is now possible for diabetics to preventmuch of this tissue damage by precise monitoringof the blood glucose level and more frequentadministration of insulin. Insulin pumps are able tomore closely mimic the natural secretion of insulin. A very serious potential problem for the type 1 diabetic is ketoacidosis . When glucose cannot be used for energy, the body turns to fats and proteins,which are converted by the liver to ketones.Ketones are organic acids (acetone, acetoaceticacid) that can be used in cell respiration, but cellsare not able to utilize them rapidly so ketonesaccumulate in the blood. Ketones are acids, andlower the pH of the blood as they accumulate. Thekidneys excrete excess ketones, but in doing soexcrete more water as well, which leads to dehy-dration and worsens the acidosis. Without adminis-tration of insulin to permit the use of glucose, andIV fluids to restore blood volume to normal, ketoaci-dosis will progress to coma and death.There are two types of diabetes mellitus : Type 1 is called insulin-dependent diabetes and its onset isusually in childhood (juvenile onset). Type 2is called non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and itsonset is usually later in life (maturity onset). Type 1 diabetes is characterized by destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans and acomplete lack of insulin (see Box Figure 10-A);onset is usually abrupt. Destruction of the beta cellsis an autoimmune response, perhaps triggered by avirus. There may be a genetic predisposition,because certain HLA types are found more fre-quently in type 1 diabetics than in other children(see Box 11-5: HLA). Insulin by injection (inhaledinsulin is undergoing clinical trials) is essential tocontrol type 1 diabetes. Research is continuing onthe use of immunosuppressant medications to tryto preserve some beta cells (if diagnosis is early),and also on the transplantation of stem cells toreplace lost beta cells. Intype 2 diabetes, insulin is produced but can- not exert its effects on cells because of a loss ofinsulin receptors on cell membranes (see Box Figure10-A). Onset of type 2 diabetes is usually gradual,and risk factors include a family history of diabetesand being overweight. Control may not requireinsulin, but rather medications that enable insulinto react with the remaining membrane receptors.For those with a family history of diabetes, a low-fatdiet and regular exercise reduce the risk of devel-oping the disease. The commitment to exercisemust be lifelong but is well worth the effort,because diabetes is very destructive. Without insulin (or its effects) blood glucose level remains high, and glucose is lost in urine.

QUESTION: Do epinephrine and norepinephrine have the same effect on skeletal muscle? Explain your answer. sex hormones. The sex hormones, \"female\" estrogens and \"male\" androgens (similar to testosterone), areproduced in very small amounts, and their importanceis not known with certainty. They may contribute torapid body growth during early puberty. They may also be important in supplying estrogen to womenafter menopause and to men throughout life (see the\"Estrogen\" section later in this chapter).10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM functions of the other adrenal cortical hor- mones are well known, however, and these are consid-ered vital hormones. Aldosterone Aldosterone is the most abundant of the mineralo- corticoids , and we will use it as a representative of this group of hormones. The target organs of aldosteroneare the kidneys, but there are important secondaryeffects as well. Aldosterone increases the reabsorptionof sodium and the excretion of potassium by the kid-ney tubules. Sodium ions (Na /H11001) are returned to the blood, and potassium ions (K/H11001) are excreted in urine. Look at Fig. 10-10 as you read the following. As Na/H11001ions are reabsorbed, hydrogen ions (H/H11001) may be excreted in exchange. This is one mechanismto prevent the accumulation of excess H /H11001ions, which would cause acidosis of body fluids. Also, as Na/H11001ions are reabsorbed, negative ions such as chloride (Cl/H11002) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) follow the Na/H11001ions back to the blood, and water follows by osmosis. This indirecteffect of aldosterone, the reabsorption of water by thekidneys, is very important to maintain normal bloodvolume and blood pressure. In summary, then, aldos-terone maintains normal blood levels of sodium andpotassium, and contributes to the maintenance of nor- mal blood pH, blood volume, and blood pressure. A number of factors stimulate the secretion of aldosterone. These are a deciency of sodium, loss ofblood or dehydration that lowers blood pressure, or anelevated blood level of potassium. Low blood pressureor blood volume activates the renin-angiotensin mechanism of the kidneys. This mechanism is dis- cussed in Chapters 13 and 18, so we will say for nowthat the process culminates in the formation of achemical called angiotensin II . Angiotensin II causes the adrenal Aldosterone thenincreases sodium and water retention by the kidneysto help restore blood volume and blood pressure tonormal. Cortisol We will use cortisol as a representative of the group of hormones called glucocorticoids , because it is responsible for most of the actions of this group(Fig. 10-11). Cortisol increases the use of fats andexcess amino acids (gluconeogenesis) for energy anddecreases the use of glucose. This is called the glucose-sparing effect, and it is important because it blood and pH are maintained Figure 10-10. Functions of aldosterone. Direct and indirect functions are shown. QUESTION: What ions does aldosterone have a direct effect on, and what is the effect?10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 240glucose for use by the brain. Cortisol is secreted in any type of physiological stress situation: disease, physicalinjury, hemorrhage, fear or anger, exercise, and hunger. Although most body cells easily use fatty acidsand excess amino acids in cell respiration, brain cellsdo not, so they must have glucose. By enabling othercells to use the alternative energy sources, cortisolensures that whatever glucose is present will be avail-able to the brain. Cortisol also has an anti-inflammatory effect . During inflammation, histamine from damaged tis- sues makes capillaries more permeable, and the lyso-somes of damaged cells release their enzymes, whichhelp break down damaged tissue but may also causedestruction of nearby healthy tissue. Cortisol blocksthe effects of histamine and stabilizes lysosomal mem- branes, preventing excessive tissue destruction.Inflammation is a benecial process up to a point, andis an essential rst step if tissue repair is to take place.It may, however, become a vicious cycle of damage,inflammation, more damage, more inflammation,and so on\u2014a positive feedback mechanism. Normalcortisol secretion seems to be the brake, to limitthe inflammation process to what is useful for tissuerepair, and to prevent excessive tissue destruction.T oo much cortisol, however, decreases the immuneresponse, leaving the body susceptible to infectionand signicantly slowing the healing of damagedtissue (see Box 10-4: the AdrenalCortex).The Adrenal cortex Conserves glucose of excess amino acidsIncreases use of fatsATP ATPAdipose tissue Amino acids Glucose BrainGlycogenLiverMost tissues Figure 10-11.

Which food type may be stored?10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 241The direct stimulus is ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland, which isstimulated by corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)from the hypothalamus. CRH is produced in thephysiological stress situations mentioned earlier.Although we often think of epinephrine as a hormoneimportant in stress, cortisol is also important. Thehormones of the adrenal cortex are summarized inT able 10-7.OVARIES The ovaries are located in the pelvic cavity, one on each side of the uterus. The hormones produced bythe ovaries are the steroids estrogen and progesterone,and the protein inhibin. Although their functions arean integral part of Chapters 20 and 21, we will brieflydiscuss some of them here.242 The Endocrine System Table 10-7 HORMONES OF THE ADRENAL Hormone Regulation of Secretion Aldosterone Cortisol Increases reabsorption of Na/H11001ions by the kidneys to the blood Increases excretion of K/H11001ions by the kidneys in urine Increases use of fats and excess amino acids for energy Decreases use of glucose for energy (except for the brain) Increases conversion of glucose to glycogen in the liver Anti-inflammatory effect: stabilizes lyso- somes and blocks the effects of histamineLow blood Na/H11001level Low blood volume or blood pressure High blood K/H11001level ACTH (anterior pituitary) during physiological stress BOX10-4 DISORDERS OF THE ADRENAL CORTEX The cause may be a pituitary tumor that increases ACTH secretion or a tumor of the adrenal cortexitself. Excessive cortisol promotes fat deposition in the trunk of the body, while the extremities remainthin. The skin becomes thin and fragile, and healingafter injury is slow. The bones also become fragilebecause osteoporosis is accelerated. Also character-istic of this syndrome is the rounded appearance ofthe face. Treatment is aimed at removal of the causeof the hypersecretion, whether it be a pituitary oradrenal tumor. Cushing's syndrome may also be seen in people who receive corticosteroids for medical reasons.Transplant recipients or people with rheumatoidarthritis or severe asthma who must take cortico-steroids may exhibit any of the above symptoms. Insuch cases, the disadvantages of this medicationmust be weighed against the benets provided.Addison's disease is the result of hyposecretion of the adrenol cortical hormones. Most cases are idio-pathic, that is, of unknown cause; atrophy and deple-tion of glycogen in the liver. Consequences aremuscle weakness and the inability to resist physio-logical stress. Aldosterone deciency leads to reten-tion of potassium and excretion of sodium andwater in urine. The result is severe dehydration, lowblood volume, and low blood pressure. Withouttreatment, circulatory shock and death will follow.Treatment involves administration of hydrocorti-sone; in high doses this will also compensate for thealdosterone deciency. Cushing's syndrome is the result by the cells of the ovary; secretion is by FSH from the anterior pitu- itary gland. Estrogen promotes the maturation of theovum in the ovarian follicle and stimulates the growthof blood vessels in the endometrium (lining) of theuterus in preparation for a possible fertilized egg. The secondary sex characteristics in women also develop in response to estrogen. These includegrowth of the duct system of the mammary glands,growth of the uterus, and the deposition of fat subcu-taneously in the hips and thighs. The closure of theepiphyseal discs in long bones is brought about byestrogen, and growth in height stops. Estrogen is alsobelieved to lower blood levels of cholesterol and tri-glycerides. For women before the age of menopausethis is benecial in that it decreases the risk of athero-sclerosis and coronary artery disease. Research suggests that estrogen no longer be con- sidered only a \"female\" hormone. Estrogen seems tohave effects on many organs, including the brain, theheart, and blood vessels. In the brain, testosteronefrom the testes or the adrenal cortex can be convertedto estrogen, which may be important for memory,especially for older people. Estrogen seems to havenon-reproductive functions in both men and women,although we cannot yet be as specic as we can bewith the reproductive functions in women, mentionedpreviously. PROGESTERONE When a mature ovarian follicle releases an ovum, thefollicle becomes the corpus luteum and begins to secrete progesterone in addition to estrogen. This is stimulated by LHfrom the anterior pituitary gland. Progesterone promotes the storage of glycogen and the further growth of blood vessels in the endo-metrium, which thus becomes a potential placenta.The secretory cells of the mammary glands alsodevelop under the influence of progesterone. Both progesterone and estrogen are secreted by the placenta during pregnancy; these functions are cov-ered in Chapter 21. INHIBIN The corpus luteum secretes another hormone, calledinhibin. Inhibin helps decrease the secretion of FSHby and GnRH by hypothalamus. TESTES The testes are located in the scrotum, a sac of skin between the upper thighs. T wo hormones, testos-terone and inhibin, are secreted by the testes. TESTOSTERONE Testosterone is a steroid hormone secreted by the interstitial cells of the testes; the stimulus for secretionis LH from the anterior pituitary gland. T estosterone promotes maturation of sperm in the seminiferous tubules of the testes; this process beginsat puberty and continues throughout life. At puberty,testosterone stimulates development of the male sec- ondary sex characteristics . These include growth of all the reproductive organs, growth of facial and bodyhair, growth of the larynx and deepening of the voice,and growth (protein synthesis) of the skeletal muscles.T estosterone also brings about closure of the epiphy-ses of the long bones. INHIBIN The hormone inhibin is secreted by the sustentacular cells of the testes; the stimulus for secretion isincreased testosterone. The function of inhibin is todecrease the secretion of FSH by the The of inhibin, testosterone, andthe anterior pituitary hormones maintains spermato-genesis at a constant rate. OTHER HORMONES Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland , which is located at the back of the third ventri- cle of the brain. The secretion of melatonin is greatestduring darkness and decreases when light enters theeye and the retina signals the hypothalamus. A recentdiscovery is that the retina also produces melatonin,which seems to indicate that the eyes and pineal glandwork with the biological clock of the hypothalamus. Inother mammals, melatonin helps regulate seasonalreproductive cycles. For people, melatonin denitelystimulates the onset of sleep and increases its duration.10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 243244 The Endocrine System Other claims, such as that melatonin strengthens the immune system or prevents cellular damage andaging, are without evidence as yet. There are other organs that produce hormones that have only one or a few target organs. For example, thestomach and duodenum produce hormones that regu-late aspects of digestion appetite. Adipose tissueproduces the appetite-suppressing hormone leptin.The thymus gland produces hormones necessary forthe normal functioning of the immune system, and thekidneys produce a hormone that stimulates red bloodcell production. All of these will be discussed in laterchapters. PROSTAGLANDINS Prostaglandins (PGs ) are made by virtually all cells from the phospholipids of their cell membranes. Theydiffer from other hormones in that they do not circu-late in the blood to target organs, but rather exerttheir effects locally, where they are produced. There are many types of prostaglandins, designated by the letters A through I, as in PGA, PGB, and so on.Prostaglandins have many functions, and we will listonly a few of them here. Prostaglandins are known tobe involved in inflammation, pain mechanisms, bloodclotting, vasoconstriction and vasodilation, contrac-tion of the uterus, reproduction, secretion of digestiveglands, and nutrient metabolism. Current researchis directed at determining the normal functioning ofprostaglandins in the hope that many of them mayeventually be used clinically. One familiar example may illustrate the widespread activity of prostaglandins. For minor pain such as aheadache, many people take aspirin. Aspirin inhibitsthe synthesis of prostaglandins involved in pain mech-anisms and usually relieves the pain. Some people,however, such as those with rheumatoid arthritis, maytake large amounts of aspirin to diminish pain andinflammation. These people may bruise easily becauseblood clotting has been impaired. This too is an effectof aspirin, which blocks the synthesis of prostaglan-dins necessary for blood clotting. MECHANISMS OF HORMONE ACTION Exactly how hormones exert their effects on their tar-get organs involves a number of complex processes,which will be presented simply here.A hormone must rst bond to a receptor for it on or in the target cell. Cells respond to certain hor-mones and not to others because of the presence ofspecic receptors, which are proteins. These receptorproteins may be part of the cell membrane or withinthe cytoplasm or nucleus of the target cells. A hor-mone will affect only those cells that have its specicreceptors. Liver cells, for example, have cell mem-brane receptors for insulin, glucagon, growth hor-mone, and epinephrine; bone cells have receptors forgrowth hormone, PTH, and calcitonin. Cells of theovaries and testes do not have receptors for PTH andcalcitonin, but do have receptors for FSH and LH,which bone cells and liver cells do not have. Once ahormone has bonded to a receptor on or in its targetcell, other reactions will take place. THE TWO-MESSENGER MECHANISM\u2014 PROTEIN HORMONES The two-messenger mechanism of hormone action involves \"messengers\" that make something happen,that is, stimulate specic reactions. Protein hor- mones usually bond to receptors of the cell mem- brane, and the hormone is called the rst messenger.The hormone-receptor bonding activates the enzymeadenyl cyclase on ) is the second mes- senger. Cyclic AMP activates specic enzymes within the cell, which bring about the cell's characteristicresponse to the hormone. These responses include achange in the permeability of the cell membrane to aspecic substance, an increase in protein synthesis,activation of other enzymes, or the secretion of a cel-lular product. In summary, a cell's response to a hormone is deter- mined by the enzymes within the cell, that is, the reac-tions of which the cell is capable. These reactions arebrought about by the rst messenger, the hormone,which stimulates the formation of the second messen-ger, cyclic AMP . Cyclic AMP then activates the cell'senzymes to elicit a response to the hormone (Fig.10-12). ACTION OF STEROID HORMONES Steroid hormones are soluble in the lipids of the cell membrane and diffuse easily into a target cell. Once10Scanlon(p3)-ch10 8/17/06 10:50 AM Page 244The Endocrine System 245 inside the cell, the steroid hormone combines with a protein receptor in the cytoplasm, and this steroid-protein complex enters the nucleus of the cell. Withinthe nucleus, the steroid-protein complex activates spe-cic genes, which begin the process of protein syn- thesis . The enzymes produced bring about the cell's characteristic response to the hormone (see Fig.10-12). AGING AND THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Most of the endocrine glands decrease their secretionswith age, but normal aging usually does not lead toserious hormone deciencies. There are decreases inadrenol cortical hormones, for example, but the levelsare usually sufficient to maintain homeostasis of water,electrolytes, and nutrients. The decreased secretion ofgrowth hormone leads to a decrease in muscle massand an increase in fat storage. A lower basal metabolic rate is common in elderly people as the thyroid slowsits secretion of thyroxine. Unless specic pathologiesdevelop, however, the endocrine system usually con-tinues to function adequately in old age. SUMMARY The hormones of endocrine glands are involved in vir-tually all aspects of normal body functioning. Thegrowth and repair of tissues, the utilization of food toproduce energy, responses to stress, the maintenanceof the proper levels and pH of body fluids, and thecontinuance of the human species all depend on hor-mones. Some of these topics will be discussed in laterchapters. As you might expect, you will be readingabout the functions of many of these hormones againand reviewing their important contributions to themaintenance of homeostasis. A BFigure 10-12.

Steroid hormones diffuse easily through cell membranes and bond to cytoplasmic receptors.Steroid-protein complex enters the nucleus andactivates certain genes, which initiate proteinsynthesis.

As youknow, however, the blood of one individual is notalways compatible with that of another person. TheABO blood types were discovered in the early 1900sby Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian-American. Healso contributed to the discovery of the Rh factor in1940. In the early 1940s, Charles Drew, an African-American, developed techniques for processing andstoring blood plasma, which could then be used intransfusions for people with any blood type. When wedonate blood today, our blood may be given to a recip-ient as whole blood, or it may be separated into itscomponent parts, and recipients will then receive onlythose parts they need, such as red cells, plasma, factor8, or platelets. Each of these parts has a specic func-tion, and all of the functions of blood are essential toour survival. The general functions of blood are transportation, regulation, and protection. Materials transported bythe blood include nutrients, waste products, gases, andhormones. The blood helps regulate fluid-electrolytebalance, acid-base balance, and the body temperature.Protection against pathogens is provided by whiteblood cells, and the blood clotting mechanism preventsexcessive loss of blood after injuries. Each of thesefunctions is covered in more detail in this chapter. CHARACTERISTICS OF BLOOD Blood has distinctive physical characteristics: Amount \u2014a person has 4 to 6 liters of blood, depend- ing on his or her size. Of the total blood volume inthe human body, 38% to 48% is composed of thevarious blood cells, also called formed elements . The remaining 52% to 62% of the blood volume isplasma, the liquid portion of blood (Fig. 11-1). Color \u2014you're probably saying to yourself, \"Of course, it's red!\" Mention is made of this obviousfact, however, because the color does vary. Arterialblood is bright red because it contains high levels ofoxygen. Venous blood has given up much of its oxy-gen in tissues, and has a darker, dull red color. Thismay be important in the assessment of the source ofbleeding. If blood is bright red, it is probably froma severed artery, and dark red blood is probablyvenous blood.pH\u2014the normal pH range of blood is 7.35 to 7.45, which is slightly alkaline. Venous blood normallyhas a lower pH than does arterial blood because ofthe presence of more carbon dioxide. Viscosity \u2014this means thickness or resistance to flow. Blood is about three to ve times thicker thanwater. Viscosity is increased by the presence ofblood cells and the plasma proteins, and this thick-ness contributes to normal blood pressure. PLASMA Plasma is the liquid part of blood and is approxi- mately 91% water. The solvent ability of waterenables the plasma to transport many types of sub-stances. Nutrients absorbed in the digestive tract, suchas glucose, amino acids, and minerals, are circulated toall body tissues. Waste products of the tissues, such asurea and creatinine, circulate through the kidneys andare excreted in urine. Hormones produced byendocrine glands are carried in the plasma to their tar-get organs, and antibodies are also transported inplasma. Most of the carbon dioxide produced by cellsis carried in the plasma in the form of bicarbonate ions(HCO 3-). When the blood reaches the lungs, the CO2 is re-formed, diffuses into the alveoli, and is exhaled. Also in the plasma are the plasma proteins . The clotting factors prothrombin , brinogen , and others are synthesized by the liver and circulate until acti-vated to form a clot in a ruptured or damaged bloodvessel. Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein. It too is synthesized by the liver. Albumin contributesto the colloid osmotic pressure of blood, which pullstissue fluid into capillaries. This is important to main-tain normal blood volume and blood pressure. Otherplasma proteins are called globulins . Alpha and beta globulins are synthesized by the liver and act as carri-ers for molecules such as fats. The gamma globulinsare antibodies produced by lymphocytes. Antibodiesinitiate the destruction of pathogens and provide uswith immunity. Plasma also carries body heat. Heat is one of the by-products of cell respiration (the production of ATPin cells). Blood is warmed by flowing through activeorgans such as the liver and muscles. This heat is dis-tributed to cooler parts of the body as blood continuesto circulate.252 Blood11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 252253 Other body tissues and fluids 92% Blood 8% Total body weight Blood plasma 52-62% Blood cells 38-48% Blood volume Erythrocytes 4.5-6.0 million Water 91.5% Blood cells (per microliter) Other substances Other substances7% 1.5%Thrombocytes 150,000 - 300,000 Nutrients Components of blood and the relationship of blood to other body tissues. QUESTION: Blood plasma is mostly what substance? Which blood cells are the most numerous?11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 253BLOOD CELLS There are three kinds of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Blood cells are pro-duced from stem cells in hemopoietic tissue . After birth this is primarily the red bone marrow , found in flat and irregular bones such as the sternum,hip bone, and vertebrae. Lymphocytes mature anddivide in lymphatic tissue , found in the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus gland. The thymus containsstem cells that produce T lymphocytes, and the stemcells in other lymphatic tissue also produce lympho-cytes. RED BLOOD CELLS Also called erythrocytes , red blood cells (RBCs) are biconcave discs, which means their centers arethinner than their edges. You may recall from Chapter3 that red blood cells are the only human cells with-out nuclei. Their nuclei disintegrate as the red bloodcells mature and are not needed for normal func-tioning. A normal RBC count ranges from 4.5 to 6.0 million cells per microliter ( /H9262L) of blood (1 microliter /H110051 mm 3/H11005one millionth of a liter, a very small volume). RBC counts for men are often toward the high end ofthis range; those for women are often toward the lowend. Another way to measure the amount of RBCs isthe hematocrit . This test involves drawing blood into a thin glass tube called a capillary tube, and centrifug-ing the tube to force all the cells to one end. The per-centages of cells and plasma can then be determined.Because RBCs are by far the most abundant of theblood cells, a normal hematocrit range is just like thatof the total blood cells: 38% to 48%. Both RBC hematocrit (Hct) are part of a complete bloodcount (CBC). Function Red blood cells contain the protein hemoglobin (Hb), which gives them the ability to carry oxygen.Each red blood cell contains approximately 300 mil-lion hemoglobin molecules, each of which can bond tofour oxygen molecules (see Box Fig. 3-B). In the pul-monary capillaries, RBCs pick up oxygen and oxyhe-moglobin is formed. In the systemic capillaries,hemoglobin gives up much of its oxygen and becomesreduced hemoglobin. A determination of hemoglobin level is also part of a CBC; the normal range is 12 to18 grams per 100 mL of blood. Essential to the for-mation of hemoglobin is the mineral iron; there arefour atoms of iron in each molecule of hemoglobin. Itis the iron that actually bonds to the oxygen and alsomakes RBCs red. Hemoglobin is also able to bond to carbon dioxide (CO 2), and does transport some CO2from the tissues to the lungs. But hemoglobin accounts for only about10% of total CO 2transport (most is carried in the plasma as bicarbonate ions). Production and Maturation Red blood cells are formed in red bone marrow (RBM)in flat and irregular bones. Within red bone marroware precursor cells called stem cells . Recall from Chapter 3 that stem cells are unspecialized cells thatmay develop, or differentiate, in several ways. Thestem cells of the red bone marrow may also be calledhemocytoblasts (hemo /H11005\"blood,\" cyto /H11005\"cell,\" blast /H11005\"producing\"), and they constantly undergo mitosis to produce all the kinds of blood cells, many of whichare RBCs (Figs. 11-2 and 11-3). The rate of produc-tion is very rapid (estimated at several million newRBCs per second), and a major regulating factor isoxygen. If the body is in a state of hypoxia , or lack of oxygen, the kidneys produce a hormone called ery- thropoietin , which stimulates the red bone marrow to increase the rate of RBC production (that is, the rateof stem cell mitosis). This will occur following hemor-rhage or if a person stays for a time at a higher altitude.As a result of the action of erythropoietin, more RBCswill be available to carry oxygen and correct thehypoxic state. The stem cells that will become RBCs go through a number of developmental stages, only the last two ofwhich we will mention (see Fig. 11-2). The nor- moblast is the last stage with a nucleus, which then disintegrates. The reticulocyte has fragments of the endoplasmic reticulum, which are visible when bloodsmears are stained for microscopic evaluation. Theseimmature cells are usually found in the red bone mar-row, although a small number of reticulocytes in theperipheral circulation is considered normal (up to1.5% of the total RBCs). Large numbers of reticulo-cytes or normoblasts in the circulating blood meanthat the number mature RBCs is Band cell Figure 11-2. Production of blood cells. Stem cells are found primarily in red bone mar- row and are the precursor cells for all the types of blood cells.QUESTION: Where are normoblasts and reticulocytes usually found, and why?11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 255carry the oxygen needed by the body. Such situations include hemorrhage, or when mature RBCs havebeen destroyed, as in Rh disease of the newborn, andmalaria. The maturation of red blood cells requires many nutrients. Protein and iron are necessary for the syn-thesis of hemoglobin and become part of hemoglobinmolecules. Copper is part of some enzymes involvedin hemoglobin synthesis. The vitamins folic acid andB 12are required for DNA synthesis in the stem cells of the red bone marrow. As these cells undergo mitosis,they must continually produce new sets of chromo-somes. Vitamin B 12is also called the extrinsic factor because its source is external, our food. Parietal cellsof the stomach lining produce the intrinsic factor , a chemical that combines with the vitamin B 12in food to prevent its digestion and promote its absorption in thesmall intestine. A deciency of either vitamin B 12orthe intrinsic factor results in pernicious anemia (see Box 11-1: Anemia). Life Span Red blood cells live for approximately 120 days.As they reach this age they become fragile and areremoved from circulation by cells of the tissue macrophage system (formerly called the reticuloen- dothelial or RE system). The organs that containmacrophages (literally, \"big eaters\") are the liver,spleen, and red bone marrow. Look at Fig. 11-4 as youread the following. The old RBCs are phagocytizedand digested by macrophages, and the iron they con-tained is put into the blood to be returned to the redbone marrow to be used for the synthesis of newhemoglobin. If not needed immediately for this pur-pose, excess iron is stored in the liver. The iron of256 Blood Figure 11-3. Blood cells. (A) Red blood cells, platelets, and a basophil.

This is a very serious disorder thatmay be caused by exposure to radiation, certainchemicals such as benzene, or some medications.There are several antibiotics that must be used withcaution since they may have this potentially fatalside effect. Hemolytic anemia is any disorder that causes rupture of RBCs before the end of their normal lifespan. Sickle-cell anemia and Rh disease of the new-born are examples. Another example is malaria, inwhich a protozoan parasite reproduces in RBCs anddestroys them. Hemolytic anemias are often char-acterized by jaundice because of the increased pro-duction of bilirubin.Anemia is a deciency of red blood cells, or insuf- cient hemoglobin within the red blood cells. Thereare many different types of anemia. Iron-deciency anemia is caused by a lack of dietary iron, and there is not enough of this mineralto form sufficient hemoglobin. A person with thistype of anemia may have a normal RBC count anda normal hematocrit, but the hemoglobin level willbe below normal. A deciency of vitamin B 12, which is found only in animal foods, leads to pernicious anemia , in which the RBCs are large, misshapen, and fragile.Another cause of this form of anemia is lack of theintrinsic factor due to autoimmune destruction ofthe parietal cells of the stomach lining. Sickle-cell anemia has already been discussed in Chapter 3. It is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin,which causes RBCs to sickle, clog capillaries, andrupture. A B D C Box Figure 11-A Anemia.

The globin or protein portion of the hemoglobin moleculeis also recycled. It is digested to its amino acids, whichmay then be used for the synthesis of new proteins. Another part of the hemoglobin molecule is the heme portion, which cannot be recycled and is a wasteproduct. The heme is converted to bilirubin bymacrophages. The liver circu- Bile is secreted by the liver into the duodenumand passes through the small intestine and colon, sobilirubin is eliminated in feces, and gives feces theircharacteristic brown color. In the colon some bilirubinis changed to urobilinogen by the colon bacteria.258 Blood New RBCs formed in red bone marrow Used to make new RBCsIron Heme Globin Stored in liver BilirubinSmall Colon bacteria UrobilinUrobilin UrineAmino acidsProtein synthesisMacrophages in liver, spleen, and red bone marrow phagocytize old RBCs KidneyRBCsCirculate 120 days Figure 11-4.

(Go to the macrophage follow the arrows.)11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 258Some urobilinogen may be absorbed into the blood, but it is changed to urobilin and excreted by the kid-neys in urine. If bilirubin is not excreted properly, per-haps because of liver disease such as hepatitis, itremains in the blood. This may cause jaundice , a con- dition in which the whites of the eyes appear yellow.This yellow color may also be seen in the skin of light-skinned people (see Box 11-2: Jaundice). Blood Types Our blood types are genetic; that is, we inherit genesfrom our parents that determine our own types. Thereare many red blood cell factors or types; we will dis-cuss the two most important ones: the ABO group and the Rh factor . (The genetics of blood types is dis- cussed in Chapter 21.)The ABO group contains four blood types: A, B, AB, and O. The letters A and B represent antigens(protein-oligosaccharides) on the red blood cell mem-brane. A person with type A blood has the A antigenon the RBCs, and someone with type B blood has theB antigen. T ype AB means that both A and B antigensare present, and type O means that neither the A northe B antigen is present. Circulating in the plasma of each person are natu- ral antibodies for those antigens notpresent on the RBCs. Therefore, a type A person has anti-B antibod-ies in the plasma; a type B person has anti-A antibod-ies; a type AB person has neither anti-A nor anti-Bantibodies; and a type O person has both anti-A andanti-B antibodies (see T able 11-1 and Fig. 11-5). These natural antibodies are of great importance for transfusions. If possible, a person should receiveBlood 259 BOX11-2 JAUNDICE born; these are hemolytic anemias. As excessive numbers of RBCs are destroyed, bilirubin is formedat a faster rate than the liver can excrete it. Thebilirubin that the liver cannot excrete remains in theblood and causes jaundice. is hemolytic . Posthepatic jaundice means that the liver. The liver excretes bilirubin intobile, which is stored in the gallbladder and thenmoved to the small intestine. If the bile ducts areobstructed, perhaps by gallstones or inflammationof the gallbladder, bile cannot pass to the smallintestine and backs up in the liver. Bilirubin maythen be reabsorbed back into the blood and causejaundice. Another name for this type is obstruc- tive jaundice .Jaundice is not a disease, but rather a sign caused by excessive accumulation of bilirubin in the blood.Because one of the liver's many functions is theexcretion of bilirubin, jaundice may be a sign ofliver disease such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. This maybe called hepatic jaundice , because the problem is with the liver. Other types of jaundice are prehepatic jaundice and posthepatic jaundice: The name of each tells uswhere the problem is. Recall that bilirubin is thewaste product formed from the heme portion ofthe hemoglobin of old RBCs. Prehepatic jaun- dice means that the problem is \"before\" the liver; that is, hemolysis of RBCs is taking place at a morerapid rate. Rapid hemolysis is characteristic of sickle-cell anemia, malaria, and Rh disease of the new- Table 11-1 ABO BLOOD TYPES Antigens Present Antibodies Present Percentage in U.S. Population* Type on RBCs in Plasma White Black Asian A A anti-B 40 27 31 B B anti-A 11 20 26AB both A and B neither anti-A nor anti-B 4 4 8O neither A nor B both anti-A and anti-B 45 49 35 *Average.11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 259260 Plasma Anti-A serum Anti-B serumTyping and cross-matching ABO blood types Type A Type B Type B Type AB Type AB Type O Type OA antigens B antibodies B antigens A antibodies A and B antigens Neither A nor B antibodies Neither A nor B antigensA and B antibodies Type O Type A Type AType OType B Type BUniversal donor Type ABUniversal recipientAB C Figure 11-5.

To whom (that is, to which blood types) can you donate blood?11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 260blood of his or her own type; only if this type is not available should another type be given. For example,let us say that a type A person needs a transfusion toreplace blood lost in hemorrhage. If this person wereto receive type B blood, what would happen? The typeA recipient has anti-B antibodies that would bind tothe type B antigens of the RBCs of the donated blood.The type B RBCs would ( agglutination ) then rupture ( hemolysis ), thus defeating the purpose of the transfusion. An even more serious consequenceis that the hemoglobin of the ruptured RBCs, nowcalled free hemoglobin, may clog the capillaries of thekidneys and lead to renal damage or renal failure. Youcan see why typing and cross-matching of donor and recipient blood in the hospital laboratory is so impor-tant before any transfusion is given (see Fig. 11-5).This procedure helps ensure that donated blood willnot bring about a hemolytic transfusion reaction inthe recipient. You may have heard of the concept that a person with type O blood is a \"universal donor.\" Usually, aunit of type O negative blood may be given to peoplewith any other blood type. This is so because type ORBCs have neither the A nor the B antigens and willnot react with whatever antibodies the recipient mayhave. If only one unit (1 pint) of blood is given, theanti-A and anti-B antibodies in the type O bloodplasma will be diluted in the recipient's blood plasmaand will not have a harmful effect on the recipient'sRBCs. The term negative , in O negative, the universal donor, refers to the Rh factor, which we will nowconsider. The Rh factor is another antigen (often called D) that may be present on RBCs. People whose RBCshave the Rh antigen are Rh withoutthe antigen are Rh negative. Rh-negative people donot have natural antibodies to the Rh antigen, andfor them this antigen is foreign. If an Rh-negativeperson receives Rh-positive blood by mistake,antibodies will be formed just as they would beto bacteria or viruses. A rst mistaken transfusionoften does not cause problems, because antibody pro-duction is slow upon the rst exposure to Rh-positiveRBCs. A second transfusion, however, when anti-Rhantibodies are already present, will bring about atransfusion reaction, with hemolysis and possible kid-ney damage (see also Box 11-3: Rh Disease of theNewborn). WHITE BLOOD CELLS White blood cells (WBCs) are also called leukocytes . There are ve kinds of WBCs; all are larger thanRBCs and have nuclei when mature. The nucleus maybe in one piece or appear as several lobes or segments.Special staining for microscopic examination giveseach kind of WBC a distinctive appearance (see Figs.11-2 and 11-3).Blood 261 BOX11-3 Rh DISEASE OF THE NEWBORN baby will be born anemic and jaundiced from the loss of RBCs. Such an infant may require a gradualexchange transfusion to remove the blood with thematernal antibodies and replace it with Rh-negativeblood. The baby will continue to produce its ownRh-positive RBCs, which will not be destroyed oncethe maternal antibodies have been removed. Much better than treatment, however, is pre- vention. If an Rh-negative woman delivers an Rh-positive baby, she should be given RhoGAM within 72 hours after delivery. RhoGAM is an anti-Rh anti-body that will destroy any fetal RBCs that haveentered the mother's circulation before her immune system can respond and produce antibodies. TheRhoGAM antibodies themselves break down withina few months. The woman's next pregnancy will belike the rst, as if she had never been exposed toRh-positive RBCs.Rh disease of the newborn may also be called erythroblastosis fetalis and is the result of an Rh incompatibility between mother and fetus. Duringa normal pregnancy, maternal blood and fetalblood do not mix in the placenta. However, duringdelivery of the placenta (the \"afterbirth\" that fol-lows the birth of the baby), some fetal blood mayenter maternal circulation. If the woman is Rh negative and her baby is Rh positive, this exposes the woman to Rh-positiveRBCs. In response, her immune system will nowproduce anti-Rh antibodies following this rst deliv-ery. In a subsequent pregnancy, these maternalantibodies will cross the placenta and enter fetal cir-culation. If this next fetus is also Rh positive, thematernal antibodies will cause destruction (hemoly-sis) of the fetal RBCs. In severe cases this may resultin the death of the fetus. In less severe cases, the11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 261A normal WBC count (part of a CBC) is 5,000 to 10,000 per /H9262L. Notice that this number is quite small compared to a normal RBC count. Many of ourWBCs are not circulating within blood vessels but arecarrying out their functions in tissue fluid or in lym-phatic tissue. Classication The ve kinds of white blood cells, all produced in thered bone marrow (and some lymphocytes in lymphatictissue), may be classied in two groups: and basophils which usually nuclei in two or more lobes or segments, andhave distinctly colored granules when stained.Neutrophils have light blue granules, eosinophils havered granules, and basophils are lymphocytes and monocytes , which have nuclei in one piece. Monocytes are usually quite a bit larger than lympho-cytes. A differential WBC count (part of a CBC) is the percentage of each kind of leukocyte. Normalranges are listed in T able 11-2, along with other nor-mal values of a CBC. Functions White blood cells all contribute to the same generalfunction, which is to protect the body from infectiousdisease and to provide immunity to certain diseases. Each kind of leukocyte makes a contribution to thisvery important aspect of homeostasis. Neutrophils and monocytes are capable of the phagocytosis of pathogens. Neutrophils are the more abundant phagocytes, but the monocytes are the moreefficient phagocytes, because they differentiate intomacrophages , which also phagocytize dead or dam- aged tissue at the site of any injury, helping to maketissue repair possible. During an infection, neutrophilsare produced more rapidly, and the immature forms,called band cells (see Fig. 11-2), may appear in greater numbers in peripheral circulation (band cellsare usually less than 10% of the total neutrophils).The term \"band\" refers to the nucleus that has not yetbecome segmented, and may look somewhat like adumbbell. Eosinophils are believed to detoxify foreign proteins and will phagocytize anything labeled withantibodies. This is especially important in allergicreactions and parasitic infections such as trichinosis (aworm parasite). granules of heparinand histamine. Heparin is an anticoagulant that helps prevent abnormal clotting within blood vessels.Histamine , you may recall, is released as part of the inflammation process, and it makes capillaries morepermeable, allowing tissue fluid, proteins, and whiteblood cells to accumulate in the damaged area. There are two major kinds of lymphocytes, T cells and B cells, and a less numerous third kind called nat-ural killer cells. For now we will say that T cells (or T lymphocytes) help recognize foreign antigens and maydirectly destroy some foreign antigens. B cells (or B lymphocytes) become plasma cells that produce anti-bodies to foreign antigens. Both T cells and B cellsprovide memory for immunity. Natural killer cells (NK cells) destroy foreign cells by chemically ruptur-ing their membranes. These functions of lymphocytesare discussed in the context of the mechanisms ofimmunity in Chapter 14. As mentioned earlier, leukocytes function in tissue fluid as well as in the blood. Many WBCs are capableof self-locomotion (ameboid movement) and are ableto squeeze between the cells of capillary walls and outinto tissue spaces. Macrophages provide a good exam-ple of the dual locations of leukocytes. Somemacrophages are \"xed,\" that is, stationary in organssuch as the liver, spleen, and red bone marrow (part ofthe tissue macrophage or RE system\u2014the same262 Blood Table 11-2 COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT Measurement Normal Range* Red blood cells HemoglobinHematocrit Reticulocytes White blood cells (total) NeutrophilsEosinophils Basophils LymphocytesMonocytes Platelets *The values on hospital lab slips may vary somewhat but will be very similar to the normal ranges given here. in the lymph nodes. They phagocytize pathogens that circu-late in blood or lymph through these organs. Other\"wandering\" macrophages move about in tissue fluid,especially in the areolar connective tissue of mucousmembranes and below the skin. Pathogens that gainentry into the body through natural openings orthrough breaks in the skin are usually destroyed by themacrophages and other leukocytes in connective tissuebefore they can cause serious disease. The alveoliof the lungs, for example, have macrophages thatvery efficiently destroy pathogens that enter withinhaled air. A high WBC count, called leukocytosis , is often an indication of infection. Leukopenia is a low WBC count, which may be present in the early stages of dis-eases such as tuberculosis. Exposure to radiation or tochemicals such as benzene may destroy WBCs andlower the total count. Such a person is then very sus-ceptible to infection. Leukemia , or malignancy of leukocyte-forming tissues, is discussed in Box 11-4:Leukemia. The white blood cell types (analogous to RBC types such as the ABO group) are called human leukocyteantigens (HLA) and are discussed in Box 11-5: White Blood Cell T ypes: HLA. PLATELETS The more formal name for platelets is thrombocytes , which are not whole cells but rather fragments orpieces of cells. Some of the stem cells in the red bonemarrow differentiate into large cells called megakary- ocytes (see Figs. 11-2 and 11-3), which break up into small pieces that enter circulation. These small, oval,circulating pieces are platelets, which may last for 5 to9 days, if not utilized before that. Thrombopoietin is a hormone produced by the liver that increases therate of platelet production. A normal platelet count (part of a CBC) is 150,000 to 300,000/ /H9262L (the high end of the range may be extended to 500,000). Thrombocytopenia is the term for a low platelet count. Function Platelets are necessary for hemostasis , which means prevention of blood loss. There are three mechanisms,Blood 263 BOX11-4 LEUKEMIA Chemotherapy may bring about cure or remis- sion for some forms of leukemia, but other formsremain resistant to treatment and may be fatalwithin a few months of diagnosis. In such cases, thecause of death is often pneumonia or some otherserious infection, because the abnormal whiteblood cells cannot prevent the growth and spread of pathogens within the body.Leukemia is the term for malignancy of the blood- forming tissue. There are many types of leukemia,which are classied as acute or chronic, by thetypes of abnormal cells produced, and by eitherchildhood or adult onset. In general, leukemia is characterized by an over- production of immature white blood cells. These immature cells cannot perform their normal func-tions, and the person becomes very susceptible to infection. As a greater proportion of the body'snutrients are used by malignant cells, the produc-tion of other blood cells decreases. Severe anemia isa consequence of decreased red blood cell produc-tion, and the tendency to hemorrhage is the resultof decreased platelets. Box Figure 11-B Leukemia.

T wo of these mech- anisms are shown in Fig. 11-6. 1.Vascular spasm \u2014when a large vessel such as an artery or vein is severed, the smooth muscle in itswall contracts in response to the damage (called themyogenic response). Platelets in the area of therupture release serotonin, which also brings aboutvasoconstriction. The diameter of the vessel isthereby made smaller, and the smaller opening maythen be blocked by a blood clot. If the vessel didnot constrict rst, the clot that forms would quicklybe washed out by the force of the blood pressure. 2.Platelet plugs \u2014when capillaries rupture, the damage is too slight to initiate the formation of ablood clot. The rough surface, however, causes platelets to change shape (become spiky) andbecome sticky. These activated platelets stick to theedges of the break and to each other. The plateletsform a mechanical barrier or wall to close off thebreak in the capillary. Capillary ruptures are quitefrequent, and platelet plugs, although small, are allthat is needed to seal them. Would platelet plugs be effective for breaks in larger vessels? No, they are too small, and thoughthey do form, they are washed away (until a clotbegins to form that can contain them). Would vas-cular spasm be effective for capillaries? Again, theanswer is no, because capillaries have no smoothmuscle and cannot constrict at all.264 Blood BOX11-5 WHITE BLOOD CELL TYPES: HLA the HLA types of a donated organ to see if one or several will match the HLA types of the potentialrecipient. If even one HLA type matches, the chanceof rejection is lessened. Although all transplantrecipients (except corneal) must receive immuno-suppressive medications to prevent rejection, suchmedications make them more susceptible to infec-tion. The closer the HLA match of the donatedorgan, the lower the dosage of such medications,and the less chance of serious infections. (Thechance of nding a perfect HLA match in the gen-eral population is estimated at 1 in 20,000.) There is yet another aspect of the importance of HLA: People with certain HLA types seem to bemore likely to develop certain non-infectious dis-eases. For example, type 1 (insulin-dependent) dia-betes mellitus is often found in people with HLADR3 or DR4, and a form of arthritis of the spinecalled ankylosing spondylitis is often found in thosewith HLA B27. These are notgenes for these dis- eases, but may be predisposing factors. What mayhappen is this: A virus enters the body and stimu-lates the immune system to produce antibodies.The virus is destroyed, but one of the person's ownantigens is so similar to the viral antigen that theimmune system continues its activity and begins todestroy this similar part of the body. Another possi-bility is that a virus damages a self-antigen to theextent that it is now so different that it will be per-ceived as foreign. These are two theories of howautoimmune diseases are triggered, which is thefocus of much research in the eld of immunology.Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are antigens on WBCs that are representative of the antigenspresent on all the cells of an individual. These areour \"self\" antigens that identify cells that belong inthe body. Recall that in the ABO blood group of RBCs, there are only two antigens, A and B, and fourpossible types: A, B, AB, and O. HLA antigens arealso given letter names. HLA A, B, and C are calledclass I proteins, with from 100 to more than 400possibilities for the specic protein each can be. Theseveral class II proteins are given various D designa-tions and, again, there are many possibilities foreach. Each person has two genes for each HLA type,because these types are inherited, just as RBC typesare inherited. Members of the same family mayhave some of the same HLA types, and identicaltwins have exactly the same HLA types. The purpose of the HLA types is to provide a \"self\" comparison for the immune system to usewhen pathogens enter the body. The T lympho-cytes compare the \"self\" antigens on macrophagesto the antigens on bacteria and viruses. Becausethese antigens do not match ours, they are recog-nized as foreign; this is the rst step in the destruc-tion of a pathogen. The surgical transplantation of organs has also focused on the HLA. The most serious problem forthe recipient of a transplanted heart or kidney isrejection of the organ and its destruction by theimmune system. You may be familiar with the termtissue typing . This process involves determining 11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 2643.Chemical clotting \u2014The stimulus for clotting is a rough surface within a vessel, or a break in the ves-sel, which also creates a rough surface. The moredamage there is, the faster clotting begins, usuallywithin 15 to 120 seconds. The clotting mechanism is a series of reactions involving chemicals that normally circulate in theblood and others that are released when a vessel isdamaged. The chemicals involved in clotting include platelet factors, chemicals released by damaged tissues, cal- cium ions, and the plasma proteins prothrombin, -brinogen, Factor 8, and others synthesized by the liver.(These clotting factors are also designated by Romannumerals; Factor 8 would be Factor VIII.) Vitamin Kis necessary for the liver to synthesize prothrombinand several other clotting factors (Factors 7, 9, and 10). Most of our vitamin K is produced by the bacteria thatlive in the colon; the vitamin is absorbed as the colonabsorbs water and may be stored in the liver. Chemical clotting is usually described in three stages, which are listed in T able 11-3 and illustrated inFig. 11-7. Stage 1 begins when a vessel is cut or dam-aged internally, and includes all of the factors shown.As you follow the pathway, notice that the product ofstage 1 is prothrombin activator, which may also becalled prothrombinase. Each name tells us something.The rst name suggests that this chemical activatesprothrombin, and that is true. The second name endsin \"ase,\" which indicates that this is an enzyme. Thetraditional names for enzymes use the substrate of theenzyme as the rst part of the name, and add \"ase.\" Sothis chemical must be an enzyme whose substrate isBlood 265 Skin is cut and blood escapes from acapillary and anarteriole. Capillary Arteriole Platelets Fibrin In the capillary, platelets stick to the ruptured wall and form a platelet plug.In the arteriole, chemical clotting forms a fibrin clot.Clot the edges of the break Hemostasis.

QUESTION: Look at the diameter of the arteriole (compared to that ofthe capillary) and explain whyplatelet plugs would not be suffi- to stop the bleeding.11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 265prothrombin, and that is also true. The stages of clot- ting may be called a cascade, where one leads to thenext, as inevitable as water flowing downhill. Pro-thrombin activator, the product of stage 1, bringsabout the stage 2 reaction: converting prothrombin tothrombin. The product of stage 2, thrombin, bringsabout the 3 reaction: converting brinogen tobrin (see Box 11-6: Hemophilia). The clot itself is made of brin , the product of stage 3. Fibrin is a thread-like protein. Many strandsof brin form a mesh that traps RBCs and platelets,and creates a wall across the break in the vessel.Once the clot has formed and bleeding has stopped, clot retraction and brinolysis occur. Clot retraction requires platelets, ATP , and Factor 13 and involvesfolding of the brin threads to pull the edges of therupture in the vessel wall closer together. This willmake the area to be repaired smaller. The plateletscontribute in yet another way, because as they disinte-grate they release platelet-derived growth factor(PDGF), which stimulates the repair of blood vessels(growth of their tissues). As repair begins, the clot isdissolved, a process called brinolysis. It is importantthat the clot be dissolved, because it is a rough surface,266 Blood Table 11-3 CHEMICAL CLOTTING Clotting Stage Factors Needed Reaction Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Platelet factors Chemicals from damaged tissue (tissue thromboplastin) Factors 5,7,8,9,10,11,12 Calcium ions Prothrombin activator from 2 Fibrinogen BOX11-6 HEMOPHILIA cure) has become possible with factor 8 obtained from blood donors. The Factor 8 is extracted fromthe plasma of donated blood and administered inconcentrated form to hemophiliacs, enabling themto live normal lives. In what is perhaps the most tragic irony of med- ical progress, many hemophiliacs were inadver-tently infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Before 1985, there was no test to detect HIV indonated blood, and the virus was passed to hemo-philiacs in the very blood product that was meantto control their disease and prolong their lives.Today, all donated blood and blood products aretested for HIV, and the risk of AIDS transmission tohemophiliacs, or anyone receiving donated blood,is now very small.There are several forms of hemophilia ; all are genetic and are characterized by the inability ofthe blood to clot properly. Hemophilia A is themost common form and involves a deciency ofclotting Factor 8. The gene for hemophilia A islocated on the X chromosome, so this is a sex- linked trait , with the same pattern of inheritance as red-green color blindness and Duchenne's mus-cular dystrophy. Without factor 8, the rst stage of chemical clotting cannot be completed, and prothrombinactivator is not formed. Without treatment, ahemophiliac experiences prolonged bleeding aftereven minor injuries and extensive internal bleeding,especially in joints subjected to the stresses ofweight-bearing. In recent years, treatment (but not11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 266Blood 267 Factors 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Platelet factors Chemicals from damaged tissue Calcium 1 Stage 2 Stage 3Liver Figure 11-7. Stages of chemical blood clotting. QUESTION: Based only on this picture, explain why the liver is a vital organ.11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 267and if it were inside a vessel it would stimulate more and unnecessary clotting, which might eventuallyobstruct blood flow. Prevention of Abnormal Clotting Clotting should take place to stop bleeding, but toomuch clotting would obstruct vessels and interferewith normal circulation of blood. Clots do not usuallyform in intact vessels because the endothelium (sim- ple squamous epithelial lining) is very smooth andrepels the platelets and clotting factors. If the liningbecomes roughened, as happens with the lipid depo-sits of atherosclerosis, a clot will form. Heparin, produced by basophils, is a natural antico- agulant that inhibits the clotting process (althoughheparin is called a \"blood thinner,\" it does not \"thin\"or dilute the blood in any way; rather it prevents achemical reaction from taking place). The liver pro-duces a globulin called antithrombin , which combines with and inactivates excess thrombin. Excess thrombinwould exert a positive feedback effect on the clottingcascade, and result in the splitting of more prothrom-bin to thrombin, more clotting, more thrombinformed, and so on. Antithrombin helps to prevent this,as does the brin of the clot, which adsorbs excessthrombin and renders it inactive. All of these factorsare the external brake for this positive feedback mech-anism. T ogether they usually limit the brin formed towhat is needed to create a useful clot but not anobstructive one. Thrombosis refers to clotting in an intact vessel; the clot itself is called a thrombus . Coronary throm- bosis, for example, is abnormal clotting in a coronaryartery, which will decrease the blood (oxygen) supplyto part of the heart muscle. An embolism is a clot or other tissue transported from elsewhere that lodgesin and obstructs a vessel (see Box 11-7: DissolvingClots).SUMMARY All of the functions of blood described in this chap-ter\u2014transport, regulation, and protection\u2014contri-bute to the homeostasis of the body as a whole.However, these functions could not be carried out ifthe blood did not circulate properly. The circulationof blood throughout the blood vessels depends uponthe proper functioning of the heart, the pump of thecirculatory system, which is the subject of our nextchapter.268 Blood BOX11-7 DISSOLVING CLOTS Abnormal clots may cause serious problems in coronary arteries, pulmonary arteries, cerebralvessels, and even veins in the legs. However, ifclots can be dissolved before they cause death oftissue, normal circulation and tissue functioningmay be restored. One of the rst substances used to dissolve clots in coronary arteries was streptokinase , which is actually a bacterial toxin producedby some members of the genus Streptococcus . Streptokinase did indeed dissolve clots, but itsuse created the possibility of clot destructionthroughout the body, with serious hemorrhage apotential consequence. Safer chemicals called third-generation /H11005\"clot\" and \"split\"). coro- nary thrombosis, if a thrombolytic can be admin-istered within a few hours, the clot may bedissolved and permanent heart damage pre-vented.

STUDY OUTLINE The general functions of blood are trans- portation, regulation, and protection. Characteristics of Blood 1. Amount\u20144 to 6 liters; 38% to 48% is 62% is plasma (Fig. 11-1). 2. Color\u2014arterial blood has a high oxygen contentand is bright red; venous blood has less oxygen and is dark red. 3. pH\u20147.35 to 7.45; venous blood has more CO2and a lower pH than arterial blood. 4. Viscosity\u2014thickness or resistance to flow; due to the presence of cells and plasma proteins; con-tributes to normal blood pressure.11Scanlon(p3)-ch11 8/17/06 10:52 AM Page 268Plasma\u2014the liquid portion of blood 1. 91% water.2. Plasma transports nutrients, wastes, hormones, antibodies, and CO 2as HCO3-. 3. Plasma proteins: clotting factors are synthesized by the liver; albumin is synthesized by the liver andprovides colloid osmotic pressure that pulls tissuefluid into capillaries to maintain normal blood vol-ume and blood pressure; alpha and beta globulinsare synthesized by the liver and are carriers for fatsand other substances in the blood; gamma globu-lins are antibodies produced by lymphocytes. Blood Cells 1. Formed elements are RBCs, WBCs, and platelets (Figs. 11-2 and 11-3). 2. After birth the primary hemopoietic tissue is the red bone marrow, which contains stem cells.Lymphocytes mature and divide in the lymphatictissue of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus,which also have stem cells for lymphocytes. Red Blood Cells\u2014erythrocytes (see Table 11-2 for normal values)1. discs; no nuclei when mature.2. RBCs carry O 2bonded to the iron in hemoglobin. 3. RBCs are formed in the RBM from hemocytoblasts (stem cells, the precursor cells). 4. Hypoxia stimulates the kidneys to produce the hor- mone erythropoietin, which increases the rate of RBC production in the RBM. 5. Immature RBCs: normoblasts (have nuclei) and reticulocytes; large numbers in peripheral cir-culation indicate a need for more RBCs to carryoxygen. 6. Vitamin B 12is the extrinsic factor, needed for DNA synthesis (mitosis) in stem cells in the RBM.Intrinsic factor is produced by the parietal cells ofthe stomach lining; it combines with B 12to prevent its digestion and promote its absorption. 7. RBCs live for 120 days and are then phagocytized by macrophages in the liver, spleen, and RBM. Theiron is returned to the RBM or stored in the liver.The heme of the hemoglobin is converted to biliru-bin, which the liver excretes into bile to be elimi-nated in feces. Colon bacteria change bilirubin tourobilinogen. Any urobilinogen absorbed is con-verted to by the kidneys inurine (Fig. 11-4). Jaundice is the accumulation ofbilirubin in the blood, perhaps due to liver disease.8. ABO blood types are hereditary. The type indicates the antigen(s) on the RBCs (see T able 11-1 andFig. 11-5); antibodies in plasma are for those anti-gens not present on the RBCs and are importantfor transfusions. 9. The Rh type is also hereditary. Rh positive means that the D antigen is present on the RBCs; Rh neg-ative means that the D antigen is not present on theRBCs. Rh-negative people do not have naturalantibodies but will produce them if given Rh-positive blood. White Blood Cells\u2014leukocytes (see Table 11-2 for normal values)1. Larger than RBCs; have nuclei when mature; pro- duced in the red bone marrow, except some lym-phocytes produced in the thymus (Figs. 11-2 and11-3). 2. foreign proteins during aller- gic reactions and parasitic infections; they phago-cytize anything labeled with antibodies. 6. Basophils contain the anticoagulant heparin and histamine, which contributes to inflammation. 7. Lymphocytes: T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. T cells recognize foreign antigens and des-troy them. B cells become plasma cells, which pro-duce antibodies to foreign antigens. NK cellsdestroy foreign cell membranes. 8. WBCs carry out their functions in tissue fluid and lymphatic tissue, as well as in the blood. Platelets\u2014thrombocytes (see Table 11-2 for normal values)1. Platelets are formed in the RBM and are fragments of megakaryocytes; the hormone thrombopoietinfrom the liver increases platelet production. 2. Platelets are involved in all mechanisms of hemo- stasis (prevention of blood loss) (Fig. 11-6). 3. Vascular spasm\u2014large vessels constrict when damaged, the myogenic response. Platelets releaseserotonin, which also causes vasoconstriction. Thebreak in the vessel is made smaller and may beclosed with a blood clot.Blood 26911Scanlon(p3)-ch11 Platelet plugs\u2014rupture of a capillary creates a rough surface to which platelets stick and form abarrier over the break. 5. Chemical clotting involves platelet factors, chemi- cals from damaged tissue, prothrombin, brinogenand other clotting factors synthesized by the liver,and calcium ions. See T able 11-3 and Fig. 11-7 forthe three stages of chemical clotting. The clot isformed of brin threads that form a mesh over thebreak in the vessel.6. Clot retraction is the folding of the brin threads to pull the cut edges of the vessel closer together tofacilitate repair. Fibrinolysis is the dissolving of theclot once it has served its purpose. 7. Abnormal clotting (thrombosis) is prevented by the very smooth endothelium (simple squamousepithelium) that lines blood vessels; heparin, whichinhibits the process; and antithrombin(synthesized by the liver), which inactivates excessthrombin.270 Blood REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

Imagine trying tosqueeze a tennis ball 70 times a minute. After a fewminutes, your arm muscles would begin to tire. Thenimagine increasing your squeezing rate to 120 times aminute. Most of us could not keep that up very long,but that is what the heart does during exercise. Ahealthy heart can increase its rate and force of con-traction to meet the body's need for more oxygen,then return to its resting rate and keep on beating as ifnothing very extraordinary had happened. In fact, itisn't extraordinary at all; this is the job the heart ismeant to do. The primary function of the heart is to pump blood through the arteries, capillaries, and veins. As youlearned in the previous chapter, blood transports oxy-gen and nutrients and has other important functionsas well. The heart is the pump that keeps blood circu-lating properly. LOCATION AND PERICARDIAL MEMBRANES The heart is located in the thoracic cavity between thelungs. This area is called the mediastinum . The base of the cone-shaped heart is uppermost, behind thesternum, and the great vessels enter or leave here. Theapex (tip) of the heart points downward and is justabove the diaphragm to the left of the midline. This iswhy we may think of the heart as being on the leftside, because the strongest beat can be heard or felthere. The heart is enclosed in the pericardial mem- branes , of which there are three layers (Fig. 12-1). The outermost is the brous pericardium , inferiorly over the diaphragm and superiorlyover the bases of the large vessels that enter and leavethe heart. The serous pericardium is a folded mem-brane; the fold gives it two layers, parietal and brous pericardium is the parietal peri- cardium . On the of the heart muscle is the visceral pericardium , often called pericardial mem-branes is serous fluid , which prevents friction as the heart beats. CHAMBERS\u2014VESSELS AND VALVES The walls of the four chambers of the heart are madeof cardiac muscle called the myocardium . The lined with endocardium , simple squamous epithelium that also covers the valves of the heart andcontinues into the vessels as their lining (endothe-lium). The important physical characteristic of theendocardium is not its thinness, but rather its smooth-ness. This very smooth tissue prevents abnormalblood clotting, because clotting would be initiated bycontact of blood with a rough surface.274 The cavity Figure 12-1. Layers of the wall of the heart and the pericardial membranes. The endocardium is the lining of the chambers of the heart. The brous pericardium is theoutermost layer.QUESTION: What is found between the parietal and vis- pericardial layers, and what is its function?12Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM Page 274The upper chambers of the heart are the right and left atria (singular: atrium ), which have relatively thin walls and are separated by a common wall of myocar-dium called the interatrial septum . The lower cham- bers are the right and left ventricles , which have thicker walls and are separated by the interventricu- lar septum (Fig. 12-2). As you will see, the atria receive blood, either from the body or the lungs, andthe ventricles pump blood to either the lungs or thebody. RIGHT ATRIUM The two large caval veins return blood from the body to the right atrium (see Fig. 12-2). The superior vena cava carries blood from the upper body, and the infe- rior vena cava carries blood from the lower body. From the right atrium, blood will flow through theright atrioventricular (AV) valve , or tricuspid valve , into the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve is made of three flaps (or cusps) of endocardium reinforced with connective tissue. Thegeneral purpose of all valves in the circulatory systemis to prevent backflow of blood. The specic purposeof the tricuspid valve is to prevent backflow of bloodfrom the right ventricle to the right atrium when theright ventricle contracts. As the ventricle contracts,blood is forced behind the three valve flaps, forcingthem upward and together to close the valve. LEFT ATRIUM The left atrium receives blood from the lungs, by wayof four pulmonary veins . This blood will then flow into the left ventricle through the left atrioventricular(AV) valve, also called the mitral valve or bicuspid (two flaps) valve. The mitral valve prevents backflowof blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium whenthe left ventricle contracts. Another function of the atria is the production of a hormone involved in blood pressure maintenance.When the walls of the atria are stretched by increasedblood volume or blood pressure, the produceatrial natriuretic . (The ventricles of the heart produce a similar hormone called B-type natri-uretic peptide, or BNP , but we will use ANP as therepresentative cardiac hormone.) ANP decreases thereabsorption of sodium ions by the kidneys, so thatmore sodium ions are excreted in urine, which in turnincreases the elimination of water. The loss of water lowers blood volume and blood pressure. You mayhave noticed that ANP is an antagonist to the hor-mone aldosterone, which raises blood pressure. RIGHT VENTRICLE When the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valvecloses and the blood is pumped to the lungs throughthe pulmonary artery (or trunk). At the junction of thislarge artery and the right ventricle is the pulmonary semilunar valve (or more simply, pulmonary valve). Its three flaps are forced open when the right ventri-cle contracts and pumps blood into the pulmonaryartery. When the right ventricle relaxes, blood tendsto come back, but this lls the valve flaps and closesthe pulmonary valve to prevent backflow of blood intothe right ventricle. Projecting into the lower part of the right ventricle are columns of myocardium called papillary muscles tendineae , extend the papillary the flaps of the tricuspid valve. When theright ventricle contracts, the papillary muscles alsocontract and pull on the chordae tendineae to preventinversion of the tricuspid valve. If you have ever hadyour umbrella blown inside out by a strong wind, youcan see what would happen if the flaps of the tricuspidvalve were not anchored by the chordae tendineae andpapillary muscles. LEFT VENTRICLE The walls of the left ventricle are thicker than those ofthe right ventricle, which enables the left ventricle tocontract more forcefully. The left ventricle pumpsblood to the body through the aorta , the largest artery of the body. At the junction of the aorta and the leftventricle is the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) (see Fig. 12-2). This valve is opened by theforce of contraction of the left ventricle, which alsocloses the mitral valve. The aortic valve closes whenthe left ventricle relaxes, to prevent backflow of bloodfrom the aorta to the left ventricle. When the mitral(left AV) valve closes, it prevents backflow of blood tothe left atrium; the flaps of the mitral valve are alsoanchored by chordae tendineae and papillary muscles. All of the valves are shown in Fig. 12-3, which also depicts the brous skeleton of the heart .

It also separates the myocardium of theatria and ventricles and prevents the contraction ofthe atria from reaching the ventricles except by way ofthe normal conduction pathway. As you can see from this description of the cham- bers and their vessels, the heart is really a double, ortwo-sided, pump. The right side of the heart receivesdeoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it tothe lungs to pick up oxygen and release carbon diox-ide. The left side of the heart receives oxygenatedblood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. Bothpumps work simultaneously; that is, both atria con-tract together, followed by the contraction of bothventricles. Aspects of the anatomy of the heart aresummarized in T able 12-1.

The purpose of the coronary vessels is to supply blood to the myocardium itself, because oxygen isessential for normal myocardial contraction. If a coro-nary artery becomes obstructed, by a blood clot forexample, part of the myocardium becomes ischemic , that is, deprived of its blood supply. Prolongedischemia will create an infarct , an area of necrotic (dead) tissue. This is a myocardial infarction, com-monly called a heart attack (see also Box 12-1: Coro-nary Artery Disease). CARDIAC CYCLE AND HEART SOUNDS The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events in one heartbeat. In its simplest form, the cardiac cycle is thesimultaneous contraction of the two atria, followed afraction of a second later by the simultaneous contrac-tion of the two ventricles. Systole is another term for contraction. The term for relaxation is diastole . You are probably familiar with these terms as they apply toblood pressure readings. If we apply them to the car-diac cycle, we can say that atrial systole is followed byventricular systole. There is, however, a signicantdifference between the movement of blood from theatria to the ventricles and the movement of bloodfrom the ventricles to the arteries. The events of thecardiac cycle are shown in Fig. 12-5. In this traditionalrepresentation, the cardiac cycle is depicted in a circle, because one heartbeat follows another, and the begin-ning of atrial systole is at the top (12 o'clock). The sizeof the segment or arc of the circle indicates how longit takes. Find the segment for atrial systole and the \"longer\") Do youthink this ventricular contraction ismore important than atrial contraction? It does, as youwill see. Refer to Fig. 12-5 as you read the following.We will begin at the bottom (6 o'clock) where the atriaare in the midst of diastole and the ventricles have justcompleted their systole. The entire heart is relaxedand the atria are lling with blood. Blood is constantly flowing from the veins into both atria. As more blood accumulates, its pressureforces open the right and left AV valves. T wo-thirdsof the atrial blood flows passively into the ventri-cles (which brings us to 12 o'clock); the atria thencontract to pump the remaining blood into the ven-tricles. Following their contraction, the atria relax and the ventricles begin to contract. Ventricular contractionforces blood against the flaps of the right and left AVvalves and closes them; the force of blood also opensthe aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves. As theventricles continue to contract, they pump blood intothe arteries. Notice that blood that enters the arteriesmust all be pumped. The ventricles then relax, and atthe same time blood continues to flow into the atria,and the cycle begins again.278 The Heart Aorta Left coronary artery Anterior interventricular branch Great cardiac veinCoronary sinus Posterior artery andvein Small cardiac vein Right coronary artery and vein A BFigure 12-4.

The cardiac cycle depicted in one heartbeat (pulse: 75). The outer circle represents the ventricles, the middle circle the atria, and the inner circlethe movement of blood and its effect onthe heart valves. See text for description. QUESTION: What makes the AV valves close and the semilunar valves open? The important distinction here is that most blood flows passively from atria to ventricles, but allblood to the arteries is actively pumped by the ventricles.For this reason, the proper functioning of the ventri-cles is much more crucial to survival than is atrialfunctioning. You may be asking \"All this in one heartbeat?\" The answer is yes. The cardiac cycle is this precisesequence of events that keeps blood moving from theveins, through the heart, and into the arteries. The cardiac cycle also creates the heart sounds : Each heartbeat produces two sounds, often called lub-dup, that can be heard with a stethoscope. The rstsound, the loudest and longest, is caused by ventricu-lar systole closing the AV valves. The second sound iscaused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonarysemilunar valves. If any of the valves do not closeproperly, an extra sound called a heart murmur may be heard (see Box 12-2: Heart Murmur). CARDIAC CONDUCTION PATHWAY The cardiac cycle is a sequence of mechanical eventsthat is regulated by the electrical activity of themyocardium. Cardiac muscle cells have the ability to contract spontaneously; that is, nerve impulses arenot required to cause contraction. The heart generatesits own beat, and the electrical impulses follow avery specic route throughout the myocardium. Youmay nd it helpful to refer to Fig. 12-6 as you read thefollowing. The natural pacemaker of the heart is the sinoatrial (SA) node , a specialized group of cardiac muscle cells located in the wall of the right atrium just below theopening of the superior vena cava. The SA node isconsidered specialized because it has the most rapidrate of contraction, that is, it depolarizes more rapidlythan any other part of the myocardium (60 to 80 timesper minute). As you may recall, depolarization is therapid entry of Na /H11001ions and the reversal of charges on either side of the cell membrane. The cells of the SAnode are more permeable to Na /H11001ions than are other cardiac muscle cells. Therefore, they depolarize morerapidly, then contract and initiate each heartbeat. From the SA node, impulses for contraction travel to the atrioventricular (AV) node , located in the lower interatrial septum. The transmission of impulsesfrom the SA node to the AV node and to the rest of theatrial myocardium brings about atrial systole.12Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM The Heart BOX12-1 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Other predisposing factors for atherosclerosis include cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, andhigh blood pressure. Any one of these may causedamage to the lining of coronary arteries, which isthe rst step in the abnormal deposition of choles-terol. A diet high in cholesterol and saturated fatsand high blood levels of these lipids will increasethe rate of cholesterol deposition. A possible chemical marker of risk is a high blood level of homocysteine. Homocysteine is a metabolicproduct of the essential amino acid methionine,and may be converted back to methionine or fur-ther changed and excreted by the kidneys. A highblood level of homocysteine may indicate inflam-mation of the walls of arteries. Yet another chemicalmarker of inflammation is C-reactive protein (CRP).There is still much to learn about the role of inflam-mation in atherosclerosis, but simple blood tests forchemical markers may someday provide a diagnosisbefore heart damage occurs. When coronary artery disease becomes life- threatening, coronary artery bypass surgery may beperformed. In this procedure, a synthetic vessel or avein (such as the saphenous vein of the leg) isgrafted around the obstructed coronary vessel torestore blood flow to the myocardium. This is not acure, for atherosclerosis may occur in a grafted veinor at other sites in the coronary arteries.Coronary artery disease results in decreased blood flow to the myocardium. If blood flow is diminishedbut not completely obstructed, the person mayexperience difficulty breathing and angina, which ischest pain caused by lack of oxygen to part of theheart muscle. If blood flow is completely blocked,however, the result is a myocardial infarction(necrosis of cardiac muscle). The most common cause of coronary artery dis- ease is atherosclerosis . Plaques of cholesterol form in the walls of a coronary artery; this narrows thelumen (cavity) and creates a rough surface where aclot (thrombus) may form (see Box Fig. 12-A). Apredisposing factor for such clot formation, one thatcannot be changed, is a family history of coronaryartery disease. There is no \"gene for heart attacks,\"but we do have genes for the enzymes involved incholesterol metabolism. Many of these are liverenzymes that regulate the transport of cholesterol inthe blood in the form of lipoproteins and regulatethe liver's excretion of excess cholesterol in bile.Some people, therefore, have a greater tendencythan others to have higher blood levels of choles-terol and certain lipoproteins. In women beforemenopause, estrogen is believed to exert a protec-tive effect by lowering blood lipid levels. This is whyheart attacks in the 30- to 50-year-old age range areless frequent in women than in men.

The AV bundle is within the upper interventricular septum; itreceives impulses from the AV node and transmitsthem to the right and left bundle branches .

QUESTION: What structure is the pacemaker of the heart, and what is its usual rate of depolarization? BOX12-2 HEART MURMUR close and prevent backflow during ventricular tole. Some valve defects involve a narrowing ( steno- sis) and are congenital; that is, the child is born with an abnormally narrow valve. In aortic stenosis, forexample, blood cannot easily pass from the left ven-tricle to the aorta. The ventricle must then workharder to pump blood through the narrow valve tothe arteries, and the turbulence created is also heardas a systolic murmur. Children sometimes have heart murmurs that are called \"functional\" because no structural causecan be found. These murmurs usually disappearwith no adverse effects on the child.A heart murmur is an abnormal or extra heart sound caused by a malfunctioning heart valve. The func-tion of heart valves is to prevent backflow of blood,and when a valve does not close properly, blood willregurgitate (go backward), creating turbulence thatmay be heard with a stethoscope. Rheumatic heart disease is a now uncommon complication of a streptococcal infection. In rheu-matic fever, the heart valves are damaged by anabnormal response by the immune system. Erosionof the valves makes them \"leaky\" and inefficient,and a murmur of backflowing blood will be heard.Mitral valve regurgitation, for example, will be heardas a systolic murmur, because this valve is meant to12Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM Page 281bundle branches, impulses travel along Purkinje bers to the rest of the ventricular myocardium and bring about ventricular systole. The electrical activityof atria and ventricles is depicted by an electrocar-diogram (ECG); this is discussed in Box 12-3:Electrocardiogram. If the SA node does not function properly, the AV node will initiate the heartbeat, but at a slower rate (50to 60 beats per minute). The AV bundle is also capa-ble of generating the beat of the ventricles, but at amuch slower rate (15 to 40 beats per minute). Thismay occur in certain kinds of heart disease in which transmission of impulses from the atria to the ventri-cles is blocked. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats; their effects range from harmless to life-threatening. Nearlyeveryone experiences heart palpitations (becoming aware of an irregular beat) from time to time. These are usually not serious and may be the result oftoo much caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol. Much moreserious is ventricular brillation , a very rapid and uncoordinated ventricular beat that is totally inef-282 The Heart BOX12-3 ELECTROCARDIOGRAM throughout the ventricular myocardium. The T wave represents repolarization of the ventricles(atrial repolarization does not appear as a separatewave because it is masked by the QRS complex). Detailed interpretation of abnormal ECGs is beyond the scope of this book, but in general, thelength of each wave and the time intervals betweenwaves are noted. An ECG may be helpful in thediagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis, which de-prives the myocardium of oxygen, or of rheumaticfever or other valve disorders that result in enlarge-ment of a chamber of the heart and prolong a spe-cic wave of an ECG. For example, the enlargementof the left ventricle that is often a consequence ofhypertension may be indicated by an abnormalQRS complex.A heartbeat is a series of electrical events, and the electrical changes generated by the myocardiumcan be recorded by placing electrodes on the bodysurface. Such a recording is called an electrocar- diogram (ECG) (see Fig. 12-6). A typical ECG consists of three distinguishable waves or deflections: the P wave, the QRS complex,and the T wave. Each represents a specic electricalevent; all are shown in Fig. 12-6 in a normal ECGtracing. The P wave represents depolarization of the atria, that is, the transmission of electrical impulsesfrom the SA node throughout the atrial myocar-dium. The QRS complex represents depolarization of the the electrical impulses spread BOX12-4 ARRHYTHMIAS rillating ventricles are not pumping, and cardiac output decreases sharply. Ventricular brillation may follow a non-fatal heart attack (myocardial infarction). Damaged car-diac muscle cells may not be able to maintain a nor-mal state of polarization, and they depolarizespontaneously and rapidly. From this ectopic focus,impulses spread to other parts of the ventricularmyocardium in a rapid and haphazard pattern, andthe ventricles quiver rather than contract as a unit. It is often possible to correct ventricular brilla- tion with the use of an electrical debrillator. Thisinstrument delivers an electric shock to the heart,which causes the entire myocardium to depolarizeand contract, then relax. If the rst part of the heartto recover is the SA node (which usually has themost rapid rate of contraction), a normal heartbeatmay be restored.Arrhythmias (also called dysrhythmias) are irreg- ular heartbeats caused by damage to part of theconduction pathway, or by an ectopic focus , which is a beat generated in part of themyocardium other than the SA node. Flutter is a very rapid but fairly regular heart- beat. In atrial flutter, the atria may contract up to300 times per minute. Because atrial pumping isnot crucial, however, blood flow to the ventriclesmay be maintained for a time, and flutter may notbe immediately life-threatening. Ventricular flutteris usually only a brief transition between ventriculartachycardia and brillation. Fibrillation is very rapid and uncoordinated contractions. Ventricular brillation is a medicalemergency that must be quickly corrected to pre-vent death. Normal contraction of the ventricles isnecessary to pump blood into the arteries, but b-12Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM Page 282fective for pumping blood (see Box 12-4: Arrhyth- mias). HEART RATE A healthy adult has a resting heart rate ( pulse ) of 60 to 80 beats per minute, which is the rate of depolariza-tion of the SA node. (The SA node actually has aslightly faster rate, closer to 100 beats per minute, butis slowed by parasympathetic nerve impulses to whatwe consider a normal resting rate.) A rate less than 60(except for athletes) is called bradycardia ; a prolonged or consistent rate greater than 100 beats per minute iscalled tachycardia . A child's normal heart rate may be as high as 100 beats per minute, that of an infant as high as 120, andthat of a near-term fetus as high as 140 beats perminute. These higher rates are not related to age, butrather to size: the smaller the individual, the higher themetabolic rate and the faster the heart rate. Parallelsmay be found among animals of different sizes; theheart rate of a mouse is about 200 beats per minuteand that of an elephant about 30 beats per minute. Let us return to the adult heart rate and consider the person who is in excellent physical condition. Asyou may know, well-conditioned athletes have lowresting pulse rates. Those of basketball players areoften around 50 beats per minute, and the pulse of amarathon runner often ranges from 35 to 40 beats perminute. T o understand why this is so, remember thatthe heart is a muscle. When our skeletal muscles areexercised, they become stronger and more efficient.The same is true for the heart; consistent exercise makes it a more efficient pump, as you will see in the next section. CARDIAC OUTPUT Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by a ventricle in 1 minute. A certain level of cardiac outputis needed at all times to transport oxygen to tissues andto remove waste products. During exercise, cardiacoutput must increase to meet the body's need for moreoxygen. We will return to exercise after rst consider-ing resting cardiac output. T o calculate cardiac output, we must know the pulse rate and how much blood is pumped per beat.Stroke volume is the term for the amount of blood pumped by a ventricle per beat; an average restingstroke volume is 60 to 80 mL per beat. A simple for- mula then enables us to determine cardiac output: Cardiac output /H11005stroke volume /H11003pulse (heart rate) Let us put into this formula an average resting stroke volume, 70 mL, and an average resting pulse,70 beats per minute (bpm): Cardiac output /H1100570 mL /H1100370 bpm Cardiac output /H110054900 mL per minute (approximately 5 liters) Naturally, cardiac output varies with the size of the person, but the average resting cardiac output is 5 to 6liters per minute. Notice that this amount is just aboutthe same as a person's average volume of blood. Atrest, the heart pumps all of the blood in the bodywithin about a minute. Changes are possible, depend-ing on circumstances and extent of physical activity. If we now reconsider the athlete, you will be able to see precisely why the athlete has a low resting pulse. Inour formula, we will use an average resting cardiacoutput (5 liters) and an athlete's pulse rate (50): Cardiac output /H11005stroke volume /H11003pulse 5000 mL /H11005stroke volume /H1100350 bpm 5000/50 /H11005stroke volume 100 mL /H11005stroke volume Notice that the athlete's resting stroke volume is signicantly higher than the average. The athlete'smore efficient heart pumps more blood with each beatand so can maintain a normal resting cardiac outputwith fewer beats. Now let us see how the heart responds to exercise. Heart rate (pulse) increases during exercise, and sodoes stroke volume. The increase in stroke volume isthe result of Starling's law of the heart , which states that the more the cardiac muscle bers are stretched,the more forcefully they contract. During exercise,more blood returns to the heart; this is called venous return . Increased venous return stretches the myocar- dium of the ventricles, which contract more forcefullyand pump more blood, thereby increasing stroke vol-ume. Therefore, during exercise, our formula mightbe the following: Cardiac output /H11005stroke volume /H11003pulse Cardiac output /H11005100 mL /H11003100 bpm /H1100510,000 (10 liters)The Heart 28312Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM Page 283This exercise cardiac output is twice the resting cardiac output we rst calculated, which should not beconsidered unusual. The cardiac output of a healthyyoung person may increase up to four times the rest-ing level during strenuous exercise. This difference isthe cardiac reserve , the extra volume the heart can pump when necessary. If resting cardiac output is 5liters and exercise cardiac output is 20 liters, the car-diac reserve is 15 liters. The marathon runner's cardiacoutput may increase six times or more compared tothe resting level, and cardiac reserve is even greaterthan for the average young person; this is the result ofthe marathoner's extremely efficient heart. Because ofStarling's law, it is almost impossible to overwork ahealthy heart. No matter how much the volume ofvenous return increases, the ventricles simply pumpmore forcefully and increase the stroke volume andcardiac output. Also related to cardiac output, and another measure of the health of the heart, is the ejection fraction . This is the percent of the blood in a ventricle that ispumped during systole. A ventricle does not emptycompletely when it contracts, but should pump out60% to 70% of the blood within it. A lower percent-age would indicate that the ventricle is weakening.These aspects of physiology are summarized in T able12-2. REGULATION OF HEART RATE Although the heart generates and maintains its ownbeat, the rate of contraction can be changed to adaptto different situations. The nervous system can and does bring about necessary changes in heart rate aswell as in force of contraction. The medulla of the brain contains the two cardiac centers, the accelerator center and the inhibitory center . These centers send impulses to the heart along autonomic nerves. Recall from Chapter 8 thatthe autonomic nervous system has two divisions: sym-pathetic and parasympathetic. Sympathetic impulsesfrom the accelerator center along sympathetic nervesincrease heart rate and force of contraction duringexercise and stressful situations. Parasympatheticimpulses from the inhibitory center along the vagusnerves decrease the heart rate. At rest these impulsesslow down the depolarization of the SA node to whatwe consider a normal resting rate, and they also slowthe heart after exercise is over. Our next question might be: What information is received by the medulla to initiate changes? Becausethe heart pumps blood, it is essential to maintain nor-mal blood pressure. Blood contains oxygen, which alltissues must receive continuously. Therefore, changesin blood pressure and oxygen level of the blood arestimuli for changes in heart rate. You may also recall from Chapter 9 that presso- receptors and chemoreceptors are located in thecarotid arteries and aortic arch. Pressoreceptors in the carotid sinuses and aortic sinus detect changes inblood pressure. Chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and aortic body detect changes in the oxygencontent of the blood. The sensory nerves for thecarotid receptors are the glossopharyngeal (9th cra-nial) nerves; the sensory nerves for the aortic arch284 The Heart Table 12-2 PHYSIOLOGY OF THE HEART Aspect and Normal Range Description Heart rate (pulse): 60-80 bpm 15 liters or moreGenerated by the SA node, propagated through the conduction pathway; parasympathetic impulses (vagus nerves) decrease the rate; sympathetic impulses increase the rate The amount of blood pumped by a ventricle in one beat The volume of blood pumped by a ventricle in 1 minute; stroke volume x pulseThe percentage of blood within a ventricle that is pumped out per beat The difference between resting cardiac output and maximum cardiac output during exercise12Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM Page 284receptors are the vagus (10th cranial) nerves. If we now put all of these facts together in a specic exam-ple, you will see that the regulation of heart rate is areflex. Figure 12-7 depicts all of the structures justmentioned. A person who stands up suddenly from a lying posi- tion may feel light-headed or dizzy for a few moments,because blood pressure to the brain has decreasedabruptly. The drop in blood pressure is detected bypressoreceptors in the carotid sinuses\u2014notice thatthey are \"on the way\" to the brain, a very strategiclocation. The drop in blood pressure causes fewerimpulses to be generated by the pressoreceptors.These impulses travel along the glossopharyngealnerves to the medulla, and the decrease in the fre-quency of impulses stimulates the accelerator center.The accelerator center generates impulses that are car-ried by sympathetic nerves to the SA node, AV node,and ventricular myocardium. As heart rate and forceincrease, blood pressure to the brain is raised to nor-mal, and the sensation of light-headedness passes.When blood pressure to the brain is restored to nor- mal, the heart receives more parasympathetic impulsesfrom the inhibitory center along the vagus nerves to the SA node and AV node. These parasympathetic impulses slow the heart rate to a normal resting pace. The heart will also be the effector in a reflex stim- ulated by a decrease in the oxygen content of theblood. The aortic receptors are strategically located soas to detect such an important change as soon as bloodleaves the heart. The reflex arc in this situation wouldbe (1) aortic chemoreceptors, (2) vagus nerves (sen-sory), (3) accelerator center in the medulla, (4) sympa-thetic nerves, and (5) the heart muscle, which willincrease its rate and force of contraction to circulatemore oxygen to correct the hypoxia. Recall also from Chapter 10 that the hormone epinephrine is secreted by the adrenal medulla instressful situations. One of the many functions of epi-nephrine is to increase heart rate and force of contrac-tion. This will help supply more blood to tissues inneed of more oxygen.The Heart 285 Accelerator center Inhibitory center Medulla Thoracic nerves carotid carotid arteries Aortic arch Aortic sinus and aortic body SA node Bundle of His AV node Figure 12-7.

The heart is located inthe mediastinum, the area between thelungs in the thoracic cavity. Pericardial Membranes\u2014three layers that enclose the heart (see Fig. 12-1)1. The outer, brous pericardium, made of brous connective tissue, is a loose-tting sac that sur-rounds the heart and extends over the diaphragmand the bases of the great vessels. 2. The parietal pericardium is a serous membrane that lines the brous 3. The visceral pericardium, or epicardium, is a serous membrane on the surface of the myocardium. 4. Serous fluid between the parietal and visceral peri- cardial membranes prevents friction as the heartbeats. Chambers of the Heart (see Fig. 12-2 and Table 12-1)1. Cardiac muscle tissue, the myocardium, forms the walls of the four chambers of the heart. 2. Endocardium lines the chambers and covers the valves of the heart; is simple squamous epitheliumthat is very smooth and prevents abnormal clotting.3. The right and left atria are the upper chambers, separated by the interatrial septum. The atriareceive blood from veins. 4. The right and left ventricles are the lower cham- bers, separated by the interventricular septum. Theventricles pump blood into arteries. Right Atrium 1. Receives blood from the upper body by way of the superior vena cava and receives blood from thelower body by way of the inferior vena cava. 2. The tricuspid (right AV) valve prevents backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atriumwhen the right ventricle contracts. Left Atrium 1. Receives blood from the lungs by way of four pul- monary veins. 2. The mitral (left AV or bicuspid) valve prevents backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the leftatrium when the left ventricle contracts. 3. The walls of the atria produce atrial natriuretic peptide when stretched by increased blood volumeor BP . ANP increases the loss of Na /H11001ions and water in urine, which decreases blood volume andBP to normal.286 The Heart STUDY OUTLINEAGING AND THE HEART The heart muscle becomes less efficient with age, and there is a decrease in both maximum cardiac outputand heart rate, although resting levels may be morethan adequate. The health of the myocardiumdepends on its blood supply, and with age there isgreater likelihood that atherosclerosis will narrow thecoronary arteries. Atherosclerosis is the deposition ofcholesterol on and in the walls of the arteries, whichdecreases blood flow and forms rough surfaces thatmay cause intravascular clot formation. High blood pressure (hypertension) causes the left ventricle to work harder; it may enlarge and outgrowits blood supply, thus becoming weaker. A weak ven-tricle is not an efficient pump, and such weakness mayprogress to congestive heart failure; such a progres-sion may be slow, or may be rapid. The heart valves may become thickened by brosis, leading to heartmurmurs and less efficient pumping. Arrhythmias arealso more common with age, as the cells of the con-duction pathway become less efficient. SUMMARY As you can see, the nervous system regulates the func-tioning of the heart based on what the heart is sup-posed to do. The pumping of the heart maintainsnormal blood pressure and proper oxygenation of tis-sues, and the nervous system ensures that the heartwill be able to meet these demands in different situa-tions. Blood pressure and the blood vessels are thesubjects of the next chapter.12Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM Page 286Right Ventricle\u2014has relatively thin walls 1. Pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. 2. The pulmonary semilunar valve prevents backflow of blood from the pulmonary artery to the rightventricle when the right ventricle relaxes. 3. Papillary muscles and chordae tendineae prevent inversion of the right AV valve when the right ven-tricle contracts. Left Ventricle\u2014has thicker walls than does the right ventricle1. Pumps blood to the body through the aorta.2. The aortic semilunar valve prevents backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle when the left ventricle relaxes. 3. Papillary muscles and chordae tendineae prevent inversion of the left AV valve when the left ventri-cle contracts. 4. The heart is a double pump: The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the bodyand pumps it to the lungs; the left side of the heartreceives oxygenated blood from the lungs andpumps it to the body. Both sides of the heart worksimultaneously. Coronary Vessels (see Fig. 12-4) 1. Pathway: ascending aorta to right and left coronary arteries, to smaller arteries, to capillaries, to coro-nary veins, to the coronary sinus, to the rightatrium. 2. Coronary circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the myocardium. 3. Obstruction of a coronary artery causes a myocar- dial infarction: death of an area of myocardium dueto lack of oxygen. Cardiac Cycle\u2014the sequence of events in one heartbeat (see Fig. 12-5)1. The atria continually receive blood from the veins; as pressure within the atria increases, the AV valvesare opened. 2. T wo-thirds of the atrial blood flows passively into the ventricles; atrial contraction pumps theremaining blood into the ventricles; the atria thenrelax. 3. The ventricles contract, which closes the AV valves and opens the aortic and pulmonary semilunarvalves.4. Ventricular contraction pumps all blood into the arteries. The ventricles then relax. Meanwhile,blood is lling the atria, and the cycle begins again. 5. Systole means contraction; diastole means relax- the atria are in diastole. 6. The mechanical events of the cardiac cycle keep blood moving from the veins through the heart andinto the arteries. Heart Sounds\u2014two sounds per heartbeat: lub-dup1. The rst sound is created by closure of the AV valves during ventricular systole. 2. The second sound is created by closure of the aor- tic and pulmonary semilunar valves. 3. Improper closing of a valve results in a heart mur- mur. Cardiac Conduction Pathway\u2014the pathway of impulses during the cardiac cycle (see Fig.12-6)1. The SA node in the wall of the right atrium initi- ates each heartbeat; the cells of the SA node aremore permeable to Na /H11001ions and depolarize more rapidly than any other part of the myocardium. 2. The AV node is in the lower interatrial septum. Depolarization of the SA node spreads to the and to the atrial myocardium and bringsabout atrial systole. 3. The AV bundle (bundle of His) is in the upper interventricular septum; the rst part of the ventri-cles to depolarize. 4. The right and left bundle branches in the interven- tricular septum transmit impulses to myocardium, which com-plete ventricular systole. 5. An electrocardiogram (ECG) depicts the electrical activity of the heart (see Fig. 12-6). 6. If part of the conduction pathway does not function properly, the next part will initiate contraction, butat a slower rate. 7. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats; their effects range from harmless to life-threatening. Heart Rate 1. Healthy adult: 60 to 80 beats per minute (heart rate equals pulse); children and infants have fasterThe Heart 28712Scanlon(p3)-ch12 8/17/06 10:53 AM Page 287pulses because of their smaller size and higher metabolic rate. 2. A person in excellent physical condition has a slow resting pulse because the heart is a more efficientpump and pumps more blood per beat. Cardiac Output (see Table 12-2) 1. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by a ventricle in 1 minute. 2. Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by a ventricle in one beat; average is 60 to 80 mL. 3. Cardiac output equals stroke volume /H11003pulse; aver- age resting cardiac output is 5 to 6 liters. 4. Starling's law of the heart\u2014the more cardiac mus- cle bers are stretched, the more forcefully theycontract. 5. During exercise, stroke volume increases as venous return increases and stretches the myocardium ofthe ventricles (Starling's law). 6. During exercise, the increase in stroke volume and the increase in pulse result in an increase in cardiacoutput: two to four times the resting level. 7. Cardiac reserve is the difference between resting cardiac output and the maximum cardiac output;may be 15 liters or more. 8. The ejection fraction is the percent of its total blood that a ventricle pumps per beat; average is60% to 70%.Regulation of Heart Rate (see Fig. 12-7) 1. The heart generates its own beat, but the nervous system brings about changes to adapt to differentsituations. 2. The medulla contains the cardiac centers: the accelerator center and the inhibitory center. 3. Sympathetic impulses to the heart increase rate and force of contraction; parasympathetic impulses(vagus nerves) to the heart decrease heart rate. 4. Pressoreceptors in the carotid and aortic sinuses detect changes in blood pressure. 5. Chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies detect changes in the oxygen content of the blood. 6. The glossopharyngeal nerves are sensory for the carotid receptors. The vagus nerves are sensory forthe aortic receptors. 7. If blood pressure to the brain decreases, presso- receptors in the carotid sinuses detect this decreaseand send fewer sensory impulses along the glos-sopharyngeal nerves to the medulla. The accelera-tor center dominates and sends motor impulsesalong sympathetic nerves to increase heart rate andforce of contraction to restore blood pressure tonormal. 8. A similar reflex is activated by hypoxia.9. Epinephrine from the adrenal medulla increases heart rate and force of contraction during stressfulsituations.288 The Heart REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

T erms that appear in bold type in the chapter text are dened in the glossary, which begins on page 547.13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 291The role of blood vessels in the circulation of blood has been known since 1628, when William Harvey, anEnglish anatomist, demonstrated that blood in veinsalways flowed toward the heart. Before that time, itwas believed that blood was static or stationary, someof it within the vessels but the rest sort of in puddlesthroughout the body. Harvey showed that bloodindeed does move, and only in the blood vessels(though he did not know of the existence of capillar-ies). In the centuries that followed, the active (ratherthan merely passive) roles of the vascular system werediscovered, and all contribute to homeostasis. The vascular system consists of the arteries, capil- laries, and veins through which the heart pumps bloodthroughout the body. As you will see, the major \"busi-ness\" of the vascular system, which is the exchange ofmaterials between the blood and tissues, takes place inthe capillaries. The arteries and veins, however, arejust as important, transporting blood between the cap-illaries and the heart. Another important topic of this chapter will be blood pressure (BP), which is the force the bloodexerts against the walls of the vessels. Normal bloodpressure is essential for circulation and for some of thematerial exchanges that take place in capillaries. ARTERIES Arteries carry blood from the heart to capillaries; smaller arteries are called arterioles . If we look at an artery in cross-section, we nd three layers (or tunics) of tissues, each with different functions (Fig. 13-1). The innermost layer, the tunica intima , is the only part of a vessel that is in contact with blood. It is madeof simple squamous epithelium called endothelium . This lining is the same type of tissue that forms theendocardium, the lining of the chambers of the heart.As you might guess, its function is also the same: Itsextreme smoothness prevents abnormal blood clot-ting. The endothelium of vessels, however, also pro-duces nitric oxide (NO), which is a vasodilator. Thetunica media , or middle layer, is made of smooth muscle and elastic connective tissue. Both of these tis-sues are involved in the maintenance of normal bloodpressure, especially diastolic blood pressure when theheart is relaxed. The smooth muscle is the tissueaffected by the vasodilator NO; relaxation of this mus-cle tissue brings about dilation of the vessel. Smooth muscle also has a nerve supply; sympathetic nerveimpulses bring about vasoconstriction. Fibrous con-nective tissue forms the outer layer, the tunica externa . This tissue is very strong, which is important to prevent the rupture or bursting of the larger arter-ies that carry blood under high pressure (see Box 13-1:Disorders of Arteries). The outer and middle layers of large arteries are quite thick. In the smallest arterioles, only individualsmooth muscle cells encircle the tunica intima. Asmentioned, the smooth muscle layer enables arteriesto constrict or dilate. Such changes in diameter areregulated by the medulla and autonomic nervous sys-tem, and will be discussed in a later section on bloodpressure. VEINS Veins carry blood from capillaries back to the heart; the smaller veins are called venules . The same three tissue layers are present in veins as in the walls ofarteries, but there are some differences when com-pared to the arterial layers. The inner layer of veins issmooth endothelium, but at intervals this lining isfolded to form valves (see Fig. 13-1). Valves prevent backflow of blood and are most numerous in veins ofthe legs, where blood must often return to the heartagainst the force of gravity. The middle layer of veins is a thin layer of smooth muscle. It is thin because veins do not regulate bloodpressure and blood flow into capillaries as arteries do.Veins can constrict extensively, however, and thisfunction becomes very important in certain situationssuch as severe hemorrhage. The outer layer of veins isalso thin; not as much brous connective tissue is nec-essary because blood pressure in veins is very low. ANASTOMOSES An anastomosis is a connection, or joining, of vessels, that is, artery to artery or vein to vein. The generalpurpose of these connections is to provide alternatepathways for the flow of blood if one vessel becomesobstructed. An arterial anastomosis helps ensure that blood will get to the capillaries of an organ to deliver oxygen292 The Vascular System13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 292and nutrients and to remove waste products. There are arterial anastomoses, for example, between someof the coronary arteries that supply blood to themyocardium. A venous anastomosis helps ensure that blood will be able to return to the heart in order to be pumpedagain. Venous anastomoses are most numerous amongthe veins of the legs, where the possibility of obstruc-tion increases as a person gets older (see Box 13-2:Disorders of Veins). CAPILLARIES Capillaries carry blood from arterioles to venules. Their walls are only one cell in thickness; capillariesare actually the extension of the endothelium, the sim- ple squamous lining, of arteries and veins (see Fig.13-1). Some tissues do not have capillaries; these arethe epidermis, cartilage, and the lens and cornea of theeye. Most tissues, however, have extensive capillary net- works. The quantity or volume of capillary networksin an organ reflects the metabolic activity of the organ.The functioning of the kidneys, for example, dependsupon a good blood supply. Fig. 18-2 shows a vascularcast of a kidney; you can see how dense the vessels are,most of which are capillaries. In contrast, a tendonsuch as the Achilles tendon at the heel or the patellartendon at the knee would have far fewer vessels,because brous connective tissue and vein.See text for description. QUESTION: What tissue is the tunica media made of, andhow is this layer different in anartery and in a vein?13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 293Blood flow into capillary networks is regulated by smooth muscle cells called precapillary sphincters , found at the beginning of each network (see Fig. 13-1).Precapillary sphincters are not regulated by the nerv-ous system but rather constrict or dilate depending onthe needs of the tissues. Because there is not enoughblood in the body to ll all of the capillaries at once,precapillary sphincters are usually slightly constricted.In an active tissue that requires more oxygen, such asexercising muscle, the precapillary sphincters dilate toincrease blood flow. These automatic responses ensure that blood, the volume of which is constant, will circu-late where it is needed most. Some organs have another type of capillary called sinusoids , which are larger and more permeable than are other capillaries. The permeability of sinusoidspermits large substances such as proteins and bloodcells to enter or leave the blood. Sinusoids are foundin the red bone marrow and spleen, where blood cellsenter or leave the blood, and in organs such as the294 The Vascular System BOX13-1 DISORDERS OF ARTERIES The most common sites for aneurysm formation are the cerebral arteries and the aorta, especi-ally the abdominal aorta. Rupture of a cerebralaneurysm is a possible cause of a cerebrovascularaccident (CVA). Rupture of an aortic aneurysm islife-threatening and requires immediate correctivesurgery. The damaged portion of the artery isremoved and replaced with a graft. Such surgerymay also be performed when an aneurysm is foundbefore it ruptures.Atherosclerosis \u2014this condition has Chapters and 12.Arteriosclerosis \u2014although commonly called \"hardening of the arteries,\" arteriosclerosis reallymeans that the arteries lose their elasticity, and theirwalls become weakened. Arteries carry blood underhigh pressure, so deterioration of their walls is partof the aging process.Aneurysm \u2014a weak portion of an arterial wall may bulge out, forming a sac or bubble called ananeurysm. Arteriosclerosis is a possible cause, butsome aneurysms are congenital. An aneurysm maybe present for many years without any symptomsand may only be discovered during diagnostic pro-cedures for some other purpose. BOX13-2 DISORDERS OF VEINS to pool in the leg veins, stretching their walls. If the veins become overly stretched, the valves withinthem no longer close properly. These incompetentvalves no longer prevent backflow of blood, leadingto further pooling and even further stretching ofthe walls of the veins. Varicose veins may cause dis-comfort and cramping in the legs, or become evenmore painful. Severe varicosities may be removedsurgically. This condition may also develop during preg- nancy, when the enlarged uterus presses againstthe iliac veins and slows blood flow into the inferiorvena cava. Varicose veins of the anal canal are calledhemorrhoids , which may also be a result of preg- nancy or of chronic constipation and straining todefecate. Hemorrhoids that cause discomfort or pain may also be removed surgically. Developmentsin laser surgery have made this a simpler procedure than it was in the past.Phlebitis \u2014inflammation of a vein. This condition is most common in the veins of the legs, becausethey are subjected to great pressure as the blood isreturned to the heart against the force of gravity.Often no specic cause can be determined, butadvancing age, obesity, and blood disorders maybe predisposing factors. If a supercial vein is affected, the area may be tender or painful, but blood flow is usually main-tained because there are so many anastomosesamong these veins. Deep vein phlebitis is potentiallymore serious, with the possibility of clot formation(thrombophlebitis) and subsequent dislodging ofthe clot to form an embolism.Varicose veins \u2014swollen and distended veins that occur most often in the supercial veins of the legs.This condition may develop in people who must sitor stand in one place for long periods of time.Without contraction of the leg muscles, blood tends13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 294liver and pituitary gland, which produce and secrete proteins into the blood. EXCHANGES IN CAPILLARIES Capillaries are the sites of exchanges of materialsbetween the blood and the tissue fluid surroundingcells. Some of these substances move from the bloodto tissue fluid, and others move from tissue fluid to theblood. The processes by which these substances areexchanged are illustrated in Fig. 13-2. Gases move by diffusion , that is, from their area of greater concentration to their area of lesser concen-tration. Oxygen, therefore, diffuses from the blood insystemic capillaries to the tissue fluid, and carbondioxide diffuses from tissue fluid to the blood to bebrought to the lungs and exhaled. Let us now look at the blood pressure as blood enters capillaries from the arterioles. Blood pressurehere is about 30 to 35 mmHg, and the pressure of the surrounding tissue fluid is much lower, about 2mmHg. Because the capillary blood pressure is higher,the process of ltration occurs, which forces plasma and dissolved nutrients out of the capillaries and intotissue fluid. This is how nutrients such as glucose,amino acids, and vitamins are brought to cells. Blood pressure decreases as blood reaches the venous end of capillaries, but notice that proteinssuch as albumin have remained in the blood. Albumincontributes to the colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of blood; this is an \"attracting\" pressure, a \"pulling\"rather than a \"pushing\" pressure. At the venous endof capillaries, the presence of albumin in the bloodpulls tissue fluid into the capillaries, which also bringsinto the blood the waste products produced bycells. The tissue fluid that returns to the bloodalso helps maintain normal blood volume and bloodpressure.The Vascular System 295 Precapillary sphincter Tissue fluid Cells Capillary mmHg COP 4 mmHg CO2CO2CO2 O2O2 P. 33 mmHg Albumin - COP 25 mmHg B.

Exchanges between blood in a systemic capillary and the surrounding tis- sue fluid. Arrows depict the direction of movement. Filtration takes place at the arterial endof the capillary. Osmosis takes place at the venous end. Gases are exchanged by diffusion.QUESTION: Of all the pressures shown here, which one is the highest, and what process does it bring about?13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 295The amount of tissue fluid formed is slightly greater than the amount returned to the capillaries. Ifthis were to continue, blood volume would be gradu-ally depleted. The excess tissue fluid, however, enterslymph capillaries. Now called lymph, it will bereturned to the blood to be recycled again as plasma,thus maintaining blood volume. This is discussed fur-ther in Chapter 14. PATHWAYS OF CIRCULATION The two major pathways of circulation are pulmonaryand systemic. Pulmonary circulation begins at theright ventricle, and systemic circulation begins at theleft ventricle. Hepatic portal circulation is a specialsegment of systemic circulation that will be coveredseparately. Fetal circulation involves pathways that arepresent only before birth and will also be discussedseparately. PULMONARY CIRCULATION The right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonaryartery (or trunk), which divides into the right and leftpulmonary arteries, one going to each lung. Withinthe lungs each artery branches extensively into smallerarteries and arterioles, then to capillaries. The pul-monary capillaries surround the alveoli of the lungs; itis here that exchanges of oxygen and carbon dioxidetake place. The capillaries unite to form venules,which merge into veins, and nally into the two pul-monary veins from each lung that return blood to theleft atrium. This oxygenated blood will then travelthrough the systemic circulation. (Notice that the pul-monary veins contain oxygenated blood; these are the only veins that carry blood with a high oxygen con- tent. The blood in systemic veins has a low oxygencontent; it is systemic arteries that carry oxygenatedblood.) SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION The left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta, thelargest artery of the body. We will return to the aortaand its branches in a moment, but rst we will sum-marize the rest of systemic circulation. The branchesof the aorta take blood into arterioles and capillary net-works throughout the body. Capillaries merge to formvenules and veins. The veins from the lower body takeblood to the inferior vena cava; veins from the upperbody take blood to the superior vena cava. These two caval veins return blood to the right atrium. The majorarteries and veins are shown in Figs. 13-3 to 13-5, andtheir functions are listed in T ables 13-1 and 13-2. The aorta is a continuous vessel, but for the sake of precise description it is divided into sections that arenamed anatomically: ascending aorta, aortic arch, tho-racic aorta, and abdominal aorta. The ascending aortais the rst inch that emerges from the top of the leftventricle. The arch of the aorta curves posteriorly overthe heart and turns downward. The thoracic aortacontinues down through the chest cavity and throughthe diaphragm. Below the level of the diaphragm, theabdominal aorta continues to the level of the 4th lum-bar vertebra, where it divides into the two commoniliac arteries. Along its course, the aorta has many branches through which blood travels to specic organs and parts of the body. The ascending aorta has only two branches: the right and left coronary arteries, which supply blood tothe myocardium. This pathway of circulation wasdescribed previously in Chapter 12. The aortic arch has three branches that supply blood to the head and arms: the brachiocephalicartery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavianartery. The brachiocephalic (literally, \"arm-head\")artery is very short and divides into the right commoncarotid artery and right subclavian artery. The rightand left common carotid arteries extend into the neck,where each divides into an internal carotid artery andexternal carotid artery, which supply the head. Theright and left subclavian arteries are in the shouldersbehind the clavicles and continue into the arms. As theartery enters another body area (it may not \"branch,\"simply continue), its name changes: The subclavianartery becomes the axillary artery, which becomes thebrachial artery. The branches of the carotid and sub-clavian arteries are diagrammed in Figs. 13-3 and13-5. As you look at these diagrams, keep in mind thatthe name of the vessel often tells us where it is. Thefacial artery, for example, is found in the face. Some of the arteries in the head contribute to an important arterial anastomosis, the circle of Willis (or cerebral arterial circle), which is a \"circle\" of arter-ies around the pituitary gland (Fig. 13-6). The circleof Willis is formed by the right and left internalcarotid arteries and the basilar artery, which is theunion of the right and left vertebral arteries (branchesof the subclavian arteries). The brain is always active,296 The Vascular System (text continued on page Superficial palmar arch Deep femoral Figure 13-3. Systemic arteries. The aorta and its major branches are shown in anterior view.QUESTION: Can you nd three arteries named after bones? After organs?13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 297298 The Vascular Superior sinus Inferior sagittal sinus in anterior view.

From this anastomosis, severalpaired arteries (the cerebral arteries) extend into thebrain itself. The thoracic aorta and its branches supply the chest wall and the organs within the thoracic cavity.These vessels are listed in T able 13-1. The abdominal aorta gives rise to arteries that sup-ply the abdominal wall and organs and to the common iliac arteries, which continue into the legs. Notice inFig. 13-3 that the common iliac artery becomes theexternal iliac which becomes the femoral artery,which becomes the popliteal artery; the same vesselhas different names based on location. These vesselsare also listed in T able 13-1 (see Box 13-3: PulseSites).

The most important veins are dia- grammed in Fig. 13-4 and listed in T able 13-2. HEPATIC PORTAL CIRCULATION Hepatic portal circulation is a subdivision of sys- temic circulation in which blood from the abdominaldigestive organs and spleen circulates through theliver before returning to the heart. Blood from the capillaries of the stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, and spleen flows into twolarge veins, the superior mesenteric vein and thesplenic vein, which unite to form the portal vein (Fig.13-7). The portal vein takes blood into the liver,where it branches extensively and empties blood intothe sinusoids, the capillaries of the liver (see also Fig.16-6). From the sinusoids, blood flows into hepaticveins, to the inferior vena cava and back to the right atrium. Notice that in this pathway there are two sets of capillaries, and keep in mind that it is in capillariesthat exchanges take place. Let us use some specicexamples to show the purpose and importance of por-tal circulation. Glucose from carbohydrate digestion is absorbed into the capillaries of the small intestine; after a bigmeal this may greatly increase the blood glucose level.If this blood were to go directly back to the heart andthen circulate through the kidneys, some of the glu- cose might be lost in urine. However, blood from thesmall intestine passes rst through the liver sinusoids,and the liver cells remove the excess glucose and storeit as glycogen. The blood that returns to the heart willthen have a blood glucose level in the normal range. Another example: Alcohol is absorbed into the cap- illaries of the stomach. If it were to circulate directlythroughout the body, the alcohol would rapidly impairthe functioning of the brain. Portal circulation, how-ever, takes blood from the stomach to the liver, theorgan that can detoxify the alcohol and prevent itsdetrimental effects on the brain. Of course, if alcoholconsumption continues, the blood alcohol level risesfaster than the liver's capacity to detoxify, and the well-known signs of alcohol intoxication appear. As you can see, this portal circulation pathway enables the liver to modify the blood from the diges-tive organs and spleen. Some nutrients may be storedor changed, bilirubin from the spleen is excreted intobile, and potential poisons are detoxied before theblood returns to the heart and the rest of the body.

The site of exchange between fetus and mother is the placenta , which contains fetal and maternal blood vessels that are very close to oneanother (see Figs. 13-8 and 21-5). The blood of thefetus does not mix with the blood of the mother; sub-stances are exchanged by diffusion and active trans-port mechanisms.The fetus is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord, which contains two umbilical arteriesand one umbilical vein (see Fig. 13-8). The umbilical arteries are branches of the fetal internal iliac arteries; they carry blood from the fetus to the placenta.

The umbilical vein carries this oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus. Within the body of thefetus, the umbilical vein branches: One branch takessome blood to the fetal liver, but most of the bloodpasses through the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava, to the right atrium. After birth, when theumbilical cord is cut, the remnants of these fetal ves-sels constrict and become nonfunctional.

Where is the blood coming from? BOX13-3 PULSE SITES Popliteal \u2014the popliteal the knee.Dorsalis pedis \u2014the dorsalis pedis artery on the top of the foot (commonly called the pedal pulse). Pulse rate is, of course, the heart rate. However, if the heart is beating weakly, a radial pulse may belower than an apical pulse (listening to the heart itself with a stethoscope). This is called a pulse decit and indicates heart disease of some kind. When taking a pulse, the careful observer also notes the rhythm and force of the pulse. Abnormalrhythms may reflect cardiac arrhythmias, and theforce of the pulse (strong or weak) is helpful inassessing the general condition of the heart andarteries.A pulse is the heartbeat that is felt at an arterial site. What is felt is not actually the force exerted by theblood, but the force of ventricular contractiontransmitted through the walls of the arteries. This iswhy pulses are not felt in veins; they are too farfrom the heart for the force to be detectable. The most commonly used pulse sites are: Radial \u2014the radial artery on the thumb side of the wrist.Carotid \u2014the carotid artery lateral to the larynx in the neck.Temporal \u2014the temporal artery just in front of the ear.Femoral \u2014the femoral artery at the top of the thigh.13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 304Fig. 13-8). Because the fetal lungs are deflated and do not provide for gas exchange, blood is shunted awayfrom the lungs and to the body. The foramen ovale is an opening in the interatrial septum that permits someblood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium,not, as usual, to the right ventricle. The blood thatdoes enter the right ventricle is pumped into the pul-monary artery. The ductus arteriosus is a short ves- sel that diverts most of the blood in the pulmonaryartery to the aorta, to the body. Both the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus permit blood to bypassthe fetal lungs. Just after birth, the baby breathes and expands its lungs, which pulls more blood into the pulmonary cir-culation. More blood then returns to the left atrium,and a flap on the left side of the foramen ovale isclosed.

Which way does blood flow through it, and why?13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 305and pulmonary circulation becomes fully functional within a few days. VELOCITY OF BLOOD FLOW The velocity, or speed, with which blood flows differsin the various parts of the vascular system. Velocity isinversely related (meaning as one value goes up, theother goes down) to the cross-sectional area of the particular segment of the vascular system. Refer toFig. 13-9 as you read the following. The aorta receivesall the blood from the left ventricle, its cross-sectionalarea is small, about 3 cm 2(1 sq. inch), and the blood moves very rapidly, at least 30 cm per second (about 12inches). Each time the aorta or any artery branches,the total cross-sectional area becomes larger, and thespeed of blood flow decreases. Think of a river that306 The Vascular System 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 30 20 10 120 100 80 60 40 20 0Blood pressure (mm Hg)Pulse pressureBlood velocity (cm/sec)Cross-sectional Veins of vas- cular system. ( A) Schematic of the branch- ing of vessels. ( B) Cross-sectional area in square centimeters. ( C) Blood velocity in centimeters per second. ( D) Systemic blood pressure changes. Notice that sys-tolic and diastolic pressures become one pressure in the capillaries.QUESTION: Look at the cross-sectional area and blood velocity. As area increases,what happens to velocity? Where is veloc-ity slowest?13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 306begins in a narrow bed and is flowing rapidly. If the river bed widens, the water spreads out to ll it andflows more slowly. If the river were to narrow again,the water would flow faster. This is just what happensin the vascular system. The capillaries in total have the greatest cross- sectional area, and blood velocity there is slowest, lessthan 0.1 cm per second. When capillaries unite toform venules, and then veins, the cross-sectional areadecreases and blood flow speeds up. Recall that it is in capillary networks that exchanges of nutrients, wastes, and gases take place between theblood and tissue fluid. The slow rate of blood flow incapillaries permits sufficient time for these essentialexchanges. Think of a train slowing down (not actuallystopping) at stations to allow people to jump onand off, then speeding up again to get to the next sta-tion. The capillaries are the \"stations\" of the vascularsystem. The more rapid blood velocity in other vessels makes circulation time quite short. This is the time ittakes for blood to go from the right ventricle to thelungs, back to the heart to be pumped by the left ven-tricle to the body, and return to the heart again.Circulation time is about 1 minute or less, and ensuresan adequate exchange of gases. BLOOD PRESSURE Blood pressure is the force the blood exerts against the walls of the blood vessels. Filtration in capillariesdepends upon blood pressure; ltration brings nutri-ents to tissues, and as you will see in Chapter 18, is therst step in the formation of urine. Blood pressure isone of the \"vital signs\" often measured, and indeed anormal blood pressure is essential to life. The pumping of the ventricles creates blood pres- sure, which is measured in mmHg (millimeters ofmercury). When a systemic blood pressure reading istaken, two numbers are obtained: systolic and dias-tolic, as in 110/70 mmHg. Systolic pressure is always the higher of the two and represents the blood pres- sure when the left ventricle is contracting. The lowernumber is the diastolic pressure, when the left ventri- cle is relaxed and does not exert force. Diastolic pres-sure is maintained by the arteries and arterioles and isdiscussed in a later section. Systemic blood pressure is highest in the aorta, which receives all of the blood pumped by the left ven-tricle. As blood travels farther away from the heart, blood pressure decreases (see Fig. 13-9). The brachialartery is most often used to take a blood pressure read-ing; here a normal systolic range is 90 to 120 mmHg,and a normal diastolic range is 60 to 80 mmHg. In thearterioles, blood pressure decreases further, and sys-tolic and diastolic pressures merge into one pressure.At the arterial end of capillary networks, blood pres-sure is about 30 to 35 mmHg, decreasing to 12 to 15mmHg at the venous end of capillaries. This is highenough to permit ltration but low enough to preventrupture of the capillaries. As blood flows throughveins, the pressure decreases further, and in the cavalveins, blood pressure approaches zero as blood entersthe right atrium. The upper limit of the normal blood pressure range is now 120/80 mmHg. The levels of 125 to 139/85 to89 mmHg, once considered high-normal, are nowcalled \"prehypertension,\" that is, with the potential tobecome even higher. A systemic blood pressure con-sistently higher than the normal range is called hyper- tension (see also Box 13-4: Hypertension). A lower than normal blood pressure is called hypotension . The regulation of systemic blood pressure is discussedin a later section. Pulmonary blood pressure is created by the right ventricle, which has relatively thin walls and thus exertsabout one-sixth the force of the left ventricle. Theresult is that pulmonary arterial pressure is always low:20 to 25/8 to 10 mmHg, and in pulmonary capillariesis lower still. This is important to prevent ltration in pulmonary capillaries, which in turn prevents tissuefluid from accumulating in the alveoli of the lungs. MAINTENANCE OF SYSTEMIC BLOOD PRESSURE Because blood pressure is so important, many physio- logical factors and processes interact to keep bloodpressure within normal limits: 1.Venous return \u2014the amount of blood that returns to the heart by way of the veins. Venous returnis important because the heart can pump onlythe blood it receives. If venous return decreases,the cardiac muscle bers will not be stretched, theforce of ventricular systole will decrease (Starling'slaw), and blood pressure will decrease. This is whatmight happen following a severe hemorrhage. When the body is horizontal, venous return can be maintained fairly easily, but when the body isThe Vascular System 30713Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 307vertical, gravity must be overcome to return blood from the lower body to the heart. Three mecha-nisms help promote venous return: constriction ofveins, the skeletal muscle pump, and the respira-tory pump. Veins contain smooth muscle, which enables them to constrict and force blood toward the heart;the valves prevent backflow of blood. The secondmechanism is the skeletal muscle pump , which is especially effective for the deep veins of the legs.These veins are surrounded by skeletal musclesthat contract and relax during normal activitiessuch as walking. Contractions of the leg musclessqueeze the veins to force blood toward the heart.The third mechanism is the respiratory pump , which affects veins that pass through the chest cav-ity. The pressure changes of inhalation and exhala-tion alternately expand and compress the veins, andblood is returned to the heart.2.Heart rate and force \u2014in general, if heart rate and force increase, blood pressure increases; this iswhat happens during exercise. However, if theheart is beating extremely rapidly, the ventriclesmay not ll completely between beats, and cardiacoutput and blood pressure will decrease. 3.Peripheral resistance \u2014this term refers to the resistance the vessels offer to the flow of blood.The arteries and veins are usually slightly con-stricted, which maintains normal diastolic bloodpressure. It may be helpful to think of the vesselsas the \"container\" for the blood. If a person's bodyhas 5 liters of blood, the \"container\" must besmaller in order for the blood to exert a pressureagainst its walls. This is what normal vasoconstric-tion does: It makes the container (the vessels)smaller than the volume of blood so that the bloodwill exert pressure even when the left ventricle isrelaxed.308 The Vascular System BOX13-4 HYPERTENSION trophy . This abnormal growth of the myocardium, however, is not accompanied by a correspondinggrowth in coronary capillaries, and the blood supplyof the left ventricle may not be adequate for all sit-uations. Exercise, for example, puts furtherdemands on the heart, and the person may experi-ence angina due to a lack of oxygen or a myocar-dial infarction if there is a severe oxygen deciency. Although several different kinds of medications (diuretics, vasodilators) are used to treat hyperten-sion, people with moderate hypertension may limittheir dependence on medications by following cer-tain guidelines: 1. Don't smoke, because nicotine stimulates vaso- constriction, which raises BP. Smoking also dam-ages arteries, contributing to arteriosclerosis. 2. Lose weight if overweight. A weight loss of as lit- tle as 10 pounds can lower BP. A diet high in fruits and vegetables may, for some people, con-tribute to lower BP. 3. Cut salt intake in half. Although salt consump- tion may not be the cause of hypertension, reducing salt intake may help lower blood pres-sure by decreasing blood volume. 4. Exercise on a regular basis. A moderate amount of aerobic exercise (such as a half hour walkevery day) is benecial for the entire cardiovas-cular system and may also contribute to weightloss.Hypertension is high blood pressure, that is, a rest- ing systemic pressure consistently above the normalrange (90 to 120/60 to 80 mmHg). Clinicians nowconsider 125 to 139/85 to 89 mmHg to be prehy-pertension. A systolic reading of 140 to 159 mmHgor a diastolic reading of 90 to 99 mmHg may becalled stage 1 hypertension, and a systolic readingabove 160 mmHg or a diastolic reading above 100mmHg may be called stage 2 hypertension. The term \"essential hypertension\" means that no specic cause can be determined; most cases are inthis category. For some people, however, an over-production of renin by the kidneys is the causeof their hypertension. Excess renin increases theproduction of angiotensin II, which raises bloodpressure. Although hypertension often produces nosymptoms, the long-term consequences may bevery serious. Chronic hypertension has its greatesteffects on the arteries and on the heart. Although the walls of arteries are strong, hyper- tension weakens them and contributes to arte-riosclerosis. Such weakened arteries may rupture ordevelop aneurysms, which may in turn lead to aCVA or kidney damage. Hypertension affects the heart because the left ventricle must now pump blood against the higherarterial pressure. The left ventricle works harderand, like any other muscle, enlarges as more work isdemanded; this is called left ventricular hyper-13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 308If more vasoconstriction occurs, blood pressure will increase (the container has become evensmaller). This is what happens in a stress situation,when greater vasoconstriction is brought aboutby sympathetic impulses. If vasodilation occurs,blood pressure will decrease (the container islarger). After eating a large meal, for example, thereis extensive vasodilation in the digestive tract tosupply more oxygenated blood for digestive activi-ties. T o keep blood pressure within the normalrange, vasoconstriction must, and does, occur else-where in the body. This is why strenuous exerciseshould be avoided right after eating; there is notenough blood to completely supply oxygen to exer-cising muscles and an active digestive tract at thesame time. 4.Elasticity of the large arteries \u2014when the left ventricle contracts, the blood that enters the largearteries stretches their walls. The arterial walls areelastic and absorb some of the force. When the leftventricle relaxes, the arterial walls recoil or snapback, which helps keep diastolic pressure withinthe normal range. Normal elasticity, therefore,lowers systolic pressure, raises diastolic pressure,and maintains a normal pulse pressure. (Pulse pres-sure is the difference between systolic and diastolicpressure. The usual ratio of systolic to diastolic topulse pressure is approximately 3:2:1. For example,with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, the pulsepressure is 40, and the ratio is 120:80:40, or 3:2:1.) 5.Viscosity of the blood \u2014normal blood viscosity depends upon the presence of red blood cells andplasma proteins, especially albumin. Having toomany red blood cells is rare but does occur in thedisorder called polycythemia vera and in peoplewho are heavy smokers. This will increase bloodviscosity and blood pressure. A decreased number of red blood cells, as is seen with severe anemia, or decreased albumin, as mayoccur in liver disease or kidney disease, willdecrease blood viscosity and blood pressure. Inthese situations, other mechanisms such as vaso-constriction will maintain blood pressure as close tonormal as is possible. 6.Loss of blood \u2014a small loss of blood, as when donating a pint of blood, will cause a temporarydrop in blood pressure followed by rapid compen-sation in the form of a more rapid heart rate andgreater vasoconstriction. After a severe hemor-rhage, however, these compensating mechanismsmay not be sufficient to maintain normal bloodpressure and blood flow to the brain. Although a person may survive loss of 50% of the body's totalblood, the possibility of brain damage increases asmore blood is lost and not rapidly replaced. 7.Hormones \u2014several hormones have effects on blood pressure. You may recall them from Chapters10 and 12, but we will summarize them here and inFig. 13-10. The adrenal blood pressure. Epinephrine also causes vaso-constriction, and increases heart rate and force ofcontraction, both of which increase blood pressure. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland when the water content ofthe body decreases. ADH increases the reabsorp-tion of water by the kidneys to prevent further lossof water in urine and a further decrease in bloodpressure. Aldosterone, a hormone from the adrenal cor- tex, has a similar effect on blood volume. Whenblood pressure decreases, secretion of aldosteronestimulates the reabsorption of Na /H11001ions by the kid- neys. Water follows sodium back to the blood,which maintains blood volume to prevent a furtherdrop in blood pressure. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), secreted by the atria of the functions in opposition to aldos-terone. ANP increases the excretion of Na /H11001ions and water by the kidneys, which decreases bloodvolume and lowers blood pressure. DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW An individual's blood volume remains relatively con-stant within the normal range appropriate to the sizeof the person. Active tissues, however, require moreblood, that is, more oxygen, than do less active tissues.As active tissues and organs receive a greater propor-tion of the total blood flow, less active organs mustreceive less, or blood pressure will decrease markedly. As mentioned previously, precapillary sphincters dilate in active tissues and constrict in less active ones.The arterioles also constrict to reduce blood flow toless active organs. This ensures that metabolicallyactive organs will receive enough oxygen to functionproperly and that blood pressure for the body as awhole will be maintained within normal limits. An example will be helpful here; let us use the body at rest and the body during exercise. ConsultFig. 13-11 as you read the following. Resting cardiacThe Vascular System 30913Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 309output is approximately 5000 mL per minute. Exercise cardiac output is three times that, about 15,000 mLper minute. Keep in mind that the volume of blood isthe same in both cases, but that during exercise theblood is being circulated more rapidly. Compare the amounts of blood flowing to various organs and tissues during exercise and at rest. Duringexercise, the heart receives about three times as muchblood as it does when the body is at rest. The veryactive skeletal muscles receive about ten times as muchblood. The skin, as an organ of heat loss, receivesabout four times as much blood. Other organs, how-ever, can function adequately with less blood. Bloodflow is reduced to the digestive tract, to the kidneys,and to other parts of the body such as bones. When the exercise ceases, cardiac output will gradually return to the resting level, as will blood flowto the various organs. These changes in the distribu-tion of blood ensure sufficient oxygen for active tissues and an appropriate blood pressure for the body as awhole. REGULATION OF BLOOD PRESSURE The mechanisms that regulate systemic blood pressuremay be divided into two types: intrinsic mechanismsand nervous mechanisms. The nervous mechanismsinvolve the nervous system, and the intrinsic mecha-nisms do not require nerve impulses. INTRINSIC MECHANISMS The term intrinsic means \"within.\" Intrinsic mecha- nisms work because of the internal characteristics ofcertain organs. The rst such organ is the heart. of water rate force of contractionVasoconstriction Raises B.P. Lowers B.P. Figure 13-10. Hormones that affect blood pressure. See text for further description. QUESTION: Which two hormones have opposite functions, and what are these functions?13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 310venous return increases, cardiac muscle bers are stretched, and the ventricles pump more forcefully(Starling's law). Thus, cardiac output and blood pres-sure increase. This is what happens during exercise,when a higher blood pressure is needed. When exer-cise ends and venous return decreases, the heart pumpsless forcefully, which helps return blood pressure to anormal resting level. The second intrinsic mechanism involves the kid- neys. When blood flow through the kidneys decreases,the process of ltration decreases and less urine isformed. This decrease in urinary output preservesblood volume so that it does not decrease further.Following severe hemorrhage or any other type ofdehydration, this is very important to maintain bloodpressure. The kidneys are also involved in the renin-angiotensin mechanism . When blood pressure decreases, the kidneys secrete the enzyme renin , which initiates a series of reactions that result in theformation of angiotensin II . These reactions are described in T able 13-3 and depicted in Fig. 13-12.Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and stimulatessecretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, both ofwhich will increase blood pressure. NERVOUS MECHANISMS The medulla and the autonomic nervous system aredirectly involved in the regulation of blood pressure.The rst of these nervous mechanisms concerns theheart; this was described previously, so we will notreview it here but refer you to Chapter 12 and Fig.12-7, as well as Fig. 13-13.The Vascular System 311 Skeletal muscleBlood distribution (mL/min) Resting cardiac output 5,000 mL/minExercise cardiac output 15,000 mL/min Heart Brain Skin GI tract Kidneys Rest of body Resting 215 mL % of total % of totalExercise1,035 mL 645 mL 430 mL 1,205 mL 950 mL 515 mL 645 mL 10,710 mL 645 mL 1,635 mL 510 mL flow through various organs when the body is at rest and during exercise. For each organ, the percentage of the total blood flow is given.QUESTION: During exercise, which organs have the greatest increase in blood flow? Which organs have the greatest decrease?13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 311The second nervous mechanism involves periph- eral resistance, that is, the degree of constriction of thearteries and arterioles and, to a lesser extent, the veins(see Fig. 13-13). The medulla contains the vasomotorcenter , which consists of a vasoconstrictor area and a vasodilator area. The vasodilator area may depress thevasoconstrictor area to bring about vasodilation,which will decrease blood pressure. The vasoconstric-tor area may bring about more vasoconstriction byway of the sympathetic division of the autonomicnervous system. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor bers innervate the smooth muscle of all arteries and veins, and severalimpulses per second along these bers maintain nor-mal vasoconstriction. More impulses per second bringabout greater vasoconstriction, and fewer impulses per second cause vasodilation. The medulla receives the information to make such changes from the presso-receptors in the carotid sinuses and the aortic sinus.The inability to maintain normal blood pressure is oneaspect of circulatory shock (see Box 13-5: CirculatoryShock).312 Decreased B. 13-12.

The cholesterol depositsof atherosclerosis are to be expected with advancingage, with the most serious consequences in the coro-nary arteries. A certain degree of arteriosclerosis is tobe expected, and average resting blood pressure mayincrease, which further damages arterial walls.Consequences include stroke and left-sided heartfailure. The veins also deteriorate with age; their thin walls weaken and stretch, making their valves incompetent.This is most likely to occur in the veins of the legs;their walls are subject to great pressure as blood isreturned to the heart against the force of gravity. Varicose veins and phlebitis are more likely to occuramong elderly people. SUMMARY Although the vascular system does form passagewaysfor the blood, you can readily see that the blood ves-sels are not simply pipes through which the bloodflows. The vessels are not passive tubes, but ratheractive contributors to homeostasis. The arteries andveins help maintain blood pressure, and the capillariesprovide sites for the exchanges of materials betweenthe blood and the tissues. Some very important sites ofexchange are discussed in the following chapters: thelungs, the digestive tract, and the kidneys.314 The Vascular System BOX13-5 CIRCULATORY SHOCK Stages of Shock Compensated shock \u2014the responses by the body maintain cardiac output. Following a small hemor-rhage, for example, the heart rate increases,the blood vessels constrict, and the kidneysdecrease urinary output to conserve water. Theseresponses help preserve blood volume and main-tain blood pressure, cardiac output, and blood flowto tissues.Progressive shock \u2014the state of shock leads to more shock. Following a severe hemorrhage, car-diac output decreases and the myocardium itself isdeprived of blood. The heart weakens, which fur-ther decreases cardiac output. Arteries that aredeprived of their blood supply cannot remain con-stricted. As the arteries dilate, venous returndecreases, which in turn decreases cardiac output.Progressive shock is a series of such vicious cycles,and medical intervention is required to restore car-diac output to normal.Irreversible shock \u2014no amount of medical assis- tance can restore cardiac output to normal. Theusual cause of death is that the heart has been dam-aged too much to recover. A severe myocardialinfarction, massive hemorrhage, or septicemia mayall be fatal despite medical treatment.Circulatory shock is any condition in which cardiac output decreases to the extent that tissues aredeprived of oxygen and waste products accumulate. Causes of Shock Cardiogenic shock occurs most often after a severe myocardial infarction but may also be theresult of ventricular brillation. In either case, theheart is no longer an efficient pump, and cardiacoutput decreases. Hypovolemic shock is the result of decreased blood volume, often due to severe hemorrhage.Other possible causes are extreme sweating (heatstroke) or extreme loss of water through the kid-neys (diuresis) or intestines (diarrhea). In thesesituations, the heart simply does not have enoughblood to pump, and cardiac output decreases.Anaphylactic shock, also in this category, is a mas-sive allergic reaction in which great amounts ofhistamine increase capillary permeability andvasodilation throughout the body. Much plasma isthen lost to tissue spaces, which decreases bloodvolume, blood pressure, and cardiac output. Septic shock is the result of septicemia, the presence of bacteria in the blood. The bacteria anddamaged tissues release inflammatory chemicalsthat cause vasodilation and extensive loss plasmainto tissue spaces.13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 314The vascular system consists of the arteries, capillaries, and veins through which bloodtravels. Arteries (and arterioles) (see Fig. 13-1) 1. Carry blood from the heart to capillaries; three lay- ers in their walls. 2. Inner layer (tunica intima): simple squamous epithelial tissue (endothelium), very smooth abnormal blood clotting; secretes nitric oxide(NO), a vasodilator. 3. layer (tunica smooth and elastic connective tissue; contributes to mainte-nance of diastolic blood Outer layer (tunica externa): brous connective tis- sue to prevent rupture. or dilation is regulated by the auto- nomic nervous system. Veins (and venules) (see Fig. 13-1) 1. Carry blood from capillaries to the heart; three lay- ers in walls. 2. Inner layer: endothelium folded into valves to pre- vent the backflow of blood. 3. Middle layer: thin smooth muscle, because veins are not as important in the maintenance of BP . 4. Outer layer: thin brous connective tissue because veins do not carry blood under high pressure. Anastomoses\u2014connections between vessels of the same type1. Provide alternate pathways for blood flow if one vessel is blocked. 2. Arterial anastomoses provide for blood flow to the capillaries of an organ (e.g., circle of Willis to thebrain). 3. Venous anastomoses provide for return of blood to the heart and are most numerous in veins of thelegs. Capillaries (see Figs. 13-1 and 13-2) 1. Carry blood from arterioles to venules.2. Walls are one cell thick (simple squamous epithelial tissue) to permit exchanges between blood and tis-sue fluid. 3. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged by diffusion.4. BP in capillaries brings nutrients to tissues and forms tissue fluid in the process of ltration. 5. Albumin in the blood provides colloid osmotic pressure, which pulls waste products and tissue fluidinto capillaries. The return of tissue fluid maintainsblood volume and BP . 6. Precapillary sphincters regulate blood flow into capillary networks based on tissue needs; in activetissues they dilate; in less active tissues they con-strict. 7. Sinusoids are very permeable capillaries found in the liver, spleen, pituitary gland, and red bone mar-row to permit proteins and blood cells to enter orleave the blood. Pathways of Circulation 1. Pulmonary: Right ventricle pulmonary artery pulmonary capillaries (exchange of gases) pul- monary veins left atrium. 2. Systemic: left ventricle aorta capillaries in body tissues superior and inferior caval veins right atrium (see T able 13-1 and Fig. 13-3 for sys-temic arteries and T able 13-2 and Fig. 13-4 for sys-temic veins). 3. Hepatic portal circulation: blood from the diges- tive organs and spleen flows through the portalvein to the liver before returning to the heart.Purpose: the liver stores some nutrients or regu-lates their blood levels and detoxies potential poi-sons before blood enters the rest of peripheralcirculation (see Fig. 13-7). Fetal Circulation\u2014the fetus depends on the mother for oxygen and nutrients and for theremoval of waste products (see Fig. 13-8)1. The placenta is the site of exchange between fetal blood and maternal blood. 2. Umbilical arteries (two) carry blood from the fetus to the placenta, where CO 2and waste products enter maternal circulation. 3. The umbilical vein carries blood with O2and nutri- ents from the placenta to the fetus. 4. The umbilical vein branches; some blood flows through the fetal liver; most blood flowsthrough the ductus venosus to the fetal inferiorvena cava. 5. foramen ovale permits blood to theThe Vascular System 315 STUDY OUTLINE13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM Page 315right atrium to the left atrium to bypass the fetal lungs. 6. The ductus arteriosus permits blood to flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta to bypass thefetal lungs. 7. These fetal structures become nonfunctional after birth, when the umbilical cord is cut and breathingtakes place. Velocity of Blood Flow (see Fig. 13-9) 1. Velocity is inversely related to the cross-sectional area of a segment of the vascular system. 2. The total capillaries have the greatest cross- sectional area and slowest blood flow. 3. Slow flow in the capillaries is important to permit sufficient time for exchange of gases, nutrients, andwastes. Blood Pressure (BP)\u2014the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood ves-sels (Fig. 13-9)1. BP is measured in mmHg: systolic/diastolic. Systolic occurs during ventricular con-traction; diastolic pressure occurs during ventricu-lar relaxation. 2. Normal range of systemic arterial BP: 90 to 120/60 to 80 mmHg. 3. BP in capillaries is 30 to 35 mmHg at the arterial end and 12 to 15 mmHg at the venous end\u2014highenough to permit ltration but low enough to pre-vent rupture of the capillaries. 4. BP decreases in the veins and approaches zero in the caval veins. 5. Pulmonary BP is always low (the right ventricle pumps with less force): 20 to 25/8 to 10 mmHg.This low BP prevents ltration and accumulationof tissue fluid in the alveoli. Maintenance of Systemic BP 1. Venous return\u2014the amount of blood that returns to the heart. If venous return decreases, the heartcontracts less forcefully (Starling's law) and BPdecreases. The mechanisms that maintain venousreturn when the body is vertical are: Constriction of veins with the valves preventing backflow of blood Skeletal muscle pump\u2014contraction of skeletal muscles, especially in the legs, squeezes the deepveins Respiratory pump\u2014the pressure changes of inhalation and exhalation expand and compressthe veins in the chest cavity 2. Heart rate and force\u2014if heart rate and force increase, BP increases. 3. Peripheral resistance\u2014the resistance of the arteries and arterioles to the flow of blood. These vesselsare usually slightly constricted to maintain normaldiastolic BP . Greater vasoconstriction will increaseBP; vasodilation will decrease BP . In the body,vasodilation in one area requires vasoconstrictionin another area to maintain normal BP . 4. Elasticity of the large arteries\u2014ventricular systole stretches the walls of large arteries, which recoilduring diastole. Normal elasticity pressure. 5. Viscosity of blood\u2014depends on RBCs and plasma proteins, especially albumin. Severe anemia tendsto decrease BP . Deciency of albumin as in liver orkidney disease tends to decrease BP . In these cases,compensation such as greater vasoconstriction willkeep BP close to normal. 6. Loss of blood\u2014a small loss will be rapidly com- pensated for by faster heart rate and greater vaso-constriction. After severe hemorrhage, thesemechanisms may not be sufficient to maintain nor-mal 7. Hormones\u2014(see BP; (b)epinephrine increases cardiac output and raises BP;(c) ADH increases water reabsorption by the kid-neys, which increases blood volume and BP; (d)aldosterone increases reabsorption of Na /H11001ions by the kidneys; water follows Na/H11001and increases blood volume and BP; (e) ANP increases excretion ofNa /H11001ions and water by the kidneys, which de- creases blood volume and BP . Distribution of Blood Flow 1. Metabolically active tissues require more oxygen, and receive a greater proportion of the blood vol-ume as it circulates (see Fig. 13-11). 2. Blood flow is increased by the dilation of arterioles and precapillary sphincters. 3. In less active tissues, arterioles and precapillary sphincters constrict. 4. Organs receive sufficient oxygen, and BP for the body is maintained within the normal range.316 The Vascular System13Scanlon(p3)-ch13 8/17/06 10:54 AM nervous mechanismsIntrinsic Mechanisms1. The heart\u2014responds to increased venous return by pumping more forcefully (Starling's law), whichincreases cardiac output and BP . 2. The kidneys\u2014decreased blood flow decreases ltration, which decreases urinary output to pre-serve blood volume. Decreased BP stimulates thekidneys to secrete renin, which initiates the renin-angiotensin mechanism (T able 13-3 and Fig.13-12) that results in the formation of angiotensinII, which causes vasoconstriction and stimulatessecretion of aldosterone.Nervous Mechanisms (see Fig. 13-13) 1. Heart rate and force\u2014see also Chapter 12.2. Peripheral resistance\u2014the medulla contains the vasomotor center, which consists of a vasoconstric-tor area and a vasodilator area. The vasodilator areabrings about vasodilation by suppressing the vaso-constrictor area. The vasoconstrictor area main-tains normal vasoconstriction by generating severalimpulses per second along sympathetic vaso-constrictor bers to all arteries and veins. Moreimpulses per second increase vasoconstriction andraise BP; fewer impulses per second bring aboutvasodilation and a drop in BP . The Vascular System 317 REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

Is this likely to be a life-threatening injury? Probably not, eventhough the breaks in the skin have permitted the entryof thousands or even millions of bacteria. Those bac-teria, however, will be quickly destroyed by the cellsand organs of the lymphatic system. Although the lymphatic system may be considered part of the circulatory system, we will consider it sep-arately because its functions are so different fromthose of the heart and blood vessels. Keep in mind,however, that all of these functions are interdepend-ent. The lymphatic system is responsible for returningtissue fluid to the blood and for protecting the bodyagainst foreign material. The parts of the lymphaticsystem are the lymph, the system of lymph vessels, andlymphatic tissue, which includes lymph nodes andnodules, the spleen, and the thymus gland. LYMPH Lymph is the name for tissue fluid that enters lymph capillaries. As you may recall from Chapter 13, ltra-tion in capillaries creates tissue fluid from bloodplasma, most of which returns almost immediately tothe blood in the capillaries by osmosis. Some tissuefluid, however, remains in interstitial spaces and mustbe returned to the blood by way of the lymphatic ves-sels. Without this return, blood volume and blood pressure would very soon decrease. The relationship of the lymphatic vessels to the cardiovascular system isdepicted in Fig. 14-1. LYMPH VESSELS The system of lymph vessels begins as dead-endlymph capillaries found in most tissue spaces (Fig. 14-2). Lymph capillaries are very permeable and col-lect tissue fluid and proteins. Lacteals are specialized lymph capillaries in the villi of the small intestine; theyabsorb the fat-soluble end products of digestion, suchas fatty acids and vitamins A, D, E, and K. Lymph capillaries unite to form larger lymph ves- sels, whose structure is very much like that of veins.There is no pump for lymph (as the heart is the pump for blood), but the lymph is kept moving within lymph vessels by the same mechanisms that promote venousreturn. The smooth muscle layer of the larger lymph vessels constricts, and the one-way valves (just likethose of veins) prevent backflow of lymph. Lymph ves-sels in the extremities, especially the legs, are com-pressed by the skeletal muscles that surround them;this is the skeletal muscle pump . The respiratory pump alternately expands and compresses the lymph vessels in the chest cavity and keeps the lymph moving. Where is the lymph going? Back to the blood to become plasma again. Refer to Fig. 14-3 as you readthe following. The lymph vessels from the lower bodyunite in front of the lumbar vertebrae to form a vesselcalled the cisterna chyli , which continues upward in front of the backbone as the thoracic duct . Lymph vessels from the upper left quadrant of the body jointhe thoracic duct, which empties lymph into the leftsubclavian vein. Lymph vessels from the upper rightquadrant of the body unite to form the right lymphaticduct, which empties lymph into the right subclavianvein. Flaps in both subclavian veins permit the entry oflymph but prevent blood from flowing into the lymphvessels. LYMPHATIC TISSUE Lymphatic tissue consists mainly of lymphocytes in amesh-like framework of connective tissue. Recall thatmost lymphocytes are produced from stem cells in thered bone marrow, then migrate to the lymph nodesand nodules, to the spleen, and to the thymus. In thesestructures, lymphocytes become activated and prolif-erate in response to infection (this is a function of alllymphatic tissue). The thymus has stem cells that pro-duce a signicant portion of the T lymphocytes. LYMPH NODES AND NODULES Lymph nodes and nodules are masses of lymphatic tissue. Nodes and nodules differ with respect to sizeand location. Nodes are usually larger, 10 to 20 mm inlength, and are encapsulated; nodules range from afraction of a millimeter to several millimeters in lengthand do not have capsules. Lymph nodes are found in groups along the path- ways of lymph vessels, and lymph flows through thesenodes on its way to the subclavian veins. Lymph entersa node through several afferent lymph vessels and322 The Lymphatic System and Immunity14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 322leaves through one or two efferent vessels (Fig. 14-4). As lymph passes through a lymph node, bacteria andother foreign materials are phagocytized by xed (sta-tionary) macrophages . Plasma cells develop from lymphocytes exposed to pathogens in the lymph and produce antibodies. These antibodies will eventuallyreach the blood and circulate throughout the body. There are many groups of lymph nodes along all the lymph vessels throughout the body, but threepaired groups deserve mention because of their strate-gic locations. These are the cervical , axillary , and inguinal lymph nodes (see Fig. 14-3). Notice that these are at the junctions of the head and extremitieswith the trunk of the body. Breaks in the skin, withentry of pathogens, are much more likely to occur inthe arms or legs or head rather than in the trunk. Ifthese pathogens get to the lymph, they will bedestroyed by the lymph nodes before they get to thetrunk, before the lymph is returned to the blood in thesubclavian veins.The Lymphatic System and Immunity 323 Subclavian vein Lymphatic vessel Valve Heart Lymph flowLymph node Blood flow Lymph capillaries Blood capillariesFigure 14-1. Relationship of lym- phatic vessels to the cardiovascularsystem. Lymph capillaries collect tis-sue fluid, which is returned to the blood. The arrows indicate the direc- tion of flow of the blood and lymph.QUESTION: To which large veins is lymph returned, and why is thisreturn important?14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 323You may be familiar with the expression \"swollen glands,\" as when a child has a strep throat (an inflam-mation of the pharynx caused by Streptococcus bacteria). These \"glands\" are the cervical lymph nodes that haveenlarged as their macrophages attempt to destroy thebacteria in the lymph from the pharynx (see Box 14-1:Hodgkin's Disease). Lymph nodules are small masses of lymphatic tis- sue found just beneath the epithelium of all mucous membranes . The body systems lined with mucous membranes are those that have openings to the envi-ronment: the respiratory, digestive, urinary, and repro-ductive tracts. You can probably see that these are alsostrategic locations for lymph nodules, because any nat-ural body opening is a possible portal of entry forpathogens. For example, if bacteria in inhaled air getthrough the epithelium of the trachea, lymph noduleswith their macrophages are in position to destroy thesebacteria before they get to the blood. Some of the lymph nodules have specic names. Those of the small intestine are called Peyer's patches , and those of the pharynx are called tonsils . The palatine tonsils are lateral walls thepharynx, the adenoid (pharyngeal tonsil) is on the pos-terior wall, and the lingual tonsils are on the base ofthe tongue. The tonsils, therefore, form a ring of lym-phatic tissue around the pharynx, which is a commonpathway for food and air and for the pathogens theycontain. A tonsillectomy is the surgical removal of the palatine tonsils and the adenoid and may be per-formed if the tonsils are chronically inflamed andswollen, as may happen in children. As mentioned ear-lier, the body has redundant structures to help ensuresurvival if one structure is lost or seriously impaired.Thus, there are many other lymph nodules in thepharynx to take over the function of the surgicallyremoved tonsils. SPLEEN The spleen is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm, behindthe stomach. The lower rib cage protects the spleenfrom physical trauma (see Fig. 14-3). In the fetus, the spleen produces red blood cells, a function assumed by the red bone marrow after birth.After birth the spleen is very much like a large lymphnode, except that its functions affect the blood thatflows through it rather than lymph. The functions of the spleen after birth are: 1. Contains plasma cells that produce antibodies to foreign antigens. 2. Contains xed macrophages (RE cells) that phago- cytize pathogens or other foreign material in theblood. The macrophages of the spleen also phago-cytize old red blood cells and form bilirubin. Byway of portal circulation, the bilirubin is sent to theliver for excretion in bile. 3. Stores platelets and destroys them when they are no longer useful. The spleen is not considered a vital organ, because other organs compensate for its functions if the spleenmust be removed. The liver and red bone marrowwill remove old red blood cells and platelets from cir-culation. The many lymph nodes and nodules willphagocytize pathogens (as will the liver) and have lym-phocytes to be activated and plasma cells to produceantibodies. Despite this redundancy, a person withouta spleen is somewhat more susceptible to certain bac-terial infections such as pneumonia and meningitis. THYMUS The thymus is located inferior to the thyroid gland. In the fetus and infant, the thymus is large and extendsunder the sternum (Fig. 14-5). With increasing age,the thymus shrinks, and relatively little thymus tissueis found in adults, though it is still active.324 The Lymphatic System and Immunity Tissue fluid CellsLymph capillary Venule Blood capillaryArteriole Figure 14-2.

Thymic hormones are necessary for whatmay be called \"immunological competence.\" T o becompetent means to be able to do something well.The thymic hormones enable the T cells to participatein the recognition of foreign antigens and to provideimmunity. This capability of T cells is establishedearly in life and then is perpetuated by the lympho-cytes themselves. The newborn's immune system is not yet fully mature, and infants are more susceptibleto certain infections than are older children andadults. Usually by the age of 2 years, the immune sys-tem matures and becomes fully functional. This is whysome vaccines, such as the measles vaccine, are notrecommended for infants younger than 15 to 18months of age. Their immune systems are not matureenough to respond strongly to the vaccine, and the326 The Lymphatic System and Immunity Afferent lymphatic Neutrophil cell MacrophageAntibody molecule (enlarged) Antigen (enlarged)A B Figure 14-4.

IMMUNITY Immunity may be dened as the ability to destroy pathogens or other foreign material and to preventfurther cases of certain infectious diseases. This abilityis of vital importance because the body is exposed topathogens from the moment of birth.Antigens are chemical markers that identify cells. Human cells have their own antigens that identify allthe cells in an individual as \"self \" (recall the HLAtypes mentioned in Chapter 11). When antigens areforeign, or \"non-self,\" they may be recognized as suchand destroyed. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoaare all foreign antigens that activate immune re-sponses, as are cell products such as bacterial toxins. Malignant cells, which may be formed within the body as a result of mutations of normal cells, are alsorecognized as foreign and are usually destroyed beforethey can establish themselves and cause cancer. Unfor-tunately, organ transplants are also foreign tissue, andthe immune system may reject (destroy) a transplantedkidney or heart. Sometimes the immune system mis-takenly reacts to part of the body itself and causesan autoimmune disease; several of these were men-tioned in previous chapters. Most often, however, theimmune mechanisms function to protect the bodyfrom the microorganisms around us and within us. Immunity has two main components: innate immu- nity and adaptive immunity. Before we describe eachcomponent, a brief general comparison may be help-ful. Innate immunity may be called nonspecic, doesnot create memory, and its responses are always thesame regardless of the target. Adaptive immunity isvery specic as to its target, may involve antibodies,does create memory, and may become more efficient.Both kinds of immunity work together to preventdamage and disease. INNATE IMMUNITY Innate immunity has several aspects: anatomic andphysiological barriers, phagocytic and other defensivecells, and chemical secretions and reactions, includinginflammation. These are not separate and distinct;rather there is a great deal of overlap among them, asyou will see. The innate immune responses are alwaysthe same, and their degree of efficiency does notincrease with repeated exposure. Barriers The stratum corneum of the epidermis of the skin isnon-living, and when unbroken is an excellent barrierto pathogens of all kinds. The fatty acids in sebumhelp limit the growth of bacteria on the skin. The liv-ing cells of the epidermis produce defensins, digestive, urinary, and reproductivetracts are living tissue, yet still a good barrier. TheThe Lymphatic System and Immunity 327 BOX14-1 HODGKIN'S DISEASE Hodgkin's disease is a malignant disorder of the lymph nodes; the cause is not known. Therst symptom is usually a swollen but painlesslymph node, often in the cervical region. Theindividual is prompted to seek medical attentionbecause of other symptoms: chronic fever,fatigue, and weight loss. The diagnosis involvesbiopsy of the lymph node and the nding ofcharacteristic cells. Treatment of Hodgkin's disease requires chemotherapy, radiation, or both. With earlydiagnosis and proper treatment, this malignancyis very often curable. Trachea Clavicle First rib Thymus gland Figure 14-5. Location of the thymus in a young child.

Dust and pathogens aretrapped on the mucus, the cilia sweep the mucus to thepharynx, and it is swallowed. The hydrochloric acid ofthe gastric juice destroys most pathogens that enterthe stomach, either in mucus or with food and drink.Lysozyme, an enzyme found in saliva and tears,inhibits the growth of bacteria in the oral cavity andon the warm, wet surface of the eye. The subcuta-neous tissue contains many white blood cells (WBCs),as does the areolar connective tissue below the epithe-lium of mucous membranes. Defensive Cells Recall from Chapter 11 that many of our defensivecells are white blood cells. Macrophages, both xedand wandering, have receptors for the pathogenshumans are likely to encounter (this probably reflectsmillions of years of coexistence) and are very efficientphagocytes. Other cells capable of phagocytosis ofpathogens or other foreign antigens are the neutro-phils and, to a lesser extent, the eosinophils. Phago-cytic cells use intracellular enzymes and chemicalssuch as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to destroy ingested pathogens. The Langerhans cells of the skin, and other den- dritic cells throughout the body, also phagocytize for-eign material, not merely to destroy it, but to take it toa lymph node where the lymphocytes of adaptiveimmune mechanisms are then activated. The macro-phages are also involved in activating these lympho-cytes. This is a very important link between the twocomponents of immunity. Natural killer cells (NK cells) circulate in the blood but are also found in the red bone marrow,spleen, and lymph nodes. They are a small portion(about 10%) of the total lymphocytes, but are able todestroy many kinds of pathogens and tumor cells. NKcells make direct contact with foreign cells, and killthem by rupturing their cell membranes (with chemi-cals called perforins) or by inflicting some other kindof chemical damage. Basophils and mast cells (a type of connective tissue cell) are also defensive cells that are found throughoutareolar connective tissue. They produce histamine andleukotrienes. Histamine ofinflammation. Leukotrienes also increase capillarypermeability and attract phagocytic cells to the area.Chemical Defenses Chemicals that help the body resist infection includethe interferons, complement, and the chemicalsinvolved in inflammation. The interferons (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-interferons) are proteins producedby cells infected with viruses and by T cells. Virusesmust be inside a living cell to reproduce, and althoughinterferon cannot prevent the entry of viruses intocells, it does block their reproduction. When viralreproduction is blocked, the viruses cannot infect newcells and cause disease. Interferon is probably a factorin the self-limiting nature of many viral diseases (andis used in the treatment of some diseases, such as hep-atitis C). Complement is a group of more than 20 plasma proteins that circulate in the blood until activated.They are involved in the lysis of cellular antigens andthe labeling of in inflammation; othersattract WBCs to the site. Inflammation is a general response to damage of any kind: microbial, chemical, or physical. Basophilsand mast cells release histamine and leukotrienes,which affect blood vessels as previously described.Vasodilation increases blood flow to the damaged area,and capillaries become more permeable; tissue fluidand WBCs collect at the site. The purpose of inflam-mation is to try to contain the damage, keep it fromspreading, eliminate the cause, and permit repair of thetissue to begin. From even this brief description youcan see why the four signs of inflammation are redness,heat, swelling, and pain: redness from greater bloodflow, heat from the blood and greater metabolic activ-ity, swelling from the accumulation of tissue fluid, andpain from the damage itself and perhaps the swelling. As mentioned in Chapter 10, inflammation is a pos- itive feedback mechanism that may become a viciouscycle of damage and more damage. The hormone cor-tisol is one brake that prevents this, and at least one ofthe complement proteins has this function as well.There are probably other chemical signals (in generalcalled cytokines and chemokines ) that help limit inflammation to an extent that is useful. In summary, innate immunity is nonspecic, is always the same, does not create memory, and doesnot become more efficient upon repeated exposures. Some cells of innate immune mechanisms also activate the adaptive immune mechanisms. The aspects ofinnate immunity are shown in Fig. 14-6.328 The Lymphatic System and Immunity14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 Langerhans cells PhagocytesNatural killer cells Basophils and mast cells Interferon ComplementInflammation T cell Blocks viral reproductionLyses cells, attracts WBC'sHistamine and leukotrienes Vasodilation Cells C Chemicals Figure 14-6.

Adaptive immunity is spe-cic and is carried out by lymphocytes and macro-phages. The majority of lymphocytes are the T lympho- cytes and B lymphocytes, or, more simply, T cells and B cells . In the embryo, T cells are produced in the bone marrow and thymus. They must pass throughthe thymus, where the thymic hormones bring abouttheir maturation. The T cells then migrate to thespleen, lymph nodes, and lymph nodules, where theyare found after birth. Produced in the embryonic bone marrow, B cells migrate directly to the spleen and lymph nodes andnodules. When activated during an immune response,some B cells will divide many times and becomeplasma cells that produce antibodies to a specic for-eign antigen. The mechanisms of immunity that involve T cells and B cells are specic, meaning that one foreign anti-gen is the target each time a mechanism is activated. Amacrophage has receptor sites for foreign chemicalssuch as those of bacterial cell walls or flagella, and mayphagocytize just about any foreign material it comesacross (as will the Langerhans or dendritic cells). Tcells and B cells, however, become very specic, as youwill see. The rst step in the destruction of a pathogen or foreign cell is the recognition of its antigens as for-eign. Both T cells and B cells are capable of this, butthe immune mechanisms are activated especially wellwhen this recognition is accomplished by macro-phages and a specialized group of T lymphocytes called helper T cells (also called CD4 T cells). The foreign antigen is rst phagocytized by a macrophage,and parts of it are \"presented\" on the macrophage'scell membrane. Also on the macrophage membraneare \"self\" antigens that are representative of theantigens found on all of the cells of the individual.Therefore, the helper T cell that encounters thismacrophage is presented not only with the foreignantigen but also with \"self\" antigens for comparison.The helper T cell becomes sensitized to and specicfor the foreign antigen, the one that does not belongin the body (see Box 14-2: AIDS). The recognition of an antigen as foreign initiates one or both of the mechanisms of adaptive immunity.These are cell-mediated immunity (sometimescalled simply cellular immunity), in which T cells and macrophages participate, and antibody-mediated immunity (or humoral immunity ), which involves T cells, B cells, and macrophages. Cell-Mediated Immunity This mechanism of immunity does not result in theproduction of antibodies, but it is effective againstintracellular pathogens (such as viruses), fungi,malignant cells, and grafts of foreign tissue. As men-tioned earlier, the rst step is the recognition of theforeign antigen by macrophages and helper T cells,which become activated and are specic. (You maynd it helpful to refer to Fig. 14-7 as you read the fol- lowing.) These activated T cells, which are antigen specic, divide many times to form memory T cells and cyto- toxic (killer ) T cells (also called CD8 T cells). The memory T cells will remember the specic foreignantigen and become active if it enters the body again.Cytotoxic T cells are able to chemically destroy for-eign antigens by disrupting cell membranes. Thisis how cytotoxic T cells destroy cells infected withviruses and prevent the viruses from reproducing.These T cells also produce cytokines, which are chem-icals that attract macrophages to the area and activatethem to phagocytize the foreign antigen and cellulardebris. It was once believed that another subset of T cells served to stop the immune response, but this may notbe so. It seems probable that the CD4 and CD8 Tcells also produce feedback chemicals to limit theimmune response once the foreign antigen has beendestroyed. The memory T cells, however, will quicklyinitiate the cell-mediated immune response shouldthere be a future exposure to the antigen. Antibody-Mediated Immunity This mechanism of immunity does involve the pro-duction of antibodies and is also diagrammed in Fig.14-7. Again, the rst step is the recognition of the for-eign antigen, this time by B cells as well as bymacrophages and helper T cells. The sensitized helperT cell presents the foreign antigen to B cells, whichprovides a strong stimulus for the activation of B cellsspecic for this antigen. The activated B cells begin todivide many times, and two types of cells are formed.Some of the new B cells produced are memory B cells , which will remember the specic antigen and330 The and Immunity14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 330The Lymphatic System and Immunity 331 331 Produces cytokines to attract macrophagesChemically destroys foreign cells Memory T cellHelper T cell Cytotoxic T cellMacrophage Foreign antigen Self antigens Receptor sites Self antigens Receptor sitesMacrophage Helper T cells Memory B cell B cell Plasma cell Antibodies Antigen-antibody complex Opsonization Complement fixation lysis of cellular antigen MacrophageA B Figure immunity.

Other B cells become plasma cells that produce anti- bodies specic for this one foreign antigen. Antibodies , also called immune globulins (Ig) orgamma globulins , are proteins shaped somewhat like the letter Y. Antibodies do not themselves destroy for- eign antigens, but rather become attached to such anti-gens to \"label\" them for destruction. Each antibody BOX14-2 AIDS placental transmission of the virus from mother to fetus. In the United States, most of the cases of AIDS during the 1980s were in homosexual men and IVdrug users who shared syringes contaminated withtheir blood. By the 1990s, however, it was clear thatAIDS was becoming more of a heterosexually trans-mitted disease, with rapidly increasing case ratesamong women and teenagers. In much of the restof the world, especially Africa and Asia, the trans-mission of AIDS has always been primarily by het-erosexual contact, with equal numbers of womenand men infected. In many of these countries AIDSis an enormous public health problem, and theannual number of new cases is still rising. At present we have no medications that will eradicate HIV, although certain combinations ofdrugs effectively suppress the virus in some people.For these people, AIDS may become a chronic butnot fatal disease. Unfortunately, the medications donot work for everyone, and they are very expensive,beyond the means of most of the world's AIDSpatients. Development of an AIDS vaccine has not yet been successful, although dozens of vaccines areundergoing clinical trials. A vaccine stimulates anti-body production to a specic pathogen, but every-one who has died of AIDS had antibodies to HIV.Those antibodies were not protective because HIV isa mutating virus; it constantly changes itself, mak-ing previously produced antibodies ineffective. AnAIDS vaccine may not be entirely effective, may nothave the 80% to 90% protection rate we havecome to expect from vaccines. If we cannot cure AIDS and we cannot yet pre- vent it by vaccination, what recourse is left?Education. Everyone should know how AIDS isspread. The obvious reason is to be able to avoidthe high-risk behaviors that make acquiring HIVmore likely. Yet another reason, however, is thateveryone should know that they need not fear casual contact with people with AIDS. Healthcare personnel have a special responsibility, not only toeducate themselves, but to provide educationabout AIDS for their patients and the families oftheir patients.In 1981, young homosexual men in New York and California were diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcomaand Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. At that time, Kaposi's sarcoma was known as a rare, slowly grow-ing malignancy in elderly men. Pneumocystis pneu-monia was almost unheard of; P.carinii (now P. jiroveci ) is a pathogen that does not cause disease in healthy people. That in itself was a clue. Theseyoung men were not healthy; their immune sys-tems were not functioning normally. As the numberof patients increased rapidly, the disease was givena name (acquired immunodeciency syndrome\u2014AIDS) and the pathogen was found. Humanimmunodeciency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that infects helper T cells, macrophages, and other human cells. Once infected, the human cells con-tain HIV genes for the rest of their lives. Without suf-cient helper T cells, the immune system is seriouslyimpaired. Foreign antigens are not recognized, Bcells are not activated, and killer T cells are notstimulated to proliferate. The person with AIDS is susceptible to oppor- tunistic infections, that is, those infections causedby fungi and protozoa that would not affect aver-age healthy adults. Some of these infections may betreated with medications and even temporarilycured, but the immune system cannot prevent thenext infection, or the next. As of this writing, AIDSis considered an incurable disease, although withproper medical treatment, some people with AIDSmay live for many years. Where did this virus come from? The latest research suggests that HIV evolved from a harmlesschimpanzee virus in Africa sometime during the1930s. Spread of the virus was very slow at rst,and only when air travel became commonplace didthe virus spread worldwide. The incubation period of AIDS is highly variable, ranging from a few months to several years.An infected person may unknowingly spread HIV toothers before any symptoms appear. It shouldbe emphasized that AIDS, although communicable,is not a contagious disease. It is not spreadby casual contact as is measles or the commoncold. Transmission of AIDS occurs through sexualcontact, by contact with infected blood, or by 14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 332produced is specic for only one antigen. Because there are so many different pathogens, you mightthink that the immune system would have to be capa-ble of producing many different antibodies, and in factthis is so. It is estimated that millions of different anti-gen-specic antibodies can be produced, should therebe a need for them. The structure of antibodies is shown in Fig. 14-8, and the ve classes of antibodiesare described in T able 14-1. The antibodies produced will bond to the antigen, forming an antigen-antibody complex. This complexresults in opsonization , which means that the antigenThe Lymphatic System and Immunity 333 Table 14-1 CLASSES OF ANTIBODIES Name Location Functions IgG IgAIgM IgD IgEBlood Extracellular fluid External secretions (tears, saliva, etc.) Blood B lymphocytes Mast cells or basophils Crosses the placenta to provide passive immunity for newborns Provides long-term immunity following recovery or a vaccine Present in breast milk to provide passive immunity for breast-fed infants Found in secretions of all mucous membranes Produced rst by the maturing immune system of infants Produced rst during an infection (IgG production follows) Part of the ABO blood group Receptors on B lymphocytes Important in allergic reactions (mast cells release histamine) A Antigen binding site Complement binding site Macrophage binding siteB IgG IgD IgE IgA IgM Bacteria Virus Toxin Agglutination 14-8.

The antigen-antibody complex also stim-ulates the process of complement xation (see Box14-3: Diagnostic T ests). Some of the circulating complement proteins are activated, or xed, by an antigen-antibody complex.Complement xation may be complete or partial. Ifthe foreign antigen is cellular, the complement pro-teins bond to the antigen-antibody complex, then toone another, forming an enzymatic ring that punchesa hole in the cell to bring about the death of the cell.This is complete (or entire) complement xation andis what happens to bacterial cells (it is also the cause ofhemolysis in a transfusion reaction). If the foreign antigen is not a cell\u2014let's say it's a virus for example\u2014partial complement xation takesplace, in which some of the complement proteins bondto the antigen-antibody complex. This is a chemotac-tic factor. Chemotaxis means \"chemical movement\" and is actually another label that attracts macrophages toengulf and destroy the foreign antigen. In summary, adaptive immunity is very specic, does create memory, and because it does, often be-comes more efficient with repeated exposures.Antibody Responses The rst exposure to a foreign antigen does stimulateantibody production, but antibodies are producedslowly and in small amounts (see Fig. 14-9). Let ustake as a specic example the measles virus. On a per-son's rst exposure to this virus, antibody production isusually too slow to prevent the disease itself, and theperson will have clinical measles. Most people who getmeasles recover, and upon recovery have antibodiesand memory cells that are specic for the measlesvirus. On a second exposure to this virus, the memory cells initiate rapid production of large amounts of anti-bodies, enough to prevent a second case of measles.This is the reason why we develop immunity to certaindiseases, and this is also the basis for the protectiongiven by vaccines (see Box 14-4: Vaccines). As mentioned previously, antibodies label patho- gens or their eventual destruction. Agglutination means \"clumping,\" and this is what happens whenantibodies bind to bacterial cells. The bacteria that areclumped together by attached antibodies are more eas-ily phagocytized by macrophages (see Fig. 14-8). The activity of viruses may be neutralized by anti- bodies. A virus must get inside a living cell in order toreproduce itself. However, a virus with antibodiesattached to it is unable to enter a cell, cannot repro-duce, and will soon be phagocytized. Bacterial toxinsmay also be neutralized by attached antibodies. Theantibodies change the shape of the toxin, prevent itfrom exerting its harmful effects, and promote itsphagocytosis by macrophages. Allergies are also the result of antibody activity (see box 14-5: Allergies). TYPES OF IMMUNITY If we consider the source of immunity, that is, whereit comes from, we can begin with two major cate-gories: genetic immunity and acquired immunity.Genetic immunity is conferred by our DNA, andacquired immunity is developed or acquired by natu-ral or articial means. Genetic immunity does not involve antibodies or the immune system; it is the result of our geneticmakeup. What this means is that some pathogens334 The Lymphatic System and Immunity BOX14-3 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Several important laboratory tests involve anti- bodies and may be very useful to conrm a diag-nosis. Complement xation test \u2014determines the presence of a particular antibody in the patient'sblood, but does not indicate when the infectionoccurred.Antibody titer \u2014determines the level or amount of a specic antibody in the patient'sblood. If another titer is done 1 to several weekslater, an increase in the antibody level shows theinfection to be current.Fluorescent antibody test \u2014uses antibodies tagged with fluorescent dyes, which are addedto a clinical specimen such as blood, sputum, ora biopsy of tissue. If the suspected pathogen ispresent, the fluorescent antibodies will bond to itand the antigen-antibody complex will \"glow\"when examined with a fluorescent microscope. Tests such as these are used in conjunction with patient history and symptoms to arrive at adiagnosis.14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 334The Lymphatic System and Immunity 335 Primary and secondary antibody responses Antibody levelFirst exposure to antigenSecond exposure to antigen 10 days 20 days some months some years 20 days 10 days Time after exposureIgGIgG IgM IgM Figure 14-9. Antibody responses to rst and subsequent exposures to a pathogen. See text for description. QUESTION: State the two differences in IgG production after a rst and a second exposure to the same antigen. BOX14-4 VACCINES the inactivated toxins of these bacteria. Vaccines for pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis contain bacterial capsules. These vaccines cannot cause dis-ease because the capsules are non-toxic and non-living; there is nothing that can reproduce.Influenza and rabies vaccines contain killed viruses.Measles and the oral polio vaccines contain attenu-ated (weakened) viruses. Although attenuated pathogens are usually strongly antigenic and stimulate a protectiveimmune response, there is a very small chance thatthe pathogen may regain its virulence and causethe disease. The live-virus oral polio vaccine (stillbeing used in the quest to eliminate polio through-out the world) has a risk of 1 in 500,000 of causingpolio. The killed-virus injectable polio vaccine hasno such risk.The purpose of vaccines is to prevent disease. A vac- cine contains an antigen that the immune systemwill respond to, just as it would to the actualpathogen. The types of vaccine antigens are a killedor weakened ( attenuated ) pathogen, part of a pathogen such as a bacterial capsule, or an inacti-vated bacterial toxin called a toxoid . Because the vaccine itself does not cause disease (with very rare exceptions), the fact that antibody production to it is slow is not detrimental to the person. The vaccine takes the place of the rstexposure to the pathogen and stimulates produc-tion of antibodies and memory cells. On exposureto the pathogen itself, the memory cells initiaterapid production of large amounts of antibody,enough to prevent disease. We now have vaccines for many diseases. The tetanus and diphtheria vaccines contain toxoids,14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 335cause disease in certain host species but not in others. Dogs and cats, for example, have genetic immunityto the measles virus, which is a pathogen only for peo-ple. Mouse leukemia viruses affect only mice, notpeople; we have genetic immunity to them. This isnot because we have antibodies against these mouseviruses, but rather that we have genes that are thecodes for proteins that make it impossible for suchpathogens to reproduce in our cells and tissues.Monkeys have similar protective genes and proteinsfor the human AIDS virus; HIV does not cause diseasein these monkeys. Because this is a genetic character-istic programmed in DNA, genetic immunity alwayslasts a lifetime. Acquired immunity does involve antibodies. Passive immunity means that the antibodies are from another source, whereas active immunity means that the individual produces his or her own antibodies. One type of naturally acquired passive immunity is the placental transmission of antibodies (IgG) frommaternal blood to fetal circulation. The baby will thenbe born temporarily immune to the diseases themother is immune to. Such passive immunity may beprolonged by breast-feeding, because breast milk alsocontains maternal antibodies (IgA). Articially acquired passive immunity is obtainedby the injection of immune globulins (gamma globu- lins or preformed antibodies) after presumed exposureto particular pathogen. Such immune globulins areavailable for German measles, hepatitis A and B, tetanus and botulism (anti-toxins), and rabies. These are notvaccines; they do not stimulate immune mech- anisms, but rather provide immediate antibody pro-tection. Passive immunity is always temporary, lastinga few weeks to a few months, because antibodies fromanother source eventually break down. Active immunity is the production of one's own antibodies and may be stimulated by natural or arti-cial means. Naturally acquired active immunity meansthat a person has recovered from a disease and nowhas antibodies and memory cells specic for thatpathogen. Articially acquired active immunity is theresult of a vaccine that has stimulated production ofantibodies and memory cells (see Box 14-6: VaccinesThat Have Changed Our Lives). No general state-ment can be made about the duration of active immu-nity. Recovering from plague, for example, conferslifelong immunity, but the plague vaccine does not.Duration of active immunity, therefore, varies withthe particular disease or vaccine. The types of immunity are summarized in T able 14-2.336 The Lymphatic System and Immunity BOX14-5 ALLERGIES In an allergic reaction, the effects of inflamma- tory chemicals create symptoms such as wateryeyes and runny nose (hay fever) or the more seriouswheezing and difficult breathing that characterizeasthma. Several medications are available to coun-teract these effects (see Chapter 15 for a descriptionof asthma). Anaphylactic shock is an extreme allergic response that may be elicited by exposure to peni-cillin or insect venoms. On the rst exposure, theperson becomes highly sensitized to the foreignantigen. On the second exposure, histamine isreleased from mast cells throughout the body andcauses a drastic decrease in blood volume. Theresulting drop in blood pressure may be fatal inonly a few minutes. People who know they areallergic to bee stings, for example, may obtain aself-contained syringe of epinephrine to carry withthem. Epinephrine can delay the progression ofanaphylactic shock long enough for the person toseek medical attention.Anallergy is a hypersensitivity to a particular for- eign antigen, called an allergen . Allergens include plant pollens, foods, chemicals in cosmetics, antibi-otics such as penicillin, dust, and mold spores. Suchallergens are not themselves harmful. Most people,for example, can inhale pollen, eat peanuts, or takepenicillin with no ill effects. Hypersensitivity means that the immune system overresponds to the allergen, and produces tissuedamage by doing so. Allergic responses are charac-terized by the production of IgE antibodies, whichbond to mast cells. Mast cells are specialized con-nective tissue cells and are numerous in the con-nective tissue of the skin and mucous membranes.Chemicals in mast cells include histamine andleukotrienes, which are released by the bonding ofIgE antibodies or when tissue damage occurs. These chemicals contribute to the process of inflammation by increasing the permeability of cap-illaries and venules. Tissue fluid collects and moreWBCs are brought to the damaged area.14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 336AGING AND THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM The aging of the lymphatic system is apparent in the decreased efficiency of immune responses. Elderlypeople are more likely than younger ones to developshingles, when an aging immune system cannot keep the chickenpox virus dormant. They are also moresusceptible to infections such as influenza and to what are called secondary infections, such as pneumoniafollowing a case of the flu. Vaccines for both of theseare available, and elderly people should be encouragedto get them. Elderly people should also be sure to geta tetanus-diphtheria booster every 10 years. Autoimmune disorders are also more common among older people; the immune system mistakenlyperceives a body tissue as foreign and initiates its des-truction. Rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravisare examples of autoimmune diseases. The incidenceof cancer is also higher. Malignant cells that oncemight have been quickly destroyed remain alive andproliferate.The Lymphatic System and Immunity 337 BOX14-6 VACCINES THAT HAVE CHANGED OUR LIVES they are no longer possible reservoirs or sources of the pathogen for others, and the spread of diseasemay be greatly limited. Other diseases that have been controlled by the use of vaccines are tetanus, mumps, influenza,measles, and German measles. Whooping coughhad been controlled until recently, when the vacci-nation rate decreased; the annual number of casesin the United States has more than doubled. Thevaccine for hepatitis B has signicantly decreasedthe number of cases of this disease among health-care workers, and the vaccine is recommended forall children. People who have been exposed torabies, which is virtually always fatal, can be pro-tected by a safe vaccine. Without such vaccines our lives would be very different. Infant mortality or death in childhoodwould be much more frequent, and all of us wouldhave to be much more aware of infectious diseases.In many parts of the world this is still true; many ofthe developing countries in Africa and Asia still can-not afford extensive vaccination programs for theirchildren. Many of the diseases mentioned here,which we may rarely think of, are still a very signif-icant part of the lives of millions of people.In 1797, Edward Jenner (in England) published his results on the use of the cowpox virus called vac-cinia as the rst vaccine for smallpox, a closelyrelated virus. (He was unaware of the actual patho-gens, because viruses had not yet been discovered,but he had noticed that milkmaids who got cow-pox rarely got smallpox.) In 1980, the World HealthOrganization declared that smallpox had beeneradicated throughout the world. A disease thathad killed or disgured millions of people through-out recorded history is now considered part of his-tory (except for the possible use of the virus as abiological weapon). In the 19th century in the northern United States, thousands of children died of diphtheriaevery winter. Today there are fewer than 10 casesof diphtheria each year in the entire country. Inthe early 1950s, 50,000 cases of paralytic poliowere reported in the United States each year.Today, wild-type polio virus is not found in NorthAmerica. Smallpox, diphtheria, and polio are no longer the terrible diseases they once were, and this isbecause of the development and widespread use ofvaccines. When people are protected by a vaccine, Table 14-2 TYPES OF IMMUNITY Type Description Genetic Acquired Passive NATURAL ARTIFICIAL Active NATURAL ARTIFICIAL Does not involve antibodies; is programmed in DNA Some pathogens affect certain host species but not others Does involve antibodies Antibodies from another source Placental transmission of antibodies from mother to fetus Transmission of antibodies in breast milk Injection of preformed antibodies (gamma globulins or immune globulins) after presumed exposure Production of one's own antibodies Recovery from a disease, with pro- duction of antibodies and memory cells A vaccine stimulates production of antibodies and memory cells14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 337SUMMARY The preceding discussions of immunity will give you a small idea of the complexity of the body's defense sys-tem. However, there is still much more to be learned,especially about the effects of the nervous system andendocrine system on immunity. For example, it isknown that people under great stress have immune systems that may not function as they did when stresswas absent. At present, much research is being done in this eld. The goal is not to eliminate all disease, for thatwould not be possible. Rather, the aim is to enablepeople to live healthier lives by preventing certaindiseases.338 The Lymphatic System and Immunity STUDY OUTLINE Functions of the Lymphatic System 1. T o return tissue fluid to the blood to maintain blood volume (see Fig. 14-1). 2. T o protect the body against pathogens and other foreign material. Parts of the Lymphatic System 1. Lymph and lymph vessels.2. Lymphatic tissue: lymph nodes and nodules, spleen, and thymus; lymphocytes mature and pro-liferate. Lymph\u2014the tissue fluid that enters lymph capillaries1. Similar to plasma, but more WBCs are present, and has less protein. 2. Must be returned to the blood to maintain blood volume and blood pressure. Lymph Vessels 1. Dead-end lymph capillaries are found in most tis- sue spaces; collect tissue fluid and proteins (see Fig.14-2). 2. The structure of larger lymph vessels is like that of veins; valves prevent the backflow of lymph. 3. Lymph is kept moving in lymph vessels by: constriction of the lymph vessels the skeletal muscle pump the respiratory pump 4. Lymph from the lower body and upper left quad- rant enters the thoracic duct and is returned to theblood in the left subclavian vein (see Fig. 14-3). 5. Lymph from the upper right quadrant enters the right lymphatic duct and is returned to the blood vein.Lymph Nodes\u2014encapsulated masses of lym- phatic along the pathways of lymph ves- sels. 2. As lymph flows through the nodes: foreign material is phagocytized by xed macro- phages lymphocytes are activated and xed plasma cells produce antibodies to foreign antigens (see Fig.14-4) 3. The major paired groups of lymph nodes are the cervical, axillary, and inguinal groups. These areat the junctions of the head and extremities withthe trunk; remove pathogens from the lymph fromthe extremities before the lymph is returned to theblood. Lymph Nodules\u2014small unencapsulated masses of lymphatic epithelium of all mucous mem- branes, that is, the tracts that have natural openingsto the environment. 2. Destroy pathogens that penetrate the epithelium of the respiratory, digestive, urinary, or reproductivetracts. 3. T onsils are the lymph nodules of the pharynx; Peyer's patches are those of the small intestine. Spleen\u2014located in the upper left abdominal quadrant behind the stomach1. The fetal spleen produces RBCs.2. Functions after birth: contains lymphocytes to be activated and xed plasma cells that produce antibodies contains fixed macrophages (RE cells) that14Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 338phagocytize pathogens and old RBCs; bilirubin is formed and sent to the liver for excretion inbile stores platelets and destroys damaged platelets Thymus\u2014inferior to the thyroid gland; in the fetus and infant the thymus is large (seeFig. 14-5); with age the thymus shrinks1. Produces T lymphocytes (T cells).2. Produces thymic hormones that make T cells immunologically competent, that is, able to recog-nize foreign antigens and provide immunity. Immunity\u2014the ability to destroy foreign antigens and prevent future cases of certaininfectious diseases1. Antigens are chemical markers that identify cells. Human cells have \"self\" antigens\u2014the HLA types. 2. Foreign antigens stimulate antibody production or other immune responses, and include bacteria,viruses, fungi, protozoa, and malignant cells. Innate Immunity (see Fig. 14-6) 1. Is nonspecic, responses are always the same, does not create memory, and does not become moreefficient.

Signs: redness, heat, swelling, and pain Adaptive Immunity (see Fig. 14-7) 1. Is very specic, may involve antibodies, does create memory, and responses become more efficient.Consists of cell-mediated and antibody-mediatedimmunity; is carried out by T cells, B cells, andmacrophages. 2. T lymphocytes (T cells)\u2014in the embryo are pro- duced in the thymus and RBM; they require thehormones of the thymus for maturation; migrate tothe spleen, lymph nodes, and nodules. 3. B lymphocytes (B cells)\u2014in the embryo are pro- duced in the RBM; migrate to the spleen, lymphnodes, and nodules. 4. The antigen must rst be recognized as foreign; this is accomplished by B cells or by helper T cellsthat compare the foreign antigen to \"self\" antigenspresent on macrophages. 5. Helper T cells strongly initiate one or both of the immune mechanisms: cell-mediated immunity andantibody-mediated immunity. Cell-Mediated (cellular) Immunity (see Fig. 14-7)1. Does not involve antibodies; is effective against intracellular pathogens, malignant cells, and grafts of foreign tissue. 2. Helper T cells recognize the foreign antigen, are antigen specic, and begin to divide to form differ-ent groups of T cells. 3. Memory T cells will remember the specic foreign antigen. 4. Cytotoxic (killer) T cells chemically destroy for- eign cells and produce cytokines to attract macro-phages. Antibody-Mediated (Humoral) Immunity (see Fig. 14-7)1. Does involve antibody production; is effective against pathogens and foreign cells.The Lymphatic System and Immunity 33914Scanlon(p3)-ch14 8/17/06 10:56 AM Page 3392.

Other B cells become plasma cells that produce antigen-specic antibodies. 5. An antigen-antibody complex is formed, which attracts macrophages (opsonization). 6. Complement xation is stimulated by antigen- antibody complexes. The complement proteinsbind to the antigen-antibody complex and lyse Table 14-1 andFig. 14-8)1.

Bond to the foreign antigen to label it for phagocy- tosis (opsonization). Antibody Responses and Functions (see Fig. 14-9)1. On the rst exposure to a foreign antigen, antibod- ies are produced slowly and in small amounts, andthe person may develop clinical disease. 2. On the second exposure, the memory cells initiate rapid production of large amounts of antibodies,and a second case of the disease may be prevented.This is the basis for the protection given by vac-cines, which take the place of the rst exposure. 3. Antibodies cause agglutination (clumping) of bac- terial cells; clumped cells are easier for macro-phages to phagocytize (see Fig. 14-8). 4. Antibodies neutralize viruses by bonding to them and preventing their entry into cells. 5. Antibodies neutralize bacterial toxins by bonding to them and changing their shape.

We rarely think about breathing, and it isn'tsomething we look forward to, as we might look for-ward to a good dinner. We just breathe, usually at therate of 12 to 20 times per minute, and faster whennecessary (such as during exercise). You may haveheard of trained singers \"learning how to breathe,\"but they are really learning how to make their breath-ing more efficient. Most of the respiratory system is concerned with what we think of as breathing: moving air into and outof the lungs. The lungs are the site of the exchanges ofoxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and theblood. Both of these exchanges are important. Allof our cells must obtain oxygen to carry out cell respi-ration to produce ATP . Just as crucial is the elimina-tion of the CO 2produced as a waste product of cell respiration, and, as you already know, the proper func-tioning of the circulatory system is essential for thetransport of these gases in the blood. DIVISIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM The respiratory system may be divided into the upperrespiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. Theupper respiratory tract consists of the parts outside the chest cavity: the air passages of the nose, nasal cav-ities, pharynx, larynx, and upper trachea. The lower respiratory tract consists of the parts found within the chest cavity: the lower trachea and the lungs them-selves, which include the bronchial tubes and alveoli.Also part of the respiratory system are the pleuralmembranes and the respiratory muscles that form thechest cavity: the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Have you recognized some familiar organs and structures thus far? There will be more, because thischapter includes material from all of the previouschapters. Even though we are discussing the bodysystem by system, the respiratory system is an excel-lent example of the interdependent functioning of allthe body systems. NOSE AND NASAL CAVITIES Air enters and leaves the respiratory system throughthe nose , which is made of bone and cartilage coveredwith skin. Just inside the nostrils are hairs, which help block the entry of dust. The two nasal cavities are within the skull, sepa- rated by the nasal septum , which is a bony plate made of the ethmoid bone and vomer. The conchae project from the lateral wall of each nasal cavity (Figs. 15-1 and 6-6). Just as shelves in acabinet provide more flat space for storage, the con-chae increase the surface area of the nasal mucosa. Asair passes through the nasal cavities it is warmed andhumidied, so that air that reaches the lungs is warmand moist. Bacteria and particles of air pollution aretrapped on the mucus; the cilia continuously sweep the mucus toward the pharynx. Most of this mucus is eventually swallowed, and most bacteria present willbe destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in the gastricjuice. In the upper nasal cavities are the olfactory recep- tors, which detect vaporized chemicals that have been inhaled. The olfactory nerves pass through the eth-moid bone to the brain. You may also recall our earlier discussion of the paranasal sinuses , air cavities in the maxillae, bones (see lined the paranasal sinuses are to lighten theskull and provide resonance (more vibrating air) forthe voice. PHARYNX The pharynx is a muscular tube posterior to the nasal and oral cavities and anterior to the cervical vertebrae.For descriptive purposes, the pharynx may be dividedinto three parts: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, andlaryngopharynx Fig. 15-1). The uppermost portion is the nasopharynx , which is behind the nasal cavities. The soft palate is elevated during swallowing to block the nasopharynx and pre-vent food or saliva from going up rather than down.The uvula is the part of the soft palate you can see atthe back of the throat. On the posterior wall of thenasopharynx is the two eustachian tubes,which extend to the middle ear cavities. The purpose344 Respiratory System15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 344of the eustachian tubes is to permit air to enter or leave the middle ears, allowing the eardrums to vibrateproperly. The nasopharynx is a passageway for air only, but the remainder of the pharynx serves as both an air andfood passageway, although not for both at the same time. The oropharynx is behind the mouth; its mucosa is stratied squamous epithelium, continuouswith that of the oral cavity. On its lateral walls are thepalatine tonsils, also lymph nodules.

QUESTION: Describe the shape of the conchae by using a familiar object. What is the func- tion of the conchae?15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 and the lingual tonsils on the base of the tongue, they form a ring of lymphatic tissue aroundthe pharynx to destroy pathogens that penetrate themucosa. The laryngopharynx is the most inferior portion of the pharynx. It opens anteriorly into the larynx andposteriorly into the esophagus. Contraction of themuscular wall of the oropharynx and laryngopharynxis part of the swallowing reflex. LARYNX The larynx is often called the voice box, a name that indicates one of its functions, which is speaking. Theother function of the larynx is to be an air passagewaybetween the pharynx and the trachea. Air passagesmust be kept open at all times, and so the larynx ismade of nine pieces of cartilage connected by liga-ments. Cartilage is a rm yet flexible tissue that pre-vents collapse of the larynx. In comparison, theesophagus is a collapsed tube except when food is pass-ing through it. The largest cartilage of the larynx is the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 15-2), which you can feel on the ante- rior surface of your neck. The epiglottis is the upper- most cartilage. During swallowing, the larynx iselevated, and the epiglottis closes over the top, ratherlike a trap door or hinged lid, to prevent the entry of saliva or food into the larynx. The mucosa of the larynx is ciliated epithelium, the cords (stratied cilia of the mucosa sweep upward toremove mucus and trapped dust and microorganisms. The vocal cords (or vocal folds) are on either side of the glottis , the opening between them. During breathing, the vocal cords are held at the sides of theglottis, so that air passes freely into and out of the tra-chea (Fig. 15-3). During speaking, the intrinsic mus-cles of the larynx pull the vocal cords across the glottis,and exhaled air vibrates the vocal cords to producesounds that can be turned into speech. It is also phys-ically possible to speak while inhaling, but this is notwhat we are used to. The cranial nerves that are motornerves to the larynx for speaking are the vagus andaccessory nerves. You may also recall that for mostpeople, the speech areas are in the left cerebral hemi-sphere. TRACHEA AND BRONCHIAL TREE The trachea is about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) long and extends from the larynx to the primary bronchi.The wall of the trachea contains 16 to 20 C-shaped pieces of cartilage, which keep the trachea open. Thegaps in these incomplete cartilage rings are posterior,to permit the expansion of the esophagus when food isswallowed. The mucosa of the trachea is ciliatedepithelium with goblet cells. As in the larynx, the ciliasweep upward toward the pharynx. The right and left primary bronchi (Fig. 15-4) are the branches of the trachea that enter the lungs. Theirstructure is just like that of the trachea, with C-shaped cartilages and ciliated epithelium. Within the lungs, each primary bronchus branches into secondary bronchi leading to the lobes of each lung (three right,two left). The further branching of the bronchial tubesis often called the bronchial tree . Imagine the trachea as the trunk of an upside-down tree with extensivebranches that become smaller and smaller; thesesmaller branches are the bronchioles . No cartilage is present in the walls of the bronchioles; this becomesclinically important in asthma (see Box 15-1: Asthma).The smallest bronchioles terminate in clusters of alve-oli, the air sacs of the lungs. LUNGS AND PLEURAL MEMBRANES The lungs are located on either side of the heart in the chest cavity and are encircled and protected by the346 The Respiratory System Epiglottis Hyoid bone Thyroid cartilage Vocal Cricoidcartilage Tracheal cartilages B Figure 15-2. Larynx. ( view. ( B) Midsagittal section through the larynx, viewed from the left side.QUESTION: What is the function of the epiglottis?15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 346rib cage. The base of each lung rests on the diaphragm below; the apex (superior tip) is at the level of the clav-icle. On the medial surface of each lung is an indenta-tion called the hilus , where the primary bronchus and the pulmonary artery and veins enter the lung. The pleural membranes are the serous membranes of the thoracic cavity. The parietal pleura lines the chest wall, and the visceral pleura is on the surface of the lungs. Between the pleural membranes is serousfluid, which prevents friction and keeps the two mem-branes together during breathing. Alveoli The functional units of the lungs are the air sacs calledalveoli . The flat alveolar type I cells that form most of the alveolar walls are simple squamous epithelium. Inthe spaces between clusters of alveoli is elastic con-nective tissue, which is important for exhalation.Within the alveoli are macrophages that phagocytizepathogens or other foreign material that may not havebeen swept out by the ciliated epithelium of thebronchial tree. There are millions of alveoli in eachlung, and their total surface area is estimated to be 700to 800 square feet (picture a sidewalk two and a halffeet wide that is as long as an American football eld,or a rectangle 25 feet by 30 feet). Each alveolus is sur-rounded by a network of pulmonary capillaries (seeFig 15-4). Recall that capillaries are also made of sim-ple squamous epithelium, so there are only two cellsbetween the air in the alveoli and the blood in the pul-monary capillaries, which permits efficient diffusion of gases (Fig. 15-5). Each alveolus is lined with a thin layer of tissue fluid, which is essential for the diffusion of gases, be-cause a gas must dissolve in a liquid in order to enteror leave a cell (the earthworm principle\u2014an earth-worm breathes through its moist skin, and will suffo-cate if its skin dries out). Although this tissue fluid isnecessary, it creates a potential problem in that itwould make the walls of an alveolus stick togetherinternally. Imagine a plastic bag that is wet inside; itswalls would stick together because of the surface ten-sion of the water. This is just what would happen inalveoli, and inflation would be very difficult. This problem is overcome by pulmonary surfac- tant, a lipoprotein secreted by alveolar type II cells, also called septal cells. Surfactant mixes with the tissuefluid within the alveoli and decreases its surface ten-sion, permitting inflation of the alveoli (see Box 15-2:Hyaline Membrane Disease). Normal inflation of thealveoli in turn permits the exchange of gases, butbefore we discuss this process, we will rst see how airgets into and out of the lungs. MECHANISM OF BREATHING Ventilation is the term for the movement of air to and from the alveoli. The two aspects of ventilation areinhalation and exhalation, which are brought about byThe Respiratory System 347 Epiglottis Vocal cord A BTrachea Glottis Figure 15-3.

QUESTION: What makes the vocal cords vibrate?15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 347the nervous system and the respiratory muscles. The respiratory centers are located in the medulla andpons. Their specic functions will be covered in a latersection, but it is the medulla that generates impulsesto the respiratory muscles. These muscles are the diaphragm and the external and internal intercostal muscles (Fig. 15-6). Thediaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle below the lungs;when it contracts, the diaphragm flattens and moves downward. The intercostal muscles are found betweenthe ribs. The external intercostal muscles pull the ribs upward and outward, and the internal inter- costal muscles pull the ribs downward and inward. Ventilation is the result of the respiratory muscles pro-ducing changes in the pressure within the alveoli andbronchial tree.348 Respiratory System folds Trachea Superior lobe Right lung Figure 15-4.

(The colors represent the vessels, not the oxygen content of the blood within the vessels.)QUESTION: What are the rst branches of the trachea, and how do they resemble the tra- chea in structure?15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 348With respect to breathing, three types of pressure are important: 1.Atmospheric pressure \u2014the pressure of the air around us. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is 760mmHg. At higher altitudes, of course, atmosphericpressure is lower. 2.Intrapleural pressure \u2014the pressure within the potential pleural space between the parietal pleuraand visceral pleura. This is a potential rather than areal space. A thin layer of serous fluid causes thetwo pleural membranes to adhere to one another.Intrapleural pressure is always slightly belowatmospheric pressure (about 756 mmHg), and iscalled a negative pressure. The elastic lungs are always tending to collapse and pull the visceralpleura away from the parietal pleura. The serousfluid, however, prevents separation (see Box 15-3: Pneumothorax). 3.Intrapulmonic pressure \u2014the the bronchial tree and alveoli. This pressure fluctuatesbelow and above atmospheric pressure during eachcycle of breathing. INHALATION Inhalation, also called inspiration , is a precise sequence of events that may be described as follows:Motor impulses from the medulla travel along thephrenic nerves to the diaphragm and along the inter- costal nerves to the external intercostal muscles. Thediaphragm contracts, moves downward, and expands the chest cavity from top to bottom. The externalintercostal muscles pull the ribs up and out, whichexpands the chest cavity from side to side and front toback. As the chest cavity is expanded, the parietal pleura expands with it. Intrapleural pressure becomes evenmore negative as a sort of suction is created betweenthe pleural membranes. The adhesion created by theserous fluid, however, permits the visceral pleura to beexpanded too, and this expands the lungs as well. As the lungs expand, intrapulmonic pressure falls below atmospheric pressure, and air enters the noseand travels through the respiratory passages to thealveoli. Entry of air continues until intrapulmonicpressure is equal to atmospheric pressure; this is a nor-mal inhalation. Of course, inhalation can be continuedbeyond normal, that is, a deep breath. This requires amore forceful contraction of the respiratory musclesto further expand the lungs, permitting the entry ofmore air. EXHALATION Exhalation may also be called expiration and begins when motor impulses from the medulla decrease andthe diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax.As the chest cavity becomes smaller, the lungs arecompressed, and their elastic connective tissue, whichwas stretched during inhalation, recoils and also com-The Respiratory System 349 BOX15-1 ASTHMA emphysema. When obstructed bronchioles prevent ventilation of alveoli, the walls of the alveoli beginto deteriorate and break down, leaving large cavi-ties that do not provide much surface area for gasexchange. One possible way to prevent such serious lung damage is to prevent asthma attacks with a med-ication that blocks the release of IgE antibodies. Anallergy is an immune overreaction, and blockingsuch a reaction would prevent the damaging effectsof inflammation. In the United States the incidenceof asthma is increasing among children; this may bea result of higher levels of air pollution, thoughgenetic and immunologic factors may contribute aswell.Asthma is usually triggered by an infection or aller- gic reaction that affects the smooth muscle andglands of the bronchioles. Allergens include foodsand inhaled substances such as dust and pollen.Wheezing and dyspnea (difficult breathing) charac-terize an asthma attack, which may range frommild to fatal. As part of the allergic response, the smooth mus- cle of the bronchioles constricts. Because there is nocartilage present in their walls, the bronchioles mayclose completely. The secretion of mucus increases,perhaps markedly, so the already constricted bron-chioles may become clogged or completelyobstructed with mucus. Chronic asthma is a predisposing factor for15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 349350 The Respiratory System Figure 15-5.

Elastin fibersMacrophage Type I cell Type II and tissue fluid Alveolar epithelium spaceExhalation InhalationRespiration Oxygen (O ) Carbon dioxide (CO )2 2 Primary bronchiBA Alveolus Respiratory membrane presses the alveoli. As intrapulmonic pressure rises above atmospheric pressure, air is forced out of thelungs until the two pressures are again equal. Notice that inhalation is an active process that requires muscle contraction, but normal exhalation isa passive process, depending to a great extent on the normal elasticity of healthy lungs. In other words,under normal circumstances we must expend energyto inhale 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 350We can, however, go beyond a normal exhalation and expel more air, such as when talking, singing, orblowing up a balloon. Such a forced exhalation is anactive process that requires contraction of other mus-cles. Contraction of the internal intercostal musclespulls the ribs down and in and squeezes even more airout of the lungs. Contraction of abdominal muscles,such as the rectus abdominis, compresses the abdomi-nal organs and pushes the diaphragm upward, whichalso forces more air out of the lungs (see Box 15-5:The Heimlich Maneuver).PULMONARY VOLUMES The capacity of the lungs varies with the size and ageof the person. T aller people have larger lungs than doshorter people. Also, as we get older our lung capacitydiminishes as lungs lose their elasticity and the respi-ratory muscles become less efficient. For the followingpulmonary volumes, the values given are those forhealthy young adults. These are also shown in Fig. 15-7.The Respiratory System 351 External intercostal muscles Normal exhala- tion: diaphragm relaxes upward; rib cage falls down as exter- nal intercostal muscles relax; lungsare compressed.QUESTION: a passive process? BOX15-2 HYALINE MEMBRANE DISEASE lapse after each breath rather than remain inflated. Each breath, therefore, is difficult, and the newbornmust expend a great deal of energy just to breathe. Premature infants may require respiratory assis- tance until their lungs are mature enough to pro-duce surfactant. Use of a synthetic surfactant hassignicantly helped some infants, and because theycan breathe more normally, their dependence onrespirators is minimized. Still undergoing evaluationare the effects of the long-term use of this surfac-tant in the most premature babies, who mayrequire it for much longer periods of time.Hyaline membrane disease is also called respira- tory distress syndrome (RDS) of the newborn, andmost often affects premature infants whose lungshave not yet produced sufficient quantities of pul-monary surfactant. The rst few breaths of a newborn inflate most of the previously collapsed lungs, and the presence ofsurfactant permits the alveoli to remain open. Thefollowing breaths become much easier, and normalbreathing is established. Without surfactant, the surface tension of the tis- sue fluid lining the alveoli causes the air sacs to col-15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 351BOX15-3 PNEUMOTHORAX trauma, may result from rupture of weakened alve- oli on the lung surface. Pulmonary diseases such asemphysema may weaken alveoli. Puncture wounds of the chest wall also allow air into the pleural space, with resulting collapse of alung. In severe cases, large amounts of air push theheart, great vessels, trachea, and esophagus towardthe opposite side (mediastinal shift), putting pres-sure on the other lung and making breathing diffi-cult. This is called tension pneumothorax, andrequires rapid medical intervention to remove thetrapped air.Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space, which causes collapse of the lung on thatside. Recall that the pleural space is only a potentialspace because the serous fluid keeps the pleuralmembranes adhering to one another, and theintrapleural pressure is always slightly below atmos-pheric pressure. Should air at atmospheric pressureenter the pleural cavity, the suddenly higher pres-sure outside the lung will contribute to its collapse(the other factor is the normal elasticity of thelungs). A spontaneous pneumothorax, without apparent BOX15-4 EMPHYSEMA In progressive emphysema, damaged lung tissue is replaced by brous connective tissue (scar tissue),which further limits the diffusion of gases. Bloodoxygen level decreases, and blood carbon dioxidelevel increases. Accumulating carbon dioxidedecreases the pH of body fluids; this is a respiratoryacidosis. One of the most characteristic signs of emphy- sema is that the affected person must make aneffort to exhale. The loss of lung elasticity makesnormal exhalation an active process, rather than thepassive process it usually is. The person mustexpend energy to exhale in order to make room inthe lungs for inhaled air. This extra \"work\" requiredfor exhalation may be exhausting for the personand contribute to the debilitating nature of emphy-sema.Emphysema , a form of chronic obstructive pul- monary disease (COPD), is a degenerative diseasein which the alveoli lose their elasticity and cannotrecoil. Perhaps the most common (and avoidable)cause is cigarette smoking; other causes are long-term exposure to severe air pollution or industrialdusts, or chronic asthma. Inhaled irritants damagethe alveolar walls and cause deterioration of theelastic connective tissue surrounding the alveoli. Macrophages migrate to the damaged areas and seem to produce an enzyme that contributes to thedestruction of the protein elastin. This is an instanceof a useful body response (for cleaning up damagedtissue) becoming damaging when it is excessive. Asthe alveoli break down, larger air cavities are cre-ated that are not efficient in gas exchange (see BoxFig. 15-A). Normal Lun g EmphysemaAB Box Figure 15-A (A) Lung tissue with normal alveoli.

The average tidalvolume is 500 mL, but many people often havelower tidal volumes because of shallow breathing. 2.Minute respiratory volume (MRV)\u2014the amount of air inhaled and exhaled in 1 minute. MRV is cal-culated by multiplying tidal volume by the numberof respirations per minute (average range: 12 to 20per minute). If tidal volume is 500 mL and the res-piratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, the MRV is6000 mL, or 6 liters of air per minute, which isaverage. Shallow breathing usually indicates asmaller than average tidal volume, and would thusrequire more respirations per minute to obtain thenecessary MRV . 3.Inspiratory reserve \u2014the amount of air, beyond tidal volume, that can be taken in with the deepestpossible inhalation. Normal inspiratory reserveranges from 2000 to 3000 mL. 4.Expiratory reserve \u2014the amount of air, beyond tidal volume, that can be expelled with the most forceful exhalation. Normal expiratory reserveranges from 1000 to 1500 mL. 5.Vital capacity \u2014the sum of tidal volume, inspira-tory reserve, and expiratory reserve. Stated another way, vital capacity is the amount of air involved inthe deepest inhalation followed by the most force-ful exhalation. Average range of vital capacity is3500 to 5000 mL. 6.Residual air \u2014the amount of air that remains in the lungs after the most forceful exhalation; theaverage range is 1000 to 1500 mL. Residual air isimportant to ensure that there is some air in thelungs at all times, so that exchange of gases is a con-tinuous process, even between breaths. Some of the volumes just described can be deter- mined with instruments called spirometers, whichmeasure movement of air. T rained singers and musi-cians who play wind instruments often have vitalcapacities much larger than would be expected fortheir height and age, because their respiratory muscleshave become more efficient with \"practice.\" The sameis true for athletes who exercise regularly. A personwith emphysema, however, must \"work\" to exhale,and vital capacity and expiratory reserve volume areoften much lower than average. Another kind of pulmonary volume is alveolarThe Respiratory System 353 BOX15-5 THE HEIMLICH MANEUVER TheHeimlich maneuver has received much well- deserved publicity, and indeed it is a life-savingtechnique. If a person is choking on a foreign object (such as food) lodged in the pharynx or larynx, the air inthe lungs may be utilized to remove the object. Thephysiology of this technique is illustrated in theaccompanying gure. The person performing the maneuver stands behind the choking victim and puts both armsaround the victim's waist. One hand forms a stthat is placed between the victim's navel and ribcage (below the diaphragm), and the other handcovers the st. It is important to place hands cor-rectly, in order to avoid breaking the victim's ribs.With both hands, a quick, forceful upward thrust ismade and repeated if necessary. This forces thediaphragm upward to compress the lungs and forceair out. The forcefully expelled air is often sufficientto dislodge the foreign object. Foreign object Lung Diaphragm Box The Heimlich maneuver.15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 353ventilation , which is the amount of air that actually reaches the alveoli and participates in gas exchange.An average tidal volume is 500 mL, of which 350 to400 mL is in the alveoli at the end of an inhalation.The remaining 100 to 150 mL of air is anatomic dead space , the air still within the respiratory passages. Despite the rather grim name, anatomic dead space isnormal; everyone has it. Physiological dead space is not normal, and is the volume of non-functioning alveoli that decrease gasexchange. Causes of increased physiological dead spaceinclude bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, emphy-sema, asthma, pulmonary edema, and a collapsed lung. The compliance of the thoracic wall and the lungs, that is, their normal expansibility, is necessary for suf-cient alveolar ventilation. Thoracic compliance maybe decreased by fractured ribs, scoliosis, pleurisy, orascites. Lung compliance will be decreased by anycondition that increases physiologic dead space. Nor-mal compliance thus promotes sufficient gas exchangein the alveoli. EXCHANGE OF GASES There are two sites of exchange of oxygen and carbondioxide: the lungs and the tissues of the body. Theexchange of gases between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries is called exter- nal respiration . This term may be a bit confusing at rst, because we often think of \"external\" as beingoutside the body. In this case, however, \"external\"means the exchange that involves air from the externalenvironment, though the exchange takes place withinthe lungs. Internal respiration is the exchange of gases between the blood in the systemic capillaries andthe tissue fluid (cells) of the body. The air we inhale (the earth's atmosphere) is approximately 21% oxygen and 0.04% carbon diox-ide. Although most (78%) of the atmosphere is nitro- gen, this gas is not physiologically available to us, andwe simply exhale it. This exhaled air also containsabout 16% oxygen and 4.5% carbon dioxide, so it isapparent that some oxygen is retained within the bodyand the carbon dioxide produced by cells is exhaled. DIFFUSION OF GASES\u2014 PARTIAL PRESSURES Within the body, a gas will diffuse from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentra-tion. The concentration of each gas in a particular site(alveolar air, pulmonary blood, and so on) is expressedin a value called partial pressure . The partial pressure354 The Respiratory System Figure 15-7. Pulmonary volumes. See text for descrip-tion.QUESTION: Which volumes make up vital capacity?

The abbreviation forpartial pressure is \"P ,\" which is used, for example, onhospital lab slips for blood gases and will be used here. The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide at the sites of external respiration (lungs) and internalrespiration (body) are shown in Fig. 15-8. Becausepartial pressure reflects concentration, a gas will dif-fuse from an area of higher partial pressure to an areaof lower partial pressure. The air in the alveoli has a high P O2and a low P CO2. The blood in the pulmonary capillaries, which has justcome from the body, has a low P O2and a high P CO2. Therefore, in external respiration, oxygen diffusesfrom the air in the alveoli to the blood, and carbondioxide diffuses from the blood to the air in the alveoli.The blood that returns to the heart now has a high P O2 and a low P CO2and is pumped by the left ventricle into systemic circulation. The arterial blood that reaches systemic capillaries has a high P O2and a low P CO2. The body cells and tis-sue fluid have a low P O2and a high P CO2because cells continuously use oxygen in cell respiration (energyproduction) and produce carbon dioxide in thisprocess. Therefore, in internal respiration, oxygen dif-fuses from the blood to tissue fluid (cells), and carbondioxide diffuses from tissue fluid to the blood. Theblood that enters systemic veins to return to the heartnow has a low P O2and a high P CO2and is pumped by the right ventricle to the lungs to participate in exter-nal respiration. Disorders of gas exchange often involve the lungs, that is, external respiration (see Box 15-6: PulmonaryEdema and Box 15-7: Pneumonia). TRANSPORT OF GASES IN THE BLOOD Although some oxygen is dissolved in blood plasmaand does create the P O2values, it is only about 1.5% of the total oxygen transported, not enough to sustainlife. As you already know, most oxygen is carried in theblood bonded to the hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs). The mineral iron is part of hemoglobin andgives this protein its oxygen-carrying ability.The Respiratory System 355 Table 15-1 PARTIAL PRESSURES AND OXYGEN SATURATION Site P O2(mmHg) P CO2(mmHg) Hemoglobin Saturation (SaO2) Atmosphere 160 0.15 \u2014 Alveolar air 104 40 \u2014 Systemic venous blood 40 45 70-75% (to pulmonary arteries) Systemic arterial blood 100 40 95-100% (from pulmonary veins) Tissue fluid 40 50 \u2014 Partial pressure is calculated as follows: % of the gas in the mixture /H11003total Notice that alveolar partial pressures are not exactly those of the atmosphere. Alveolar air contains signicant amounts of water vapor and the CO2diffusing in from the blood. Oxygen also diffuses readily from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries. Therefore, alveolar P O2is lower than atmospheric P O2, and alveolar CO2is signicantly higher 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 355The oxygen-hemoglobin bond is formed in the lungs where P O2is high. This bond, however, is rela- tively unstable, and when blood passes through tissueswith a low P O2, the bond breaks, and oxygen is released to the tissues. The lower the oxygen concen-tration in a tissue, the more oxygen the hemoglobinwill release. This ensures that active tissues, such as exercising muscles, receive as much oxygen as possible to continue cell respiration. Other factors that increasethe release of oxygen from hemoglobin are a highP CO2(actually a lower pH) and a high temperature, both of which are also characteristic of active tissues.Another measure of blood oxygen is the percent of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (Sa O2). The higher the P O2, the higher the Sa O2, and as P O2decreases, so does Sa O2, though not as rapidly. A P O2of 100 is an SaO2of about 97% , as is found in systemic arteries. A PO2of 40, as is found in systemic veins, is an Sa O2of about 75%. Notice that venous blood still has quite abit of oxygen. Had this blood flowed through a veryactive tissue, more of its oxygen would have been released from hemoglobin. This venous reserve ofoxygen provides active tissues with the oxygen they need (see also Box 15-8: Carbon Monoxide).356 The Respiratory System Pulmonary Po capillariesFigure 15-8.

The partial pressures of oxygen andcarbon dioxide are shown ateach site.QUESTION: In external respi- ration, describe the movement of oxygen. In internal respira-tion, describe the movementof carbon dioxide.15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 356The Respiratory System 357 BOX15-8 CARBON MONOXIDE light skin as cyanosis , a bluish cast to the skin, lips, and nail beds. This is because hemoglobin is darkred unless something (usually oxygen) is bonded toit. When hemoglobin bonds to CO, however, itbecomes a bright, cherry red. This color may beseen in light skin and may be very misleading; theperson with CO poisoning is in a severely hypoxicstate. Although CO is found in cigarette smoke, it is present in such minute quantities that it is not lethal. Heavy smokers, however, may be in a mild but chronic hypoxic state because much of theirhemoglobin is rmly bonded to CO. As a compen-sation, RBC production may increase, and a heavysmoker may have a hematocrit over 50% .Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gasthat is produced during the combustion of fuelssuch as gasoline, coal, oil, and wood. As you know,CO is a poison that may cause death if inhaled inmore than very small quantities or for more than ashort period of time. The reason CO is so toxic is that it forms a very strong and stable bond with the hemoglobin inRBCs (carboxyhemoglobin). Hemoglobin with CObonded to it cannot bond to and transport oxygen. The effect of CO, therefore, is to drastically decrease the amount of oxygen carried in the blood. As littleas 0.1% CO in inhaled air can saturate half the totalhemoglobin with CO. Lack of oxygen is often apparent in people with BOX15-6 PULMONARY EDEMA capillaries. As blood pressure increases in the pul- monary capillaries, ltration creates tissue fluid thatcollects in the alveoli. Fluid-lled alveoli are no longer sites of efficient gas exchange, and the resulting hypoxia leads tothe symptoms of dyspnea and increased respira- tory rate. The most effective treatment is that whichrestores the pumping ability of the heart to normal.Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli. This is often a consequence of conges-tive heart failure in which the left side of the heart(or the entire heart) is not pumping efficiently. If theleft ventricle does not pump strongly, the chamberdoes not empty as it should and cannot receive allthe blood flowing in from the left atrium. Bloodflow, therefore, is \"congested,\" and blood backs upin the pulmonary veins and then in the pulmonary BOX15-7 PNEUMONIA that accumulates in the air sacs. Many neutrophils migrate to the site of infection and attempt tophagocytize the bacteria. The alveoli become lledwith fluid, bacteria, and neutrophils (this is calledconsolidation); this decreases the exchange ofgases. Pneumovax is a vaccine for this type of pneumo- nia. It contains only the capsules of S.pneumoniae and cannot cause the disease. The vaccine is rec-ommended for people over the age of 60 years,and for those with chronic pulmonary disorders orany debilitating disease. It has also been approvedfor administration to infants.Pneumonia is a bacterial infection of the lungs. Although many bacteria can cause pneumonia,the most common one is probably Streptococcus pneumoniae . This species is estimated to cause at least 500,000 cases of pneumonia every year in theUnited States, with 50,000 deaths. S.pneumoniae is a transient inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract, but in otherwise healthypeople, the ciliated epithelium and the immune sys-tem prevent infection. Most cases of pneumoniaoccur in elderly people following a primary infec-tion such as influenza. When the bacteria are able to establish them- selves in the alveoli, the alveolar cells secrete fluid15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 357Carbon dioxide transport is a little more compli- cated. Some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma,and some is carried by hemoglobin (carbaminohemo-globin), but these account for only about 20% of totalCO 2transport. Most carbon dioxide is carried in the plasma in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). Let us look at the reactions that transform CO2into a bicarbonate ion. When carbon dioxide enters the blood, most dif- fuses into red blood cells, which contain the enzymecarbonic anhydrase . This enzyme (which contains zinc) catalyzes the reaction of carbon dioxide andwater to form carbonic bicarbonate ions diffuse out of the red blood cells into the plasma, leaving the hydrogen ions (H+) in the red blood cells. The many H+ions would tend to make the red blood cells too acidic, but hemoglobinacts as a buffer to prevent acidosis. T o maintain anionic equilibrium, chloride ions (Cl -) from the plasma enter the red blood cells; this is called the chlorideshift. Where is the CO 2? It is in the plasma as part of HCO3-ions. When the blood reaches the lungs, an area of lower P CO2, these reactions are reversed, and CO2is re-formed and diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled. REGULATION OF RESPIRATION T wo types of mechanisms regulate breathing: nervousmechanisms and chemical mechanisms. Because anychanges in the rate or depth of breathing are ulti-mately brought about by nerve impulses, we will con-sider nervous mechanisms rst. NERVOUS REGULATION The respiratory centers are located in the medulla and pons , which are parts of the brain stem (see Fig. 15-9). Within the medulla are the inspiration centerand expiration center. The inspiration center automatically generates impulses in rhythmic spurts. These impulses travelalong nerves to the respiratory muscles to stimulatetheir contraction. The result is inhalation. As the lungs inflate, baroreceptors in lung tissue detect thisstretching and generate sensory impulses to themedulla; these impulses begin to depress the inspira-tion center. This is called the Hering-Breuer inflationreflex, which also helps prevent overinflation of thelungs. As the inspiration center is depressed, the result is a decrease in impulses to the respiratory muscles,which relax to bring about exhalation. Then the inspi-ration center becomes active again to begin anothercycle of breathing. When there is a need for moreforceful exhalations, such as during exercise, the inspi-ration center activates the expiration center , which generates impulses to the internal intercostal andabdominal muscles. The two respiratory centers in the pons work with the inspiration center to produce a normal rhythm ofbreathing. The apneustic center prolongs inhalation, and is then interrupted by impulses from the pneu- motaxic center , which contributes to exhalation. In normal breathing, inhalation lasts 1 to 2 seconds, fol-lowed by a slightly longer (2 to 3 seconds) exhalation,producing the normal respiratory rate range of 12 to20 breaths per minute. What has just been described is normal breathing, but variations are possible and quite common. Emo-tions often affect respiration; a sudden fright may bringabout a gasp or a scream, and anger usually increasesthe respiratory rate. In these situations, impulses fromthe hypothalamus modify the output from the medulla. The cerebral cortex enables us to voluntar- ily change our breathing rate or rhythm to talk, sing,breathe faster or slower, or even to stop breathing for1 or 2 minutes. Such changes cannot be continuedindenitely, however, and the medulla will eventuallyresume control. Coughing and sneezing are reflexes that remove irritants from the respiratory passages; the medullacontains the centers for both of these reflexes. Sneez-ing is stimulated by an irritation of the nasal mucosa,and coughing is stimulated by irritation of the mucosaof the pharynx, larynx, or trachea. The reflex action same for both: An inhalation is followedby exhalation beginning with the glottis closed tobuild up pressure. Then the glottis opens suddenly,and the exhalation is explosive. A cough directs theexhalation out the mouth, while a sneeze directs theexhalation out the nose.358 The Respiratory System15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 358Hiccups, also a reflex, are spasms of the diaphragm. The result is a quick inhalation that is stopped whenthe glottis snaps shut, causing the \"hic\" sound. Thestimulus may be irritation of the phrenic nerves or nerves of the stomach. Excessive alcohol is an irri-tant that can cause hiccups. Some causes are simplyunknown. Yet another respiratory reflex is yawning. Most of us yawn when we are tired, but the stimulus for andpurpose of yawning are not known with certainty.There are several possibilities, such as lack of oxygenor accumulation of carbon dioxide, but we really do not know. Nor do we know why yawning is conta-gious, but seeing someone yawn is almost sure to elicita yawn of one's own. You may even have yawned whilereading this paragraph about yawning. CHEMICAL REGULATION Chemical regulation refers to the effect on breathingof blood pH and blood levels of oxygen and carbondioxide. This is shown in Fig. 15-10. 15-9. Nervous regulation of respiration. ( A) Midsagittal section of brain. (B) Respiratory centers in medulla and pons. ( C) Respiratory muscles. See text for descrip- tion. QUESTION: Which center directly stimulates inhalation? How can tell from this picture?15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 359tors that detect changes in blood gases and pH are located in the carotid and aortic bodies and in themedulla itself. A decrease in the blood level of oxygen (hypoxia) is detected by the chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies . The sensory impulses generated by these receptors travel along the glossopharyngeal andvagus nerves to the medulla, which responds byincreasing respiratory rate or depth (or both). Thisresponse will bring more air into the lungs so thatmore oxygen can diffuse into the blood to correct thehypoxic state. Carbon dioxide becomes a problem when it is pres- ent in excess in the blood, because excess CO 2(hyper- capnia ) lowers the pH when it reacts with water to form carbonic acid (a source of H+ions). That is, excess CO2makes the blood or other body fluids less alkaline (or more acidic). The medulla contains chemoreceptors that are very sensitive to changes in pH, especially decreases. If accumulating CO2low- ers blood pH, the medulla responds by increasing res-piration. This is not for the purpose of inhaling, butrather to exhale more CO 2to raise the pH back to normal. Of the two respiratory gases, which is the more important as a regulator of respiration? Our guessmight be oxygen, because it is essential for energy pro-duction in cell respiration. However, the respiratorysystem can maintain a normal blood level of oxygeneven if breathing decreases to half the normal rate orstops for a few moments. Recall that exhaled air is16% oxygen. This oxygen did not enter the blood butwas available to do so if needed. Also, the residual air in the lungs supplies oxygen to the blood even ifbreathing rate slows. Therefore, carbon dioxide must be the major regu- lator of respiration, and the reason is that carbon diox- ide affects the pH of the blood. As was just mentioned, an excess of CO 2causes the blood pH to decrease, a process that must not be allowed to continue.Therefore, any increase in the blood CO 2level is quickly compensated for by increased breathing toexhale more CO 2. If, for example, you hold your breath, what is it that makes you breathe again? Haveyou run out of oxygen? Probably not, for the reasonsmentioned. What has happened is that accumulatingCO 2has lowered blood pH enough to stimulate the medulla to start the breathing cycle again. In some situations, oxygen does become the major regulator of respiration. People with severe, chronicpulmonary diseases such as emphysema have de-creased exchange of both oxygen and carbon dioxidein the lungs. The decrease in pH caused by accumu-lating CO 2is corrected by the kidneys, but the blood oxygen level keeps decreasing. Eventually, the oxygenlevel may fall so low that it does provide a very strongstimulus to increase the rate and depth of respiration. RESPIRATION AND ACID-BASE BALANCE As you have just seen, respiration affects the pH ofbody fluids because it regulates the amount of carbon360 The Respiratory System Chemoreceptors in carotid andaortic bodies Chemoreceptors in medullaO 2 CO 2 or pHMedulla; inspirationcenterIncrease rate and depth ofrespirationMore O 2 available to enter blood More CO 2 exhaled pH Figure 15-10.

Explain why.15Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 360dioxide in these fluids. Remember that CO2reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which ion- into H+ions and HCO3-ions. The more hydro- gen ions present in a body fluid, the lower the pH, andthe fewer hydrogen ions present, the higher the pH. The respiratory system may be the cause of a pH imbalance, or it may help correct a pH imbalance cre-ated by some other cause. RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS AND ALKALOSIS Respiratory acidosis occurs when the rate or effi- ciency of respiration decreases, permitting carbondioxide to accumulate in body fluids. The excess CO 2 results in the formation of more H+ions, which decrease the pH. Holding one's breath can bring abouta mild respiratory acidosis, which will soon stimulatethe medulla to initiate breathing again. More seriouscauses of respiratory acidosis are pulmonary diseasessuch as pneumonia and emphysema, or severe asthma.Each of these impairs gas exchange and allows excessCO 2to remain in body fluids. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when the rate of res- piration increases, and CO2is very rapidly exhaled. Less CO2decreases H+ion formation, which increases the pH. Breathing faster for a few minutes can bringabout a mild state of respiratory alkalosis. Babies whocry for extended periods (crying is a noisy exhalation)put themselves in this condition. In general, however,respiratory alkalosis is not a common occurrence.Severe physical trauma and shock, or certain statesof mental or emotional anxiety, may be accompaniedby hyperventilation and also result in respiratoryalkalosis. In addition, traveling to a higher altitude(less oxygen in the atmosphere) may cause a tempo-rary increase in breathing rate before compensationoccurs (increased rate of RBC production\u2014see Chapter 11). RESPIRATORY COMPENSATION If a pH imbalance is caused by something other than a change in respiration, it is called metabolic acidosis oralkalosis. In either case, the change in pH stimulates achange in respiration that may help restore the pH ofbody fluids to normal. Metabolic acidosis may be caused by untreated diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis), kidney disease, orsevere diarrhea. In such situations, the H +ion concen-tration of body fluids is increased. Respiratory com- pensation involves an increase in the rate and depth ofrespiration to exhale more CO 2to decrease H+ion formation, which will raise the pH toward the normalrange. Metabolic alkalosis is not a common occurrence but may be caused by ingestion of excessive amountsof alkaline medications such as those used to relievegastric disturbances. Another possible cause is vomit-ing of stomach contents only. In such situations, theH +ion concentration of body fluids is decreased. Respiratory compensation involves a decrease in res-piration to retain CO 2in the body to increase H+ion formation, which will lower the pH toward the normalrange. Respiratory compensation for an ongoing meta- bolic pH imbalance cannot be complete, because thereare limits to the amounts of CO 2that may be exhaled or retained. At most, respiratory compensation is onlyabout 75% effective. A complete discussion of acid-base balance is found in Chapter 19. AGING AND THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Perhaps the most important way to help your respira-tory system age gracefully is not to smoke. In theabsence of chemical assault, respiratory function doesdiminish but usually remains adequate. The respira-tory muscles, like all skeletal muscles, weaken withage. Lung tissue loses its elasticity and alveoli arelost as their walls deteriorate. All of this results in de-creased ventilation and lung capacity, but the remain-ing capacity is usually sufficient for ordinary activities.The cilia of the respiratory mucosa deteriorate withage, and the alveolar macrophages are not as efficient,which make elderly people more prone to pneumonia,a serious pulmonary infection. Chronic alveolar hypoxia from diseases such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis may lead to pul-monary hypertension, which in turn overworks theright ventricle of the heart. Systemic hypertensionoften weakens the left ventricle of the heart, leading tocongestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, inwhich excess tissue fluid collects in the alveoli anddecreases gas exchange. Though true at any age, theinterdependence of the respiratory and circulatorysystems is particularly apparent in elderly people.The Respiratory System 36115Scanlon(p3)-ch15 8/17/06 10:57 AM Page 361SUMMARY As you have learned, respiration is much more than the simple mechanical actions of breathing. Inhalationprovides the body with the oxygen that is necessary forthe production of ATP in the process of cell respira-tion. Exhalation removes the CO 2that is a product ofcell respiration. Breathing also regulates the level of CO2within the body, and this contributes to the maintenance of the acid-base balance of body fluids.Although the respiratory gases do not form structuralcomponents of the body, their contributions to thechemical level of organization are essential to thefunctioning of the body at every level.362 The Respiratory System STUDY OUTLINE The respiratory system moves air into and out of the lungs, which are the site ofexchange for O 2and CO2between the air and the blood. The functioning of the respi-ratory system depends directly on theproper functioning of the circulatory system.1. The upper respiratory tract consists of those parts outside the chest cavity. 2.

Alveolar macrophages phagocytize foreign mate- rial. Mechanism of Breathing 1. Ventilation is the movement of air into and out of the lungs: inhalation and exhalation. 2. Respiratory centers are in the medulla and pons.3. Respiratory muscles are the diaphragm and exter- nal and internal intercostal muscles (see Fig. 15-6). Atmospheric pressure is air pressure: 760 mmHg at sea level. Intrapleural pressure is within the potential pleu- ral space; always slightly below atmosphericpressure (\"negative\"). Intrapulmonic pressure is within the bronchial tree and alveoli; fluctuates during breathing. Inhalation (inspiration) 1. Motor impulses from medulla travel along phrenic nerves to diaphragm, which contracts and movesdown. Impulses are sent along intercostal nerves toexternal intercostal muscles, which pull ribs up andout. 2. The chest cavity is expanded and expands the pari- etal pleura. 3. The visceral pleura adheres to the parietal pleura and is also expanded and in turn expands the lungs. 4. Intrapulmonic pressure decreases, and air rushes into the lungs. Exhalation (expiration) 1. Motor impulses from the medulla decrease, and the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax. 2. The chest cavity becomes smaller and compresses the lungs. 3. The elastic lungs recoil and further compress the alveoli. 4. Intrapulmonic pressure increases, and air is forced out of the lungs. Normal exhalation is passive. 5.

Exchange of Gases 1. External respiration is the exchange of gases between the air in the alveoli and the blood in thepulmonary capillaries. 2. Internal respiration is the exchange of gases between blood in the systemic capillaries and tissuefluid (cells). 3. Inhaled air (atmosphere) is 21% O CO2. Exhaled Diffusion of O2and CO2in the body occurs because of pressure gradients (see T able 15-1). Agas will diffuse from an area of higher partial pres-sure to an area of lower partial pressure. 5. External respiration: P O2in the alveoli is high, and PO2in the pulmonary capillaries is low, so O2dif- fuses from the air to the blood. P CO2in the alveoli is low, and P CO2in the pulmonary capillaries is high, so CO2diffuses from the blood to the air and is exhaled (see Fig. 15-8). 6. Internal respiration: P O2in the systemic capillaries is high, and P O2in the tissue fluid is low, so O2dif- fuses from the blood to the tissue fluid and cells.P CO2in the systemic capillaries is low, and P CO2in the tissue fluid is high, so CO2diffuses from the tis- sue fluid to the blood (see Fig. 15-8). Transport of Gases in the Blood 1. Oxygen is carried by the iron of hemoglobin (Hb) in the RBCs. The O2-Hb bond is formed in the lungs where the P O2is high. 2. In tissues, Hb releases much of its O2; the impor- tant factors are low P O2in tissues, high P CO2in tis- sues, and a high temperature in tissues. 3. Oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (Sa O2) is 95% to 97% in systemic arteries and averages 70% to 75%in systemic veins. 4. Most CO 2is carried as HCO3-ions in blood plasma. CO2enters the RBCs and enter the plasma; buffers the H+ions that remain in the RBCs. Cl-ions from the plasma enter the RBCs to maintain ionic equilibrium (the chloride shift). 5. When blood reaches the lungs, CO2is re-formed, diffuses into the alveoli, and is exhaled.Nervous Regulation of Respiration (see Fig. 15-9)1. The medulla contains the inspiration center and expiration center. 2. Impulses from the inspiration center to the respira- tory muscles cause their contraction; the chest cav-ity is expanded. 3. Baroreceptors in lung tissue detect stretching and send impulses to the medulla to depress the inspi-ration center. This is the Hering-Breuer inflationreflex, which also prevents overinflation of thelungs. 4. The expiration center is stimulated by the inspi- ration center when forceful exhalations are needed. 5. In the pons: the apneustic center prolongs inhala- tion, and the pneumotaxic center helps bring aboutexhalation. These centers work with the inspirationcenter in the medulla to produce a normal breath-ing rhythm. 6. The hypothalamus influences changes in breathing in emotional situations. The cerebral cortex per-mits voluntary changes in breathing. 7. Coughing and sneezing remove irritants from the upper respiratory tract; the centers for thesereflexes are in the medulla. Chemical Regulation of Respiration (see Fig. 15-10)1. Decreased blood O 2is detected by chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic body. Response:increased respiration to take more air into thelungs. 2. Increased blood CO 2level is detected by chemo- receptors in the medulla. Response: increased res-piration to exhale more CO 2. 3. CO2is the major regulator of respiration because excess CO2decreases the pH of body fluids (CO2+ H2O H2CO3H++ HCO3-). Excess H+ions lower pH. 4. Oxygen becomes a major regulator of respiration when blood level is very low, as may occur withsevere, chronic pulmonary disease. Respiration and Acid-Base Balance 1. Respiratory acidosis: a decrease in the rate or effi- ciency of respiration permits excess CO 2to accu- mulate in body fluids, resulting in the formation ofexcess H +ions, which lower pH.

Food. We may take food for granted, cele-brate with it, or wish we wouldn't eat quite so much ofit. Although food is not as immediate a need forhuman beings as is oxygen, it is a very important partof our lives. Food provides the raw materials or nutri-ents that cells use to reproduce and to build new tis-sue. The energy needed for cell reproduction andtissue building is released from food in the process ofcell respiration. In fact, a supply of nutrients from reg-ular food intake is so important that the body can evenstore any excess for use later. Those \"extra 5 pounds\"are often stored fat in adipose tissue. The food we eat, however, is not in a form that our body cells can use. A turkey sandwich, for example,consists of complex proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.The function of the digestive system is to change these complex organic nutrient molecules into simpleorganic and inorganic molecules that can then beabsorbed into the blood or lymph to be transported tocells. In this chapter we will discuss the organs ofdigestion and the contribution each makes to diges-tion and absorption. DIVISIONS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM The two divisions of the digestive system are the ali-mentary tube and the accessory organs (Fig. 16-1).The alimentary tube extends from the mouth to the anus. It consists of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus,stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.Digestion takes place within the oral cavity, stomach,and small intestine; most absorption of nutrients takesplace in the small intestine. Undigestible material, pri-marily cellulose, is eliminated by the large intestine(also called the colon). The accessory organs of digestion are the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.Digestion does not take place within these organs, but each contributes something tothe digestive process. TYPES OF DIGESTION The food we eat is broken down in two complemen- tary processes: mechanical digestion and chemicaldigestion. Mechanical digestion is the physical break- ing up of food into smaller pieces. Chewing is anexample of this. As food is broken up, more of its sur-face area is exposed for the action of digestive enzymes.Enzymes are discussed in Chapter 2. The work of thedigestive enzymes is the chemical digestion of bro- ken-up food particles, in which complex chemical mol-ecules are changed into much simpler chemicals thatthe body can utilize. Such enzymes are specic withrespect to the fat, protein, or carbohydrate food mole-cules each can digest. For example, protein-digestingenzymes work only on proteins, not on carbohydratesor fats. Each enzyme is produced by a particular diges-tive organ and functions at a specic site. However, theenzyme's site of action may or may not be its site ofproduction. These digestive enzymes and their func-tions are discussed in later sections. END PRODUCTS OF DIGESTION Before we describe the organs of digestion, let us seewhere the process of digestion will take us, or rather,will take our food. The three types of complex organicmolecules found in food are carbohydrates, proteins,and fats. Each of these complex molecules is digestedto a much more simple substance that the body canthen use. Carbohydrates, such as starches and disac-charides, are digested to monosaccharides such as glu-cose, fructose, and galactose. Proteins are digested toamino acids, and fats are digested to fatty acids andglycerol. Also part of food, and released during diges-tion, are vitamins, minerals, and water. We will now return to the beginning of the alimen- tary tube and consider the digestive organs and theprocess of digestion. ORAL CAVITY Food enters the oral cavity (or buccal cavity ) by way of the mouth. The boundaries of the oral cavity arethe hard and soft palates superiorly; the cheeks later-ally; and the floor of the mouth inferiorly. Within theoral cavity are the teeth and tongue and the openingsof the ducts of the salivary glands. TEETH The function of the teeth is, of course, chewing. This is the process that mechanically breaks food intosmaller pieces and mixes it with saliva. An individual370 The System16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 canalPharynx Figure 16-1.

(The spleen is not a digestive organ but is included to show its location relativeto the stomach, pancreas, and colon.)QUESTION: In which parts of the digestive system does digestion actu- ally take place? develops two sets of teeth: deciduous and permanent. The deciduous teeth begin to erupt through the gums at about 6 months of age, and the set of 20 teethis usually complete by the age of 2 years. These teethare gradually lost throughout childhood and replacedby the permanent teeth , the rst of which are molars that emerge around the age of 6 years. A complete setof permanent teeth consists of 32 teeth; the types of teeth are incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Thewisdom teeth are the third molars on either side ofeach jawbone. In some people, the wisdom teeth maynot emerge from the jawbone because there is noroom for them along the gum line. These wisdomteeth are said to be impacted and may put pressure on16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 371the roots of the second molars. In such cases, extrac- tion of a wisdom tooth may be necessary to preventdamage to other teeth. The structure of a tooth is shown in Fig. 16-2. The crown is visible above the gum ( gingiva ). The root is enclosed in a socket in the mandible or maxillae. Theperiodontal membrane lines the socket and produces a bone-like cement that anchors the tooth. The outer-most layer of the crown is enamel , which is made by cells called ameloblasts. Enamel provides a hard chew-ing surface and is more resistant to decay than areother parts of the tooth. Within the enamel is dentin , which is very similar to bone and is produced by cellscalled odontoblasts. Dentin also forms the roots of atooth. The innermost portion of a tooth is the pulp cavity , which contains blood vessels and nerve end- ings of the trigeminal nerve (5th cranial). Erosion ofthe and dentin layers by bacterial acids (dentalcaries or cavities) may result in bacterial invasion ofthe pulp cavity and a very painful toothache. TONGUE The tongue is made of skeletal muscle that is inner- vated by the hypoglossal nerves (12th cranial). On theupper surface of the tongue are small projectionscalled papillae , many of which contain taste buds (see also Chapter 9). The sensory nerves for taste are alsocranial nerves: the facial (7th) and glossopharyngeal(9th). As you know, the sense of taste is importantbecause it makes eating enjoyable, but the tongue hasother functions as well. Chewing is efficient because of the action of the tongue in keeping the food between the teeth andmixing it with saliva. Elevation of the tongue is therst step in swallowing. This is a voluntary action, inwhich the tongue contracts and meets the resistance ofthe hard palate. The mass of food, called a bolus, isthus pushed backward toward the pharynx. Theremainder of swallowing is a reflex, which is describedin the section on the pharynx. SALIVARY GLANDS The digestive secretion in the oral cavity is saliva , produced by three pairs of salivary glands , which are shown in Fig. 16-3. The parotid glands are just below and in front of the ears. The submandibular (also called submaxillary) glands are at the posteriorcorners of the mandible, and the sublingual glands are below the floor of the mouth. Each gland has atleast one duct that takes saliva to the oral cavity. Secretion of saliva is continuous, but the amount varies in different situations. The presence of food(or anything else) in the mouth increases saliva secre-tion. This is a parasympathetic response mediatedby the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. The sightor smell of food also increases secretion of saliva.Sympathetic stimulation in stress situations decreasessecretion, making the mouth dry and swallowingdifficult. Saliva is mostly water, which is important to dis- solve food for tasting and to moisten food for swal-lowing. The digestive enzyme in saliva is salivaryamylase, which breaks down starch molecules toshorter chains of glucose molecules, or to maltose, adisaccharide. Most of us, however, do not chew ourfood long enough for the action of salivary amylase tobe truly effective. As you will see, another amylasefrom the pancreas is also available to digest starch.T able 16-1 summarizes the functions of digestivesecretions. Saliva is made from blood plasma and thus contains many of the chemicals that are found in plasma.Considerable research is focused on detecting in salivachemical markers for diseases such as cancer, with the372 The Digestive System Enamel Dentin Pulp cavity Gingiva (gum) Periodontal membrane Blood vesselsCrown Neck Root Nerve Figure 16-2.

How do you know?16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 372goal of using saliva rather than blood for diagnostic tests. PHARYNX As described in the preceding chapter, the oropharynxand laryngopharynx are food passageways connectingthe oral cavity to the esophagus. No digestion takesplace in the pharynx. Its only related function is swal-lowing, the mechanical movement of food. When thebolus of food is pushed backward by the tongue, theconstrictor muscles of the pharynx contract as part ofthe swallowing reflex. The reflex center for swallow-ing is in the medulla, which coordinates the manyactions that take place: constriction of the pharynx,cessation of breathing, elevation of the soft palate toblock the nasopharynx, elevation of the larynx and clo-sure of the epiglottis, and peristalsis of the esophagus. As you can see, swallowing is rather complicated, butbecause it is a reflex we don't have to think about mak-ing it happen correctly. T alking or laughing while eat-ing, however, may interfere with the reflex and causefood to go into the \"wrong pipe,\" the larynx. Whenthat happens, the cough reflex is usually effective inclearing the airway. ESOPHAGUS The esophagus is a muscular tube that takes food from the pharynx to the stomach; no digestion takesplace here. Peristalsis of the esophagus propels food inone direction and ensures that food gets to the stom-ach even if the body is horizontal or upside down. Atthe junction with the stomach, the lumen (cavity) ofthe esophagus is surrounded by the lower esophageal sphincter (LES or cardiac sphincter), a circular smooth muscle. The LES relaxes to permit food toenter the stomach, then contracts to prevent thebackup of stomach contents. If the LES does not closecompletely, gastric juice may splash up into the esoph-agus; this is a painful condition we call heartburn, orgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Most peopleexperience heartburn once in a while, and it is merelyuncomfortable, but chronic GERD is more serious.The lining of the esophagus cannot withstand the cor-rosive action of gastric acid and will be damaged, per-haps resulting in bleeding or even perforation.Medications are available to treat this condition. STRUCTURAL LAYERS OF THE ALIMENTARY TUBE Before we continue with our discussion of the organsof digestion, we will rst examine the typical structureof the alimentary tube. When viewed in cross-section,the alimentary tube has four layers (Fig. 16-4): themucosa, submucosa, external muscle layer, and serosa.Each layer has a specic structure, and its functionscontribute to the functioning of the organs of which itis a part. MUCOSA The mucosa , or lining, of the alimentary tube is made of epithelial tissue, areolar left lateral view. QUESTION: Why are these exocrine glands?

( B) Sagittal section through the abdomen showing the relationship of theperitoneum and mesentery to the abdominal organs. QUESTION: What is the function of the external mus- cle layer?16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 375thin layers of esophagus the epithelium is stratied squamous epithelium; in epithe-lium. The epithelium secretes mucus, which lubricatesthe passage of food, and also secretes the digestiveenzymes of the stomach and small intestine. Justbelow the epithelium, within the areolar connectivetissue, are lymph contain lymphocytes toproduce antibodies, and macrophages to phagocytizebacteria or other foreign material that get through theepithelium. The thin layers of smooth muscle createfolds in the mucosa, and ripples, so that all of theepithelial cells are in touch with the contents of theorgan. In the stomach and small intestine this isimportant for absorption. SUBMUCOSA The submucosa is made of areolar connective tissue with many blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Manymillions of nerve bers are also present, part of whatis called the enteric nervous system , or the \"brain of the gut,\" which extends the entire length of the ali-mentary tube. The nerve networks in the submucosaare called Meissner's plexus (or submucosal plexus), and increase secretions, whereassympathetic impulses decrease secretions. Sensoryneurons are also present to the smooth muscle (astretched or cramping gut is painful), as are motorneurons to blood vessels, to regulate vessel diameterand blood flow. EXTERNAL MUSCLE LAYER The external muscle layer typically contains two layersof smooth muscle: an inner, circular layer and an outer,longitudinal layer. Variations from the typical dooccur, however. In the esophagus, this layer is striatedmuscle in the upper third, which gradually changes tosmooth muscle in the lower portions. The stomach hasthree layers of smooth muscle, rather than two. Contractions of this muscle layer help break up food and mix it with digestive juices. The one-waycontractions of peristalsis move the food toward the anus. Auerbach's plexus (or myenteric plexus) is the portion of the enteric nervous system in this layer, andsome of its millions of neurons are autonomic. Sympa-thetic impulses decrease contractions and peristalsis,whereas parasympathetic impulses increase contrac-tions and peristalsis, promoting normal digestion. The parasympathetic nerves are the vagus (10th cranial)nerves; they truly live up to the meaning of vagus , which is \"wanderer.\" SEROSA Above the diaphragm, is peritoneum, membrane. the peritoneum, usually simplycalled the peritoneum . The peritoneum-mesentery is actually one continuous membrane (see Fig. 16-4).The serous fluid between the peritoneum and mesen-tery prevents friction when the alimentary tube con-tracts and the organs slide against one another. The preceding descriptions are typical of the layers of the alimentary tube. As noted, variations are possi-ble, and any important differences are mentioned inthe sections that follow on specic organs. STOMACH The stomach is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdominal cavity, to the left of the liver and infront of the spleen. Although part of the alimentarytube, the stomach is not a tube, but rather a sac thatextends from the esophagus to the small intestine.Because it is a sac, the stomach is a reservoir for food,so that digestion proceeds gradually and we do nothave to eat constantly. Both mechanical and chemicaldigestion take place in the stomach. The parts of the stomach are shown in Fig. 16-5. The cardiac orice is the opening of the esophagus,and the fundus is the portion above the level of thisopening. The body of the stomach is the large central portion, bounded laterally by the greater curvature and medially by the lesser curvature. The pylorus is adja-cent to the duodenum of the small intestine, and thepyloric sphincter surrounds the junction of the two organs. The fundus and body are mainly storage areas,whereas most digestion takes place in the pylorus. When the stomach is empty, the mucosa appears wrinkled or folded. These folds are called rugae ; they flatten out as the stomach is lled and permit expan-sion of the lining without tearing it. The gastric pits are the glands of the stomach and consist of several376 The Digestive System16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM called gas- tric juice. Mucous cells secrete mucus, which coats the stomach lining and helps prevent erosion by thegastric juice. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen , called proton pumps , which secrete H +ions into the stomach cavity. The H+ions unite with Cl- ions that have diffused from the parietal cells to formHCl in the lumen of the stomach. HCl convertspepsinogen to pepsin, which then begins the digestionof proteins to polypeptides, and also gives gastric juice its pH of 1 to 2. This very acidic pH is necessary forpepsin to function and also kills most microorganismsthat enter the stomach. The parietal cells also secreteintrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorptionof vitamin B 12. Enteroendocrine cells called G cells secrete the hormone gastrin. Gastric juice is secreted in small amounts at the sight or smell of food. This is a parasympatheticresponse that ensures that some gastric juice will bepresent in the stomach when food arrives.

See text for functions.QUESTION: What is the function of the pyloric sphincter?16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 377ence of food in the stomach causes the G cells to secrete gastrin , a hormone that stimulates the secre- tion of greater amounts of gastric juice. The external muscle layer of the stomach consists of three layers of smooth muscle: circular, longitudi-nal, and oblique layers. These three layers are inner-vated by the myenteric plexuses of the enteric nervoussystem. Stimulatory impulses are carried theCNS by the vagus nerves (10th cranial) and providefor very efficient mechanical digestion to change foodinto a thick liquid called chyme. The pyloric sphincteris usually contracted when the stomach is churningfood; it relaxes at intervals to permit small amounts ofchyme to pass into the duodenum. This sphincter thencontracts again to prevent the backup of intestinalcontents into the stomach (see Box 16-1: Disorders ofthe Stomach). SMALL INTESTINE The small intestine is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diam- eter and approximately 20 feet (6 m) long and extendsfrom the stomach to the cecum of the large intestine.Within the abdominal cavity, the large intestine encir- cles the coils of the small intestine (see Fig. 16-1). The duodenum is the rst 10 inches (25 cm) of the small intestine. The common bile duct enters the duo-denum at the ampulla of Vater (or hepatopancreaticampulla). The jejunum is about 8 feet long, and the ileum is about 11 feet in length. In a living person, however, the small intestine is always contracted and istherefore somewhat shorter. Digestion is completed in the small intestine, and the end products of digestion are absorbed into theblood and lymph. The mucosa (see Fig. 16-4) hassimple columnar epithelium that includes cells withmicrovilli and goblet cells that secrete mucus.Enteroendocrine cells secrete the hormones of thesmall intestine. Lymph nodules called Peyer's patchesare especially abundant in the ileum to destroyabsorbed pathogens. The external muscle layer has thetypical circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layersthat mix the chyme with digestive secretions and toward the colon. Stimulatory impulsesto the enteric nerves of these muscle layers are carriedby the vagus nerves. The waves of peristalsis, however,can take place without stimulation by the central nerv-378 The Digestive System BOX16-1 DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH pyloric stenosis. Correcting this condition requires surgery to widen the opening in the sphincter. Agastric ulcer is an erosion of the mucosa of the stomach. Because the normal stomach lining isadapted to resist the corrosive action of gastricjuice, ulcer formation is the result of oversecretionof HCl or undersecretion of mucus. As erosion reaches the submucosa, small blood vessels are ruptured and bleed. If vomiting occurs,the vomitus has a \"coffee-ground\" appearance dueto the presence of blood acted on by gastric juice.A more serious complication is perforation of thestomach wall, with leakage of gastric contents intothe abdominal cavity, and peritonitis . The bacterium called Helicobacter pylori is the cause of most gastric ulcers. For many patients, afew weeks of antibiotic therapy to eradicate thisbacterium has produced rapid healing of theirulcers. This bacterium also seems to be responsiblefor virtually all cases of stomach cancer. The medications that decrease the secretion of HCl are useful for ulcer patients not helped byantibiotics.Vomiting is the expulsion of stomach and intes- tinal contents through the esophagus and mouth.Stimuli include irritation of the stomach, motionsickness, food poisoning, or diseases such as menin-gitis. The vomiting center is in the medulla, whichcoordinates the simultaneous contraction of the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles. This squeezes the stomach and upper intestine, expell-ing their contents. As part of the reflex, the loweresophageal sphincter relaxes, and the glottis closes.If the glottis fails to close, as may happen in alcoholor drug intoxication, aspiration of vomitus mayoccur and result in fatal obstruction of the respira-tory passages. Pyloric stenosis means that the opening of the pyloric sphincter is narrowed, and emptying of thestomach is impaired. This is most often a congeni-tal disorder caused by hypertrophy of the pyloricsphincter. For reasons unknown, this condition ismore common in male infants than in femaleinfants. When the stomach does not empty effi-ciently, its internal pressure increases. Vomitingrelieves the pressure; this is a classic symptom of16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 378ous system; the enteric nervous system can function independently and promote normal peristalsis. There are three sources of digestive secretions that function within the small intestine: the liver, the pan-creas, and the small intestine itself. We will return tothe small intestine after considering these otherorgans. LIVER The liver (Fig. 16-6) consists of two large lobes, right and left, and lls the upper right and center of theabdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm. Thestructural unit of the liver is the liver lobule , a roughly hexagonal column of liver cells (hepatocytes).Between adjacent lobules are branches of the hepaticartery and portal vein. The capillaries of a lobule aresinusoids, large and very permeable vessels betweenthe rows of liver cells. The sinusoids receive bloodfrom both the hepatic artery and portal vein, and it iswith this mixture of blood that the liver cells carry outtheir functions. The hepatic artery brings oxygenatedblood, and the portal vein brings blood from the digestive organs and spleen (see Fig. 13-7). Each lob- ule has a central vein. The central veins of all the lob-ules unite to form the hepatic veins, which take bloodout of the liver to the inferior vena cava. The cells of the liver have many functions (which are discussed in a later section), but their only diges-tive function is the production of bile. Bile enters the small bile ducts, called bile canaliculi, on the livercells, which unite to form larger ducts and nallymerge to form the hepatic duct , which takes bile out of the 16-6). The hepatic duct uniteswith the Bile is mostly water and has an excretory function in that it carries bilirubin and excess cholesterol to theintestines for elimination in feces. The digestive func-tion of accomplished by bile emul- sifyfats in the small intestine. Emulsication means that large fat globules are broken into smaller glob-ules. This is mechanical, not chemical, digestion; thefat is still fat but now has more surface area to facili-tate chemical digestion. Production of bile is stimulated by the hormone secretin , which is produced by the duodenum when food enters the small intestine. T able 16-2 summa-The Digestive System 379 rizes the all digestive secre-tions. GALLBLADDER The gallbladder is a sac about 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) long located on the undersurface of the right lobeof the liver. Bile in the hepatic duct of the liver flowsthrough the cystic duct into the gallbladder (see Fig. 16-6), which stores bile until it is needed in the smallintestine. The gallbladder also concentrates bile byabsorbing water (see Box Gallstones). When fatty foods enter the duodenum, the of the mucosa secretethe hormone cholecystokinin . This hormone stimu- lates contraction of the smooth muscle in the wall ofthe gallbladder, which forces bile into the cystic duct,then into the common bile duct, and on into the duo-denum. PANCREAS The pancreas is located in the upper left abdominal quadrant between the curve of the duodenum and thespleen and is about 6 inches (15 cm) in length. Theendocrine functions of the pancreas were discussed inChapter 10, so only the exocrine functions will beconsidered here. The exocrine glands called acini (singular: acinus) (Fig. 16-7). Theyproduce enzymes that are involved in the digestion ofall three types of complex food molecules. The pancreatic enzyme amylase digests starch to maltose. You may recall is the \"backup\"enzyme for salivary amylase, though pancreatic amy-lase is responsible for most digestion of starch. Lipase converts emulsied fats to fatty acids and glycerol. The emulsifying or fat-separating action of bile saltsincreases the surface area of fats so that lipase workseffectively. T rypsinogen is an inactive enzyme the duodenum. T rypsin digests polypeptides to shorter chains of amino acids. The pancreatic enzyme juice is carried by small ducts that unite to form larger ducts, then nally themain pancreatic duct . An accessory duct may present. The main pancreatic duct emerges from themedial side of the pancreas and joins the common bileduct to the duodenum (see Fig. 16-7). The pancreas also produces a bicarbonate juice (containing sodium bicarbonate), which is alkaline.16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 Gallbladder Sinusoids Bile ductLiver artery Bile duct Hepatocytes B Figure 16-6.

QUESTION: In part B, trace the pathway of blood flow through a liver lobule.16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 380Because the gastric juice that enters the duodenum is very acidic, it must be neutralized to prevent dam-age to the duodenal mucosa. This neutralizing isaccomplished by the sodium bicarbonate in pancreaticjuice, and the pH of the duodenal chyme is raised toabout 7.5. Secretion of pancreatic juice is stimulated by the hormones secretin and cholecystokinin, which areproduced by the duodenal stimulates the by and chole-cystokinin stimulates the secretion of the pancreatic enzymes.

Medications that dissolve gallstones work slowly,over the course of several months, and are useful ifbiliary obstruction is not severe. An instrument that generates shock waves (called a lithotripter) may be used to pulverize the stones into smaller pieces thatmay easily pass into the duodenum; this procedureis called lithotripsy . Surgery to remove the gall- bladder (cholecystectomy) is required in somecases. The hepatic duct bile flows intothe duodenum. Following such surgery, the patientshould avoid meals high in fats.One of the functions of the gallbladder is to con- centrate bile by absorbing water. If the bile containsa high concentration of cholesterol, absorption ofwater may lead to precipitation and the formation ofcholesterol crystals. These crystals are gallstones . If the gallstones are small, they will pass through the cystic duct and common bile duct to the duo-denum without causing symptoms. If large, how- ever, the gallstones cannot pass out of the gallbladder, and may cause mild to severe pain thatoften radiates to the right shoulder. Obstructivejaundice may occur if bile backs up into the liverand bilirubin is reabsorbed into the blood.16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 381presence of food in the duodenum. The intestinal enzymes are the peptidases and sucrase, maltase, andlactase. Peptidases complete the digestion of protein by short polypeptide chains to monosaccharides.

Regulation of thesesecretions is shown in T able 16-2. ABSORPTION Most absorption of the end products of digestion takesplace in the small intestine (although the stomach doesabsorb water and alcohol). The process of absorptionrequires a large surface area, which is provided by sev-eral structural modications of the small intestine; these are Fig. 16-8. Plica circulares , or cir- cular folds, mucosa andsubmucosa, somewhat like accordion pleats. Themucosa is further folded into projections called villi, which give the inner surface of the intestine a velvet-like appearance. Each columnar cell (except themucus-secreting goblet cells) of the villi also hasmicrovilli on its free surface. Microvilli are micro- scopic folds of the cell membrane, and are collectivelyThe Digestive System 383 Small intestine Figure 16-8. The small intestine. ( A) Section through the small intestine showing plica circulares. ( B) Microscopic view of a villus showing the internal structure. The enteroen- docrine cells secrete the intestinal hormones.QUESTION: What is the purpose of the villi? What other structures have the same purpose?16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 383called the brush border. All of these folds greatly increase the surface area of the intestinal lining. It isestimated that if the intestinal mucosa could be flat-tened out, it would cover more than 2000 square feet(half a basketball court). The absorption of nutrients takes place from the lumen of the intestine into the vessels within thevilli. Refer to Fig. 16-8 and notice that within each vil-lus is a capillary network and a lacteal , which is a dead-end lymph capillary. Water-soluble nutrientsare absorbed into the blood in the capillary networks.Monosaccharides, amino acids, positive ions, and thewater-soluble vitamins (vitamin C and the B vitamins)are absorbed by active transport. Negative ions maybe absorbed by either passive or active transportmechanisms. Water is absorbed by osmosis followingthe absorption of minerals, especially sodium. Certainnutrients have additional special requirements fortheir absorption: For example, vitamin B 12requires the intrinsic factor produced by the parietal cellsof the gastric mucosa, and the efficient absorption ofcalcium ions requires parathyroid hormone and vita- min D. Fat-soluble nutrients are absorbed into the lymph in the lacteals of the villi. Bile salts are necessary forthe efficient absorption of fatty acids and the fat-solu-ble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Once absorbed, fattyacids are recombined with glycerol to form triglyc-erides. These triglycerides then form globules thatinclude cholesterol and protein; these lipid-proteincomplexes are called chylomicrons . In the form of chylomicrons, most absorbed fat is transported by thelymph and eventually enters the blood in the left sub-clavian vein. Blood from the capillary networks in the villi does not return directly to the heart but rst travelsthrough the portal vein to the liver. You may recall theimportance of portal circulation, discussed in Chapter13. This pathway enables the liver to regulate theblood levels of glucose and amino acids, store certainvitamins, and remove potential poisons from theblood (see Box 16-3: Disorders of the Intestines).384 The Digestive System BOX16-3 DISORDERS OF THE INTESTINES Salmonella food poisoning is caused by bac- teria in the genus Salmonella . These are part of the intestinal flora of animals, and animal foods such asmeat and eggs may be sources of infection. Thesebacteria are not normal for people, and they causethe intestines to secrete large amounts of fluid.Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps,and vomiting and usually last only a few days. Forelderly or debilitated people, however, salmonellafood poisoning may be very serious or even fatal. Diverticula are small outpouchings through weakened areas of the intestinal wall. They aremore likely to occur in the colon than in the smallintestine and may exist for years without causingany symptoms. The presence of diverticula is calleddiverticulosis . Inflammation of diverticula is called diverticulitis , which is usually the result of entrapment of feces and bacteria. Symptomsinclude abdominal pain and tenderness and fever. Ifuncomplicated, diverticulitis may be treated with antibiotics and modications in diet. The most seri- ous complication is perforation of diverticula, allow-ing fecal material into the abdominal cavity, causingperitonitis. A diet high in ber is believed to be animportant aspect of prevention, to provide bulk inthe colon and prevent weakening of its wall.Duodenal ulcers are erosions of the duodenal wall caused by the gastric juice that enters from the stomach. The most serious consequences are bleed-ing and perforation. Paralytic ileus is the cessation of contraction of the smooth muscle layer of the intestine. Thisis a possible complication of abdominal surgery,but it may also be the result of peritonitis orinflammation elsewhere in the abdominal cavity.In the absence of peristalsis, intestinal obstruc-tion may occur. Bowel movements cease, and vom-iting occurs to relieve the pressure within thealimentary tube. Treatment involves suctioningthe intestinal contents to eliminate any obstruc-tion and to allow the intestine to regain its normalmotility. Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose because of deciency of the enzyme lactase.Lactase deciency may be congenital, a conse-quence of prematurity, or acquired later in life. Thedelayed form is quite common among people ofAfrican or Asian ancestry, and in part is genetic.When lactose, or milk sugar, is not digested, itundergoes fermentation in the intestine. Symptomsinclude diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, andflatulence (gas formation).16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 384LARGE INTESTINE The large intestine , also called the colon , is approx- imately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) in diameter and 5 feet (1.5m) in length. It extends from the ileum of the smallintestine to the anus, the terminal opening. The partsof the colon are shown in Fig. 16-9. The cecum is the rst portion, and at its junction with the ileum isthe ileocecal valve , which is not a sphincter but serves the same purpose. After undigested food (which isnow mostly cellulose) and water pass from the ileuminto the cecum, closure of the ileocecal valve preventsthe backflow of fecal material. Attached to the cecum is the appendix , a small, dead-end tube with abundant lymphatic tissue. Theappendix seems to be a vestigial organ , that is, one whose size and function seem to be reduced. Althoughthere is abundant lymphatic tissue in the wall of theappendix, the possibility that the appendix is con-cerned with immunity is not known with certainty.Appendicitis refers to inflammation of the appendix,which may occur if fecal material becomes impacted within it. This usually necessitates an appendectomy , the surgical removal of the appendix. The remainder of the colon consists of the ascend- ing, transverse, and descending colon, which encirclethe small intestine; the sigmoid colon, which turnsmedially and downward; the rectum; and the analcanal. The rectum is about 6 inches long, and the analcanal is the last inch of the colon that surrounds theanus. Clinically, however, the terminal end of thecolon is usually referred to as the rectum. No digestion takes place in the colon. The only secretion of the colonic mucosa is mucus, which lubri-cates the passage of fecal material. The longitudinalsmooth muscle layer of the colon is in three bandscalled taeniae coli . The rest of the colon is \"gathered\" to t these bands. This gives the colon a puckeredappearance; the puckers or pockets are called haustra , which provide for more surface area within the colon. The functions of the colon are the absorption of water, minerals, and vitamins and the elimination ofundigestible material. About 80% of the Rectum AnusAnal canalFigure 16-9. The large intestine shown in anterior view. The term flexure means a turn or bend.QUESTION: What is the function of the ileoce- cal valve?16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 385enters the colon is absorbed (400 to 800 mL per day). Positive and negative ions are also absorbed. The vita-mins absorbed are those produced by the normal flora , the trillions of bacteria that live in the colon. Vitamin K is produced and absorbed in amounts usu-ally sufficient to meet a person's daily need. Othervitamins produced in smaller amounts includeriboflavin, thiamin, biotin, and folic acid. Everythingabsorbed by the colon circulates rst to the liver byway of portal circulation. Yet another function of thenormal colon flora is to inhibit the growth ofpathogens (see Box 16-4: Infant Botulism). ELIMINATION OF FECES Feces consist of cellulose and other undigestible mate-rial, dead and living bacteria, and water. Eliminationof feces is accomplished by the defecation reflex , a spinal cord reflex that may be controlled voluntarily.The rectum is usually empty until peristalsis of thecolon pushes feces into it. These waves of peristalsis tend to occur after eating, especially when food entersthe duodenum. The wall of the rectum is stretched bythe entry of feces, and this is the stimulus for the defe-cation reflex. Stretch receptors in the smooth muscle layer of the rectum generate sensory impulses that travel to thesacral spinal cord. The returning motor impulsescause the smooth muscle of the rectum to contract.Surrounding the anus is the internal anal sphincter , which is made of smooth muscle. As part of the reflex,this sphincter relaxes, permitting defecation to takeplace. The external anal sphincter is made of skeletal muscle and surrounds the internal anal sphincter (Fig.16-10). If defecation must be delayed, the externalsphincter may be voluntarily contracted to close theanus. The awareness of the need to defecate passes asthe stretch receptors of the rectum adapt. Thesereceptors will be stimulated again when the next waveof peristalsis reaches the rectum (see Box 16-5: Fiber). OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE LIVER The liver is a remarkable organ, and only the brain is capable of a greater variety of functions. The livercells (hepatocytes) produce many enzymes that cat-alyze many different chemical reactions. These reac-tions are the functions of the liver. As blood flowsthrough the sinusoids (capillaries) of the liver (see Fig.16-6), materials are removed by the liver cells, and theproducts of the liver cells are secreted into the blood.Some of the liver functions will already be familiarto you. Others are mentioned again and discussed inmore detail in the next chapter. Because the liverhas such varied effects on so many body systems, wewill use the categories below to summarize the liver functions. 1.Carbohydrate metabolism \u2014As you know, the liver regulates the blood glucose level. Excess glu-cose is converted to glycogen (glycogenesis) whenblood glucose is high; the hormones insulin andcortisol facilitate this process. During hypo-glycemia or stress situations, glycogen is convertedback to glucose (glycogenolysis) to raise the bloodglucose level. Epinephrine and glucagon are thehormones that The Digestive System BOX16-4 INFANT BOTULISM Botulism is most often acquired from food. When the spores of the botulism bacteria are inan anaerobic (without oxygen) environmentsuch as a can of food, they germinate into activebacteria that produce a neurotoxin. If peopleingest food containing this toxin, they willdevelop the paralysis that is characteristic ofbotulism. For infants less than 1 year of age, however, ingestion of just the bacterial spores may beharmful. The infant's stomach does not producemuch HCl, so ingested botulism spores may notbe destroyed. Of equal importance, the infant'snormal colon flora is not yet established. Withoutthe normal population of colon bacteria to pro-vide competition, spores of the botulism bacteriamay germinate and produce their toxin. An affected infant becomes lethargic and weak; paralysis may progress slowly or rapidly.Treatment (antitoxin) is available, but may bedelayed if botulism is not suspected. Many casesof infant botulism have been traced to honeythat was found to contain botulism spores. Suchspores are not harmful to older children andadults, who have a normal colon flora that pre-vents the botulism bacteria from becomingestablished.16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 386387 BOX16-5 FIBER no protective effect of ber against colon cancer. What we can say for sure is that ber may not bethe only dietary or environmental factor involved. Claims that high-ber diets directly lower blood levels of cholesterol and fats are not supported bydenitive clinical or experimental studies. One pos-sible explanation may be that a person whose dietconsists largely of high-ber foods simply eats lessof the foods high in cholesterol and fats, and this isthe reason for that person's lower blood levels offats and cholesterol. Should people try to make great changes in their diets? Probably not, not if they are careful to limitfat intake and to include signicant quantities ofvegetables and fruits. Besides the possible benetsof ber, unprocessed plant foods provide importantamounts of vitamins and minerals.Fiber is a term we use to refer to the organic mate- rials in the cell walls of plants. These are mainly cel-lulose and pectins. The role of dietary ber andpossible benets that a high-ber diet may provideare currently the focus of much research. It isimportant to differentiate what is known from whatis, at present, merely speculation. Many studies have shown that populations (large groups of people, especially those of differentcultures) who consume high-ber diets tend tohave a lower frequency of certain diseases. Theseinclude diverticulitis, colon cancer, coronary arterydisease, diabetes, and hypertension. Such diseasesare much more common among populationswhose diets are low in vegetables, fruits, and wholegrains, and high in meat, dairy products, andprocessed foods.

QUESTION: The internal anal sphincter is a continuation of which part of the rectum?16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 387The liver also changes other monosaccharides to glucose. Fructose and galactose, for example, areend products of the digestion of sucrose and lac-tose. Because most cells, however, cannot readilyuse fructose and galactose as energy sources, theyare converted by the liver to glucose, which is eas-ily used by cells. 2.Amino acid metabolism \u2014The liver regulates blood levels of amino acids based on tissue needsfor protein synthesis. Of the 20 different aminoacids needed for the production of human proteins,the liver is able to synthesize 12, called the non- essential amino acids . The chemical process by which this is done is called transamination , the transfer of an amino group (NH 2) from an amino acid present in excess to a free carbon chain thatforms a complete, new amino acid molecule. Theother eight amino acids, which the liver cannotsynthesize, are called the essential amino acids . In this case, \"essential\" means that the amino acidsmust be supplied by our food, because the livercannot manufacture them. Similarly, \"non-essen-tial\" means that the amino acids do not have to besupplied in our food because the liver canmake them. All 20 amino acids are required in order tomake our body proteins. Excess amino acids, those not needed right away for protein synthesis, cannot be stored. However,they do serve another useful purpose. By theprocess of deamination , which also occurs in the liver, the NH 2group is removed from an amino acid, and the remaining carbon chain may be con-verted to a simple carbohydrate molecule or to fat.Thus, excess amino acids are utilized for energyproduction: either for immediate energy or for thepotential energy stored as fat in adipose tissue. TheNH 2groups that were detached from the original amino acids are combined to form urea, a wasteproduct that will be removed from the blood by thekidneys and excreted in urine. 3.Lipid metabolism \u2014The liver forms lipoproteins, which as their name tells us, are molecules of lipidsand proteins, for the transport of fats in the bloodto other tissues. The liver also synthesizes choles-terol and excretes excess cholesterol into bile to beeliminated in feces. Fatty acids are a potential source of energy, but in order to be used in cell respiration they must bebroken down to smaller molecules. In the processof beta-oxidation , the long carbon chains of fattyacids are split into two-carbon molecules called acetyl groups, which are simple carbohydrates.These acetyl groups may be used by the liver cellsto produce ATP or may be combined to formketones to be transported in the blood to othercells. These other cells then use the ketones to pro-duce ATP in cell respiration. 4.Synthesis of plasma proteins \u2014This is a liver function that you will probably remember fromChapter 11. The liver synthesizes many of the pro-teins that circulate in the blood. Albumin , the most abundant plasma protein, helps maintain blood vol-ume by pulling tissue fluid into capillaries. The clotting factors are also produced by the liver. These, as you recall, include prothrombin,brinogen, and Factor 8, which circulate in theblood until needed in the chemical clotting mech-anism. The liver also synthesizes alpha and betaglobulins , which are proteins that serve as carriers for other molecules, such as fats, in the blood. 5.Formation of bilirubin \u2014This is another familiar function: The liver contains xed macrophagesthat phagocytize old red blood cells (RBCs).Bilirubin is then formed from the heme portion ofthe hemoglobin. The liver also removes from theblood the bilirubin formed in the spleen and redbone marrow and excretes it into bile to be elimi-nated in feces. 6.Phagocytosis by Kupffer cells \u2014The fixed macrophages of the liver are called cells stellate reticuloendothelial cells). Besidesdestroying old RBCs, Kupffer cells phagocytizepathogens or other foreign material that circulatethrough the liver. Many of the bacteria that get tothe liver come from the colon. These bacteria arepart of the normal flora of the colon but would bevery harmful elsewhere in the body. The bacteriathat enter the blood with the water absorbed by thecolon are carried to the liver by way of portal cir-culation. The Kupffer cells in the liver phagocytizeand destroy these bacteria, removing them fromthe blood before the blood returns to the heart. 7.Storage \u2014The liver stores the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, and the water-soluble vitamin B 12. Up to a 6- to 12-month supply of vitamins A and Dmay be stored, and beef or chicken liver is an excel-lent dietary source of these vitamins. Also stored by the liver are the minerals iron and copper. You already know that iron is needed forhemoglobin and myoglobin and enables these pro-388 The Digestive System16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 388teins to bond to oxygen. Copper (as well as iron) is part of some of the proteins needed for cell respi-ration, and is part of some of the enzymes neces-sary for hemoglobin synthesis. 8.Detoxication \u2014The liver is capable of synthesiz- ing enzymes that will detoxify harmful substances,that is, change them to less harmful ones. Alcohol,for example, is changed to acetate, which is a two-carbon molecule (an acetyl group) that can be usedin cell respiration. Medications are all potentially toxic, but the liver produces enzymes that break them down orchange them. When given in a proper dosage, amedication exerts its therapeutic effect but is thenchanged to less active substances that are usuallyexcreted by the kidneys. An overdose of a drugmeans that there is too much of it for the liver todetoxify in a given time, and the drug will remainin the body with possibly harmful effects. This iswhy alcohol should never be consumed when tak-ing medication. Such a combination may cause theliver's detoxication ability to be overworked andineffective, with the result that both the alcohol and the medication will remain toxic for a longertime. Barbiturates taken as sleeping pills after con-sumption of alcohol have too often proved fatal forjust this reason. Ammonia is a toxic substance produced by the bacteria in the colon. Because it is soluble in water,some ammonia is absorbed into the blood, but it iscarried rst to the liver by portal circulation. Theliver converts ammonia to urea, a less toxic sub-stance, before the ammonia can circulate and dam-age other organs, especially the brain. The ureaformed is excreted by the kidneys (see Box 16-6:Hepatitis). AGING AND THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM Many changes can be expected in the aging digestivesystem. The sense of taste becomes less acute, lesssaliva is produced, and there is greater likelihood ofThe Digestive System 389 BOX16-6 HEPATITIS include blood and semen. Hepatitis B may be severe or even fatal, and approximately 10% ofthose who recover become carriers of the virus.Possible consequences of the carrier state arechronic hepatitis progressing to cirrhosis or primaryliver cancer. Of equal importance, carriers aresources of the virus for others, especially their sex-ual partners. A vaccine is available for hepatitis B, and health- care workers who have contact with blood, evenjustoccasional contact, should receive it. Other potential recipients of the vaccine are the sexualpartners of carriers. Pediatricians now consider thisvaccine one of the standard ones for infants. Thehepatitis C virus is also present in body flu- ids and is spread by blood or mucous membranecontact. Most people develop chronic disease, butmany may remain asymptomatic for years afterbeing infected. With active disease the virus maycause liver failure. The only therapy then is a liver transplant. It is important for healthcare personnel, and their patients, to know that these types of hepatitisare not spread by blood transfusions. Donatedblood is tested for all three viruses.Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver caused by any of several viruses. The most common of these hepatitis viruses have been designated A, B,and C, although there are others. Symptoms of hep-atitis include anorexia, nausea, fatigue, and possiblyjaundice. Severity of disease ranges from very mild(even asymptomatic) to fatal. Hundreds of thou-sands of cases of hepatitis occur in the United Statesevery year, and although liver inflammation is com-mon to all of them, the three hepatitis viruses havedifferent modes of transmission and different conse-quences for affected people. Hepatitis A is an intestinal virus that is spread by the fecal-oral route. Food contaminated by thehands of people with mild cases is the usual vehicleof transmission, although shellsh harvested fromwater contaminated with human sewage areanother possible source of this virus. Hepatitis A ismost often mild, recovery provides lifelong immu-nity, and the carrier state is not known to occur. Avaccine is available, but people who have beenexposed to hepatitis A may receive gamma globu-lin by injection to prevent the disease. Hepatitis B is contracted by exposure to the body fluids of an infected person; these fluids16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 389Function of the Digestive System\u2014to break down food into simple chemicals that canbe absorbed into the blood and lymph andutilized by cells Divisions of the Digestive System 1.

Secretions are reduced throughout the digestive system, and theeffectiveness of peristalsis diminishes. Indigestion maybecome more frequent, especially if the LES loses itstone, and there is a greater chance of esophageal dam-age. In the colon, diverticula may form; these are bub-ble-like outpouchings of the weakened wall of thecolon that may be asymptomatic or become infected.Intestinal obstruction, of the large or small bowel,occurs with greater frequency among the elderly.Sluggish peristalsis contributes to constipation, whichin turn may contribute to the formation of hemor-rhoids. The risk of oral cancer or colon cancer alsoincreases with age. The liver usually continues to function adequately even well into old age, unless damaged by pathogenssuch as the hepatitis viruses or by toxins such as alco-hol. There is a greater tendency for gallstones to form,perhaps necessitating removal of the gallbladder.Inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) is alsomore frequent in older adults. In the absence of spe- cic diseases, the pancreas usually functions well,although acute pancreatitis of unknown cause is some-what more likely in elderly people. SUMMARY The processes of the digestion of food and the absorp-tion of nutrients enable the body to use complex foodmolecules for many purposes. Much of the food we eatliterally becomes part of us. The body synthesizes pro-teins and lipids for the growth and repair of tissues andproduces enzymes to catalyze all of the reactions thatcontribute to homeostasis. Some of our food providesthe energy required for growth, repair, movement,sensation, and thinking. In the next chapter we willdiscuss the chemical basis of energy production fromfood and consider the relationship of energy produc-tion to the maintenance of body temperature.16Scanlon(p3)-ch16 8/17/06 10:59 AM Page 3905.

Naturally, we are not aware of the processof cell respiration, but we may be aware of one of theproducts\u2014energy in the form of heat. The humanbody is indeed warm, and its temperature is regulatedvery precisely. Though we cannot stand barefoot onthe ice of Antarctica for months in winter, as penguinsdo, we can adapt to and survive a wide range of envi-ronmental temperatures. This chapter discusses the regulation of body tem- perature and also discusses metabolism , which is the total of all reactions that take place within the body.These reactions include the energy-releasing ones ofcell respiration and energy-requiring ones such asprotein synthesis, or DNA synthesis for mitosis. Asyou will see, body temperature and metabolism areinseparable. BODY TEMPERATURE The normal range of human body temperature is96.5\u00b0to 99.5 \u00b0F (36 \u00b0to 38 \u00b0C), with an average oral temperature of 98.6 \u00b0F (37 \u00b0C). (A 1992 study sug- gested a slightly lower average oral temperature: 98.2 \u00b0 or 36.8 \u00b0. But everyone seems to prefer the \"tradi- tional\" average temperature.) Within a 24-hourperiod, an individual's temperature fluctuates 1 \u00b0to 2\u00b0, with the lowest temperatures occurring during sleep. At either end of the age spectrum, however, tem- perature regulation may not be as precise as it is inolder children or younger adults. Infants have moresurface area (skin) relative to volume and are likely tolose heat more rapidly. In the elderly, the mechanismsthat maintain body temperature may not function asefficiently as they once did, and changes in environ-mental temperature may not be compensated for asquickly or effectively. This is especially important toremember when caring for patients who are veryyoung or very old. HEAT PRODUCTION Cell respiration, the process that releases energy fromfood to produce ATP , also produces heat as one of itsenergy products. Although cell respiration takes placeconstantly, many factors influence the rate of thisprocess:1. The hormone thyroxine (and T 3), produced by the thyroid gland, increases the rate of cell respirationand heat production. The secretion of thyroxine isregulated by the body's rate of energy production,the metabolic rate itself. (See Chapter 10 for a dis-cussion of the feedback mechanism involving thehypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland andChapter 1 for an illustration.) When the metabolicrate decreases, the thyroid gland is stimulated tosecrete more thyroxine. As thyroxine increases therate of cell respiration, negative feedback mecha-nism inhibits further until metabolic ratedecreases again. Thus, thyroxine is secreted when-ever there is a need for increased cell respirationand is probably the most important regulator ofday-to-day energy production. 2. In stress situations, epinephrine and norepineph- rine are secreted by the adrenal medulla, and thesympathetic nervous system becomes more active. Epinephrine increases the rate of cell respiration,especially in organs such as the heart, skeletal mus-cles, and liver. Sympathetic stimulation also in-creases the activity of these organs. The increasedproduction of ATP to meet the demands of thestress situation also means that more heat will beproduced. 3. Organs that are normally active (producing ATP) are signicant sources of heat when the bodyis at rest. The skeletal muscles, for example, areusually in a state of slight contraction called muscletone. Because even slight contraction requires ATP ,the muscles are also producing heat. This amountsto about 25% of the total body heat at rest andmuch more during exercise, when more ATP isproduced. The liver is another organ that is continually active, producing ATP to supply energy for itsmany functions. As a result, the liver produces asmuch as 20% of the total body heat at rest. Theheat produced by these active organs is dispersedthroughout the body by the blood. As the relativelycooler blood flows through organs such as the mus-cles and liver, the heat they produce is transferred to the blood, warming it. The warmed blood circu-lates to other areas of the body, distributing this heat. 4. The intake of food also increases heat production, because the metabolic activity of the digestive tractis increased. Heat is generated as the digestive396 Body Temperature and Metabolism17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 396organs produce ATP for peristalsis and for the syn- thesis of digestive enzymes. 5. Changes in body temperature also have an effect on metabolic rate and heat production. Thisbecomes clinically important when a person hasa fever , an abnormally high body tempera- ture. The higher temperature increases the meta-bolic rate, which increases heat production andelevates body temperature further. Thus, a highfever may trigger a vicious cycle of ever-increasingheat production. Fever is discussed later in thischapter. The factors that affect heat production are summa- rized in T able 17-1. HEAT LOSS The pathways of heat loss from the body are the skin,the respiratory tract, and, to a lesser extent, the uri-nary and digestive tracts.Heat Loss through the Skin Because the skin covers the body, most body heat islost from the skin to the environment. When the envi-ronment is cooler than body temperature (as it usuallyis), heat loss is unavoidable. The amount of heat thatis lost is determined by blood flow through the skinand by the activity of sweat glands. Blood flow through the skin influences the amount of heat lost by the processes of radiation, conduction,and convection. Radiation means that heat from the body is transferred to cooler objects not touching theskin, much as a radiator warms the contents of a room(radiation starts to become less effective when theenvironmental temperature rises above 88 \u00b0F). Con- duction is the loss of heat to cooler air or objects, such as clothing, that touch the skin. Convection means that air currents move the warmer air away from theskin surface and facilitate the loss of heat; this is why afan makes us feel cooler on hot days. Loss of heat byconvection also gives us the \"wind chill factor\" wehear about in winter. A cold day that is windy will feelcolder than a cold day when the air is still, because thewind blows the slightly warmer air surrounding thebody away, replacing it with colder air. As you may recall from Chapter 5, the tempera- ture of the skin and the subsequent loss of heat aredetermined by blood flow through the skin. The arte-rioles in the dermis may constrict or dilate to decreaseor increase blood flow. In a cold environment, vaso- constriction decreases blood flow through the dermis and thereby decreases heat loss. In a warm environ-ment, vasodilation in the dermis increases blood flow to the body surface and loss of heat to the environ-ment. The other mechanism by which heat is lost from the skin is sweating. The eccrine sweat glands secrete sweat (water) onto the skin surface, and excessbody heat evaporates the sweat. Think of runningwater into a hot frying pan; the pan is rapidly cooledas its heat vaporizes the water. Although sweating isnot quite as dramatic (no visible formation of steam),the principle is just the same. Sweating is most efficient when the humidity of the surrounding air is low. Humidity is the percentage ofthe maximum amount of water vapor the atmospherecan contain. A humidity reading of 90% means thatthe air is already 90% saturated with water vapor andcan hold little more. In such a situation, sweat doesnot readily evaporate, but instead remains on the skineven as more sweat is secreted. If the humidity is 40%,Body Temperature and Metabolism 397 Table 17-1 FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEAT PRODUCTION Factor Effect Thyroxine Epinephrine and sympathetic stimulation Skeletal muscles Liver Food intakeHigher body temperature The most important regulator of day-to-day metabolism; increases use of foods for ATP production, thereby increasingheat production Important in stress situations; increases the metabolic activity of many organs; increases ATPand heat production Normal muscle tone requires ATP; the heat produced isabout 25% of the total bodyheat at rest Always metabolically active; produces as much as 20% oftotal body heat at rest Increases activity of the GI tract; increases ATP and heat production Increases metabolic rate, which increases heat production, which further increases meta- bolic rate and heat production;may become detrimental dur-ing high fevers17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 397however, the air can hold a great deal more water vapor, and sweat evaporates quickly from the skin sur-face, removing excess body heat. In air that is com-pletely dry, a person may tolerate a temperature of200\u00b0F for nearly 1 hour. Although sweating is a very effective mechanism of heat loss, it does have a disadvantage in that it requiresthe loss of water in order to also lose heat. Water lossduring sweating may rapidly lead to dehydration, andthe water lost must be replaced by drinking fluids (seeBox 17-1: Heat-Related Disorders). Small amounts of heat are also lost in what is called \"insensible water loss.\" Because the skin is not like aplastic bag, but is somewhat permeable to water, asmall amount of water diffuses through the skin and isevaporated by body heat. Compared to sweating, how-ever, insensible water loss is a minor source of heatloss. Heat Loss through the Respiratory Tract Heat is lost from the respiratory tract as the warmth of the respiratory mucosa evaporates some water from the living epithelial surface. The water vapor formedis exhaled, and a small amount of heat is lost. Animals such as dogs that do not have numerous sweat glands often pant in warm weather. Panting isthe rapid movement of air into and out of the upperrespiratory passages, where the warm surfaces evapo-rate large amounts of water. In this way the animalmay lose large amounts of heat.Heat Loss through the Urinary and Digestive Tracts When excreted, urine and feces are at body tempera- ture, and their elimination results in a very smallamount of heat loss. The pathways of heat loss are summarized in T able 17-2. REGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE The hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of body temperature and is considered the \"thermo-stat\" of the body. As the thermostat, the hypothalamusmaintains the \"setting\" of body temperature by bal-ancing heat production and heat loss to keep the bodyat the set temperature. T o do this, the hypothalamus must receive infor- mation about the temperature within the body andabout the environmental temperature. Specializedneurons of the hypothalamus detect changes in thetemperature of the blood that flows through the brain.The temperature receptors in the skin provide infor-mation about the external temperature changes towhich the body is exposed. The hypothalamus thenintegrates this sensory information and promotes thenecessary responses to maintain body temperaturewithin the normal range. Mechanisms to Increase Heat Loss In a warm environment or during exercise, the bodytemperature tends to rise, and greater heat loss is398 Body Temperature and Metabolism BOX17-1 HEAT-RELATED DISORDERS of heat loss, but in high heat the sweating process continues. As fluid loss increases, sweating stops topreserve body fluid, and body temperature risesrapidly (over 105 \u00b0F , possibly as high as 110 \u00b0F ). The classic symptom of heat stroke is hot, dry skin. The affected person often loses consciousness,reflecting the destructive effect of such a high bodytemperature on the brain. Treatment should involvehospitalization so that IV fluids may be adminis-tered and body temperature lowered under med-ical supervision. A rst-aid measure would be theapplication of cool (not ice cold) water to as muchof the skin as possible. Fluids should never be forcedon an unconscious person, because the fluid maybe aspirated into the respiratory tract.Heat exhaustion is caused by excessive sweating with loss of water and salts, especially NaCl. Theaffected person feels very weak, and the skin is usu-ally cool and clammy (moist). Body temperature isnormal or slightly below normal, the pulse is oftenrapid and weak, and blood pressure may be lowbecause of fluid loss. Other symptoms may includedizziness, vomiting, and muscle cramps. Treatmentinvolves rest and consumption of salty fluids or fruitjuices (in small amounts at frequent intervals). Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that may affect elderly or chronically ill people on hot,humid days, or otherwise healthy people who exer-cise too strenuously during such weather. Highhumidity makes sweating an ineffective mechanism17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 398needed. This is accomplished by vasodilation in the dermis and an increase in sweating. Vasodilationbrings more warm blood close to the body surface,and heat is lost to the environment. However, if theenvironmental temperature is close to or higher thanbody temperature, this mechanism becomes ineffec-tive. The second mechanism is increased sweating, inwhich excess body heat evaporates the sweat on theskin surface. As mentioned previously, sweatingbecomes inefficient when the atmospheric humidity ishigh. On hot days, heat production may also be decreased by a decrease in muscle tone. This is why wemay feel very sluggish on hot days; our muscles areeven slightly less contracted than usual and are slowerto respond. Mechanisms to Conserve Heat In a cold environment, heat loss from the body isunavoidable but may be reduced to some extent.Vasoconstriction in the dermis shunts blood awayfrom the body surface, so that more heat is kept in thecore of the body. Sweating decreases, and will stopcompletely if the temperature of the hypothalamusfalls below about 98.6 \u00b0F . (Remember that the internal temperature of the brain is higher than an oral tem-perature, and is less subject to any changes in environ-mental temperature.)If these mechanisms are not sufficient to prevent the body temperature from dropping, more heat maybe produced by increasing muscle tone. When thisgreater muscle tone becomes noticeable and rhythmic,it is called shivering and may increase heat productionby as much as ve times the normal. People also have behavioral responses to cold, and these too are important to prevent heat loss. Suchthings as putting on a sweater or going indoors reflectour awareness of the discomfort of being cold. Forpeople (we do not have thick fur as do some othermammals), these voluntary activities are of criticalimportance to the prevention of excessive heat losswhen it is very cold (see Box 17-2: Cold-RelatedDisorders). FEVER A fever is an abnormally high body temperatureand may accompany infectious diseases, extensivephysical trauma, cancer, or damage to the CNS. Thesubstances that may cause a fever are called pyrogens . Pyrogens include bacteria, foreign proteins, andchemicals released are . from pyrogens chemically affect the hypo-thalamus and \"raise the setting\" of the hypothalamicthermostat. The hypothalamus will then stimulateresponses by the body to raise body temperature tothis higher setting. Let us use as a specic example a child who has a strep throat. The bacterial and endogenous pyrogensreset the hypothalamic thermostat upward, to 102 \u00b0F. At rst, the body is \"colder\" than the setting of thehypothalamus, and the heat conservation and produc-tion mechanisms are activated. The child feels coldand begins to shiver (chills). Eventually, sufficient heatis produced to raise the body temperature to the hypo-thalamic setting of 102 \u00b0F . At this time, the child will feel neither too warm nor too cold, because the bodytemperature is what the hypothalamus wants. As the effects of the pyrogens diminish, the hypo- thalamic setting decreases, perhaps close to normalagain, 99 \u00b0F . Now the child will feel warm, and the heat loss mechanisms will be activated. Vasodilation in theskin and sweating will occur until the body tempera-ture drops to the new hypothalamic setting. Thisis sometimes referred to as the \"crisis,\" but actually the crisis has passed, because sweating indicates thatBody Temperature and Metabolism 399 Table 17-2 PATHWAYS OF HEAT LOSS Pathway Mechanism Skin (major pathway) Respiratory tract (secondarypathway) Urinary tract (minor pathway) Digestive tract (minor pathway) Radiation and conduction\u2014 heat is lost from the body tocooler air or objects. Convection\u2014air currents move warm air away from the skin. Sweating\u2014excess body heat evaporates sweat on the skinsurface. Evaporation\u2014body heat evap- orates water from the respira-tory mucosa, and water vaporis exhaled. Urination\u2014urine is at body temperature when eliminated. Defecation\u2014feces are at body temperature when eliminated.17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 399the body temperature is returning to normal. The sequence of temperature changes during a fever isshown in Fig. 17-1. You may be wondering if a fever serves a useful pur- pose. For low fevers that are the result of infection, theanswer is yes. White blood cells increase their activityat moderately elevated temperatures, and the metabo-lism of some pathogens is inhibited. Thus, a fever maybe benecial in that it may shorten the duration of aninfection by accelerating the destruction of thepathogen. High fevers, however, may have serious conse- quences. A fever increases the metabolic rate, whichincreases heat production, which in turn raises bodytemperature even more. This is a positive feedbackmechanism that will continue until an external event (such as aspirin or death of the pathogens) acts as a brake (see Fig. 1-3). When the body temperature risesabove 106 \u00b0F , the hypothalamus begins to lose its abil- ity to regulate temperature. The proteins of cells,especially the enzymes, are also damaged by such hightemperatures. Enzymes become denatured, that is,lose their shape and do not catalyze the reactions nec-essary within cells (see Fig. 2-9). As a result, cellsbegin to die. This is most serious in the brain, becauseneurons cannot be replaced, and cellular death is thecause of brain damage that may follow a prolonged high fever. The effects of changes in body temperatureon the hypothalamus are shown in Fig. 17-2. A medication such as aspirin is called an anti- pyretic because it lowers a fever, probably by affecting the hypothalamic thermostat. T o help lower a highfever, the body may be cooled by sponging it with coolwater. The excessive body heat will cause this externalwater to evaporate, thus reducing temperature. A veryhigh fever requires medical attention. METABOLISM The term metabolism encompasses all of the reac- tions that take place in the body. Everything that hap-pens within us is part of our metabolism. The reactionsof metabolism may be divided into two major cate-gories: anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism means synthesis or \"formation\" reac- tions, the bonding together of smaller molecules toform larger ones. The synthesis of hemoglobin bycells of the red bone marrow, synthesis of glycogen byliver cells, and synthesis of fat to be stored in adiposetissue are all examples of anabolism. Such reactionsrequire energy, usually in the form of ATP .400 Body Temperature and Metabolism BOX17-2 COLD-RELATED DISORDERS slurred speech, drowsiness, and lack of coordina- tion. At this stage, people often do not realize theseriousness of their condition, and if outdoors (iceskating or skiing) may not seek a warmer environ-ment. In progressive hypothermia, breathing andheart rate slow, and coma and death follow. Other people at greater risk for hypothermia include the elderly, whose temperature-regulatingmechanisms are no longer effective, and quadriple-gics, who have no sensation of cold in the body. Forboth of these groups, heat production is or may below because of inactivity of skeletal muscles. Articial hypothermia may be induced during some types of cardiovascular or neurologic surgery.This carefully controlled lowering of body tempera-ture decreases the metabolic rate and need foroxygen and makes possible prolonged surgerywithout causing extensive tissue death in thepatient.Frostbite is the freezing of part of the body. Fingers, toes, the nose, and ears are most oftenaffected by prolonged exposure to cold, becausethese areas have little volume in proportion to theirsurface. At rst the skin tingles, then becomes numb. If body fluids freeze, ice crystals may destroy capillar-ies and tissues (because water expands when itfreezes), and blisters form. In the most severe casesgangrene develops; that is, tissue dies because oflack of oxygen. Treatment of frostbite includes rewarming the affected area. If skin damage is apparent, it shouldbe treated as if it were a burn injury. Hypothermia is an abnormally low body tem- perature (below 95 \u00b0F) that is most often the result of prolonged exposure to cold. Although theaffected person certainly feels cold at rst, this sen-sation may pass and be replaced by confusion,17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 400Catabolism means decomposition, the breaking of bonds of larger molecules to form smaller molecules.Cell respiration is a series of catabolic reactions thatbreak down food molecules to carbon dioxide andwater. During catabolism, energy is often released andused to synthesize ATP (the heat energy released wasdiscussed in the previous section). The ATP formedduring catabolism is then used for energy-requiringanabolic reactions. Most of our anabolic and catabolic reactions are catalyzed by enzymes. Enzymes are proteins thatenable reactions to take place rapidly at body temper-ature (see Chapter 2 to review the active site theory ofenzyme functioning). The body has thousands ofenzymes, and each is specic, that is, will catalyze onlyone type of reaction. As you read the discussions thatfollow, keep in mind the essential role of enzymes.CELL RESPIRATION You are already familiar with the summary reaction ofcell respiration, C 6H12O6/H11001O2CO2/H11001H2O /H11001ATP /H11001Heat, (glucose) the purpose of which is to produce ATP . Glucose con- tains potential energy, and when it is broken down toCO 2and H2O, this energy is released in the forms of ATP and heat. The oxygen that is required comesfrom breathing, and the CO 2formed is circulated to the lungs to be exhaled. The water formed is calledmetabolic water, and helps to meet our daily need forwater. Energy in the form of heat gives us a body tem-perature, and the ATP formed is used for energy-requiring reactions. Synthesis of ATP means thatBody Temperature and Metabolism 401 105 104103102 101 100 9998 2 hr 4 hr 6 hr 8 hr 10 hr 12 hr 14 hr 16 hr 18 hr 20 hr 22 hr 24 hrBody temperature TimeHypothalamic thermostatActual body temperature Pyrogen affects hypothalamus Effect of pyrogen diminishes Sweating, vasodilation Figure 17-1.

ADP and free phos-phates are present in cells after ATP has been brokendown for energy-requiring processes. The breakdown of glucose summarized here is not quite that simple, however, and involves a complexseries of reactions. Glucose is taken apart \"piece bypiece,\" with the removal of hydrogens and the split- ting of carbon-carbon bonds. This releases the energyof glucose gradually, so that a signicant portion(about 40%) is available to synthesize ATP . Cell respiration of glucose involves three major stages: glycolysis, the Krebs citric acid cycle, and thecytochrome (or electron) transport system. Although402 Body Temperature and Metabolism 114 112 110 108 106 104 102 100 98 96 94 92 90 88 86 84 82 80 78 76 74 72 70 68 6644 42 40 38 37 36 34 32 30 28 26 24Upper limit of survival?Body temperatureTemperature regulation by the hypothalamus Heat stroke or high fever Strenuous exercise or fever Usual range of normal Hypothermia (cold weather orimmersion incold water) Lower limit of survival?

QUESTION: Give a range of temperature that an average person would probably survive.17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 402the details of each stage are beyond the scope of this book, we will summarize the most important aspectsof each, and then relate to them the use of amino acidsand fats for energy. This simple summary is depictedin Fig. 17-3. Glycolysis The enzymes for the reactions of glycolysis are found in the cytoplasm of cells, and oxygen is not required(glycolysis is an anaerobic process). Refer now to Fig.17-3 as you read the following. In glycolysis, a six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down to two three-carbon molecules of pyruvic acid. T wo molecules ofATP are necessary to start the process. The energythey supply is called energy of activation and is neces-sary to make glucose unstable enough to begin to breakdown. As a result of these reactions, enough energy isreleased to synthesize four molecules of ATP , for a netgain of two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Alsoduring glycolysis, two pairs of hydrogens are removedby NAD, a carrier molecule that contains the vitaminniacin . T wo NAD molecules thus become 2NADH 2, and these attached hydrogen pairs will be transportedto the cytochrome transport system (stage 3). If no oxygen is present in the cell, as may happen in muscle cells during exercise, pyruvic acid is convertedto lactic acid, which causes muscle fatigue. If oxygen is present, however, pyruvic acid continues into the nextstage, the Krebs citric acid cycle (or, more simply, theKrebs cycle). Krebs Citric Acid Cycle The enzymes for the Krebs cycle (or citric acid cycle ) are located in the mitochondria of cells. This second stage of cell respiration is aerobic, meaningthat oxygen is required. In a series of reactions, a pyru-vic acid molecule is \"taken apart,\" and its carbons areconverted to CO 2. The rst CO2molecule is removed by an enzyme that contains the vitamin thiamine . This leaves a two-carbon molecule called an acetylgroup, which combines with a molecule called coen-zyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA). Asacetyl CoA continues in the Krebs cycle, two morecarbons are removed as CO 2, and more pairs of hydro- gens are picked up by NAD and FAD (another carriermolecule that contains the vitamin riboflavin ). NADH 2and FADH2will carry their hydrogens to the cytochrome transport system. During the Krebs cycle, a small amount of energy is released, enough to synthesize one molecule of ATP(two per glucose). Notice also that a four-carbon mol- ecule (oxaloacetic acid) is regenerated after the forma-tion of CO 2. This molecule will react with the next acetyl CoA, which is what makes the Krebs cycle trulya self-perpetuating cycle. The results of the stages ofcell respiration are listed in T able 17-3. Before youcontinue, you may wish to look at that table to see justwhere the process has gotten thus far. Cytochrome Transport System Cytochromes are proteins that contain either iron or copper and are found in the mitochondria of cells. The pairs of hydrogens that were once part of glucoseare brought to the cytochromes by the carrier mole-cules NAD and FAD. Each hydrogen atom is thensplit into its proton (H +ion) and its electron. The electrons of the hydrogens are passed from onecytochrome to the next, and nally to oxygen. Thereactions of the electrons with the cytochromesrelease most of the energy that was contained in theglucose molecule, enough to synthesize 34 moleculesof ATP . As you can see, most of the ATP produced incell respiration comes from this third stage. Finally, and very importantly, each oxygen atom that has gained two electrons (from the cytochromes)reacts with two of the H +ions (protons) to form water. The formation of metabolic water contributes to thenecessary intracellular fluid, and also prevents acido-sis. If H +ions accumulated, they would rapidly lower the pH of the cell. This does not happen, however,because the H +ions react with oxygen to form water, and a decrease in pH is prevented. The summary of the three stages of cell respiration in T able 17-3 also includes the vitamins and mineralsthat are essential for this process. An important over-all concept is the relationship between eating andbreathing. Eating provides us with a potential energysource (often glucose) and with necessary vitamins andminerals. However, to release the energy from food,we must breathe. This is whywe breathe. The oxygen we inhale is essential for the completion of cell respi-ration, and the CO 2produced is exhaled. Proteins and Fats as Energy Sources Although glucose is the preferred energy source forcells, proteins and fats also contain potential energyand are alternative energy sources in certain situations. As you know, proteins are made of the smaller mol- ecules called amino acids , and the primary use for the amino acids we obtain from food is the synthesis ofBody Temperature and Metabolism 40317Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 403404 Body Temperature and Metabolism Carbohydrates Fats Fatty acid Pyruvic acid Acetyl CoA Citric acid (Beta oxidation C C CCCO2 CO2 =OxygenProteins Figure 17-3.

Seetext for description.QUESTION: To which two molecules can all three food types be converted to enter the cit- ric acid cycle?17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 404new proteins. Excess amino acids, however, those not needed immediately for protein synthesis, may beused for energy production. In the liver, excess aminoacids are deaminated , that is, the amino group (NH 2) is removed. The remaining portion is converted to amolecule that will t into the Krebs cycle. For exam-ple, a deaminated amino acid may be changed to athree-carbon pyruvic acid or to a two-carbon acetylgroup. When these molecules enter the Krebs cycle,the results are just the same as if they had come fromglucose. This is diagrammed in Fig. 17-3. Fats are made of glycerol and fatty acids, which are the end products of fat digestion. These molecules mayalso be changed to ones that will take part in the Krebscycle, and the reactions that change them usually takeplace in the liver. Glycerol is a three-carbon moleculethat can be converted to the three-carbon pyruvic acid,which enters the Krebs cycle. In the process of beta-oxidation, the long carbon chains of fatty acids are splitinto two-carbon acetyl groups, which enter a later stepin the Krebs cycle (see Fig. 17-3). Both amino acids and fatty acids may be converted by the liver to ketones , which are two- or four-carbon molecules such as acetone and acetoacetic acid. Although body cells can use ketones in cell respira- tion, they do so slowly. In situations in which fats oramino acids have become the primary energy sources,a state called ketosis may develop; this is described in Box 17-3: Ketosis. Excess amino acids may also beconverted to glucose; this is important to supply the brain when dietary intake of carbohydrates is low. Theeffects of hormones on the metabolism of food aresummarized in T able 17-4. Energy Available from the Three Nutrient Types The potential energy in food is measured in units called Calories or kilocalories . A calorie (lowercase \"c\") is the amount of energy needed to raise the tem-perature of 1 gram of water 1 \u00b0C. A kilocalorie or Calorie (capital \"C\") is 1000 times that amount ofenergy. One gram of carbohydrate yields about 4 kilocalo- ries. A gram of protein also yields about 4 kilocalories.A gram of fat, however, yields 9 kilocalories, anda gram of alcohol yields 7 kilocalories. This is why adiet high in fat is more likely to result in weight gainif the calories are not expended in energy-requiringactivities. You may have noticed that calorie content is part of the nutritional information on food labels. On suchlabels the term calorie actually means Calorie or kilo- calories but is used for the sake of simplicity. SYNTHESIS USES OF FOODS Besides being available for energy production, each ofthe three food types is used in anabolic reactions toBody Temperature and Metabolism 405 Table 17-3 SUMMARY OF CELL RESPIRATION Molecules That Vitamins or Stage Enter the Process Results Minerals Needed Glycolysis (cytoplasm) Krebs citric acid cycle (mitochondria) ATP (net) 2 NADH2(to acid anaerobic: lactic acid glucose) 3 NADH 2and 1 FADH2(to cytochrome transport system) A 4-carbon molecule is regen- erated for the next cycle 34 ATP Metabolic water Niacin (part of NAD) Thiamine (for removal of CO2) Niacin (part of NAD) Riboflavin (part of FAD) Pantothenic acid (part of coenzyme A) Iron and copper (part of some cytochromes)Glucose\u2014ATP needed as energy of activation Pyruvic acid\u2014from glucose or glycerol or excess amino acids orAcetyl acids or or the Krebscycle17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 405synthesize necessary materials for cells and tissues. A simple summary of these reactions is shown in Fig.17-4. The three food types and their end products ofdigestion are at the bottom of the picture, and thearrows going upward indicate synthesis and lead to theproducts formed. You may wish to refer to Fig. 17-4as you read the next sections. Glucose Glucose is the raw material for the synthesis ofanother important monosaccharide, the pentose sug- arsthat are part of nucleic acids. Deoxyribose is the ve-carbon sugar found in DNA, and ribose is foundin RNA. This function of glucose is very important, for without the pentose sugars our cells could neitherproduce new chromosomes for cell division nor carryout the process of protein synthesis. Any glucose in excess of immediate energy needs or the need for pentose sugars is converted to glycogen in the liver and skeletal muscles. Glycogen is then anenergy source during states of hypoglycemia or duringexercise. If still more glucose is present, it will bechanged to fat and stored in adipose tissue. Amino Acids As mentioned previously, the primary uses for aminoacids are the synthesis of the non-essential amino acids by the liver and the synthesis of new proteins in all tissues. By way of review, we can mention someproteins with which you are already familiar: keratinand melanin in the epidermis; collagen in myosin, WBCs; and brinogen for406 Body Temperature and Metabolism Table 17-4 HORMONES THAT REGULATE METABOLISM Hormone (Gland) Effects Thyroxine (thyroid gland) Growth hormone cortex) Epinephrine (adrenal medulla) Increases use of all three food types for energy (glu-cose, fats, amino acids) Increases protein synthesis Increases amino acid trans- port into cells Increases protein synthesis Increases use of fats for energy Increases glucose transport into cells and use for energy Increases conversion of glu- cose to glycogen in liverand muscles Increases transport of amino acids and fatty acids into cells to be used for synthe-sis ( notenergy production) Increases conversion of glycogen to glucose Increases use of amino acids and fats for energy Increases conversion of glu- cose to glycogen in liver Increases use of amino acids and fats for energy Decreases protein synthesis except in liver and GI tract Increases conversion of glycogen to glucose Increases use of fats for energy BOX17-3 KETOSIS When fats and amino acids are to be used for energy, they are often converted by the liver toketones. Ketones are organic molecules such asacetone that may be changed to acetyl CoA andenter the Krebs cycle. Other cells are able to useketones as an energy source, but they do soslowly. When ketones are produced in smallamounts, as they usually are between meals, theblood level does not rise sharply. A state of ketosis exists when fats and pro- teins become the primary energy sources, andketones accumulate in the blood faster than cellscan utilize them. Because ketones are organicacids, they lower the pH of the blood. As theblood ketone level rises, the kidneys excreteketones, but they must also excrete more wateras a solvent, which leads to dehydration. Ketosis is clinically important in diabetes mel- litus, starvation, and eating disorders such asanorexia nervosa. Diabetics whose disease ispoorly controlled may progress to ketoacido- sis, a form of metabolic acidosis that may lead to confusion, coma, and death. Reversal of thisstate requires a carbohydrate energy source andthe insulin necessary to utilize it.17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 406clotting; albumin to maintain pepsin and amylase for digestion; growth hormone andinsulin; and the thousands of enzymes needed to cat-alyze reactions within the body. The amino acids we obtain from the proteins in our food are used by our cells to synthesize all of theseproteins in the amounts needed by the body. Onlywhen the body's needs for new proteins have been met are amino acids used for energy production. Butnotice in Fig. 17-4 what happens to excess aminoacids; they will be deaminated and converted to simplecarbohydrates and contribute to glycogen storageor they may be changed to fat and stored in adiposetissue.Body Temperature and Metabolism 407 Proteins (enzymes, structural) Non-essential amino acids Transamination Proteins (Digestion) Amino acids NH2 CCNH2 Cholesterol and other steroids Figure 17-4.

Can any other food be used to synthesize proteins?17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 407Fatty Acids and Glycerol The end products of fat digestion that are not needed immediately for energy production may be stored asfat (triglycerides) in adipose tissue . Most adipose tis- sue is found subcutaneously and is potential energy fortimes when food intake decreases. Notice in T able17-4 that insulin promotes fat synthesis and storage.One theory of weight gain proposes that a diet high insugars and starches stimulates the secretion of somuch insulin that fat can only be stored, not taken outof storage and used for energy. Fatty acids and glycerol are also used for the syn- thesis of phospholipids , which are essential compo- nents of all cell membranes. Myelin, for example, is of the membranes of Schwann cells,which form the myelin sheath of peripheral neurons. The liver can synthesize most of the fatty acids needed by the body. T wo exceptions are linoleic acidand linolenic acid, which are essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet. Linoleic acid is part oflecithin, which in turn is part of all cell membranes.Vegetable oils are good sources of these essential fattyacids. When fatty acids are broken down in the process of beta-oxidation, the resulting acetyl groups may also beused for the synthesis of cholesterol , a steroid. This takes place primarily in the liver, although all cells arecapable of synthesizing cholesterol for their cell mem-branes. The liver uses cholesterol to synthesize bilesalts for the emulsication of fats in digestion. Thesteroid hormones are also synthesized from choles- terol. Cortisol and aldosterone are produced progesterone by theovaries, and testosterone by the testes. VITAMINS AND MINERALS Vitamins are organic molecules needed in very small amounts for normal body functioning. Some vitamins are coenzymes ; that is, they are necessary for the functioning of certain enzymes. Others are antioxi-dant vitamins, including vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene (a precursor for vitamin A). Antioxidantsprevent damage from free radicals , which are mole- cules that contain an unpaired electron and are highlyreactive. The reactions of free radicals can damageDNA, cell membranes, and the cell organelles. Freeradicals are formed during some normal body reac-tions, but smoking and exposure to pollution willincrease their formation. Antioxidant vitamins com- bine with free radicals before they can react with cel-lular components. Plant foods are good sources ofthese vitamins. T able 17-5 summarizes some impor-tant metabolic and nutritional aspects of the vitaminswe need. Deciencies of vitamins often result in disease: vitamin C deciency and scurvy, for example (see Box4-2). Other deciency diseases that have been knownfor decades include pellagra (lack of niacin), beri-beri(riboflavin), pernicious anemia (B 12), and rickets (D). More recently the importance of folic acid (folacin)for the development of the fetal central nervous sys-tem has been recognized. Adequate folic acid duringpregnancy can signicantly decrease the chance ofspina bida (open spinal column) and anencephaly(absence of the cerebrum, always fatal) in a fetus. Allwomen should be aware of the need for extra (400micrograms) folic acid during pregnancy. Minerals are simple inorganic chemicals and have a variety of functions, many of which you are alreadyfamiliar with. T able 17-6 lists some important aspectsof minerals. We will return to the minerals as part ofour study of fluid-electrolyte balance in Chapter 19. METABOLIC RATE Although the term metabolism is used to describe all of the chemical reactions that take place within thebody, metabolic rate is usually expressed as an amount of heat production. This is because manybody processes that utilize ATP also produce heat.These processes include the contraction of skeletalmuscle, the pumping of the heart, and the normalbreakdown of cellular components. Therefore, it ispossible to quantify heat production as a measure ofmetabolic activity. As mentioned previously, the energy available from food is measured in kilocalories (kcal). Kilocalories arealso the units used to measure the energy expended bythe body. During sleep, for example, energy expendedby a 150-pound person is about 60 to 70 kcal per hour.Getting up and preparing breakfast increases energyexpenditure to 80 to 90 kcal per hour. For motherswith several small children, this value may be signi-cantly higher. Clearly, greater activity results ingreater energy expenditure. The energy required for merely living (lying qui- etly in bed) is the basal metabolic rate (BMR).

Age\u2014Metabolic rate is highest in young children and decreases with age. The energy require-ments for growth and the greater heat loss by asmaller body contribute to the higher rate in chil-dren.

Multiply kg weight by the BMR factor: 55 kg x 0.9 kcal/kg/hr approximate BMR, about 1200kcal/day) BOX17-5 WEIGHT LOSS food. Keeping track of daily caloric intake is an important part of a decision to try to lose weight. Itis also important to remember that sustained loss offat usually does not exceed 1 to 2 pounds per week.In part this is so because as calorie intake decreases,the metabolic rate decreases. There will also be lossof some body protein so that amino acids can beconverted to carbohydrates to supply the brain. A sensible weight-loss diet will include carbohy- drate to supply energy needs, will have sufficientprotein (40 to 45 grams per day), and will be low inanimal fat. Including vegetables and fruits will sup-ply vitamins, minerals, and ber.Although diet books are often found on the best- seller lists, there is no magic method that will resultin weight loss. Losing weight depends on one sim-ple fact: calorie expenditure in activity must exceedcalorie intake in food (the term calorie here will be used to mean kilocalorie). To lose 1 pound of body fat, which consists of fat, water, and protein, 3500 calories of energy must beexpended. Although any form of exercise requirescalories, the more strenuous the exercise, the morecalories expended. Some examples are shown in theaccompanying table. Most food packaging contains nutritional infor- mation, including the calories per serving of the Calories per 10 Calories per 10 minutes (average minutes (average Activity for a 150-lb person) Activity for a 150-lb person) Walking slowly Walking briskly Walking up stairs Dancing (slow)Dancing (fast)30 45 170 40 65Running (8 mph) Cycling (10 mph) Cycling (15 mph)Swimming120 70 11510017Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 411becomes less active, the total decrease is almost 5% per decade. 3. Body conguration of adults\u2014T all, thin people usually have higher metabolic rates than do short,stocky people of the same weight. This is so becausethe tall, thin person has a larger surface area (pro- portional to weight) through which heat is con-tinuously lost. The metabolic rate, therefore, isslightly higher to compensate for the greater heatloss. The variance of surface-to-weight ratios fordifferent body configurations inFig. 17-5. 4. Sex hormones\u2014T estosterone increases metabolic activity to a greater degree than does estrogen, giv-ing men a slightly higher metabolic rate thanwomen. Also, men tend to have more muscle, anactive tissue, whereas women tend to have morefat, a relatively inactive tissue. 5. Sympathetic stimulation\u2014In stress situations, the metabolism of many body cells is increased. Alsocontributing to this are the hormones epinephrineand norepinephrine. As a result, metabolic rateincreases. 6. Decreased food intake\u2014If the intake of food decreases for a prolonged period of time, metabolicrate also begins to decrease. It is as if the body'smetabolism is \"slowing down\" to conserve what-ever energy sources may still be available. (See alsoBox 17-6: Leptin and Body-Mass Index.) 7. Climate\u2014People who live in cold climates may have metabolic rates 10% to 20% higher than peo-ple who live in tropical regions. This is believed tobe due to the variations in the secretion of thyrox-ine, the hormone most responsible for regulationof metabolic rate. In a cold climate, the necessityfor greater heat production brings about an 412Figure 17-5. Surface-to-weight ratios. Imagine that the three shapes are people who all weigh the same amount. The \"tall, thin person\" on the right has about50% more surface area than does the \"short, stocky per-son\" on the left. The more surface area (where heat islost), the higher the metabolic rate. QUESTION: Which of these ratios best represents an infant? (Rather than weight, think of inside-outsideproportion.) Box 17-6 LEPTIN AND BODY-MASS INDEX directly decreases fat storage in cells, and improves the efficiency of the pancreatic cells that produceinsulin. What was rst believed to be a simple chem-ical signal has proved to be much more complex. A good measure of leanness or fatness is the body-mass index .

Divide by height in inches.Divide again by height in inches = body-massindex Example: A person ve foot six weighing 130 pounds. 130 x 703 = 91,390 91,390 /H1100466 = 1385 1385/H1100466 = 20.98 The optimal body-mass index is considered to be 21. Any index over 25 is considered overweight.The 1994 discovery of the hormone leptin was reported to the general public in 1995, along withspeculation that leptin could become an anti-obe-sity medication, which it has not. Leptin is a proteinproduced by fat cells, and signals the hypothalamusto release a chemical that acts as an appetite sup-pressant. It seems to inform the brain of how muchstored fat the body has, and is therefore involved inthe regulation of body weight (along with manyother chemicals, some still unknown). Another likely role for leptin is as a contributor to the onset of puberty, especially in females. Girlswho are very thin, with little body fat, tend to havea later rst menstrual period than girls with averagebody fat, and a certain level of body fat is necessaryfor continued ovulation. Leptin may be the chemi-cal mediator of this information. The most recent research indicates that leptin17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 412Body Temperature 1. Normal range is 96.5 \u00b0to 99.5 \u00b0F (36 \u00b0to 38 \u00b0C), with an average of 98.6 \u00b0F (37 \u00b0C). 2. Normal fluctuation in 24 hours is 1 \u00b0to 2\u00b0F. 3. T emperature regulation in infants and the elderly is not as precise as it is at other ages. Heat Production Heat is one of the energy products of cell respiration.Many factors affect the total heat actually produced(see T able 17-1).1. Thyroxine from the thyroid gland\u2014the most im- portant regulator of daily heat production. As meta-bolic rate decreases, more thyroxine is secreted toincrease the rate of cell respiration. 2. Stress\u2014sympathetic impulses and epinephrine and norepinephrine increase the metabolic activity ofmany organs, increasing the production of ATPand heat. 3. Active organs continuously produce heat. Skeletal muscle tone produces 25% of the total body heat atrest. The liver provides up to 20% of the restingbody heat. 4. Food intake increases the activity of the digestive organs and increases heat production. 5. Changes in body temperature affect metabolic rate.A fever increases the metabolic rate, and more heat is produced; this may become detrimental duringvery high fevers. Heat Loss (see Table 17-2) 1. Most heat is lost through the skin.2. Blood flow through the dermis determines the amount of heat that is lost by radiation, conduc-tion, and convection. 3. Vasodilation in the dermis increases blood flow and heat loss; radiation and conduction are effectiveonly if the environment is cooler than the body. 4. Vasoconstriction in the dermis decreases blood flow and conserves heat in the core of the body. 5. Sweating is a very effective heat loss mechanism; excess body heat evaporates sweat on the skin sur-face; sweating is most effective when the atmos-pheric humidity is low. 6. Sweating also has a disadvantage in that water is lost and must be replaced to prevent serious dehy- dration. 7. Heat is lost from the respiratory tract by the evap- oration of water from the warm respiratorymucosa; water vapor is part of exhaled air. 8. A very small amount of heat is lost as urine and feces are excreted at body temperature.Body Temperature and Metabolism 413 STUDY OUTLINEincreased secretion of thyroxine and a higher meta- bolic rate. AGING AND METABOLISM As mentioned in the previous section, metabolic ratedecreases with age. Elderly people who remain active,however, can easily maintain a metabolic rate (energyproduction) adequate for their needs as long as theirgeneral health is good. Some elderly people subject tophysical or emotional disability, however, may be atrisk for malnutrition. Caregivers may assess such a riskby asking how often the person eats every day; ifappetite is good, fair, or poor; and how the food tastes.These simple questions may help ensure adequatenutrition. Sensitivity to external temperature changes may decrease with age, and the regulation of body temper-ature is no longer as precise. Sweat glands are not asactive, and prolonged high environmental tempera- tures are a real danger for elderly people. In August2003, in Europe, an unusually long and severe heatwave was the cause of at least 25,000 deaths. Most ofthose who died were elderly. SUMMARY Food is needed for the synthesis of new cells and tis-sues, or is utilized to produce the energy required forsuch synthesis reactions. As a consequence of metabo-lism, heat energy is released to provide a constantbody temperature and permit the continuation ofmetabolic activity. The metabolic pathways describedin this chapter are only a small portion of the body'stotal metabolism. Even this simple presentation, how-ever, suggests the great chemical complexity of thefunctioning human being.17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 413Regulation of Heat Loss 1. The hypothalamus is the thermostat of the body and regulates body temperature by balancing heatproduction and heat loss. 2. The hypothalamus receives information from its own neurons (blood temperature) and from thetemperature receptors in the dermis. 3. Mechanisms to increase heat loss are vasodilation in the dermis and increased sweating. Decreasedmuscle tone will decrease heat production. 4. Mechanisms to conserve heat are vasoconstriction in the dermis and decreased sweating. Increasedmuscle tone (shivering) will increase heat produc-tion. Fever\u2014an abnormally elevated body temper- ature1. Pyrogens are substances that cause a fever: bacteria, foreign proteins, or chemicals released duringinflammation (endogenous pyrogens). 2. Pyrogens raise the setting of the hypothalamic thermostat; the person feels cold and begins toshiver to produce heat. 3. When the pyrogen has been eliminated, the hypo- thalamic setting returns to normal; the person feelswarm, and sweating begins to lose heat to lower thebody temperature. 4. A low fever may be benecial because it increases the activity of WBCs and inhibits the activity ofsome pathogens. 5. A high fever may be detrimental because enzymes are denatured at high temperatures. This is mostcritical in the brain, where cells that die cannot bereplaced. Metabolism\u2014all the reactions within the body1. Anabolism\u2014synthesis reactions that usually require energy in the form of ATP . 2. Catabolism\u2014decomposition reactions that often release energy in the form of ATP . 3. Enzymes catalyze most anabolic and catabolic reac- tions. Cell Respiration\u2014the breakdown of food molecules to release their potential energyand synthesize ATP (Fig. 17-3)1. Glucose /H11001oxygen yields CO 2/H11001H2O /H11001ATP /H11001 heat. 2. The breakdown of glucose involves three stages:glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the cytochrome (electron) transport system (see also T able 17-3). 3. The oxygen necessary comes from breathing.4. The water formed becomes part of intracellular fluid; CO 2is exhaled; ATP is used for energy- requiring reactions; heat provides a body tempera-ture. Proteins and Fats\u2014as energy sources (see Table 17-4 for hormonal regulation)1. Excess amino acids are deaminated in the liver and converted to pyruvic acid or acetyl groups to enterthe Krebs cycle. Amino acids may also be convertedto glucose to supply the brain (Fig. 17-3). 2. Glycerol is converted to pyruvic acid to enter the Krebs cycle. 3. Fatty acids, in the process of beta-oxidation in the liver, are split into acetyl groups to enter the Krebscycle; ketones are formed for transport to othercells (see Fig. 17-3). Energy Available from Food 1. Energy is measured in kilocalories (Calories): kcal. 2. There are 4 kcal per gram of carbohydrate, 4 kcal per gram of protein, 9 kcal per gram of fat. Withreference to food, kilocalories may be called calo-ries. Synthesis Uses of Foods (Fig. 17-4) 1. Glucose\u2014used to synthesize the pentose sugars for DNA and RNA; used to synthesize glycogen tostore energy in liver and muscles. 2. Amino acids\u2014used to synthesize new proteins and the non-essential amino acids; essential aminoacids must be obtained in the diet. 3. Fatty acids and glycerol\u2014used to synthesize phos- pholipids for cell membranes, triglycerides for fatstorage in adipose tissue, and cholesterol and othersteroids; essential fatty acids must be obtained inthe diet. 4. Any food eaten in excess will be changed to fat and stored. 5. Vitamins and minerals\u2014see T ables 17-5 and 17-6. kcal1. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the energy required to maintain life (see Box 17-4); several factorsinfluence the metabolic rate of an active person.414 Body Temperature and Metabolism17Scanlon(p3)-ch17 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 4142. Age\u2014metabolic rate is highest in young children and decreases with age. 3. Body conguration\u2014more surface area propor- tional to weight (tall and thin) means a highermetabolic rate. 4. Sex hormones\u2014men usually have a higher meta- bolic rate than do women; men have more muscleproportional to fat than do women.5. Sympathetic stimulation\u2014metabolic activity in- creases in stress situations. 6. Decreased food intake\u2014metabolic rate decreases to conserve available energy sources. 7. Climate\u2014people who live in cold climates usually have higher metabolic rates because of a greaterneed for heat production.Body Temperature and Metabolism 415 REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

Because thedonor and recipient were identical twins, rejection wasnot a problem. Thousands of kidney transplants havebeen performed since then, and the development ofimmunosuppressive medications has permitted manypeople to live normal lives with donated kidneys.Although a person usually has two kidneys, one kidneyis sufficient to carry out the complex work required to maintain homeostasis of the body fluids. The urinary system consists of two kidneys, two ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra (Fig.18-1). The formation of urine is the function of thekidneys, and the rest of the system is responsible foreliminating the urine. Body cells produce waste products such as urea,420 The Urinary System Diaphragm Right kidney Psoas shown in anterior view. QUESTION: Why is blood pressure relatively high in the kidneys? What do you see that would suggest this?18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 420creatinine, and ammonia, which must be removed from the blood before they accumulate to toxic levels.As the kidneys form urine to excrete these waste prod-ucts, they also accomplish several other importantfunctions: 1. Regulation of the volume of blood by excretion or conservation of water 2. Regulation of the electrolyte content of the blood by the excretion or conservation of minerals 3. Regulation of the acid-base balance of the blood by excretion or conservation of ions such as H /H11001ions or HCO3/H11002ions 4. Regulation of all of the above in tissue fluid The process of urine formation, therefore, helps maintain the normal composition, volume, and pH ofboth blood and tissue fluid by removing those sub-stances that would upset the normal constancy andbalance of these extracellular fluids. KIDNEYS The two kidneys are located in the upper abdominal cavity on either side of the vertebral column, behindthe peritoneum ( retroperitoneal ). The upper por- tions of the kidneys rest on the lower surface of thediaphragm and are enclosed and protected by thelower rib cage (see Fig. 18-1). The kidneys areembedded in adipose tissue that acts as a cushion andis in turn covered by a brous connective tissue mem- brane called the renal fascia , which helps hold the kidneys in place (see Box 18-1: Floating Kidney). Each kidney has an indentation called the hilus on its medial side. At the hilus, the renal artery entersthe kidney, and the renal vein and ureter emerge. Therenal artery is a branch of the abdominal aorta, and therenal vein returns blood to the inferior vena cava (seeFig. 18-1). The ureter carries urine from the kidney tothe urinary bladder. INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEY In a coronal or frontal section of the kidney, three areas can be distinguished (Fig. 18-2). The lateral andmiddle areas are tissue layers, and the medial area atthe hilus is a cavity. The outer tissue layer is called therenal cortex ; it is made of renal corpuscles and convo- luted tubules. These are parts of the nephron and aredescribed in the next section. The inner tissue layer isthe renal medulla , which is made of loops of Henle and collecting tubules (also parts of the nephron). Therenal medulla consists of wedge-shaped pieces calledrenal pyramids . The tip of each pyramid is its apex or papilla. The third area is the renal pelvis ; this is not a layer of tissues, but rather a cavity formed by the expansionof the ureter within the kidney at the hilus. Funnel-shaped of the renal pelvis, called calyces enclose the papillae of the renal pyr- amids. Urine flows from the renal pyramids into thecalyces, then to the renal pelvis and out into the ureter. THE NEPHRON The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each kidney contains approximately 1 mil-lion nephrons. It is in the nephrons, with their associ-ated blood vessels, that urine is formed. Each nephronhas two major portions: a renal corpuscle and a renaltubule. Each of these major parts has further subdivi-sions, which are shown with their blood vessels in Fig.18-3. Renal Corpuscle A renal corpuscle consists of a glomerulus surroun- ded by a Bowman's capsule. The glomerulus is a cap- illary network that arises from System 421 BOX18-1 FLOATING KIDNEY A floating kidney is one that has moved out of its normal position. This may happen in very thinpeople whose renal cushion of adipose tissue isthin, or it may be the result of a sharp blow tothe back that dislodges a kidney. A kidney can function in any position; the problem with a floating kidney is that the uretermay become twisted or kinked. If urine cannotflow through the ureter, the urine backs up andcollects in the renal pelvis. Incoming urinefrom the renal tubules then backs up as well. If the renal ltrate cannot flow out of Bowman's capsules, the pressure within Bowman's capsulesincreases, opposing the blood pressure in theglomeruli. Glomerular ltration then cannot takeplace efficiently. If uncorrected, this lead topermanent kidney damage.18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:00 AM Page 421422 The vein artery Arcuate Ureter A CNephronRenal cortex Renal medulla (pyramids) Figure 18-2.

Which areas of a kidney have many blood vessels?18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 422423 Bowman's 18-3. A nephron with its associated blood vessels. Portions of the nephron have been magnied. The arrows indicate the direction of blood flow and flow of renal ltrate.See text for description.QUESTION: How does the shape of a podocyte contribute to its function? How is the lin- ing of the proximal Page 423of smaller than that of the afferent arteriole, which helps maintain a fairly highblood pressure in the glomerulus. Bowman's capsule (or glomerular capsule) is the expanded end of a renal tubule; it encloses theglomerulus. The inner layer of Bowman's capsule ismade of podocytes ; the name means \"foot cells,\" and the \"feet\" of the podocytes are on the surface of theglomerular capillaries. The arrangement of podocytescreates pores, spaces between adjacent \"feet,\" whichmake this layer very permeable. The outer layer ofBowman's capsule has no pores and is not permeable.The space between the inner and outer layers ofBowman's capsule contains renal ltrate, the fluid thatis formed from the blood in the glomerulus and willeventually become urine. Renal Tubule The renal tubule continues from Bowman's capsule and consists of the following parts: proximal convo- luted tubule (in the renal cortex), loop of Henle (or loop of the nephron, in the renal medulla), and distal convoluted tubule (in the renal cortex). The from nephrons empty intoa collecting tubule . Several collecting tubules then a papillary duct that empties urine intoa calyx of the renal pelvis. Cross-sections of the parts of the renal tubule are shown in Fig. 18-3. Notice how thin the walls of thetubule are, and also the microvilli in the proximal con-voluted tubule. These anatomic characteristics providefor efficient exchanges of materials, as you will see. All parts of the renal tubule are surrounded by peritubular capillaries , which arise from the efferent arteriole. The peritubular capillaries will receive thematerials reabsorbed by the renal tubules; this isdescribed in the section on urine formation. BLOOD VESSELS OF THE KIDNEY The pathway of blood flow through the kidney is anessential part of the process of urine formation. Bloodfrom the abdominal aorta enters the renal artery , which branches extensively within the kidney intosmaller arteries (see Fig. 18-2). The smallest arteriesgive rise to afferent arterioles to efferent arterioles,to peritubular capillaries, to veins within the kidney, tothe renal vein , and nally to the inferior vena cava.Notice that in this pathway there are two sets of cap- illaries, and recall that it is in capillaries that exchangestake place between the blood and surrounding tissues.Therefore, in the kidneys there are two sites of ex-change. The exchanges that take place between thenephrons and the capillaries of the kidneys will formurine from blood plasma. Figure 18-2 shows two views of a vascular cast of a kidney; the shape of the blood vessels has been pre-served in red plastic. You can see how dense the vas-culature of a kidney is, and most of these vessels arecapillaries. FORMATION OF URINE The formation of urine involves three major pro-cesses. The rst is glomerular ltration, which takesplace in the renal corpuscles. The second and third aretubular reabsorption and tubular secretion, which takeplace in the renal tubules. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION You may recall that ltration is the process in whichblood pressure forces plasma and dissolved materialout of capillaries. In glomerular ltration , blood pressure forces plasma, dissolved substances, and smallproteins out of the glomeruli and into Bowman's cap-sules. This fluid is no longer plasma but is called renal ltrate . The blood pressure in the glomeruli, compared with that in other capillaries, is relatively high, about60 mmHg. The pressure in Bowman's capsule is verylow, and its inner, podocyte layer is very permeable, sothat approximately 20% to 25% of the blood thatenters glomeruli becomes renal ltrate in Bowman's capsules. The blood cells and larger proteins are toolarge to be forced out of the glomeruli, so they remain in the blood. Waste products are dissolved in bloodplasma, so they pass into the renal ltrate. Usefulmaterials such as nutrients and minerals are also dis-solved in plasma and are also present in renal ltrate.Filtration is not selective with respect to usefulness; itis selective only with respect to size. Therefore, renalltrate is very much like blood plasma, except thatthere is far less protein and no blood cells are present. The glomerular ltration rate (GFR) is the amount of renal ltrate formed by the kidneys in 1minute, and averages 100 to 125 mL per minute. GFR424 The Urinary System18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 424may be altered if the rate of blood flow through the kidney changes. If blood flow increases, the GFRincreases, and more ltrate is formed. If blood flow decreases (as may happen following a severe hemor-rhage), the GFR decreases, less ltrate is formed, andurinary output decreases (see Box 18-2: Renal Failureand Hemodialysis). TUBULAR REABSORPTION Tubular reabsorption takes place from the renal tubules into the peritubular capillaries. In a 24-hourperiod, the kidneys form 150 to 180 liters of ltrate,and normal urinary output in that time is 1 to 2 liters.Therefore, it becomes apparent that most of the renalltrate does not become urine. Approximately 99% ofthe ltrate is reabsorbed back into the blood in theperitubular capillaries. Only about 1% of the ltrate will enter the renal pelvis as urine.Most reabsorption and secretion (about 65%) the proximal convoluted tubules, whose cellshave microvilli that greatly increase their surface area. The distal convoluted tubules and collecting tubulesare also important sites for the reabsorption of water(Fig. 18-4). Mechanisms of Reabsorption 1.Active transport \u2014the cells of the renal tubule use ATP to transport most of the useful materials fromthe ltrate to the blood. These useful materialsinclude glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and positiveions. For many of these substances, the renal tubules have a threshold level of reabsorption. This means that there is a limit to how much the tubules canremove from the ltrate. For example, if the ltratelevel of glucose is normal (reflecting a normalThe Urinary System 425 BOX18-2 RENAL FAILURE AND HEMODIALYSIS articial kidney machine to do what the patient's nephrons can no longer do. The patient's blood ispassed through minute tubes surrounded by fluid(dialysate) with the same chemical composition asplasma. Waste products and excess minerals diffuseout of the patient's blood into the fluid of themachine. Although hemodialysis does prolong life for those with chronic renal failure, it does not fully take theplace of functioning kidneys. The increasing successrate of kidney transplants, however, does indeedprovide the possibility of a normal life for peoplewith chronic renal failure.Renal failure , the inability of the kidneys to func- tion properly, may be the result of three generalcauses, which may be called prerenal, intrinsicrenal, and postrenal. \"Prerenal\" means that the problem is \"before\" the kidneys, that is, in the blood flow to the kid-neys. Any condition that decreases blood flow tothe kidneys may result in renal damage and failure.Examples are severe hemorrhage or very low bloodpressure following a heart attack (MI). \"Intrinsic renal\" means that the problem is in the kidneys themselves. Diabetes and hypertensiondamage the blood vessels of the kidneys, and arethe causes of 70% of all cases of end-stage renalfailure. Bacterial infections of the kidneys or expo-sure to chemicals (certain antibiotics) may causedamage to the nephrons. Polycystic kidney diseaseis a genetic disorder in which the kidney tubules dilate and become nonfunctional. Severe damage may not be apparent until age 40 to 60 years butmay then progress to renal failure. \"Postrenal\" means that the problem is \"after\" the kidneys, somewhere in the rest of the urinary tract.Obstruction of urine flow may be caused by kidneystones, a twisted ureter, or prostatic hypertrophy. Treatment of renal failure involves correcting the specic cause, if possible. If not possible, and kidneydamage is permanent, the person is said to havechronic renal failure. Hemodialysis is the use of an A CB Box Figure 18-A Causes of renal failure. ( A) Prerenal. (B) Intrinsic renal. ( C) Proximal tubule H2O Glucose tubular renal tubule has been uncoiled, and the peritubular capillariesare shown adjacent to the tubule. QUESTION: Describe tubular secretion; that is, it goes from where to where? What sub- stances may be secreted?18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 426blood glucose level), the tubules will reabsorb all of the glucose, and none will be found in the urine.What happens is this: The number of glucosetransporter molecules in the membranes of thetubule cells is sufficient to take in the number ofglucose molecules passing by in the ltrate. If,however, the blood glucose level is above normal,the amount of glucose in the ltrate will also beabove normal and will exceed the threshold level ofreabsorption. The number of glucose molecules tobe reabsorbed is more than the number of thetransporter molecules available to do so. In this sit-uation, therefore, some glucose will remain in theltrate and be present in urine. The reabsorption of Ca /H110012ions is increased by parathyroid hormone (PTH). The parathyroidglands secrete PTH when the blood calcium leveldecreases. The reabsorption of Ca /H110012ions by the kidneys is one of the mechanisms by which theblood calcium level is raised back to normal. The hormone aldosterone, secreted by the adre- nal cortex, increases the reabsorption of Na /H11001ions and the excretion of K/H11001ions. Besides regulating the blood levels of sodium and potassium, aldosteronealso affects the volume of blood. 2.Passive transport \u2014many of the negative ions that are returned to the blood are reabsorbed followingthe of positive ions, because reabsorption of water follows the reabsorption of minerals, especially sodium ions.The hormones that affect reabsorption of water arediscussed in the next section. 4.Pinocytosis \u2014small proteins are too large to be reabsorbed by active transport. They become adsorbed to the membranes of the cells of the prox-imal convoluted tubules. The cell membrane then sinks inward and folds around the protein to take itin (see Fig. 3-3 for depictions of this and the othertransport mechanisms). Normally all proteins inthe ltrate are reabsorbed; none is found in urine. TUBULAR SECRETION This mechanism also changes the composition ofurine. In tubular secretion , substances are actively secreted from the blood in the peritubular capillariesinto the ltrate in the renal tubules. Waste products,such as ammonia and some creatinine, and the meta-bolic products of medications may be secreted into theltrate to be eliminated in urine. Hydrogen ions (H /H11001) may be secreted by the tubule cells to help maintainthe normal pH of blood. HORMONES THAT INFLUENCE REABSORPTION OF WATER Aldosterone is secreted by the adrenal cortex in re- sponse to a high blood potassium level, to a low bloodsodium level, or to a decrease in blood pressure. Whenaldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of Na /H11001ions, water follows from the ltrate back to the blood. Thishelps maintain normal blood volume and blood pres-sure. You may recall that the antagonist to aldosterone is natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is by atria of the heart when the atrial walls arestretched by high blood pressure or greater blood vol-ume. ANP decreases the reabsorption of Na /H11001ions by the kidneys; these remain in the ltrate, as does water,and are excreted. By increasing the elimination ofsodium and water, ANP lowers blood volume andblood pressure. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released by the posterior pituitary gland when the amount of water inthe body decreases. Under the influence of ADH, thedistal convoluted tubules and collecting tubules areable to reabsorb more water from the renal ltrate.This helps maintain normal blood volume and bloodpressure, and also permits the kidneys to produceurine that is more concentrated than body fluids.Producing a concentrated urine is essential to preventexcessive water loss while still excreting all the sub-stances that must be eliminated. If the amount of water in the body increases, how- ever, the secretion of ADH diminishes, and the kid-neys will reabsorb less water. Urine then becomesdilute, and water is eliminated until its concentrationin the body returns to normal. This may occur follow-ing ingestion of excessive quantities of fluids. SUMMARY OF URINE FORMATION 1. The kidneys form urine from blood plasma. Blood flow through the kidneys is a major factor in deter-mining urinary output. 2. Glomerular ltration is the rst step in urine for- mation. Filtration is not selective in terms of use-fulness of materials; it is selective only in terms ofsize. High blood pressure in the glomeruli forcesThe Urinary System 42718Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM materials, and small proteins into Bowman's capsules; the fluid is now called renalltrate. 3. T ubular reabsorption is selective in terms of useful- ness. Nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, andvitamins are reabsorbed by active transport andmay have renal threshold levels. Positive ions arereabsorbed by active transport and negativeions are reabsorbed most often by passive trans-port. Water is by osmosis, and smallproteins are reabsorbed by pinocytosis. Reabsorption takes place from the ltrate in the renal tubules to the blood in the peritubular capil-laries. 4. T ubular secretion takes place from the blood in the peritubular capillaries to the ltrate in the renaltubules and can ensure that wastes such as creati-nine or excess H /H11001ions are actively put into the l- trate to be excreted. 5. Hormones such as aldosterone, ANP , and ADH influence the reabsorption of water and help main-tain normal blood volume and blood pressure. Thesecretion of ADH determines whether a concen-trated or dilute urine will be formed. 6. Waste products remain in the renal ltrate and are excreted in urine. The effects of hormones on thekidneys are summarized in T able 18-1 and illus-trated in Fig. 18-5. THE KIDNEYS AND ACID-BASE BALANCE The kidneys are the organs most responsible for main- taining the pH of blood and tissue fluid within normalranges. They have the greatest ability to compensate for the pH changes that are a normal part of bodymetabolism or the result of disease, and to make thenecessary corrections. This regulatory function of the kidneys is complex, but at its simplest it may be described as follows. Ifbody fluids are becoming too acidic, the kidneys willsecrete more H /H11001ions into the renal ltrate and will return more HCO3/H11002ions to the blood. This will help raise the pH of the blood back to normal. The reac-tions involved in such a mechanism are shown in Fig.18-6, to which we will return later. First, however, letus briefly consider how the kidneys will compensatefor body fluids that are becoming too alkaline. Youmight expect the kidneys to do just the opposite ofwhat was just described, and that is just what happens.The kidneys will return H /H11001ions to the blood and excrete HCO3/H11002ions in urine. This will help lower the pH of the blood back to normal. Because the natural tendency is for body fluids to become more acidic, let us look at the pH-raisingmechanism in more detail (see Fig. 18-6). The cellsof the renal tubules can secrete H /H11001ions or ammonia in exchange for Na/H11001ions and, by doing so, influence the reabsorption of other ions. Hydrogen ions areobtained from the reaction of CO 2and water (or other processes). An amine group from an amino acid iscombined with an H /H11001ion to form ammonia. The tubule cell secretes the H/H11001ion and the ammo- nia into the renal ltrate, and two Na/H11001ions are reab- sorbed in exchange. In the ltrate, the H/H11001ion and ammonia form NH4/H11001(an ammonium radical), which reacts with a chloride ion (Cl/H11002) to form NH4Cl (ammonium chloride) that is excreted in urine. As the Na/H11001ions are returned to the blood in the428 The Urinary System Table 18-1 EFFECTS OF HORMONES ON THE KIDNEYS Hormone (gland) Function Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) water from the ltrate to the blood. Increases reabsorption of Ca/H110012ions from ltrate to the blood and excretion of phosphate ions into the ltrate. Increases reabsorption of Na/H11001ions from the ltrate to the blood and excretion of K/H11001ions into the ltrate. Water is reabsorbed following the reabsorption of sodium. Decreases reabsorption of Na/H11001ions, which remain in the ltrate. More sodium and water are eliminated in urine.18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 428peritubular capillaries, HCO3/H11002ions follow. Notice what has happened: T wo H/H11001ions have been excreted in urine, and two Na/H11001ions and two HCO3/H11002ions have been returned to the blood. As reactions like thesetake place, the body fluids are prevented from becom-ing too acidic. Another mechanism used by the cells of the kidney tubules to regulate pH is the phosphate buffer system,which is described in Chapter 19. OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS In addition to the functions described thus far, the kid-neys have other functions, some of which are notdirectly related to the formation of urine. These func- tions are secretion of renin (which does influenceurine formation), production of erythropoietin, andactivation of vitamin D. 1.Secretion renin cells enzyme renin . renin-angiotensin mechanism to raise blood pres-sure. This was rst described in Chapter 13, andthe sequence of events is presented in T able 18-2.The end product of this mechanism is angiotensin II, which causes vasoconstriction and increases the secretion of aldosterone, both of which help raiseblood pressure.The Decreases reabsorption of Na+ Figure 18-5. Effects of hormones on the kidneys. QUESTION: Do any of these hormones affect both reabsorption and secretion? If so, how?18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 429A normal blood pressure is essential to normal body functioning. Perhaps the most serious changeis a sudden, drastic decrease in blood pressure, suchas would follow a severe hemorrhage. In response tosuch a decrease, the kidneys will decrease ltrationand urinary output and will initiate the formation ofangiotensin II. In these ways the kidneys help ensure that the heart has enough blood to pump to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure. 2.Secretion of erythropoietin \u2014This hormone is secreted whenever the blood oxygen level decreases(a state of hypoxia). Erythropoietin stimulatesthe red bone marrow to increase the rate of RBCproduction. With more RBCs in circulation, theoxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is greater,and the hypoxic state may be corrected (see alsoBox 18-3: Erythropoietin). 3.Activation of vitamin D \u2014This vitamin exists in several structural forms that are converted to cal-citriol (D 2) by the kidneys. Calcitriol is the most active form of vitamin D, which increases theabsorption of calcium and phosphate in the The cells of the renal tubule secrete H/H11001 ions and ammonia into the ltrate and returnNa /H11001ions and HCO3/H11002ions to the blood in the peritubular capillaries.

Decreased blood pressure stimulates the kidneys to secrete renin. 2. Renin splits the plasma protein angiotensinogen (synthesized by the liver) to angiotensin I. 3. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by an enzyme found in lung tissue and vascular endothe- lium. II 430ELIMINATION OF URINE The ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra do not change the composition or amount of urine, but areresponsible for the periodic elimination of urine. URETERS Each ureter extends from the hilus of a kidney to the lower, posterior side of the urinary bladder (see Fig.18-1). Like the kidneys, the ureters are retroperi-toneal, that is, behind the peritoneum of the dorsalabdominal cavity. The smooth muscle in the wall of the ureter con- tracts in peristaltic waves to propel urine toward theurinary bladder. As the bladder lls, it expands andcompresses the lower ends of the ureters to preventbackflow of urine. URINARY BLADDER The urinary bladder is a muscular sac below the peri- toneum and behind the pubic bones. In women, thebladder is inferior to the uterus; in men, the bladder issuperior to the prostate gland. The bladder is a reser-voir for accumulating urine, and it contracts to elimi-nate urine. The mucosa of the bladder is transitional epithe- lium , which permits expansion without tearing the lining. When the bladder is empty, the mucosaappears wrinkled; these folds are rugae , which also permit expansion. On the floor of the bladder is a tri-angular area called the trigone , which has no rugae and does not expand. The points of the triangle arethe openings of the two ureters and that of the urethra(Fig. 18-7). The smooth muscle layer in the wall of the bladder is called the detrusor muscle . It is a muscle in the form of a sphere; when it contracts it becomes asmaller sphere, and its volume diminishes. Around theopening of the urethra the muscle bers of the detru-sor form the internal urethral sphincter (or sphinc- ter of the bladder), which is involuntary. URETHRA The urethra (see Fig. 18-7) carries urine from the bladder to the exterior. The external urethral sphincter is made of the surrounding skeletal muscle of the pelvic floor, and is under voluntary control. In women, the urethra is 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 4 cm) long and is anterior to the vagina. In men, theurethra is 7 to 8 inches (17 to 20 cm) long. The rstpart just outside the bladder is called the prostatic ure-thra because it is surrounded by the prostate gland.The next inch is the membranous urethra, aroundwhich is the external urethral sphincter. The longestportion is the cavernous urethra (or spongy or penileurethra), which passes through the cavernous (or erec- tile) tissue of the penis. The male urethra carries semen as well as urine. THE URINATION REFLEX Urination may also be called micturition or voiding . This reflex is a spinal cord reflex over which voluntarycontrol may be exerted. The stimulus for the reflex isstretching of the detrusor muscle of the bladder. Thebladder can hold as much as 800 mL of urine, or evenmore, but the reflex is activated long before the maxi-mum is reached. When urine volume reaches 200 to 400 mL, the stretching is sufficient to generate sensory impulsesthat travel to the sacral spinal cord. Motor impulsesreturn along parasympathetic nerves to the detrusormuscle, causing contraction. At the same time, theinternal urethral sphincter relaxes. If the external ure-thral sphincter is voluntarily relaxed, urine flows intothe urethra, and the bladder is emptied. Urination can be prevented by voluntary contrac- tion of the external urethral sphincter. However, if thebladder continues to ll and be stretched, voluntarycontrol is eventually no longer possible.The Urinary System 431 BOX18-3 ERYTHROPOIETIN Anemia is one of the most debilitating conse- quences of renal failure, one that hemodialysiscannot reverse. Diseased kidneys stop produc-ing erythropoietin, a natural stimulus for RBCproduction. Erythropoietin can be produced bygenetic engineering and is available for hemo-dialysis patients. In the past, their anemia couldonly be treated with transfusions, which exposedthese patients to possible immunologic compli-cations of repeated exposure to donated bloodor to viral diseases. The synthetic erythropoietineliminates such risks. Others who benet fromthis medication are cancer patients and AIDSpatients with severe anemia.18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 431CHARACTERISTICS OF URINE The characteristics of urine include the physical and chemical aspects that are often evaluated as part of aurinalysis. Some of these are described in this section,and others are included in Appendix D: Normal Values for Some Commonly Used Urine T ests. Amount \u2014normal urinary output per 24 hours is 1 to 2 liters. Many factors can signicantly changeoutput. Excessive sweating or loss of fluid through432 The Cavernous (erectile) tissue of penisAB Figure 18-7.

QUESTION: Name the sphincters of the urinary system and state whether each is volun- tary or involuntary.18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 output ( oliguria ) to conserve intake willincrease urinary output ( polyuria ). Consumption of alcohol will also increase output because alcoholinhibits the secretion of ADH, and the kidneys willreabsorb less water. Color \u2014the typical yellow color of urine (from urochrome, a breakdown product of bile) is oftenreferred to as \"straw\" or \"amber.\" Concentratedurine is a deeper yellow (amber) than is dilute urine.Freshly voided urine is also clear rather than cloudy. Specic gravity \u2014the normal range is 1.010 to 1.025; this is a measure of the dissolved materials in urine.The specic gravity of distilled water is 1.000, mean-ing that there are no solutes present. Therefore, thehigher the specic gravity number, the more dis-solved material is present. Someone who has beenexercising strenuously and has lost body water insweat will usually produce less urine, which willbe more concentrated and have a higher specicgravity. The specic gravity of the urine is an indicator of the concentrating ability of the kidneys: The kid-neys must excrete the waste products that are con-stantly formed in as little water as possible. pH\u2014the pH range of urine is between 4.6 and 8.0, with an average value of 6.0. Diet has the greatestinfluence on urine pH. A vegetarian diet will resultin a more alkaline urine, whereas a high-proteindiet will result in a more acidic urine. Constituents \u2014urine is approximately 95% water, which is the solvent for waste products and salts.Salts are not considered true waste products becausethey may well be utilized by the body when needed, but excess amounts will be excreted in urine (seeBox 18-4: Kidney Stones). Nitrogenous wastes \u2014as their name indicates, all of these wastes contain nitrogen. Urea is formed byliver cells when excess amino acids are deaminatedto be used for energy production. Creatinine comesfrom the metabolism of creatine phosphate, anenergy source in muscles. Uric acid comes from themetabolism of nucleic acids, that is, the breakdownof DNA and RNA. Although these are waste prod-ucts, there is always a certain amount of each in theblood. Box 18-5: Blood T ests and Kidney Functiondescribes the relationship between blood levels ofthese waste products and kidney function. Other non-nitrogenous waste products include small amounts of urobilin from the hemoglobin ofold RBCs (see Fig. 11-4), and may include themetabolic products of medications. T able 18-3summarizes the characteristics of urine. When a substance not normally found in urine does appear there, there is a reason for it. The rea-son may be quite specic or more general. T able18-4 lists some abnormal constituents of urine andpossible reasons for each (see also Box 18-6:Urinary T ract Infections). AGING AND THE URINARY SYSTEM With age, the number of nephrons in the kidneysdecreases, often to half the original number by the ageof 70 to 80, and the kidneys lose some of their con-The Urinary System 433 BOX18-4 KIDNEY STONES The entry of a kidney stone into a ureter may cause intense pain (renal colic) and bleeding.Obstruction of a ureter by a stone may causebackup of urine and possible kidney damage.Treatments include surgery to remove the stone, orlithotripsy, the use of shock waves to crush thestone into pieces small enough to be eliminated without damage to the urinary tract. A recent study links lithotripsy with an increased risk of diabetes orhypertension later in life, though the mechanismsthat would bring about these conditions have notyet been discovered.Kidney stones, or renal calculi , are crystals of the salts that are normally present in urine. A very highconcentration of salts in urine may trigger precipi-tation of the salt and formation of crystals, whichcan range in size from microscopic to 10 to 20 mmin diameter. The most common type of kidney stone is made of calcium salts; a less common type is made of uric acid. Kidney stones are most likely to form in the renal pelvis. Predisposing factors include decreased fluidintake or overingestion of minerals (as in mineralsupplements), both of which lead to the formationof a very concentrated urine.18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 433434 The Urinary System Table 18-3 CHARACTERISTICS OF NORMAL URINE Characteristic Description Amount Color Specic gravity pH Composition Nitrogenous wastes1-2 liters per 24 hours; highly variable depending on fluid intake and water loss through the skin and GI tract Straw or amber; darker means more concentrated; should be clear, not cloudy 1.010-1.025; a measure of the dissolved material in urine; the lower the value, the more dilute the urine Average 6; range 4.6-8.0; diet has the greatest effect on urine pH 95% water; 5% salts and waste muscle metabolismUric acid\u2014from nucleic acid metabolism Table 18-4 ABNORMAL CONSTITUENTS IN URINE Characteristic Reason(s) Glycosuria (presence of glucose) Proteinuria (presence of ofblood\u2014RBCs) Bacteriuria (presenceof bacteria) Ketonuria (presence ofketones)As long as blood glucose levels are within normal limits, ltrate levels will also be normal and will not exceed the threshold level for reabsorption. In an untreated diabetic, for example, blood glucose is too high; therefore the ltrate glucose level is too high. The kidneys reabsorb glucoseup to their threshold level, but the excess remains in the ltrate and is excreted in urine. Most plasma proteins are too large to be forced out of the glomeruli, and the small proteins that enter the ltrate are reabsorbed by pinocytosis. The presence of protein in the urine indicates that the glomeruli have become too permeable, as occurs in some types of kidney disease. The presence of RBCs in urine may also indicate that the glomeruli have become too permeable. Another possible cause might be bleeding somewhere in the urinary tract. Pinpointing the site of bleeding would require specic diagnostic tests. Bacteria give urine a cloudy rather than clear appearance; WBCs may be present also. The pres- ence of bacteria means that there is an infection somewhere in the urinary tract. Further diag-nostic tests would be needed to determine the precise location. Ketones are formed from fats and proteins that are used for energy production. A trace of ketones in urine is normal. Higher levels of ketones indicate an increased use of fats and proteins forenergy. This may be the result of malfunctioning carbohydrate metabolism (as in diabetes mel-litus) or simply the result of a high-protein diet. BOX18-5 BLOOD TESTS AND KIDNEY FUNCTION impaired. Of the three, the creatinine level is proba- bly the most reliable indicator of kidney functioning.Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) may vary considerably incertain situations not directly related to the kidneys.For example, BUN may be elevated as a conse-quence of a high-protein diet or of starvation whenbody protein is being broken down at a faster ratethan normal. Uric acid levels may also vary accord-ing to diet. However, elevated blood levels of allthree nitrogenous wastes usually indicate impairedglomerular ltration.Waste products are normally present in the blood, and the concentration of each varies within a nor-mal range. As part of the standard lab work calledblood chemistry, the levels of the three nitrogenouswaste products are determined (urea, creatinine,and uric acid). If blood levels of these three substances are within normal ranges, it may be concluded that thekidneys are excreting these wastes at normal rates.If, however, these blood levels are elevated, onepossible cause is that kidney function has been18Scanlon(p3)-ch18 8/17/06 11:01 AM Page 434centrating ability. The glomerular ltration rate also decreases, partly as a consequence of arteriosclerosisand diminished renal blood flow. Despite these chan-ges, excretion of nitrogenous wastes usually remainsadequate. The urinary bladder decreases in size, and the tone of the detrusor muscle decreases. These changes maylead to a need to urinate more frequently. Urinaryincontinence (the inability to control voiding) is notan inevitable consequence of aging, and can be preventedor minimized. Elderly people are, however, more atrisk for infections of the urinary tract, especially ifvoiding leaves residual urine in the bladder.SUMMARY The kidneys are the principal regulators of the inter-nal environment of the body. The composition of allbody fluids is either directly or indirectly regulated bythe kidneys as they form urine from blood plasma.The kidneys are also of great importance in the regu-lation of the pH of the body fluids. These topics arethe subject of the next chapter.The Urinary System 435 BOX18-6 URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS Symptoms include frequency of urination, painful voiding, and low back pain. Nephritis (or pyelo- nephritis) is inflammation of the kidneys. Althoughthis may be the result of a systemic bacterial in-fection, nephritis is a common complication ofuntreated lower urinary tract infections such as cys-titis. Possible symptoms are fever and flank pain (inthe area of the kidneys). Untreated nephritis mayresult in severe damage to nephrons and progressto renal failure.Infections may occur anywhere in the urinary tract and are most often caused by the microbial agentsof sexually transmitted diseases (see Chapter 20) orby the bacteria that are part of the normal flora ofthe colon. In women especially, the urinary andanal openings are in close proximity, and colon bac-teria on the skin of the perineum may invade theurinary tract. The use of urinary catheters in hospi-talized or bedridden patients may also be a factor ifsterile technique is not carefully followed. Cystitis is inflammation of the urinary bladder. STUDY OUTLINE The urinary system consists of two kidneys, two ureters, the urinary bladder, and theurethra.1. The kidneys form urine to excrete waste products and to regulate the volume, electrolytes, and pH ofblood and tissue fluid. 2. The other organs of the system are concerned with elimination of urine. Kidneys (see Fig. 18-1) 1. Retroperitoneal on either side of the backbone in the upper abdominal cavity; partially protected bythe lower rib cage. 2. Adipose tissue and the renal fascia cushion the kid- neys and help hold them in place. 3.

T wo sets of capillaries provide for two sites of exchanges between the blood and tissues in theprocess of urine formation. Formation of Urine (see Fig. 18-4) 1. Glomerular filtration\u2014takes place from the glomerulus to Bowman's capsule. High blood pres-sure (60 mmHg) in the glomerulus forces plasma,dissolved materials, and small proteins out of theblood and into Bowman's capsule. The fluid is nowcalled ltrate. Filtration is selective only in terms ofsize; blood cells and large proteins remain in theblood. 2. GFR is 100 to 125 mL per minute. Increased blood flow to the kidney increases GFR; decreased bloodflow decreases GFR. 3. T ubular reabsorption\u2014takes place from the ltrate in the renal tubule to the blood in the peritubularcapillaries; 99% of the ltrate is reabsorbed; only1% becomes urine. Active transport\u2014reabsorption of glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and positive ions; thresh-old level is a limit to the quantity that can bereabsorbed.

T ubular secretion\u2014takes place from the blood in the peritubular capillaries to the ltrate in the renaltubule; creatinine and other waste products may besecreted into the ltrate to be excreted in urine;secretion of H /H11001ions helps maintain pH of blood. 5. Kidneys and Acid-Base Balance 1. The kidneys have the greatest capacity to compen- sate for normal and abnormal pH changes. 2. If the body fluids are becoming too acidic, the kid- neys excrete H /H11001ions and return HCO3/H11002ions to the blood (see Fig. 18-6). 3. If the body fluids are becoming too alkaline, the kidneys return H/H11001ions to the blood and excrete HCO3/H11002ions. Other Functions of the Kidneys 1. Secretion of renin by juxtaglomerular cells when blood pressure decreases (see T able 18-2). Angio-tensin II causes vasoconstriction and increasessecretion of aldosterone. 2. Secretion of erythropoietin in response to hypoxia; stimulates red bone marrow to increase rate ofRBC production. 3. Activation of vitamin D\u2014conversion of inactive forms to the active form.

More precisely, we are salt-watery creatures, though not as salty as the oceans.Water, the fluid medium of the human body, makes up55% to 75% of the total body weight. Electrolytes arethe positive and negative ions present in body fluids. Inprevious chapters we have called these salts or, in somecases, trace elements. Many of these ions are mineralsthat are already familiar to you. They each have spe-cic functions in body fluids, and some of them arealso involved in the maintenance of the normal pH ofthe body fluids. In this chapter we will rst discussfluid-electrolyte balance, then review and summarizethe mechanisms involved in acid-base balance. WATER COMPARTMENTS Most of the water of the body, about two-thirds of thetotal water volume, is found within individual cells andis called intracellular fluid (ICF). The remaining third is called extracellular fluid (ECF) and includes blood plasma, lymph, tissue fluid, and the specializedfluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, aque-ous humor, and serous fluid.Water constantly moves from one fluid site in the body to another by the processes of ltration andosmosis. These fluid sites are called water compart- ments (Fig. 19-1). The chambers of the heart and all of the blood vessels form one compartment, and thewater within is called plasma. By the process of ltra-tion in capillaries, some plasma is forced out into tis-sue spaces (another compartment) and is then calledtissue fluid. When tissue fluid enters cells by theprocess of osmosis, it has moved to still another com-partment and is called intracellular fluid. The tissuefluid that enters lymph capillaries is in yet anothercompartment and is called lymph. The other process (besides ltration) by which water moves from one compartment to another isosmosis, which, you may recall, is the diffusion ofwater through a semi-permeable membrane. Waterwill move through cell membranes from the area of itsgreater concentration to the area of its lesser concen-tration. Another way of expressing this is to say thatwater will diffuse to an area with a greater concentra-tion of dissolved material. The concentration of elec-trolytes present in the various water compartmentsdetermines just how osmosis will take place. There-442 Fluid-Electrolyte and Balance Fluid movementIntracellular fluid Cell Capillary Lymph capillaryLymph Interstitial (tissue) fluid Plasma Figure 19-1. Water compartments. The name given to water in each of its locations is indicated.QUESTION: Name two specialized fluids that are similar to tissue fluid.19Scanlon(p3)-ch19 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 442fore, if water is in balance in all of the compartments, the electrolytes are also in balance. Although waterand ions are constantly moving, their relative propor-tions in the compartments remain constant; this isfluid-electrolyte homeostasis, and its maintenance isessential for life (see Box 19-1: Edema). WATER INTAKE AND OUTPUT Most of the water the body requires comes from theingestion of liquids; this amount averages 1600 mLper day. The food we eat also contains water. Evenfoods we think of as somewhat dry, such as bread,contain signicant amounts of water. The daily watertotal from food averages 700 mL. The last source ofwater, about 200 mL per day, is the metabolic waterthat is a product of cell respiration. The total intakeof water per day, therefore, is about 2500 mL, or 2.5liters. Most of the water lost from the body is in the form of urine produced by the kidneys; this averages 1500mL per day. About 500 mL per day is lost in the formof sweat, another 300 mL per day is in the form ofwater vapor in exhaled air, and another 200 mL perday is lost in feces. The total output of water is thusabout 2500 mL per day. Naturally, any increase in water output must be compensated for by an increase in intake. Someonewho exercises strenuously, for example, may lose 1 to 2 liters of water in sweat and must replace that waterby drinking more fluids. In a healthy individual, waterintake equals water output, even though the amountsof each may vary greatly from the averages just men-tioned (Fig. 19-2 and T able 19-1). REGULATION OF WATER INTAKE AND OUTPUT The hypothalamus in the brain contains osmorecep- tors that detect changes in the osmolarity of bodyFluid-Electrolyte and Acid-Base Balance 443 BOX19-1 EDEMA lower extremities (pulmonary edema was described in Chapter 15). Systemic bacterial infections may increase capil- lary permeability, and loss of plasma to tissue spacesis one aspect of septicemia. In this situation, how-ever, the edema is of secondary importance to thehypotension, which may be life-threatening. Insufficient osmosis, the return of tissue fluid into capillaries, is a consequence of a decrease in plasmaproteins, especially albumin. This may occur insevere liver diseases such as cirrhosis, kidney diseaseinvolving loss of protein in urine, malnutrition, orsevere burn injuries. Because edema is a symptom rather than a dis- ease, treatment is aimed at correcting the speciccause. If that is not possible, the volume of tissuefluid may be diminished by a low-salt diet and theuse of diuretics.Edema is an abnormal increase in the amount of tissue fluid, which may be localized or systemic.Sometimes edema is inapparent, and sometimes itis apparent as swelling. Localized edema follows injury and inflamma- tion of a body part. Spraining an ankle, forexample, damages tissues that then releasehistamine. Histamine increases the permeability ofcapillaries, and more tissue fluid is formed. Astissue fluid accumulates, the ankle may becomeswollen. Systemic edema is the result of an imbalance between the movement of water out of and intocapillaries, that is, between ltration and osmosis.Excessive ltration will occur when capillary pres-sure rises. This may be caused by venous obstruc-tion due to blood clots or by congestive heartfailure. Edema of this type is often apparent in the Table 19-1 WATER INTAKE AND OUTPUT Average Amount Form per 24 Hours (mL) Intake Liquids 1600 Food 700 Metabolic water 200 Output Urine 1500 Sweat (and insensible 500 water loss) Exhaled air (water vapor) 300Feces 20019Scanlon(p3)-ch19 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 443fluids. Osmolarity is the concentration of dissolved materials present in a fluid. Dehydration raises theosmolarity of the blood; that is, there is less water inproportion to the amount of dissolved materials.Another way to express this is to simply say that theblood is now a more concentrated solution. Whendehydrated, we feel the sensation of thirst, character-ized by dryness of the mouth and throat, as less salivais produced. Thirst is an uncomfortable sensation, andwe drink fluids to relieve it. The water we drink isreadily absorbed by the mucosa of the stomach andsmall intestine and has the effect of decreasing theosmolarity of the blood. In other words, we can saythat the water we just drank is causing the blood tobecome a more dilute solution, and, as the serumosmolarity returns to normal, the sensation of thirst diminishes. As you may recall, the hypothalamus is also involved in water balance because of its productionof antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is stored in theposterior pituitary gland. In a state of dehydration, ADH fromthe posterior pituitary. thenincreases the reabsorption of water by the kidneytubules. Water is returned to the blood to preserveblood volume, and urinary output decreases. The hormone aldosterone, from the adrenal cortex, also helps regulate water output. Aldosterone in-creases the reabsorption of Na /H11001ions by the kidney tubules, and water from the renal ltrate follows the444 Fluid-Electrolyte and Acid-Base Balance Metabolic waterFoodLiquidsInput Output Urine Sweat Exhaled air FecesFigure 19-2. Water intake and output. See text andTable 19-1 for description. QUESTION: On a very hot day, how might the outputvolumes change?19Scanlon(p3)-ch19 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 444Na/H11001ions back to the blood. Aldosterone is secreted when the Na/H11001ion concentration of the blood de- creases or whenever there is a signicant decrease inblood pressure (the renin-angiotensin mechanism). Several other factors may also contribute to water loss. These include excessive sweating, hemorrhage,diarrhea or vomiting, severe burns, and fever. In thesecircumstances, the kidneys will conserve water, butwater must also be replaced by increased consump-tion. Following hemorrhage or during certain diseasestates, fluids may also be replaced by intravenousadministration. A less common occurrence is that of too much water in the body. This may happen following over-consumption of fluids. The osmolarity of the blooddecreases, and there is too much water in proportionto electrolytes (or, the blood is too dilute). This con-dition may become symptomatic, and is called waterintoxication. Symptoms are dizziness, abdominalcramps, nausea, and lethargy. Convulsions are possiblein severe cases, and fluids must be restricted until thekidneys can excrete the excess water. A hormone thatwill contribute to that is atrial natriuretic peptide(ANP), which is secreted by the atria when vol-ume or blood pressure increases. ANP then decreasesthe reabsorption of Na /H11001ions by the kidneys, which increases urinary output of sodium and water. Also,secretion of ADH will diminish, which will contributeto a greater urinary output that will return the bloodosmolarity to normal. ELECTROLYTES Electrolytes are chemicals that dissolve in water and dissociate into their positive and negative ions. Mostelectrolytes are the inorganic salts, acids, and basesfound in all body fluids. Most organic compounds are non-electrolytes; that is, they do not ionize when in solution. Glucose, forexample, dissolves in water but does not ionize; itremains as intact glucose molecules. Some proteins,however, do form ionic bonds and when in solutiondissociate into ions. Positive ions anions. Electrolytes help create the osmolarity of body flu-ids and, therefore, help regulate the osmosis of water between water compartments. Some electrolytes areinvolved in acid-base regulatory mechanisms, or theyare part of structural components of tissues or part ofenzymes. ELECTROLYTES IN BODY FLUIDS The three principal fluids in the body are intracellularfluid and the extracellular fluids plasma and tissuefluid. The relative concentrations of the most impor-tant electrolytes in these fluids are depicted in Fig.19-3. The major differences may be summarized asfollows. In intracellular fluid, the most abundantcation is K /H11001, the most abundant anion is HPO4/H110022, and protein anions are also abundant. In both tissue fluidand plasma, the most abundant cation is Na /H11001, and the most abundant anion is Cl/H11002. Protein anions form a signicant part of plasma but not of tissue fluid. Thefunctions of the major electrolytes are described inT able 19-2. INTAKE, OUTPUT, AND REGULATION Electrolytes are part of the food and beverages weconsume, are absorbed by the gastrointestinal tractinto the blood, and become part of body fluids.Hormones regulate the ECF concentrations of someelectrolytes. Aldosterone ofNa /H11001ions and the excretion of K/H11001ions by the kidneys. The blood sodium level is thereby raised, and theblood potassium level is lowered. ANP increasesthe excretion of Na /H11001ions by the kidneys and lowers the blood sodium level. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)and calcitonin regulate the blood levels of calcium andphosphate. PTH increases the reabsorption of theseminerals from bones, and increases their absorptionfrom food in the small intestine (vitamin D is also nec-essary). Calcitonin promotes the removal of calciumand phosphate from the blood to form bone matrix. Electrolytes are lost in urine, sweat, and feces. Urine contains the electrolytes that are not reab-sorbed by the kidney tubules; the major one of these isNa /H11001ions. Other electrolytes are present in urine when their concentrations in the blood exceed the body'sneed for them. The most abundant electrolytes in sweat are Na /H11001 ions and Cl/H11002ions. Electrolytes lost in feces are those that are not absorbed in either the small intestine orcolon.Fluid-Electrolyte and Acid-Base Balance 44519Scanlon(p3)-ch19 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 445446 Fluid-Electrolyte and Acid-Base Balance Some of the major imbalances of electrolyte levels are described in Box 19-2: Electrolyte Imbalances. ACID-BASE BALANCE You have already learned quite a bit about the regula-tion of the pH of body fluids in the chapters on chem-istry (see Chapter 2 for the pH scale), the respiratorysystem, and the urinary system. In this section, we willput all of that information together. The normal pH range of blood is 7.35 to 7.45. The pH of tissue fluid is similar but can vary slightly aboveor below this range. The intracellular fluid has a pHrange of 6.8 to 7.0. Notice that these ranges of pH arequite narrow; they must be maintained in order forenzymatic reactions and other processes to proceednormally.Maintenance of acid-base homeostasis is accom- plished by the buffer systems in body fluids, the rateand depth of respiration, and the kidneys. BUFFER SYSTEMS The purpose of a buffer system is to prevent drastic changes in the pH of body fluids by chemically react-ing with strong acids or bases that would otherwisegreatly change the pH. A buffer system consists of aweak acid and a weak base. These molecules react withstrong acids or bases that may be produced and changethem to substances that do not have a great effect onpH. Bicarbonate Buffer System The two components of this buffer system are carbonicacid (H 2CO3), a weak acid, and sodium bicarbonate Figure 19-3. Electrolyte concentrations in intracellular fluid, tissue fluid, and plasma. Concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per liter. See text for summary of major differences among these fluids.QUESTION: Tissue fluid is most like which of the other fluids?

Each of these molecules par- ticipates in a specic type of reaction. If a potential pH change is created by a strong acid, the following reaction takes place: HCl/H11001NaHCO3NaCl /H11001H2CO3 (strong acid) (weak acid) The strong acid has reacted with the sodium bicar- bonate to produce a salt (NaCl) that has no effect onpH and a weak acid that has little effect on pH. If a potential pH change is created by a strong base, the following reaction takes place: NaOH /H11001H 2CO3H2O /H11001NaHCO3 (strong base) (weak base) The strong base has reacted with the carbonic acid to produce water, which has no effect on pH and aweak base that has little effect on pH. The bicarbonate buffer system is important in both the blood and tissue fluid. During normal metabolism,these fluids tend to become more acidic, so moresodium bicarbonate than carbonic acid is needed. Theusual ratio of these molecules to each other is about 20to 1 (NaHCO 3to H2CO3). Phosphate Buffer System The two components of this buffer system are sodiumdihydrogen phosphate (NaH 2PO4), a weak acid, and sodium monohydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4), a weak base. Let us use specic reactions to show how thisbuffer system works. If a potential pH change is created by a strong acid, the following reaction takes place: HCl/H11001Na 2HPO4NaCl /H11001NaH2PO4 (strong acid) (weak acid) The strong acid has reacted with the sodium mono- hydrogen phosphate to produce a salt that has noeffect on pH and a weak acid that has little effect onpH. If a potential pH change is created by a strong base, the following reaction takes place: NaOH /H11001NaH 2PO4H2O /H11001Na2HPO4 (strong base) (weak base) The strong base has reacted with the sodium dihy- drogen phosphate to form water, which has no effecton pH and a weak base that has little effect on pH.The phosphate buffer system is important in the regulation of the pH of the blood by the kidneys (seeFig. 19-4). The cells of the kidney tubules can removeexcess hydrogen ions by forming NaH 2PO4, which is excreted in urine. The retained Na/H11001ions are returned to the blood in the peritubular capillaries, along withbicarbonate ions. Protein Buffer System This buffer system is the most important one in theintracellular fluid. You may recall from Chapter 15that hemoglobin buffers the hydrogen ions formedduring CO 2transport. The amino acids that make up proteins each have a carboxyl group (COOH) and an amine (or amino) group (NH2) and may act as either acids or bases. The carboxyl group may act as an acid because it can donate a hydrogen ion (H/H11001) to the fluid to coun- teract increasing alkalinity: The amine group may act as a base because it can pick up an excess hydrogen ion from the fluid to coun-teract increasing acidity: The buffer systems react within a fraction of a sec- ond to prevent drastic pH changes. However, theyhave the least capacity to prevent great changes in pHbecause a limited number of molecules of these buffersare present in body fluids. When an ongoing cause isdisrupting the normal pH, the respiratory and renalmechanisms will also be needed. RESPIRATORY MECHANISMS The respiratory system affects pH because it regulatesthe amount of CO 2present in body fluids. As youCOOH NH2H 448know, the respiratory system may be the cause of a pH imbalance or may help correct a pH imbalance from some other cause. Respiratory Acidosis and Alkalosis Respiratory acidosis is caused by anything that decreases the rate or efficiency of respiration. Severe pulmonary diseases are possible causes of respiratoryacidosis. When CO 2cannot be exhaled as fast as it is formed during cell respiration, excess CO2results in the formation of excess H/H11001ions, as shown in this reaction: CO2/H11001H2O H2CO3H/H11001/H11001HCO3/H11002 The excess H/H11001ions lower the pH of body fluids. Respiratory alkalosis is far less common but is the result of breathing more rapidly, which increases theamount of CO 2exhaled. Because there are fewer CO2molecules in the body fluids, fewer H/H11001ions are formed, and pH tends to rise. Respiratory Compensation for Metabolic pH Changes Changes in pH caused by other than a respiratory dis- order are called metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. In either case, the respiratory system may help prevent adrastic change in pH. Metabolic acidosis may be caused by kidney dis- ease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, excessive diar-rhea or vomiting, or the use of some diuretics. Whenexcess H /H11001ions are present in body fluids, pH begins to decrease, and this stimulates the respiratory centers in the medulla. The response is to increase the rate ofbreathing to exhale more CO 2to decrease H/H11001ion for- mation. This helps raise the pH back toward 19-4. The phosphate buffer system. The reactions are shown in a kidney tubule. See text for description. QUESTION: From where does the kidney tubule cell get a hydrogen ion to excrete?19Scanlon(p3)-ch19 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 449Metabolic alkalosis is not common, but may be caused by the overuse of antacid medications or thevomiting of stomach contents only. As the pH of bodyfluids begins to rise, breathing slows and decreases theamount of CO 2exhaled. The CO2retained within the body increases the formation of H/H11001ions, which will help lower the pH back toward the normal range. The respiratory system responds quickly to prevent drastic changes in pH, usually within 1 to 3 minutes.For an ongoing metabolic pH imbalance, however, therespiratory mechanism does not have the capacity tofully compensate. In such cases, respiratory compen-sation is only 50% to 75% effective. RENAL MECHANISMS As just discussed in Chapter 18, the kidneys help reg-ulate the pH of extracellular fluid by excreting or con-serving H /H11001ions and by reabsorbing (or not) Na/H11001ions and HCO3/H11002ions. One mechanism was depicted in Fig. 18-6, and another, involving the phosphate buffersystem, is shown in Fig. 19-4. The kidneys have the greatest capacity to buffer an ongoing pH change. Although the renal mechanismsdo not become fully functional for several hours todays, once they do they continue to be effective farlonger than respiratory mechanisms. Let us use as anexample a patient with untreated diabetes mellituswho is in ketoacidosis, a metabolic acidosis. As acidicketones accumulate in the blood, the capacity of theextracellular fluid (ECF) buffer systems is quicklyexhausted. Breathing rate then increases, and more CO 2is exhaled to decrease H/H11001ion formation and raise the pH of ECF . There is, however, a limit to howmuch the respiratory rate can increase, but the renalbuffering mechanisms will then become effective. At this time it is the kidneys that are keeping the patientalive by preventing acidosis from reaching a fatal level.Even the kidneys have limits, however, and the causeof the acidosis must be corrected to prevent death. EFFECTS OF pH CHANGES A state of acidosis is most detrimental to the central nervous system, causing depression of impulse trans-mission at synapses. A person in acidosis becomes con-fused and disoriented, then lapses into a coma. Alkalosis has the opposite effect and affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Increasedsynaptic transmission, even without stimuli, is rstindicated by irritability and muscle twitches. Progres-sive alkalosis is characterized by severe muscle spasmsand convulsions. The types of pH changes are summarized in T able 19-3. AGING AND FLUID AND pH REGULATION Changes in fluid balance or pH in elderly people areoften the result of disease or damage to particularorgans. A weak heart (congestive heart failure) thatcannot pump efficiently allows blood to back up in cir-culation. In turn, this may cause edema, an abnormalcollection of fluid. Edema may be systemic (oftenapparent in the lower legs) if the right ventricle isweak, or pulmonary if the left ventricle is failing. The sense of thirst may not be as acute in elderly450 Fluid-Electrolyte and Acid-Base Balance Table 19-3 pH CHANGES Compensation acidosis Metabolic alkalosis Respiratory acidosis vomiting Overingestion of bicarbonate medications, gastric suctioning Decreased rate or efficiency of respiration: emphysema, asthma, pneumonia, paralysis of respiratory muscles Increased rate of respiration: anxiety, high altitude Increased respirations to exhale CO2 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 450people, who may become severely dehydrated before they begin to feel thirsty. An important behavioralconsideration is that elderly people who fear urinaryincontinence may decrease their intake of fluids. Deciencies of minerals in elderly people may bethe result of poor nutrition or a side effect of some medications, especially those for hypertension thatincrease urinary output. Disturbances in pH may becaused by chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, or kid-ney disease.Fluid-Electrolyte and Acid-Base Balance 451 STUDY OUTLINE Fluid-Electrolyte Balance 1. Water makes up 55% to 75% of the total body weight. 2. Electrolytes are the ions found in body fluids; most are minerals. Water Compartments (see Fig. 19-1) 1. Intracellular fluid (ICF)\u2014water within cells; about two-thirds of total body water. 2. Extracellular fluid (ECF)\u2014water outside cells; includes plasma, lymph, tissue fluid, and specializedfluids. 3. Water constantly moves from one compartment to another. Filtration: plasma becomes tissue fluid.Osmosis: tissue fluid becomes plasma, or lymph, orICF . 4. Osmosis is regulated by the concentration of elec- trolytes in body fluids (osmolarity). Water will dif-fuse through membranes to areas of greaterelectrolyte concentration. Water Intake (see Fig. 19-2) 1. Fluids, food, metabolic water\u2014see T able 19-1. Water Output (see Fig. 19-2) 1. Urine, sweat, exhaled air, feces\u2014see T able 19-1.2. Any variation in output must be compensated for by a change in input. Regulation of Water Intake and Output 1. Hypothalamus contains osmoreceptors that detect changes in osmolarity of body fluids. 2. Dehydration stimulates the sensation of thirst, and fluids are consumed to relieve it. 3. ADH released from the posterior pituitary increases the reabsorption of water by the kidneys. 4. Aldosterone secreted by the adrenal cortex increases the reabsorption of /H11001ions by the kid- neys; water is then reabsorbed by osmosis.5. If there is too much water in the body, secretion of ADH decreases, and urinary output increases. 6. If blood volume increases, ANP promotes loss of Na/H11001ions and water in urine. Electrolytes 1. Chemicals that dissolve in water and dissociate into ions; most are inorganic. 2. Cations are positive ions such as Na/H11001and Anions are negative ions such as Cl/H11002and HCO3/H11002. 4. By creating osmotic pressure, electrolytes regulate the osmosis of water between compartments. Electrolytes in Body Fluids (see Fig. 19-3 and Table 19-2)1.

May be the cause of a pH change or help compen- sate for a metabolic pH change\u2014see T able 19-3. 3. Respiratory compensation is rapidly effective (within a few minutes), but limited in capacity if thepH imbalance is ongoing.Renal Mechanisms 1. The kidneys have the greatest capacity to buffer pH changes, but they may take several hours todays to become effective (see T able 19-3). 2. Reactions: see Figs. 18-6 and 19-4.3.

How dry and impersonal thatsounds, until we remember that each of us is a contin-uation of our species and that many of us in turn willhave our own children. Although some other animalscare for their offspring in organized families or soci-eties, the human species is unique, because of culturalinfluences, in the attention we give to reproductionand to family life. Yet like other animals, the actual production and growth of offspring is a matter of our anatomy andphysiology. The male and female reproductive systemsproduce gametes , that is, sperm and egg cells, and ensure the union of gametes in fertilization followingsexual intercourse. In women, the uterus provides thesite for the developing embryo/fetus until it is suffi-ciently developed to survive outside the womb. This chapter will describe the organs of reproduc- tion and the role of each in the creation of new life orthe functioning of the reproductive system as a whole.First, however, we will discuss the formation ofgametes. MEIOSIS The cell division process of meiosis produces the gametes\u2014sperm or egg cells. In meiosis, one cell withthe diploid number of chromosomes (46 for humans)divides twice to form four cells, each with the haploidnumber of chromosomes. Haploid means half the usual diploid number, so for humans the haploid number is23. Although the process of meiosis is essentially thesame in men and women, there are some importantdifferences. SPERMATOGENESIS Spermatogenesis is the process of meiosis as it takes place in the testes, the site of sperm production.Within each testis are seminiferous tubules that contain spermatogonia, which are stem cells that gen-erate sperm. A spermatogonium divides by mitosis toform two cells, one of which will remain in place as astem cell, while the other differentiates (specializes) tobecome a primary spermatocyte that will undergomeiosis (Fig. 20-1). As you may recall from Chapter10, gamete formation is regulated by hormones.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from anterior pituitary gland initiates sperm and secreted by the when stimulated byluteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary,promotes the maturation of sperm. Inhibin, also pro-duced by the testes, decreases the secretion of FSH. Asyou can see in Fig. 20-1, for each primary spermato-cyte that undergoes meiosis, four functional spermcells are produced. Sperm production begins at puberty (10 to 14 years of age), and millions of sperm are formed eachday in the testes. Although sperm production dimin-ishes with advancing age, there is usually no completecessation, as there is of egg production in women atmenopause. OOGENESIS Oogenesis is the process of meiosis for egg cell for- mation; it begins in the ovaries and is also regulated byhormones. FSH initiates the growth of ovarian folli- cles, each of which contains an oogonium, a stem cell for egg cell production (Fig. 20-2). This hormone alsostimulates the follicle cells to secrete estrogen, whichpromotes the maturation of the ovum. Notice that foreach primary oocyte that undergoes meiosis, only onefunctional egg cell is produced. The other three cellsproduced are called polar bodies. They have no func-tion, and will simply deteriorate. A mature ovarian fol-licle actually contains the secondary oocyte; thesecond meiotic division will take place if and when theegg is fertilized. The production of ova begins at puberty (10 to 14 years of age) and continues until menopause (45 to 55 years of age), when the ovaries atrophy and no longer respond to pituitary hormones. During this 30- to 40- year span, egg production is cyclical, with a matureovum being produced approximately every 28 days(the menstrual cycle is discussed later in this chapter).Actually, several follicles usually begin to developduring each cycle. However, the rupturing (ovulation)of the rst follicle to mature stops the growth of theothers. The process of meiosis is like other human proces- ses in that \"mistakes\" may sometimes occur. One ofthese, trisomy, is discussed in Box 20-1: T risomy andDown Syndrome. The haploid egg and sperm cells produced by meiosis each have 23 chromosomes. When fertiliza-456 The Reproductive Systems20Scanlon(p3)-ch20 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 456tion occurs, the nuclei of the egg and sperm merge, and the fertilized egg ( zygote ) has 46 chromosomes, the diploid number. Thus, meiosis maintains thediploid number of the human species by reducing thenumber of chromosomes by half in the formation ofgametes. MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM The male reproductive system consists of the testesand a series of ducts and glands. Sperm are producedin the testes and are transported through the glandsproduce secretions that become part of semen, thefluid that is ejaculated from the urethra. These glands are the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bul-bourethral glands. TESTES The testes are located in the scrotum , a sac of skin between the upper thighs. The temperature withinthe scrotum is about 96 /H11034F , slightly lower than body temperature, which is necessary for the productionof viable sperm. In the male fetus, the testes developnear the kidneys, then descend into the scrotum justbefore birth. Cryptorchidism is the condition in which the testes fail to descend, and the result issterility unless the testes are surgically placed in thescrotum.The Reproductive Systems 457 Mitosis SpermatogoniumStem cell New stem cell Figure 20-1.

QUESTION: When does the secondary oocyte begin the second meiotic division? BOX20-1 TRISOMY AND DOWN SYNDROME every 5000 live births. Both of these trisomies are characterized by severe mental and physical retar-dation, heart defects, deafness, and bone abnor-malities. Affected infants usually die within their rstyear. Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) is the most common trisomy, with a frequency of about oneper 750 live births. Children with Down syndromeare mentally retarded, but there is a great range ofmental ability in this group. Physical characteristicsinclude a skin fold above each eye, short stature,poor muscle tone, and heart defects. Again, thedegree of severity is highly variable. Women over the age of 35 are believed to be at greater risk of having a child with Down syndrome.The reason may be that as egg cells age the processof meiosis is more likely to proceed incorrectly.Trisomy means the presence of three (rather than the normal two) of a particular chromosome in thecells of an individual. This may occur because ofnon-disjunction (nonseparation) of a chromosomepair during the second meiotic division, usually inan egg cell. The egg cell has two of a particularchromosome, and if fertilized by a sperm, will thencontain three of that chromosome, and a total of47 chromosomes. Most trisomies are probably lethal; that is, the affected embryo will quickly die, even before thewoman realizes she is pregnant. When an embryo-fetus survives and a child is born with a trisomy,developmental defects are always present. The severity of trisomies may be seen in two of the more rarely occurring ones: Trisomy 13 andTrisomy 18, each of which occurs about once for 45820Scanlon(p3)-ch20 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 458Each testis is about 1.5 inches long by 1 inch wide (4 cm by 2.5 cm) and is divided internally into lobes(Fig. 20-4). Each lobe contains several seminiferous tubules , in seminiferous tubulesare (Sertoli ) cells produce the hormone inhibin when stimulated by testosterone. Between the loops of the seminiferous tubules areinterstitial cells , which produce hormone (LH) from theanterior pituitary gland. Besides its role in the matu-ration of sperm, testosterone is also responsible for themale secondary sex characteristics, which begin todevelop at puberty (T able 20-1). A sperm cell consists of several parts, which are shown in Fig. 20-1. The head contains the 23 chro-mosomes. On the tip of the head is the acrosome , which is similar to a lysosome and contains enzymes todigest the membrane of an egg cell. Within the mid-dle piece are mitochondria that produce ATP . The fla- gellum provides motility, the capability of the sperm cell to move. It is the beating of the flagellum thatrequires energy from ATP . Sperm from the seminiferous tubules enter a tubu- lar network called the rete testis, then enter the epi-didymis, the rst of the reproductive ducts. EPIDIDYMIS The epididymis (plural: epididymides) is a tube about 20 feet (6 m) long that is coiled on the posterior sur-face of each testis (see Fig. 20-4).

Smooth muscle inthe wall of the epididymis propels the sperm into deferens extends from the epididymis in the scrotum on its ownside into the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal . This canal is an opening in the abdominal wall for the spermatic cord , a connective tissue sheath that contains the ductus deferens, testicular bloodvessels, and nerves. Because the inguinal canal is anopening in a muscular wall, it is a natural \"weak spot,\"and it is the most common site of hernia formation inmen. Once inside the abdominal cavity, the ductus defer- ens extends upward over the urinary bladder, thendown the posterior side to join the ejaculatory duct onits own side (see Fig. 20-3). The smooth muscle layerof the ductus deferens contracts in waves of peristalsisas part of ejaculation (see Box 20-2: Contraception).EJACULATORY DUCTS Each of the two ejaculatory ducts receives sperm from the ductus deferens and the secretion of the sem-inal vesicle on its own side. Both ejaculatory ductsempty into the single urethra (see Fig. 20-3). SEMINAL VESICLES The paired seminal vesicles are posterior to the uri- nary bladder (see Fig. 20-3).

Women who use thismethod of contraception should not smoke, be-cause smoking seems to be associated with abnor-mal clotting and a greater risk of heart attack orstroke. Barrier methods \u2014These include the condom, diaphragm, and cervical cap, which prevent spermfrom reaching the uterus and fallopian tubes. Theuse of a spermicide (sperm-killing chemical)increases the effectiveness of these methods. A con-dom is a latex or rubber sheath that covers thepenis and collects and contains ejaculated semen.Leakage is possible, however, and the condom isconsidered 80% to 90% effective. This is the onlycontraceptive method that decreases the spread ofsexually transmitted diseases. The diaphragm and cervical cap are plastic struc- tures that are inserted into the vagina to cover thecervix. They are about 80% effective. These meth- ods should not be used, however, by women with vaginal infections or abnormal Pap smears or bythose who have had toxic shock syndrome.There are several methods of contraception, or birth control; some are more effective than others. Sterilization \u2014Sterilization in men involves a relatively simple procedure called a vasectomy . The ductus (vas) deferens is accessible in the scro-tum, in which a small incision is made on eitherside. The ductus is then sutured and cut. Althoughsperm are still produced in the testes, they cannotpass the break in the ductus, and they simply dieand are reabsorbed. Sterilization in women is usually accomplished bytubal ligation , the suturing and severing of the fallopian tubes. Usually this can be done by way ofa small incision in the abdominal wall. Ova cannotpass the break in the tube, nor can sperm pass fromthe uterine side to fertilize an ovum. When done properly, these forms of surgical ster- ilization are virtually 100% effective. Oral contraceptives (\"the pill \")\u2014Birth con- trol pills contain progesterone and estrogen in vary-ing proportions. They prevent ovulation byinhibiting FSH LH from theanterior pituitary gland. When about 98% effective.20Scanlon(p3)-ch20 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 461fluid that helps maintain sperm motility. The smooth muscle of the prostate gland contracts during ejacula- tion to contribute to the expulsion of semen from the urethra (see Box 20-3: Prostatic Hypertrophy). BULBOURETHRAL GLANDS Also called Cowper's glands, the bulbourethral glands are about the size of peas and are located below the prostate gland; they empty into the urethra. Theiralkaline secretion coats the interior of the urethra justbefore ejaculation, which neutralizes any acidic urinethat might be present. You have probably noticed that the secretions of the male reproductive glands are alkaline. This isimportant because the cavity of the female vagina hasan acidic pH created by the normal flora, the naturalbacterial population of the vagina. The alkalinity ofseminal fluid helps neutralize the acidic vaginal pHand permits sperm motility in what might otherwisebe an unfavorable environment. URETHRA\u2014PENIS The urethra is the last of the ducts through which semen travels, and its longest portion is enclosedwithin the penis. The penis is an external genital organ; its distal end is called the glans penis and is cov-ered with a fold of skin called the prepuce or foreskin.Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin.This is a common procedure performed on male infants, and though there is considerable medicaldebate as to whether circumcision has a useful pur-pose, some research studies have found fewer cases ofHIV infection among circumcised men, comparedwith men who are uncircumcised. Within the penis are three masses of cavernous (erectile) tissue (see Fig. 20-3). Each consists of aframework of smooth muscle and connective tissuethat contains blood sinuses, which are large, irregularvascular channels. When blood flow through these sinuses is minimal, the penis is flaccid. During sexual stimulation, thearteries to the penis dilate, the sinuses ll with blood,and the penis becomes erect and rm. The dilation ofpenile arteries and the resulting erection are broughtabout by the localized release of nitric oxide (NO) andby parasympathetic impulses. The erect penis is capa-ble of penetrating the female vagina to deposit sperm.The culmination of sexual stimulation is ejaculation, asympathetic response that is brought about by peristal-sis of all of the reproductive ducts and contraction ofthe prostate gland and the muscles of the pelvic floor. SEMEN Semen consists of sperm and the secretions of the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethralglands; its average pH is about 7.4. During ejacula-tion, approximately 2 to 4 mL of semen is expelled.Each milliliter of semen contains about 100 millionsperm cells. FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM The female reproductive system consists of the pairedovaries and fallopian tubes, the single uterus andvagina, and the external genital structures (Fig. 20-5).Egg cells (ova) are produced in the ovaries and travelthrough the fallopian tubes to the uterus. The uterusis the site for the growth of the embryo-fetus. OVARIES The ovaries are a pair of oval structures about 1.5 inches (4 cm) long on either side of the uterus in thepelvic cavity (Fig. 20-6). The ovarian ligamentextends from the medial side of an ovary to the uter-ine wall, and the broad ligament is a fold of the peri-462 The Reproductive Systems BOX20-3 PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY prostatic hypertrophy is acommon occurrence in men over the age of 60years. The enlarged prostate compresses the ure-thra within it and may make urination difficult orresult in urinary retention. A prostatectomy is thesurgical removal of part or all of the prostate. Apossible consequence is that ejaculation may beimpaired. Newer surgical procedures may pre-serve sexual function, however, and medicationsare available to shrink enlarged prostate tissue. Cancer of the prostate is the second most common cancer among men (lung cancer isrst). Most cases occur in men over the age of 50years. Treatment may include surgery to removethe prostate, radiation therapy, or hormone ther-apy to reduce the patient's level of testosterone.20Scanlon(p3)-ch20 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 462toneum that covers the ovaries. These ligaments help keep the ovaries in place. Within an ovary are several hundred thousand pri- mary follicles , which are present at birth. During a woman's childbearing years, only 300 to 400 of thesefollicles will produce mature ova. As with sperm pro-duction in men, the supply of potential gametes farexceeds what is actually needed, but this helps ensurethe continuation of the human species.Each primary ovarian follicle contains an oocyte, a potential ovum or egg cell. Surrounding the oocyteare the follicle cells, which secrete estrogen.

Under the influence of LH, the ruptured folliclebecomes the corpus luteum and begins to secrete progesterone as well as estrogen. Hormones producedin smaller amounts by the corpus luteum are inhibinand relaxin. FALLOPIAN TUBES There are two fallopian tubes (also called uterine tubes or oviducts); each is about 4 inches (10 cm) long.The lateral end of a fallopian tube encloses an ovary, and the medial end opens into the uterus. The end ofthe tube that encloses the ovary has mbriae , fringe- like projections that create currents in the fluid sur-rounding the ovary to pull the ovum into the fallopiantube. Because the ovum has no means of self-locomotion (as do sperm), the structure of the fallopian tubeensures that the ovum will be kept moving toward theuterus. The smooth muscle layer of the tube contractsin peristaltic waves that help propel the ovum (orzygote, as you will see in a moment).

The sweeping action of the cilia alsomoves the ovum toward the uterus. Fertilization usually takes place in the fallopian tube. If not fertilized, an ovum dies within 24 to 48hours and disintegrates, either in the tube or theuterus. If fertilized, the ovum becomes a zygote and isswept into the uterus; this takes about 4 to 5 days (seeBox 20-4: In Vitro Fertilization). Sometimes the zygote will not reach the uterus but will still continue to develop. This is called an ectopic pregnancy ; ectopic means \"in an abnormal site.\" The developing embryo may become implanted in the fal-lopian tube, the ovary itself, or even elsewhere in theabdominal cavity. An ectopic pregnancy usually doesnot progress very long, because these other sites arenot specialized to provide a placenta or to expand toaccommodate the growth of a fetus, as the uterus is.The spontaneous termination of an ectopic pregnancyis usually the result of bleeding in the mother, and sur-gery may be necessary to prevent maternal death fromcirculatory shock. Occasionally an ectopic pregnancydoes go to full term and produces a healthy baby; suchan event is a credit to the adaptability of the humanbody and to the advances of medical science. UTERUS The uterus is shaped like an upside-down pear, about 3 inches long by 2 inches wide by 1 inch deep (7.5 cmby 5 cm by 2.5 cm), superior to the urinary bladderand between the two ovaries in the pelvic cavity(see Fig. 20-5). The broad ligament also covers theuterus (see Fig. 20-6). During pregnancy the uterus increases greatly in size, contains the placenta to nour-ish the embryo-fetus, and expels the baby at the end ofgestation. The parts and layers of the uterus are shown in Fig. 20-6. The fundus is the upper portion above the entry of the fallopian tubes, and the body is the large central portion. The narrow, lower end of the uterus isthe cervix , which opens into the vagina. The outermost layer of the uterus, the serosa or epimetrium, is a fold of the peritoneum. The myome- trium is the smooth muscle layer; during pregnancy these cells increase in size to accommodate the grow-ing fetus and contract for labor and delivery at the endof pregnancy. The lining of the uterus is the endometrium , which itself consists of two layers. The basilar layer , adjacent to the myometrium, is vascular but verythin and is a permanent layer. The functional layer is regenerated and lost during each menstrual cycle. Under the influence of estrogen and progesteronefrom the ovaries, the growth of blood vessels thick- ens the functional layer in preparation for a possibleembryo. If fertilization does not occur, the functionallayer sloughs off in menstruation. During pregnancy,the endometrium forms the maternal portion of theplacenta. VAGINA The vagina is a muscular tube about 4 inches (10 cm) long that extends from the cervix to the vaginal oricein the perineum (pelvic floor). It is posterior to theThe Reproductive Systems 465 BOX20-4 IN VITRO FERTILIZATION woman's fallopian tube. Development then pro- ceeds as if the ova had been fertilized naturally. Since the birth of the rst \"test tube baby\" in 1978, many thousands of babies have been bornfollowing in vitro fertilization. The techniques are not always successful, and repeated attempts canbe very expensive. As an adjunct to IVF, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis may be done, to test for genetic diseasesand chromosome abnormalities such as the tri-somies described in Box 20-1. This may be espe-cially useful for older women trying to conceive andfor couples with a family history of a genetic diseasesuch as sickle-cell anemia or cystic brosis.In vitro fertilization (IVF) is fertilization outside the body, usually in a glass dish. A woman whowishes to conceive by this method is given FSH tostimulate the simultaneous development of severalovarian follicles. LH may then be given to stimulatesimultaneous ovulation. The ova are removed byway of a small incision in the abdominal wall andare placed in a solution containing the sperm of thewoman's partner (or an anonymous donor). Afterfertilization and the rst mitotic divisions of cleav-age, the very early embryo is placed in the woman'suterus. It is also possible to mix the removed ova with sperm and return them almost immediately to the20Scanlon(p3)-ch20 8/17/06 11:02 AM Page 465urethra and anterior to the rectum (see Fig. 20-5). The vaginal opening is usually partially covered by athin membrane called the hymen , which is ruptured by the rst sexual intercourse or by the use of tamponsduring the menstrual period. The functions of the vagina are to receive sperm from the penis during sexual intercourse, to providethe exit for menstrual blood flow, and to become thebirth canal at the end of pregnancy. The vaginal mucosa after puberty is stratied squamous epithelium, which is relatively resistant topathogens. The normal flora (bacteria) of the vaginacreates an acidic pH that helps inhibit the growthof pathogens (see Box 20-5: Sexually T ransmittedDiseases). EXTERNAL GENITALS The female external genital structures may also becalled the vulva (Fig. 20-7), and include the clitoris,labia majora and minora, and the Bartholin's glands (see Fig. 20-5). The clitoris is a small mass of erectile tissue ante- rior to the urethral orice. The only function of theclitoris is sensory; it responds to sexual stimulation,and its vascular sinuses become lled with blood. The mons pubis is a pad of fat over the pubic sym- physis, covered with skin and pubic labia minora (medial), which are of skin. The area between the labia minora iscalled the vestibule and contains the openings of theurethra and vagina. The labia cover these openingsand prevent drying their mucous membranes. Bartholin's glands , also called vestibular glands (see 20-5 and 20-6), are within the floor ofthe vestibule; their ducts open onto the mucosa at thevaginal orice. The secretion of these glands keeps themucosa moist and lubricates the vagina during sexualintercourse.466 The Reproductive Systems BOX20-5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES simplex (usually type 2).

Neonatal herpes is infection of a newborn dur- ing passage through the birth canal.

This is one of the most prevalent STDs in the United States,with estimates of 4 million new cases yearly.Infected men may have urethritis or epididymitis.Women often have no symptoms at rst but maydevelop PID, which increases the risk of ectopicpregnancy. Infants born to infected women maydevelop conjunctivitis or pneumonia. Chlamydialinfection can be treated successfully with antibioticssuch as erythromycin or azithromycin.Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs ) are those in which the pathogen is acquired during sexualactivity. Most are caused by bacteria or viruses. Gonorrhea \u2014caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Infected men have urethritis with painful and frequent urination and pus in the urine.Women are often asymptomatic, and the bacteriamay spread from the cervix to other reproductiveorgans (pelvic inflammatory disease [PID]). The useof antibiotics in the eyes of all newborns has virtu-ally eliminated neonatal conjunctivitis acquiredfrom an infected mother. Gonorrhea can be treatedwith antibiotics, but resistant strains of the bacteriacomplicate treatment. Despite this, the number ofreported cases of gonorrhea has been decreasing by the bacterium Treponema syphilis can be cured with peni- cillin, it is a disease that may be ignored by the per-son who has it because the symptoms may seemminor and often do not last long. If untreated, how-ever, syphilis may cause severe or even fatal dam-age to the nervous system and heart. In the last fewyears the number of reported cases of syphilis hasbeen decreasing, and the CDC has hopes of eradi-cating syphilis in the United States.

Enclosed within the breasts, the mammaryglands are anterior to the pectoralis major muscles;their structure is shown in Fig. 20-8. The glandular tissue is surrounded by adipose tis- sue. The alveolar glands produce milk after preg- nancy; the milk enters lactiferous ducts that convergeat the nipple. The skin around the nipple is a pig-mented area called the areola. The formation of milk is under hormonal control. During pregnancy, high levels of estrogen and proges-terone prepare the glands for milk production.Prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland causes theactual synthesis of milk after pregnancy. The sucking of the infant on the nipple stimulates the hypothala-mus to send nerve impulses to the posterior pituitary gland, which secretes oxytocin to cause the release of milk. The effects of these hormones on the mammaryglands are summarized in T able 20-2 (see also Box20-6: Mammography). THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE The menstrual cycle includes the activity of the hor- mones of the ovaries and anterior pituitary gland andthe resultant changes in the ovaries (ovarian cycle) anduterus (uterine cycle). These are all incorporated intoFig. 20-9, which may look complicated at rst, butrefer to it as you read the following. Notice rst the four hormones involved: FSH andThe Reproductive genitals (vulva) shown in inferior view of the perineum.QUESTION: What is the function of the labia majora mid- sagittal section. QUESTION: Name the hormones that stimulate the production of milk and release of milk.20Scanlon(p3)-ch20 8/17/06 11:03 AM Page 467LHfrom the anterior pituitary gland, from the ovarian follicle, and progesterone from the cor- pus luteum. The fluctuations of these hormones areshown as they would occur in an average 28-day cycle.A cycle may be described in terms of three phases:menstrual phase, follicular phase, and luteal phase. 1.Menstrual phase \u2014The loss of the functional layer of the endometrium is called menstruation or the menses. Although this is actually the end ofa menstrual cycle, the onset of menstruation is eas-ily pinpointed and is, therefore, a useful startingpoint. Menstruation may last 2 to 8 days, with anaverage of 3 to 6 days. At this time, secretion ofFSH is increasing, and several ovarian folliclesbegin to develop.2.Follicular phase \u2014FSH stimulates growth of ovarian estrogen thefollicle cells. The secretion of LH also in-creasing, but more slowly. FSH and estrogen pro-mote the growth and maturation of the ovum, andestrogen stimulates the growth of blood vessels inthe endometrium to regenerate the functionallayer. This phase ends with ovulation, when a sharp increase in LH causes rupture of a mature ovarianfollicle. 3.Luteal phase \u2014Under the influence of LH, the ruptured follicle becomes the corpus luteum andbegins to secrete progesterone as well as estrogen.Progesterone stimulates further growth of bloodvessels in the functional layer of the endometriumand promotes the storage of nutrients such asglycogen. As progesterone secretion increases, LH secre- tion decreases, and if the ovum is not fertilized, thesecretion of progesterone also begins to decrease.Without progesterone, the endometrium cannot bemaintained and begins to slough off in menstrua-tion. FSH secretion begins to increase (as estrogenand progesterone decrease), and the cycle beginsagain. Also secreted by the corpus luteum during a cycle are the hormones inhibin and relaxin. Inhibin inhibits the secretion of well, fromthe anterior pituitary gland. Relaxin is believed to inhibit contractions of the myometrium (as does pro-gesterone), which would help make implantation ofthe early embryo successful. The 28-day cycle shown in Fig. 20-9 is average. Women may have cycles of anywhere from 23 to 35days, the normal range. Women who engage in stren-uous exercise over prolonged periods of time mayexperience amenorrhea , that is, cessation of menses. This seems to be related to reduction of body fat.Apparently the reproductive cycle ceases if a womandoes not have sufficient reserves of energy for herselfand a developing fetus. The exact mechanism bywhich this happens is not completely understood atpresent (see Box 17-6). Amenorrhea may also accom-pany states of physical or emotional stress, anorexianervosa, or various endocrine disorders. The functions of the hormones of female repro- duction are summarized in T able 20-3.468 The Reproductive Systems Table 20-2 HORMONE EFFECTS ON THE MAMMARY GLANDS Hormone Secreted system Promotes growth of secretory cells Promotes pro- duction of milk after birth Promotes release of milk BOX20-6 MAMMOGRAPHY Mammography is an x-ray technique that is used to evaluate breast tissue for abnormalities. By farthe most frequent usage is to detect breast can-cer, which is one of the most common malig-nancies in women. If detected early, breastcancer may be cured through a combination ofsurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Womenshould practice breast self-examination monthly,but mammography can detect lumps that aretoo small to be felt manually.

Estrogen secre-tion decreases; ovulation and menstrual cycles becomeirregular and nally cease. The decrease in estrogenhas other effects as well. Loss of bone matrix may leadto osteoporosis and fractures; an increase in bloodcholesterol makes women more likely to developcoronary artery disease; drying of the vaginal mucosaincreases susceptibility to vaginal infections. Estrogenreplacement therapy may delay some of these conse-quences of menopause, but there are risks involved,and women should be fully informed of them beforestarting such therapy. The likelihood of breast canceralso increases with age, and women over age 50 shouldconsider having a mammogram to serve as a baseline,then one at least every other year. For most men, testosterone secretion continuesthroughout life, as does sperm production, though both diminish with advancing age. Perhaps the mostcommon reproductive problem for older men is pro-static hypertrophy, enlargement of the prostate gland.As the urethra is compressed by the growing prostategland, urination becomes difficult, and residual urinein the bladder increases the chance of urinary tractinfection. Prostate hypertrophy is usually benign, butcancer of the prostate is one of the more common can-cers in elderly men. SUMMARY The production of male or female gametes is a processthat is regulated by hormones. When fertilization ofan ovum by a sperm cell takes place, the zygote, or fer-tilized egg, has the potential to become a new humanbeing. The development of the zygote to embryo-fetus to newborn infant is also dependent on hor-mones and is the subject of our next chapter.470 The Reproductive Systems Table 20-3 HORMONES OF FEMALE REPRODUCTION Hormone Secreted by Functions FSH LH Estrogen* Progesterone Inhibin Relaxin *Estrogen has effects on organs such as bones and blood vessels in both men and women.

One cell with the diploid number of chromosomes (46) divides twice to form four cells, each with thehaploid number of chromosomes (23). 2. Spermatogenesis takes place in the testes; a contin- uous process from puberty throughout life; each primary spermatocyte produces four functionalsperm (see Fig. 20-1). FSH and testosterone are directly necessary (see T able 20-1). 3. Oogenesis takes place in the ovaries; the process is cyclical (every 28 days) from puberty untilmenopause; each primary oocyte produces onefunctional able 20-3). Male Reproductive System\u2014consists of the testes and the ducts and glands that con-tribute to the formation of semen (see Fig.20-3)1. T estes (paired)\u2014located in the scrotum between the upper thighs; temperature in the scrotum is96/H11034F to permit production of viable sperm. Sperm are produced in seminiferous tubules (see Fig. 20-4and T able 20-1). A sperm cell consists of the head,which contains 23 chromosomes; the middlepiece, which contains mitochondria; the flagellumfor motility; and the acrosome on the tip of thehead to digest the membrane of the egg cell (seeFig. 20-1). 2.

Urethra (single)\u2014within the penis; carries semen to exterior (see Fig. 20-3). The penis containsthree masses of erectile tissue that have bloodsinuses. Sexual stimulation and parasympatheticimpulses cause dilation of the penile arteries and anerection. Ejaculation of semen involves peristalsisof all male ducts and contraction of the prostategland and pelvic floor. 9. Semen\u2014composed of sperm and the secretions of the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bul-bourethral glands. The alkaline pH (7.4) neutral-izes the acidic pH of the female vagina. Female Reproductive System\u2014consists of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, andexternal genitals1. Ovaries (paired)\u2014located on either side of the uterus (see Fig. 20-6). Egg cells are produced inovarian follicles; each ovum contains chromo-somes. Ovulation of is LH (see T able 20-3). 2. Fallopian tubes (paired)\u2014each extends from an ovary to the uterus Fig. 20-6); mbriae sweepthe ovum into the tube; ciliated epithelial of smooth muscle propel the ovumtoward the uterus; fertilization usually takes placein 4713.

The Menstrual Cycle\u2014average is 28 days; includes the hormones FSH, LH, estrogen,and progesterone, and ovulation is the rupture of a mature follicle; bloodvessels grow in the endometrium. 3. Luteal phase\u2014the becomes the corpus luteum; the endometrium continues todevelop. 4. If fertilization does not occur, decreased proges- terone results in the loss of the endometrium inmenstruation.472 The Reproductive Systems REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

Although a child maynot resemble either parent, there is a sound basis forsuch comparisons, because the genetic makeup andmany of the traits of a child are the result of the chro-mosomes inherited from mother and father. In this chapter, we will cover some of the funda- mentals of genetics and inheritance. First, however,we will look at the development of a fertilized egg intoa functioning human being. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT During the 40 weeks of gestation , the embryo-fetus is protected and nourished in the uterus of the mother.A human being begins life as one cell, a fertilized eggcalled a zygote, which develops into an individualhuman being consisting of billions of cells organizedinto the body systems with whose functions you arenow quite familiar. FERTILIZATION Although millions of sperm are deposited in thevagina during sexual intercourse, only one will fertil-ize an ovum. As the sperm swim through the fluid ofthe uterus and fallopian tube, they undergo a nalmetabolic change, called capacitation . This change involves the acrosome , which becomes more fragile. When sperm and egg make contact, the acrosomalenzymes will digest the layers of cells and membrane around an ovum. Once a sperm nucleus enters the ovum, changes in the egg cell membrane block the entry of other sperm.The nucleus of the ovum completes the second mei-otic division, and the nuclei of ovum and sperm fuse,restoring the diploid number of chromosomes in thezygote. The human diploid number of 46 chromosomes is actually 23 pairs of chromosomes; 23 from the spermand 23 from the egg. These 23 pairs consist of 22 pairsof autosomes (designated by the numerals 1 through 22) and one pair of sex chromosomes . Women have the sex chromosomes XX, and men have the sex chro-mosomes XY. Figure 21-1 shows the inheritance ofgender. The Y chromosome has a gene that triggers the development of male gonads in the embryo. In theabsence of the Y chromosome, the embryo willdevelop as a female. IMPLANTATION Fertilization usually takes place within the fallopiantube, and the zygote begins to divide even as it is beingswept toward the uterus. These are mitotic divisionsand are called cleavage . Refer to Fig. 21-2 as you read the following. The single-cell zygote divides into a two-cell stage, four-cell stage, eight-cell stage, and so on. Three daysafter fertilization there are 16 cells, which continue todivide to form a solid sphere of cells called a morula (see Box 21-1: T wins). As mitosis proceeds, this spherebecomes hollow and is called a blastocyst , which is still about the same size as the original zygote. A fluid-lled blastocyst consists of an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast and an inner cell mass that contains the potential embryo. It is the blastocyst stagethat becomes implanted in the uterine wall, about 5 to 8 days after fertilization. Successful implantation is not simply a matter of the blastocyst contacting the uterine lining. The endo-metrium produces carbohydrate \"docking\" moleculestoward the end of the uterine cycle, and the blastocysthas a surface protein that ts the docking sites. Oncethis \"t\" is made, the trophoblast secretes enzymes todigest the surface of the endometrium, creating a smallcrater into which the blastocyst sinks. The trophoblastwill become the chorion , the embryonic membrane that will form the fetal portion of the placenta.Following implantation, the inner cell mass will growto become the embryo and other membranes. The cells of the inner cell mass are embryonic stem cells. In these cells, all of the DNA has the potentialfor being switched on, that is, the potential exists for acell to develop into any of the 200 kinds of humancells that will be present at birth. As the cells continueto divide and become more numerous, some DNAwill be switched off in each cell, genes will becomeinactive, and the possibilities for the specialization ofeach cell will be narrowed down. The \"switches\" arechemicals, few of which are known at present. A greatdeal of research is focusing on discovering the stimulithat turn a stem cell into a muscle cell rather than anerve cell or skin cell, and so on.476 Human Development and Genetics21Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 476EMBRYO AND EMBRYONIC MEMBRANES An embryo is the developing human individual from the time of implantation until the eighth week of ges-tation. Several stages of early embryonic developmentare shown in Fig. 21-3. At approximately 12 days, theembryonic disc (the potential person) is simply a plate of cells within the blastocyst. As cells keep divid-ing, the plate of cells begins to fold. At 14 days twin-ning is believed to be no longer possible. Very soon thereafter, three primary layers, or germ layers, begin to develop: the ectoderm , mesoderm , and endoderm a major step in the specializa- tion of the embryo cells, because different sets ofgenes are switched off for each of the three layers,while the genes appropriate for the layer remainswitched on. Each cell is now committed to a particu-lar layer and can no longer \"go back,\" that is, becomea cell of either of the other two layers. Each primary layer develops further; its cells become more specialized as more and more genes ineach cell are switched off. With the active genes, thosethat remain switched on, the cells in each layer arethereby committed to develop into specic organs orparts of organs. Ecto means \"outer\"; the epidermis is derived from ectoderm, and in some of these cells thegene for producing keratin is active. Meso means \"mid- dle\"; the skeletal muscles develop from mesoderm,and in these cells the genes for producing myosin andactin are active. Endo means \"inner\"; the stomach lin- ing is derived from endoderm, and in these cells, thegene for producing pepsinogen is active. T able 21-1lists some other structures derived from each of theprimary germ layers. At 20 days, the embryonic membranes can be clearly distinguished from the embryo itself. The yolk sacdoes not contain nutrient yolk, as it does for bird and reptile embryos. It is, however, the site for the for-mation of the rst blood cells and the cells that willbecome spermatogonia or oogonia. As the embryogrows, the yolk sac membrane is incorporated into theumbilical cord. The amnion is a thin membrane that eventually surrounds the embryo and contains amniotic fluid . This fluid provides a cushion for the fetus againstmechanical injury as the mother moves. When thefetal kidneys become functional, they excrete urineinto the amniotic fluid. Also in this fluid are cells thathave sloughed off the fetus; this is clinically importantHuman der. Each ovum contains 22 auto- somes and an X chromosome. Each sperm contains 22 autosomes andeither an X chromosome or a Ychromosome.

Twins of this type may becalled monozygotic, meaning that they have comefrom one fertilized egg. Identical twins are always ofthe same sex, are very much alike in appearance,and in other respects are genetically identical. Conjoined twins are the result of the incomplete separation of a splitting embryo (the splitting be-lieved to occur 9 to 12 days after fertilization). Thename Siamese twins refers to Chang and Eng(1811-1874), famous Chinese brothers born inSiam, now Thailand. Conjoined twins may sharesupercial parts such as skin and muscle, or theymay share a vital organ such as a liver. Advances in microsurgery and reparative surgery have permit- ted the separation of many sets of conjoined twins.Fraternal twins are the result of two separate ova fertilized by separate sperm. This may occur whentwo ovarian follicles reach maturity and rupture atthe same time. Fraternal twins may be of the samesex or different sexes. Even if of the same sex, how-ever, they are as genetically different as any siblingsmight be. Identical twins are the result of the splitting of the very early embryo before the cells start tobecome specialized (usually within 8 days after fer-tilization). For example, if a 16-cell stage becomesseparated into two groups of 8 cells each, eachgroup will usually continue to develop in the usualway. Another possible cause is the development oftwo inner cell masses within the blastocyst. This,too, is before signicant specialization has taken Fertilization2 cell stage (36 hours) 4 cell stage (48 hours) Morula Blastocyst Inner cell mas s Blastocoele Trophoblast Implantation (7-8 Figure 21-2.

The rupture of the amnion (some-times called the \"bag of waters\") is usually an indica-tion that labor has begun. The chorion is the name given to the trophoblast as it develops further. Once the embryo has becomeimplanted in the uterus, small projections called chorionic villi begin to grow into the endometrium. These will contain the fetal blood vessels that becomethe fetal portion of the placenta. At about 4 to 5 weeks of development, the embryo shows denite form.

The period of fetal growthextends from the 9th through the 40th week. T able21-2 lists some of the major aspects of development inthe growth of the embryo-fetus. The fetus at 16 weeksis depicted in Fig. 21-4 (see Box 21-3: CongenitalFetal Infections, and Box 21-4: Fetal AlcoholSyndrome). Maternal changes during pregnancy aresummarized in T able 21-3. PLACENTA AND UMBILICAL CORD The placenta is made of both fetal and maternal tis- sue. The chorion of the embryo and the endometriumof the uterus contribute, and the placenta is formedby the third month of gestation (12 weeks). Themature placenta is a flat disc about 7 inches (17 cm) indiameter.The structure of a small portion of the placenta is shown in Fig. 21-5. Notice that the fetal blood vesselsare within maternal blood sinuses, but there is nodirect connection between fetal and maternal vessels.Normally, the blood of the fetus does not mix withthat of the mother. The placenta has two functions: tobe the site of exchanges between maternal and fetalblood and to produce hormones to maintain preg-nancy. We will consider the exchanges rst. The fetus is dependent upon the mother for oxygen and nutrients and for the removal of waste products.The umbilical cord connects the fetus to the pla- centa. Within the cord are two umbilical arteries thatcarry blood from the fetus to the placenta and oneumbilical vein that returns blood from the placenta tothe fetus. When blood in the umbilical arteries enters the placenta, CO 2and waste products in the fetal capillar- ies diffuse into the maternal blood sinuses. Oxygendiffuses from the maternal blood sinuses into the fetalcapillaries; nutrients enter the fetal blood by diffusionand active transport mechanisms. This oxygen- andnutrient-rich blood then flows through the umbilicalvein back to the fetus. Circulation within the fetus wasdescribed in Chapter 13. When the baby is delivered at the end of gestation, the umbilical cord is cut. The placenta then detachesfrom the uterine wall and is delivered, with the rest ofthe umbilical cord, as the afterbirth . The blood in the remnant of the umbilical cord contains abundant stem cells, and their potential tobecome different kinds of cells is between that ofembryonic stem cells (which may become any humancell) and adult stem cells (which are more limited).Umbilical cord stem cells have already been used totreat newborns with infantile Krabbe's disease, a neu-rological disorder that is fatal by the age of 2 years.Such treatment depends on genetic testing and havingsuitable donated cord stem cells available at birth.Banks of cord blood are being established by somemedical centers (because such donated blood can befrozen and stored), and the use of cord stem cells maysomeday decrease the need for bone marrow trans-plants. Placental Hormones The rst hormone secreted by the placenta is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the chorion of the early embryo. The function of480 Human Development and Genetics Table 21-1 STRUCTURES DERIVED FROM THE PRIMARY GERM LAYERS Layer Structures Derived* Ectoderm Mesoderm Endoderm *These are representative lists, not all-inclusive ones.

The secretion of progesterone is partic-ularly important to prevent contractions of themyometrium, which would otherwise result in miscar-riage of the embryo. Once hCG enters maternal cir-culation, it is excreted in urine, which is the basis formany pregnancy tests. T ests for hCG in maternalblood are even more precise and can determinewhether a pregnancy has occurred even before a men-strual period is missed. The corpus luteum is a small structure, however, and cannot secrete sufficient amounts of estrogen andprogesterone to maintain a full-term pregnancy. Theplacenta itself begins to secrete estrogen and proges- terone within a few weeks, and the levels of these hor- mones increase until birth. As the placenta takes over,the secretion of hCG decreases, and the corpus luteum becomes non-functional. During pregnancy,estrogen and progesterone inhibit the anterior pitu-itary secretion of FSH and LH, so no other ovarianfollicles develop. These placental hormones also pre-pare the mammary glands for lactation. The placenta also secretes relaxin , which helps inhibit contractions of the myometrium. Relaxin alsopermits stretching of the ligaments of the pubic sym-physis so that this joint will give a little, if necessary,during birth. PARTURITION AND LABOR Parturition is the rather formal term for birth, and labor is the sequence of events that occur during birth. The average gestation period is 40 weeks (280Human Development and Genetics 481 BOX21-2 FETAL DIAGNOSIS certain genetic diseases is another reason a preg- nant woman may wish to have this procedure. Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) In this procedure, a biopsy catheter is inserted through the vagina and cervix to collect a smallportion of the chorionic villi. These cells are derivedfrom the fetus but are not part of the fetus itself.The information obtained is the same as that foramniocentesis, but CVS may be performed earlier inpregnancy, at about 8 weeks. Although there is arisk that the procedure may cause a miscarriage,CVS is considered comparable in safety to amnio-centesis. It is important to remember that no inva-sive procedure is without risks. Maternal Blood Tests Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by the fetus and is found in maternal circulation. The levelreaches a peak between 12 and 15 weeks of gesta-tion, and should then decrease. If AFP is still highafter 16 to 18 weeks, there is a 95% chance that thefetus has spina bida or anencephaly, malforma-tions of the central nervous system. Recall fromChapter 17 that sufficient folic acid during preg-nancy will greatly reduce the risk to the fetus. Maternal blood levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and beta hCG can be measured during the rst trimester. These tests, in conjunction with ultrasound, can reliably detectDown syndrome.Several procedures are currently available to deter- mine certain kinds of abnormalities in a fetus or tomonitor development. Ultrasound (or Fetal Ultrasonography) This is a non-invasive procedure; high-frequency sound waves are transmitted through the abdomi-nal wall into the uterus. The reflected sound wavesare converted into an image called a sonogram.This method is used to conrm multiple pregnan-cies, fetal age or position, or to detect fetal abnor-malities such as heart defects or malformationsof other organs. Ultrasound may also be used todetermine the thickness of the fetal neck (nuchaltranslucency), which is an indicator of Down syn-drome. Amniocentesis This procedure is usually performed at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation. A hypodermic needle is insertedthrough the wall of the abdomen into the amniotic sac, and about 10 to 20 mL of amniotic fluid is removed. Within this fluid are fetal cells, which canbe cultured so that their chromosomes may beexamined. Through such examination and bio-chemical tests, a number of genetic diseases orchromosome abnormalities may be detected.Because women over the age of 35 years arebelieved to have a greater chance of having a childwith Down syndrome, amniocentesis is often rec-ommended for this age group.

These bacteria may cross the placenta after the fourth month of gestation. Consequences ofearly infection of the fetus are death, malformationsof bones and teeth, or cataracts. If infection occurstoward the end of gestation, the child may be bornwith syphilis. This is most often apparent as a rash onthe skin and mucous membranes. Syphilis in adultscan be cured by penicillin; prevention of congenitalsyphilis depends upon good prenatal care forwomen who may be infected. The Centers forDisease Control and Prevention has a goal of eradi-cating syphilis in the United States, which wouldeliminate fetal infection. Congenital toxoplasmosis \u2014this condition is caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii . For most healthy people, toxoplasmosis has no symptoms at all; it is a harmless infection.Because cats and some other mammals are hostsfor this parasite, pregnant women may acquireinfection from contact with cat feces or by eatingrare beef or lamb. Consequences for the fetus aredeath, mental retardation, or blindness. Retinalinfection may only become apparent during child-hood or adolescence. Prevention now dependsupon education of pregnant women to avoidpotential sources of infection.A teratogen is anything that may cause develop- mental abnormalities in an embryo-fetus. Severalinfectious microorganisms are known to be terato-genic; they may cross the placenta from maternalblood to fetal blood and damage the fetus. Congenital rubella syndrome \u2014the virus of German measles (rubella) is perhaps the bestknown of the infectious teratogens. If a womanacquires rubella during pregnancy, there is a 20%chance that her fetus will be affected.Consequences for the fetus may be death (still-birth), heart defects, deafness, or mental retarda-tion. Women who have never had rubella shouldconsider receiving the vaccine before they begin tohave children. In this way, congenital rubella syn- drome is completely prevented. Use of the rubella vaccine has made this syndrome rare in the UnitedStates, but many developing nations do not haveextensive vaccination programs. Congenital varicella syndrome \u2014chickenpox (herpes zoster) is a viral disease that most peoplehave during childhood. If a pregnant womanacquires chickenpox, however, the virus may crossthe placenta. Consequences for the fetus includemalformed limbs, cutaneous scars, blindness, andmental retardation. This is not a common congeni-tal syndrome, and the success of the chickenpoxvaccine should make it truly rare. 16 weeks Placenta Uterus Umbilical cord Cervix Vagina Figure 21-4.

T oward the end of gestation, theplacental secretion of progesterone decreases whilethe estrogen level remains high, and the myometriumbegins to contract weakly at irregular intervals. At thistime the fetus is often oriented head down within theuterus (Fig. 21-6). Labor itself may be divided intothree stages: First stage \u2014dilation of the cervix. As the uterus con- tracts, the amniotic sac is forced into the cervix,which dilates (widens) the cervical opening. At theend of this stage, the amniotic sac breaks (ruptureof the \"bag of waters\") and the fluid leaves throughthe vagina, which may now be called the birth canal . This stage lasts an average of 8 to 12 hours but may vary considerably. Second stage \u2014delivery of the infant. More power- ful contractions of the uterus are brought aboutby oxytocin released by the posterior pituitary gland and perhaps by the placenta itself. This stagemay be prolonged by several factors. If the fetus ispositioned other than head down, delivery may be 48321Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 483difficult. This is called a breech birth and may necessitate a cesarean section (C-section), which is delivery of the fetus through a surgical incision inthe abdominal wall and uterus. For some women,the central opening in the pelvic bone may be too small to permit a vaginal delivery. Fetal distress, as determined by fetal monitoring of heartbeat forexample, may also require a cesarean section.484 Human Development and Genetics Maternal arterioleMaternal venuleChorionic villusMaternal blood sinus Fetal arteriole and venule Umbilical Umbilical arteries ofplacenta)(maternal part ofplacenta)Myometrium Endometrium Figure 21-5.

BOX21-4 FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME defects, malformation of other organs, and irritabil- ity and agitation. The infant often grows slowly,both physically and mentally, and mental retarda-tion is also a possible outcome. Because there is no way to reverse the damage done by intrauterine exposure to alcohol, the bestcourse is prevention. Education is very important;women should be aware of the consequences theirconsumption of alcohol may have for a fetus.Fetal alcohol syndrome is the term for a group of characteristics present in infants who were exposed to alcohol during their fetal life. Alcohol is a toxinfor adults and even more so for fetal tissues that areimmature and growing rapidly. Either alcohol or itstoxic intermediate product (acetaldehyde) maypass from maternal to fetal circulation and impairfetal development. Consequences for infants include low birth weight, small head with facial abnormalities, heart21Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 484485 BOX21-5 PREMATURE BIRTH been successfully treated and eventually sent home with their parents. Whether there will be any long-term detrimental effects of their very prematurebirths will only be known in time. Medical science may have reached its maximum capability in this area. In a fetus of 20 weeks, thecells of the alveoli and the cells of the pulmonarycapillaries are just not close enough to each otherto permit gas exchange. At present there is nomedical intervention that can overcome thisanatomic fact. The lowest birth weight with subsequent sur- vival is believed to be 244 grams (8.6 oz) inSeptember 2004. The little gi rl had a gestational age of 26 weeks.A premature birth is the spontaneous delivery of an infant before the end of the gestation period, or theintentional delivery (for reasons concerning thehealth of the mother or fetus) before that time. Apremature infant may also be dened as one whoweighs less than 2500 grams (5.5 pounds), thoughgestation time is more important than birth weight. In terms of gestation time, an 8-month infant has a very good chance of surviving if good medicalcare is available. Infants of 7 months gestation orless often have respiratory distress, because theirlungs have not yet produced enough surfactant topermit inflation of the alveoli. This is hyaline mem-brane disease, which was described in Chapter 15. Infants as young as 23 weeks of gestation have Amniotic sac Amniotic fluid positioned down within the uterus. QUESTION: Why is it benecial that the fetus is positioned head down?21Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 485Third stage \u2014delivery of the placenta (afterbirth). Continued contractions of the uterus expel the pla-centa and membranes, usually within 10 minutesafter delivery of the infant. There is some bleedingat this time, but the uterus rapidly decreases in size,and the contractions compress the endometrium toclose the ruptured blood vessels at the former siteof the placenta. This is important to prevent severematernal hemorrhage. THE INFANT AT BIRTH Immediately after delivery, the umbilical cord isclamped and cut, and the infant's nose and mouth areaspirated to remove any fluid that might interfere withbreathing (see Box 21-6: Apgar Score). Now the infant is independent of the mother, and the most rapid changes occur in the respiratory and circulatorysystems. As the level of CO 2in the baby's blood increases, the respiratory center in the medulla is stimulated andbrings about inhalation to expand and inflate thelungs. Full expansion of the lungs may take up to 7days following birth, and the infant's respiratory ratemay be very rapid at this time, as high as 40 respira-tions per minute.Breathing promotes greater pulmonary circula- tion, and the increased amount of blood returningto the left atrium closes the flap of the foramen ovale . The ductus arteriosus begins to constrict, apparently in response to the higher blood oxygen level. Fullclosure of the ductus arteriosus may take up to 3months. The ductus venosus no longer receives blood from the umbilical vein and begins to constrict withina few minutes after birth. Within a few weeks the duc-tus venosus becomes a non-functional ligament. The infant's liver is not fully mature at birth and may be unable to excrete bilirubin efficiently. Thismay result in jaundice, which may occur in as many ashalf of all newborns. Such jaundice is not consideredserious unless there is another possible cause, such asRh incompatibility (see Chapter 11). GENETICS Genetics is the study of inheritance. Most, if not vir- tually all, human characteristics are regulated at leastpartially by genes. We will rst look at what genes are,then describe some patterns of inheritance.486 Human Development and Genetics BOX21-6 APGAR SCORE The highest possible score is 10. Infants who score less than 5 require immediate medical attention.The Apgar score is an overall assessment of an infant and is usually made 1 minute after birth (maybe repeated at 5 minutes if the rst score is low).

These chromosomesare in 23 pairs called homologous pairs . One mem- ber of each pair has come from the egg and is calledmaternal, the other member has come from the spermand is called paternal. The autosomes are the chromo-some pairs designated 1 to 22. The sex chromosomesform the remaining pair. In women these are desig-nated XX and in men XY. Chromosomes are made of DNA and protein; the DNA is the hereditary material. You may wish to referto Chapter 3 to review DNA structure. The sequenceof bases in the DNA of chromosomes is the geneticcode for proteins, structural proteins as well asenzymes. The DNA code for one protein is called agene. For example, a specic region of the DNA ofchromosome 11 is the code for the beta chain ofhemoglobin. Because an individual has two of chro-mosome 11, he or she will have two genes for this pro-tein, a maternal gene inherited from the mother and apaternal gene inherited from the father. This is truefor virtually all of the 20,000 to 25,000 genes estimatedto be found in our chromosomes. In our geneticmakeup, each of us has two genes for each protein. GENOTYPE AND PHENOTYPE For each gene of a pair, there may be two or more pos-sibilities for its \"expression,\" that is, how it will appearor how it will affect the individual. These possibilitiesare called alleles . A person, therefore, may be said to have two alleles for each protein or trait; the allelesmay be the same or may be different. If the two alleles are the same, the person is said to be homozygous for the trait. If the two alleles are dif- ferent, the person is said to be heterozygous for the trait. The genotype is the actual genetic makeup, that is, the alleles present. The phenotype is the appearance, or how the alleles are expressed. When a gene has twoor more alleles, one allele may be dominant over the other, which is called recessive . For a person who is heterozygous for a trait, the dominant allele (or gene)is the one that will appear in the phenotype. Therecessive allele (or gene) is hidden but is not lost, andmay be passed to children. For a recessive trait to beexpressed in the phenotype, the person must behomozygous recessive, that is, have two recessive al- leles (genes) for the trait. An example will be helpful here to put all this together and is illustrated in Fig. 21-7. When doinggenetics problems, a Punnett square is used to show the possible combinations of genes in the egg andsperm for a particular set of parents and their children.Remember that an egg or sperm has only 23 chromo-somes and, therefore, has only one gene for each trait. In this example, the inheritance of eye color has been simplied. Although eye color is determined bymany pairs of genes, with many possible phenotypes,one pair is considered the principal pair, with browneyes dominant over blue eyes. A dominant gene is usu-ally represented by a capital letter, and the correspon-ding recessive gene is represented by the same letter,but lowercase. The parents in Fig. 21-7 are both het-erozygous for eye color. Their genotype consists of agene for brown eyes and a gene for blue eyes, but theirphenotype is brown eyes. Each egg produced by the mother has a 50% chance of containing the gene for brown eyes, or anequal 50% chance of containing the gene for blue eyes.Similarly, each sperm produced by the father has a50% chance of containing the gene for brown eyes and a 50% chance of containing the gene for blue eyes. Now look at the boxes of the Punnett square; these represent the possibilities for the genetic makeup ofeach child. For eye color there are three possibilities:a 25% (one of four) chance for homozygous browneyes, a 50% (two of four) chance for heterozygousbrown eyes, and a 25% (one of four) chance forhomozygous blue eyes. Notice that BB and Bb havethe same phenotype (brown eyes) despite their differ-ent genotypes, and that the phenotype of blue eyes ispossible only with the genotype bb. Can brown-eyedparents have a blue-eyed child? Yes; if each parent isheterozygous for brown eyes, each child has a 25%chance of inheriting blue eyes. Could these parentshave four children with blue eyes? What is the proba-bility or chance of this happening? The answers tothese questions will be found in Box 21-7: Solution toGenetics Question. INHERITANCE: DOMINANT-RECESSIVE The inheritance of eye color just described is an exam-ple of a trait determined by a pair of alleles, oneof which may dominate the other. Another exampleis sickle-cell anemia, which was discussed in ChapterHuman Development and Genetics 48721Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 48711. The gene for the beta chain of hemoglobin is on chromosome 11; an allele for normal hemoglobin isdominant, and an allele for sickle-cell hemoglobin isrecessive. An individual who is heterozygous is said tohave sickle-cell trait; an individual who is homozygousrecessive will have sickle-cell anemia. The Punnettsquare in Fig. 21-8 shows that if both parents are het-erozygous, each child has a 25% chance (1 of 4) ofinheriting the two recessive genes. T able 21-4 listssome other human genetic diseases and their patternsof inheritance.It is important to remember that in the terminol- ogy of genetics, dominant does not mean \"common\"or \"frequent.\" It simply means that one gene is suffi-cient for the characteristic to appear in the phenotype.Think back to the ABO blood types. Which type is themost common in a population? T ype O is most com-mon, followed by type A, then type B. T ype AB is theleast common. Here is an instance in which the reces-sive trait, type O, is most frequent in a group of peo-ple. Why is type AB the least common, even though Aand B alleles are dominant over an O allele? Because488 Human Development and Genetics Gene for brown eye colorGene for blue eye color Ova Sperm BB Genotype: homozygous brown (2 dominant genes) Phenotype: brown heterozygous (1 dominant and 1 recessive Phenotype: brown (since brown is dominant) bb blue (2 recessive genes) Phenotype: blueKey Figure 21-7. Inheritance of eye color. Both mother and father are heterozygous for brown eyes. The Punnett square shows the possible combinations of genes for eye color for each child of these parents. See text for further description.QUESTION: If Dad is heterozygous for brown eyes and Mom has blue eyes, what will be the four possible combinations?21Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 488there are not many B alleles to be found in a popula- tion; not many people have a B allele. If you look atT able 21-6 later in this chapter, you will certainly beable to nd other dominant traits that are rare. INHERITANCE: MULTIPLE ALLELES The best example of this pattern of inheritance is thehuman blood type of the ABO group. For each geneof this blood type, there are three possible alleles: A,B, or O. A person will have only two of these alleles,which may be the same or different. O is the recessiveallele; A and B are co-dominant alleles, that is, domi-nant over O but not over each other. You already know that in this blood group there are four possible blood types: O, AB, A, and B. T able 21-5shows the combinations of alleles for each type.Notice that for types O and AB there is only one pos-sible genotype. For types A and B, however, there aretwo possible genotypes, because both A and B allelesare dominant over an O allele. Let us now use a problem to illustrate the inheri- tance of blood type. The Punnett square in Fig. 21-9shows that Mom has type O blood and Dad has typeAB blood. The boxes of the square show the possibleblood types for each child. Each child has a 50%chance of having type A blood, and a 50% chance of having type B blood. The genotype, however, willalways be heterozygous. Notice that in this example,the blood types of the children will not be the same asthose of the parents. (The Rh factor is inherited inde-pendently of the ABO type, and is of the dominant-recessive pattern. Rh positive is dominant and Rhnegative is recessive.) T able 21-6 lists some other human genetic traits, with the dominant and recessive phenotype for each. INHERITANCE: SEX-LINKED TRAITS Sex-linked traits may also be called X-linked traitsbecause the genes for them are located only on the Xchromosome. The Y does not have correspondinggenes for many of the genes on the X chromosome.(The Y chromosome is very small and has only about20 genes. Some of these genes are active only in thetestes and contribute to spermatogenesis. Others areactive in many body cells, but their functions are notyet known with certainty.) The genes for sex-linked traits are recessive, but because there are no corresponding genes on the Ychromosome to mask them, a man needs only onegene to express one of these traits in his phenotype. AHuman Development and Genetics 489 Hh hMom Has sickle-cell sickle-cell traitFigure 21-8. Inheritance of sickle-cell anemia (dominant-recessive pattern). See text for description. QUESTION: If Dad has sickle-cell trait and Mom is homozygous for normal hemoglobin, can a child of theirs have sickle-cell anemia?21Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 489woman who has one of these recessive genes on one X chromosome and a dominant gene for normal func-tion on the other X chromosome will not express thistrait. She is called a carrier, however, because the geneis part of her genotype and may be passed to children. Let us use as an example, red-green color blind- ness. The Punnett square in Fig. 21-10 shows thatMom is carrier of this trait and that Dad has normalcolor vision. A Punnett square for a sex-linked traituses the X and Y chromosomes with a lower case let-ter on the X to indicate the presence of the recessivegene. The possibilities for each child are dividedequally into daughters and sons. In this example, each daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier anda 50% chance of not being a carrier. In either case, adaughter will have normal color vision. Each son hasa 50% chance of being red-green color blind and a50% chance of having normal color vision. Men cannever be carriers of a trait such as this; they either haveit or do not have it. The inheritance of other characteristics is often not as easily depicted as are the examples just discussed.Height, for example, is a multiple gene characteristic,meaning that many pairs of genes contribute. Manypairs of genes result in many possible combinationsfor genotype and many possible phenotypes. Inaddition, height is a trait that is influenced by envi-ronmental factors such as nutrition. These kinds ofcircumstances or influences are probably important inmany other human characteristics. Of the estimated 20,000 to 25,000 human genes, almost all have been \"mapped.\" This means that theyhave been precisely located on a particular chromo-some. There is still much work to be done, however,and the focus now is on learning what each of these490 Human Development and Genetics Table 21-4 HUMAN GENETIC DISEASES Disease (Pattern of Inheritance) Description Sickle-cell anemia (R) Cystic brosis (R) Tay-Sachs disease R/H11005recessive; D /H11005dominant.

Most severe effects are chronic respira-tory infections and pulmonary failure. The most common genetic disease among people of Jewish ancestry. Degeneration of neurons and the nervous system results in death by the age of 2 years. Lack of an enzyme to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine leads to severe mental and physical retardation. These effects may be prevented by the use of a diet (beginning at birth) that limits phenylalanine. Uncontrollable muscle contractions begin between the ages of 30 and 50 years; followed by loss of memory and personality. There is no treatment that can delay mental deterioration. Lack of Factor 8 impairs chemical clotting; may be controlled with Factor 8 from donated blood. Replacement of muscle by adipose or scar tissue, with progressive loss of muscle function; often fatal before age 20 years due to involvement of cardiac muscle.

Someday it will be possible to cure genetic diseases by inserting correct copies of malfunctioning genesinto the cells of affected individuals. As of 2006, cer-tain immune deciencies (which previously wouldhave been fatal) seem to have been reversed in severalchildren by supplying correct copies of their faultygenes. But these early successes have not been repli-cated, and replication of results is an essential part ofthe scientic method. Research must proceed slowly,because human beings are the subjects, and so that anypotential risks of such therapy may be assessed andreduced.Other diseases that may eventually be cured or controlled with gene therapy include cystic brosisand hemophilia (for both of which clinical trials arecontinuing), Parkinson's disease, diabetes, musculardystrophy, and sickle-cell anemia. Much moreresearch and careful experimentation remain to bedone before gene replacement becomes the standardtreatment available to everyone with these genetic dis-eases. This is a good example of how science mustwork when results fall short of expectations.Researchers and clinicians must pause and reevaluatethe underlying principles of their work and the meth-ods they have chosen, decide what changes are neces-sary, and try again.492 Human Development and Genetics BOX21-7 SOLUTION TO GENETICS QUESTION Question : Can parents who are both heterozygous for brown eyes have four children with blue eyes? What is the probability or chance of this happening? Answer : Yes. For each child, the probability or chance of having blue eyes is 1 in 4 (or 25%).

Sperm undergo nal maturation (capacitation) within the female reproductive tract; the acrosomecontains enzymes to digest the membrane of theovum. 2. The 23 chromosomes of the sperm join with the 23 chromosomes of the egg to restore the diploidnumber of 46 in the zygote. 3. A zygote has 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes; XX in females, XY in males (seeFig. 21-1). Implantation (see Fig. 21-2)\u20145 to 8 days after fertilization1. Within the fallopian tube, the zygote begins mitotic divisions called cleavage to form two-cell,four-cell, eight-cell stages, and so on. 2. A morula is a solid sphere of cells that divides fur- ther to form a hollow sphere called a blastocyst. 3. A blastocyst consists of an outer layer of cells called the trophoblast and an inner cell mass that containsthe potential embryo; the cells are stem cells, notyet specialized. The trophoblast secretes enzymesto form a crater in the endometrium into which theblastocyst sinks. Embryo\u2014weeks 1 through 8 of gestation (see Fig. 21-3)1. In the embryonic disc, three primary germ layers develop: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (seeT able 21-1). 2. By the eighth week of gestation (end of 2 months), all organ systems are formed (see T able 21-2). Embryonic Membranes (see Fig. 21-3) 1. The yolk sac forms the rst blood cells and the cells that become spermatogonia or oogonia. 2. The amnion surrounds the fetus and contains amni- otic fluid; this fluid absorbs shock around the fetus. 3. The chorion develops chorionic villi that will con- tain blood vessels that form the fetal portion of theplacenta.Fetus\u2014weeks 9 through 40 of gestation (see Table 21-2)1. The organ systems grow and mature.2. The growing fetus brings about structural and functional changes in the mother (see T able 21-3). Placenta and Umbilical Cord 1. The placenta is formed by the chorion of the embryo and the endometrium of the uterus;the umbilical cord connects the fetus to the pla-centa. 2. Fetal blood does not mix with maternal blood; fetal capillaries are within maternal blood sinuses (seeFig. 21-5); this is the site of exchanges betweenmaternal and fetal blood. 3. T wo umbilical arteries carry blood from the fetus to the placenta; fetal CO 2and waste products dif- fuse into maternal blood; oxygen and nutrientsenter fetal blood. 4. Umbilical vein returns blood from placenta to fetus.5. The placenta is delivered after the baby and is called the afterbirth. Placental Hormones 1. hCG\u2014secreted by the chorion; maintains the corpus luteum so that it secretes estrogen andprogesterone during the rst few months of gesta-tion. The corpus luteum is too small to secretesufficient hormones to maintain a full-term preg-nancy. 2. Estrogen and progesterone secretion begins within 4 to 6 weeks and continues until birth in amountsgreat enough to sustain pregnancy. 3. Estrogen and progesterone inhibit FSH and LH secretion during pregnancy and prepare the mam-mary glands for lactation. 4. Progesterone inhibits contractions of the myometrium until just before birth, when proges-terone secretion begins to decrease. 5. Relaxin inhibits contractions of the myometrium and permits stretching of the pubic symphysis. Parturition and Labor 1. Gestation period ranges from 37 to 42 weeks; the average is 40 weeks. 2. Labor: rst stage\u2014dilation of the cervix; uterine contractions force the amniotic sac into the cervix; amniotic sac ruptures and fluid escapes.Human Development and Genetics 493 STUDY OUTLINE21Scanlon(p3)-ch21 8/17/06 11:04 AM Page 4931.

No matter that we cannot see them, the microbes, includ-ing viruses, fungi, and bacteria, are always with us. Microbiology is the study of microorganisms (also called microbes) and of their place or role in theirenvironment. Sometimes, the environment of mi-crobes is us, people, and that will be our focus.Although there are many perspectives in the eld ofmicrobiology, we will concentrate on the microorgan-isms that affect the functioning of the human body.These microbes include our normal flora and thosethat are capable of causing human disease. A disease isany disruption of normal body functioning. Many dis-eases are not caused by microorganisms, but those thatare may be called infectious diseases. The microor-ganisms that cause infectious diseases are called pathogens. Pathogens may also be called parasites, that is, they live on another living organism called a host andcause harm to the host. Some parasites cause diseasesthat are fatal to the host, but many others live in a morebalanced way with their hosts. These cause illnessesfrom which the host recovers, and the parasite oftensurvives long enough to be spread to other hosts.Our introduction to microbiology will begin with a brief description of the classication and naming ofmicroorganisms, followed by a discussion of normalflora. We will then consider infectious diseases, typesof infection, and the spread and control of infection.Last, we will describe the types of pathogens in moredetail and include the methods we have to treat andcontrol the diseases they cause. For a historical per-spective on microbiology, see Box 22-1: The GoldenAge of Microbiology, and Box 22-2: Microbiology inthe 20th Century. CLASSIFICATION OF MICROORGANISMS Bacteria are very simple, single-celled organisms that are found virtually everywhere. The natural habitatsof bacteria include freshwater, saltwater, soil, andother living organisms. Most bacteria are not harmfulto us, and within their normal environments, theyhave the vital role of decomposing dead organic mate-rial and recycling their nutrients. However, a numberof bacteria cause human diseases, including strepthroat, pneumonia, and meningitis. Viruses are not cells; they are even smaller and498 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease BOX22-1 THE GOLDEN AGE OF MICROBIOLOGY 1881 Discovery that staphylococci cause infections. 1882 The cause of tuberculosis is found to be a bacterium. 1883 Diphtheria is found to be caused by a bac- terium. 1884 The bacteria that cause tetanus, typhoid fever, and cholera are each isolated. The rst description of phagocytosis by whiteblood cells is published. 1885 Louis Pasteur rst uses his vaccine for rabies.1890 Development of antitoxins to treat tetanus and diphtheria. 1892 Discovery and demonstration of a virus.1894 The bacterium that causes plague is discovered.1897 Discovery of the cause of botulism. Rat fleas are found to be vectors of plague. 1900 Walter Reed and his associates demonstrate that yellow fever is caused by a virus and thatthe vector is a mosquito.Microorganisms were rst seen in the 17th century when simple microscopes were developed. Theroles of microorganisms, however, especially in rela-tion to disease, were to remain largely unknown foranother two centuries. The years between 1875and 1900 are sometimes called \"The Golden Age ofMicrobiology\" because of the number and signi-cance of the discoveries that were made during thistime. The following is only a partial list. 1877 Robert Koch proves that anthrax is caused by a bacterium. 1878 Joseph Lister rst grows bacteria in pure cul- ture. The oil immersion lens for microscopes is discov- Pasteur develops chicken cholera.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 498simpler in structure than the bacteria. All viruses are parasites because they can reproduce only within theliving cells of a host. Therefore, all viruses cause dis-ease. Common human viral diseases are influenza, thecommon cold, and chickenpox. Protozoa are single-celled animals such as amoe- bas. Most protozoa are free living in freshwater orsaltwater, where they consume bacteria, fungi, and oneanother. Human protozoan parasites include thosethat cause malaria, amebic dysentery, and giardiasis,another intestinal infection. Fungi may be unicellular or multicellular. Molds and mushrooms are familiar fungi. They decomposeorganic matter in the soil and freshwater and helprecycle nutrients. Fungal diseases of people includeyeast infections, ringworm, and more serious diseasessuch as a type of meningitis. Worms are multicellular animals. Most are free liv- ing and non-pathogenic; within the soil they consumedead organic matter or smaller living things. Worminfestations of people include trichinosis, hookwormdisease, and tapeworms. Arthropods (the name means \"jointed legs\") are multicellular animals such as lobsters, shrimp, the insects, ticks, and mites. Some insects (such as mos- quitoes and fleas) are vectors of disease; that is, they spread pathogens from host to host when they bite toobtain blood. Ticks are also vectors of certain diseases, and some mites may cause infestations of the skin. BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE We refer to bacteria and all other living things usingtwo names (binomial nomenclature), the genus andthe species. The genus name is placed rst, is alwayscapitalized, and is the larger category. The speciesname is second, is not capitalized, and is the smallercategory. Let us use as examples Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis . These two bacteria are in the same genus, Staphylococcus , which tells us that they are related or similar to one another. Yet they aredifferent enough to be given their own species names:aureus or epidermidis . It may be helpful here to think of our own names. Each of us has a family name,which indicates that we are related to other membersof our families, and each of us has a rst name indi- cating that we are individuals in this related group. Ifwe wrote our own names using the method of bino- mial nomenclature, we would write Smith Mary andSmith John. In scientic articles and books, for the sake of con- venience, the genus name is often abbreviated with itsrst letter. We might read of S. aureus as a cause of a food poisoning outbreak or see E.coli (E. forAn Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 499 BOX22-2 MICROBIOLOGY IN THE 20TH CENTURY 1962 The Sabin polio vaccine is marketed in the United States. 1963 The measles vaccine becomes available.1969 A vaccine for rubella is developed.1976 Legionnaire's disease is discovered and des- cribed. 1980 Genetically engineered bacteria produce the hormone insulin. 1981 The rst cases of AIDS are described.1982 The rst vaccine for hepatitis B is licensed.1986 Genetically engineered yeast are used to pro- duce a more effective vaccine for hepatitis B.

Many ofthem concerned diagnosis, prevention, or treat-ment of infectious diseases, and some involvedusing microorganisms and the new genetic tech-nologies. 1928 Discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming. 1935 The rst of the sulfa drugs is found to be effective against staphylococcal infections. 1938 Penicillin is puried and produced in large quantities. 1941 The fluorescent antibody test is developed.1943 Streptomycin is discovered and is the rst effective drug in the treatment of tuberculo-sis. 1953 Watson and Crick describe the structure of DNA. 1955 The Salk polio vaccine is rst used.1957 Interferon is discovered.1959 A vaccine for whooping cough is available.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 499Escherichia ) on a lab report as the cause of a patient's urinary tract infection. Therefore, it is important tolearn both genus and species names of importantpathogens. NORMAL FLORA Each of us has a natural population of microorganismsliving on and within us. This is our normal flora.These microbes may be further categorized as resi-dents or transients. Resident flora are those species that live on or in nearly everyone almost all the time.These residents live in specic sites, and we provide avery favorable environment for them. Some, such asStaphylococcus epidermidis , live on the skin. Others, such as E. coli , live in the colon and small intestine. When in their natural sites, resident flora do not cause harmto healthy tissue, and some are even benecial to us.However, residents may become pathogenic if theyare introduced into abnormal sites. If E. coli , for exam- ple, gains access to the urinary bladder, it causes aninfection called cystitis. In this situation, E. coli is con- sidered an opportunist , which is a normally harmless species that has become a pathogen in special circum-stances. Transient flora are those species that are found periodically on or in the body; they are not as welladapted to us as are the resident flora. Streptococcus pneumoniae , for example, is a transient in the upper res- piratory tract, where it usually does not cause harm inhealthy people. However, transients may become path-ogenic when the host's resistance is lowered. In an eld-erly person with influenza, S. pneumoniae may invade the lower respiratory tract and cause a serious or evenfatal pneumonia. The distribution of our normal flora is summarized in T able 22-1. You can see that an important functionof normal flora is to inhibit the growth of pathogensin the oral cavity, intestines, and in women, the vagina.The resident bacteria are believed to do this by pro-ducing antibacterial chemicals but also by simplybeing there and providing competition that makes itdifficult for pathogens to establish themselves. Anexample may be helpful here. Let us use botulism.T ypical food-borne botulism is acquired by ingestingthe bacterial toxin that has been produced in food.Infants, however, may acquire botulism by ingestingthe spores (dormant forms) of the botulism bacteriaon foods such as honey or raw vegetables. The infant'scolon flora is not yet abundant, and the botulismspores may be able to germinate into active cells that produce toxin in the baby's own intestine. For olderchildren or adults, botulism spores are harmless ifingested, because the normal colon flora prevents thegrowth of these bacteria. Recent research suggests that some specic bacte- ria in our colon flora are even more important than wethought. One species, Bacteroides fragilis , produces a polysaccharide, Psac, that may be necessary for thenormal development of certain aspects of the humanimmune system: production of normal T cells by thethymus gland and the proper functioning of thespleen. We have much more to learn about our rela-tionship with our resident flora. Resident flora may be diminished by the use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. An antibioticdoes not distinguish between the pathogen and theresident bacteria. In such circumstances, without theusual competition, yeasts or pathogenic bacteria maybe able to overgrow and create new infections. This is most likely to occur on mucous membranes such asthose of the oral cavity and vagina. INFECTIOUS DISEASE An infectious disease is one that is caused by microor-ganisms or by the products (toxins) of microorganisms.T o cause an infection, a microorganism must enter andestablish itself in a host and begin reproducing. Several factors determine whether a person will develop an infection when exposed to a pathogen.These include the virulence of the pathogen and theresistance of the host. Virulence is the ability of the pathogen to cause disease. Host resistance is the total of the body's defenses against pathogens. Our defensesinclude aspects of innate immunity such as intact skinand mucous membranes, and the sweeping of cilia toclear the respiratory tract, as well as adequate nutri- tion, and the adaptive immune responses of our lym- phocytes and macrophages (see Chapter 14). T o illustrate these concepts, let us compare the measles virus and rhinoviruses (common cold). Themeasles virus has at least a 90% infectivity rate, mean-ing that for every 100 non-immune people exposed,at least 90 will develop clinical measles. Thus, themeasles virus is considered highly virulent, evenfor healthy people. However, people who have recov-ered from measles or who have received the measlesvaccine have developed an active immunity thatincreases their resistance to measles. Even if exposed500 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 500many times, such people probably will not develop clinical measles. In contrast, the rhinoviruses that cause the com- mon cold are not considered virulent pathogens, andhealthy people may have them in their upper respira-tory tracts without developing illness. However,fatigue, malnutrition, and other physiological stressesmay lower a person's resistance and increase the like-lihood of developing a cold upon exposure to theseviruses. Once infected, a person may have a clinical (apparent or symptomatic ) infection, in which symp- toms appear. Symptoms are observable or measurable changes that indicate illness. For some diseases, sub- clinical (inapparent or asymptomatic ) infections are possible, in which the person shows no symptoms.Women with the sexually transmitted disease gonor-rhea, for example, may have subclinical infections, thatis, no symptoms at all. It is important to remember that such people are still reservoirs (sources) of the pathogen for others, who may then develop clinicalinfections. COURSE OF AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE When a pathogen establishes itself in a host, there is aperiod of time before symptoms appear. This is calledthe incubation period . Most infectious diseases have rather specic incubation periods (T able 22-2). Somediseases, however, have more variable incubation peri-ods (see hepatitis in T able 22-2), which may make itdifficult to predict the onset of illness after exposureor to trace outbreaks of a disease. A short time called the prodromal period may follow the incubation period. During this time, vague,non-specic symptoms may begin. These includeAn Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 501 Table 22-1 DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL FLORA IN THE HUMAN BODY Body Site Description of Flora Skin Nasal cavitiesTrachea, bronchi, and lungs Oral cavity Esophagus Stomach Small intestine Large intestine Urinary bladder Vagina Tissue fluid BloodExposed to the environment; therefore has a large bacterial population and small numbers of fungi, especially where the skin is often moist. Flora are kept in check by the continual loss of dead cells from the stratum corneum. Bacteria, mold spores, and viruses constantly enter with inhaled air; the ciliated epithelium limits the microbial population by continuously sweeping mucus and trapped pathogens to the pharynx, where they are swallowed. The cilia of the trachea and large bronchial tubes sweep mucus and microbes upward toward the pharynx, where they are swallowed. Very few pathogens reach the lungs, and most of theseare destroyed by alveolar macrophages. Large bacterial population and small numbers of yeasts and protozoa. Kept in check by lysozyme, the enzyme in saliva that inhibits bacterial reproduction. The resident flora help prevent thegrowth of pathogens. Contains the microorganisms swallowed with saliva or food. The hydrochloric acid in gastric juice kills most bacteria. This may not be effective if large num- bers of a pathogen or bacterial toxins are present in contaminated food. The ileum, adjacent to the colon, has the largest bacterial population. The duodenum, adjacent to the stomach, has the smallest. Contains an enormous population of bacteria, which inhibits the growth of pathogens and pro- duces vitamins. The vitamins are absorbed as the colon absorbs water. Vitamin K is obtained inamounts usually sufficient to meet a person's daily need. Smaller amounts of folic acid, riboflavin, and other vitamins are also obtained from colon flora. Is virtually free of bacteria, as is the upper urethra. The lower urethra, especially in women, has a flora similar to that of the skin. A large bacterial population creates an acidic pH that inhibits the growth of pathogens. Small numbers of bacteria and viruses penetrate mucous membranes or get through breaks in the skin. Most are destroyed in lymph nodules or lymph nodes or by wandering macrophages intissue fluid. Should be free of microorganisms.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 501generalized muscle aches, lethargy, and fatigue, or a feeling that \"I'm coming down with something.\" During the invasion period, the specic symptoms of the illness appear. These might include a high fever,rash, swollen lymph nodes, cough, diarrhea, or suchthings as the gradual paralysis of botulism. The acmeis the worst stage of the disease, and this is followed bythe recovery or death of the host. Some diseases are self-limiting ; that is, they typi- cally last a certain length of time and are usually fol-lowed by recovery. The common cold, chickenpox, andmumps are illnesses that are considered self-limiting. TYPES OF INFECTION The terminology of infection may refer to the locationof the pathogens in the body, to the general nature ofthe disease, or to how or where the pathogen wasacquired. A localized infection is one that is conned to one area of the body. Examples are the common cold ofthe upper respiratory tract, boils of the skin, and sal-monella food poisoning that affects the intestines.In a systemic infection, the pathogen is spread throughout the body by way of the lymph or blood.T yphoid fever, for example, begins as an intestinalinfection, but the bacteria eventually spread to theliver, gallbladder, kidneys, and other organs. Bubonicplague is an infection that begins in lymph nodes, butagain the bacteria are carried throughout the body,and fatal plague is the result of pneumonia. Bacteremia and septicemia are terms that are often used interchangeably in clinical practice,although technically they have different meanings.Bacteremia means that bacteria are present in theblood; septicemia means that the bacteria present aremultiplying rapidly. Septicemia is always serious,because it means that the immune defenses have beencompletely overwhelmed and are unable to stop thespread of the pathogen. With respect to timing and duration, some infec- tions may be called acute or chronic. An acute infec- tion is one that usually begins abruptly and is severe.In contrast, a chronic infection often progresses slowly and may last for a long time. A secondary infection is one that is made possible by a primary infection that has lowered the host'sresistance. Influenza in an elderly person, for example,may be followed by bacterial pneumonia. This sec-ondary bacterial infection might not have occurredhad not the person rst been ill with the flu. Nosocomial infections are those that are acquired in hospitals or other institutions such as nursinghomes. The hospital population includes newborns,the elderly, postoperative patients, people with seriouschronic diseases, cancer patients receiving chemother-apy, and others whose resistance to disease is lowered.Some hospital-acquired pathogens, such as Staphylo- coccus aureus , are transmitted from patient to patient by healthy hospital personnel. These staff members arereservoirs for S. aureus and carry it on their skin or in their upper respiratory tracts. For this reason, properhand washing is of critical importance for all hospitalstaff. Other nosocomial infections, however, are caused by the patient's own normal flora that has been inad-vertently introduced into an abnormal body site. Suchinfections may be called endogenous , which literally means \"generated from within.\" Intestinal bacilli suchas E. coli are also an important cause of nosocomial infections. Without very careful aseptic technique(and sometimes in spite of it), the patient's own intes-tinal bacteria may contaminate urinary catheters,decubitus ulcers, surgical incisions, chest tubes, and502 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease Table 22-2 INCUBATION PERIODS OF SOME INFECTIOUS DISEASES Disease Incubation Period Chickenpox 14-16 days A 2 weeks-2 months Hepatitis C 2 weeks-6 monthsHerpes daysRabies 2 weeks-2 months (up to 1 year) Salmonella food poisoning 12-72 hours Staphylococcus food poisoning 1-8 hours Syphilis 10 days-3 Tetanus 3 2-10 weeks22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 502intravenous lines. Such infections are a signicant problem in hospitals, and all those involved in anyaspect of patient care should be aware of this. EPIDEMIOLOGY Epidemiology is the study of the patterns and spread of disease within a population. This term is related toepidemic , which is an outbreak of disease, that is, more than the usual number of cases in a given timeperiod. An endemic disease is one that is present in a population, with an expected or usual number of casesin a given time. Influenza, for example, is endemic inlarge cities during the winter, and public health per-sonnel expect a certain number of cases. In some win-ters, however, the number of cases of influenzaincreases, often markedly, and this is an epidemic. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread throughout several countries. The bubonic plaguepandemic of the 14th century affected nearly all ofEurope and killed one-fourth of the population. Justafter World War I, from 1918 to 1920, an especiallyvirulent strain of the influenza virus spread around theworld and caused at least 20 million deaths. Morerecently, an epidemic of cholera began in Peru inJanuary 1991, but soon became a pandemic as choleraspread to neighboring South American countries. T o understand the epidemiology of a disease, we must know several things about the pathogen. Theseinclude where it lives in a host, the kinds of hosts it can infect, and whether it can survive outside of hosts. PORTALS OF ENTRY AND EXIT The portal of entry is the way the pathogen enters a host (Fig. 22-1). Breaks in the skin, even very smallones, are potential portals of entry, as are the naturalbody openings. Pathogens may be inhaled, consumedwith food and water, or acquired during sexual activ-ity. Most pathogens that enter the body by way ofthese natural routes are destroyed by the white bloodcells found in and below the skin and mucous mem-branes, but some may be able to establish themselvesand cause disease. You may wonder if the eye can be aportal of entry for other than eye infections, or youmay already know that it is a portal for many respira-tory viruses. People may pick up cold or flu viruses ontheir hands and then rub their eyes; the viruses arethen washed by tears into the nasal cavities, their pre-ferred site of infection. Insects such as mosquitoes, fleas, and lice, and other arthropods, such as ticks, are vectors of disease. Theyspread pathogens when they bite to obtain a host'sblood. Mosquitoes, for example, are vectors of malaria,yellow fever, and encephalitis. Ticks are vectors ofLyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. As mentioned previously, it is important to keep in mind that many hospital procedures may provide por-tals of entry for pathogens. Any invasive procedure, whether it involves the skin or the mucous mem-An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 503 Mouth (water or food) Bites of vectors Skin breaks Urinary or reproductive tractUrine Reproductive tractFecesSkin contactBloodRespiratory droplets Eye Nose A BFigure 22-1. (A) Portals of entry. (B) Portals of exit. QUESTION: Are there any portals of entry that are unlikely portals of exit?22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 503branes, may allow pathogens to enter the body. Thus it is essential that all healthcare workers follow aseptictechnique for such procedures. The portal of exit (see Fig. 22-1) is the way the pathogen leaves the body or is shed from thehost. Skin lesions, such as those of chickenpox, con-tain pathogens that may be transmitted to others bycutaneous contact. Intestinal pathogens such as thehepatitis A virus and the cholera bacteria are excretedin the host's feces, which may contaminate foodor water and be ingested by another host (this is calledthe fecal-oral route of transmission). Respiratorypathogens such as influenza and measles virusesare shed in respiratory droplets from the mouth andnose and may be inhaled by another person. Thepathogens of the reproductive tract, such as the bacte-ria that cause syphilis and gonorrhea, are transmittedto others by sexual contact. Notice that with respect toepidemiology, the pathogen travels from one host'sportal of exit to another host's portal of entry. RESERVOIRS OF INFECTION Some pathogens cause disease only in people. Measles,whooping cough, syphilis, and bacterial meningitis arestrictly human diseases. T o acquire such a disease, aperson must be exposed to someone who has theillness. Also of importance is that upon recovery from some diseases, the host may continue to harbor thepathogen and thus be a reservoir of it for others. Sucha person is called a carrier . Diseases for which the car- rier state is possible include typhoid, diphtheria, andhepatitis B. Many other diseases, however, are really animal diseases that people acquire in certain circumstances.These diseases are called zoonoses (singular: zoono- sis) and include plague, Lyme disease, encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which are spreadfrom animal to person by vectors such as ticks or fleas.Rabies is acquired by contact with infected animalsaliva or infected tissue, the virus entering the newhost through breaks in the skin. Salmonellosis is a typeof food poisoning caused by the intestinal bacilli ofanimals that contaminate meats such as chicken andturkey. Prevention of such diseases depends uponknowledge of how they are spread. For example, peo-ple who live in areas where Lyme disease is endemicshould be aware that the disease is acquired by way ofa tick bite. If children and pets are examined for ticksafter they have been out of doors, the chance ofacquiring Lyme disease is greatly diminished.Some bacteria are pathogenic only by accident, for their natural habitat is soil or water, where they act asdecomposers. The bacteria that cause gas gangrene,tetanus, and botulism are normal soil flora and causedisease when they (or their toxins) contaminate a skinwound, or, in the case of botulism, the toxin is presentin food. SPREAD OF INFECTION Based on our knowledge thus far, we can classify infec-tious diseases as noncommunicable or communicable.A noncommunicable disease is one in which a resi- dent species causes disease under certain conditions orin which a non-resident species causes disease when itenters the body. Such diseases cannot be transmitteddirectly or indirectly from host to host. Cystitis causedby E. coli in a hospital patient, for example, is not com- municable to the nurses who care for that patient.Similarly, a nurse caring for a patient with tetanus orbotulism need not worry about acquiring these dis-eases; both are noncommunicable. A communicable disease is one in which the pathogen may be transmitted directly or indirectlyfrom host to host. Direct spread of infection is by wayof cutaneous contact (including sexual contact), respi-ratory droplets, contaminated blood, or placental transmission from mother to fetus. Indirect spread is by way of contaminated food or water, or vectors,or fomites , which are inanimate objects that carry the pathogen. Influenza and cold viruses, for example,can survive outside their hosts for a time, so thatobjects such as eating utensils, door knobs, or chil-dren's toys may be vehicles of transmission for thesepathogens. Some communicable diseases may also be called contagious , which means that they are easily spread from person to person by casual cutaneous contact orby respiratory droplets. Chickenpox, measles, andinfluenza are contagious diseases. In contrast, AIDS isnot contagious, because sexual contact, blood contact,or placental transmission is necessary to acquire thevirus (HIV). HIV is not spread by cutaneous contactor by respiratory droplets. METHODS OF CONTROL OF MICROBES Microorganisms are everywhere in our environment,and although we need not always be aware of theirpresence, there are times when we must try to dimin-504 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 504ish or even eliminate them. These situations include the use of chemicals for disinfection, especially inhospitals, and the protection of our food and watersupplies. ANTISEPTICS, DISINFECTANTS, AND STERILIZATION We are all familiar with the practice of applying iodine, hydrogen peroxide, or alcohol to minor cuts in theskin, and we know the purpose of this: to prevent bac-terial infection. The use of such chemicals does indeeddestroy many harmful bacteria, although it has noeffect on bacterial spores. The chemicals used to pre-vent infection may be called antiseptics or disinfec-tants. An antiseptic (anti /H11005against; septic /H11005infection) is a chemical that destroys bacteria or inhibits theirgrowth on a living being. The chemicals named aboveare antiseptics on skin surfaces. A disinfectant is a chemical that is used on inanimate objects. Chemicalswith antibacterial effects may be further classied asbactericidal bacteriostatic. Bactericides kill bacteria by disrupting important metabolic processes.Bacteriostatic chemicals do not destroy bacteria, but rather inhibit their reproduction and slow theirgrowth. Alcohol, for example, is a bactericide that isboth an antiseptic and a disinfectant, depending uponthe particular surface on which it is used. Some chemicals are not suitable for use on human skin because they are irritating or damaging, but theymay be used on environmental surfaces as disinfec-tants. Bleach, such as Clorox, and cresols, such asLysol, may be used in bathrooms, on floors or coun-tertops, and even on dishes and eating utensils (ifrinsed thoroughly). These bactericides will also des-troy certain viruses, such as those that cause influenza.A dilute (10%) bleach solution will inactivate HIV , thevirus that causes AIDS. In hospitals, environmental surfaces are disinfected, but materials such as surgical instruments, sutures,and dressings must be sterilized. Sterilization is a process that destroys all living organisms. Most med-ical and laboratory products are sterilized by autoclav-ing. An autoclave is a chamber in which steam is generated under pressure. This pressurized steam penetrates the contents of the chamber and kills allmicroorganisms present, including bacterial spores. Materials such as disposable plastics that might be damaged by autoclaving are often sterilized by expo-sure to ionizing radiation. Foods such as meats mayalso be sterilized by this method. Such food productshave a very long shelf life (equivalent to canned food),and this procedure is used for preparing some military eld rations. PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES Each of us is rightfully concerned with our own healthand the health of our families. People who work in thepublic health professions, however, consider thehealth of all of us, that is, the health of a population.T wo traditional aspects of public health are ensuringsafe food and safe drinking water. T wo more recentaspects are tracking and learning about emerging dis-eases, and preparing defenses against the possible useof biological weapons. Food The safety of our food depends on a number offactors. Most cities have certain standards and prac-tices that must be followed by supermarkets andrestaurants, and inspections are conducted on a regu-lar basis. Food companies prepare their products by using specic methods to prevent the growth of microor-ganisms. Naturally, it is in the best interests of thesecompanies to do so, for they would soon be out ofbusiness if their products made people ill. Also ofimportance is the willingness of companies to recallproducts that are only suspected of being contami-nated. This is all to the benet of consumers. Forexample, since 1925 in the United States, only vefatal cases of botulism have been traced to commer-cially canned food. If we consider that billions of cansof food have been consumed during this time, we canappreciate the high standards the food industry hasmaintained. Milk and milk products provide ideal environments for the growth of bacteria because they contain both protein and sugar (lactose) as food sources. For this reason, milk must be pasteurized , that is, heated to 145/H11034F (62.9 /H11034C) for 30 minutes. Newer methods of pasteurization use higher temperatures for shorterperiods of time, but the result is the same: Thepathogens that may be present in milk are killed,although not all bacteria are totally destroyed. Milkproducts such as cheese and ice cream are also pas-teurized, or are made from pasteurized milk. When a food-related outbreak of disease does take place, public health workers try to trace the outbreakto its source. This stops the immediate spread of dis-ease by preventing access to the contaminated food,and the ensuing publicity on television or in the news-An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 50522Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 505papers may help remind everyone of the need for care- ful monitoring of food preparation. Some foods meant to be eaten raw or briefly cooked, such as fruit or rare beef, do carry a small risk.Consumers should realize that food is not sterile, thatmeat, for example, is contaminated with the animals'intestinal bacteria during slaughtering. Meat shouldbe thoroughly cooked. Fruit and vegetables should bewashed or peeled before being eaten raw. (Food-bornediseases, also called food poisoning, are included inthe tables of diseases that appear at the end of thischapter.) Finally, the safety of our food may depend on some- thing we often take for granted: our refrigerators. Forexample, a Thanksgiving turkey that was carved fordinner at 3 P.M. and left on the kitchen counter until midnight probably should not be used for turkey sand-wiches the next day. Although we have to rely on oth-ers to ensure that commercially prepared food will besafe, once food reaches our homes, all we really need(besides the refrigerator) is our common sense. Water When we turn on a faucet to get a glass of water, weusually do not wonder whether the water is safe todrink. It usually is. Having a reliable supply of cleandrinking water depends on two things: divertinghuman sewage away from water supplies and chlori-nating water intended for human consumption. Large cities have sewer systems for the collection of wastewater and its subsequent treatment in sewageplants. Once treated, however, the sludge (solid, par-ticulate matter) from these plants must be disposed of.This is becoming more of a problem simply becausethere is so much sewage sludge (because there are somany of us). Although the sludge is largely free ofpathogens, it ought not to be put in landlls, andbecause ocean dumping is being prohibited in manycoastal areas, this is a problem that will be with us fora long time. Drinking water for cities and towns is usually chlo- rinated. The added chlorine kills virtually all bacteriathat may be present. The importance of chlorinationis shown by a 1978 outbreak of enteritis (diarrhea)in a Vermont town of 10,000 people. The chlorina-tion process malfunctioned for 2 days, and 2000 of thetown's inhabitants became ill. (The bacteriumwas Campylobacter , a common intestinal inhabitant of animals.)You may now be wondering if all those bottled spring waters are safe to drink. The answer, in general,is yes, because the bottling companies do not wish tomake people ill and put themselves out of business.Some bottled waters, however, do have higher moldspore counts than does chlorinated tap water. Usuallythese molds are not harmful when ingested; they aredestroyed by the hydrochloric acid in gastric juice. In much of North America, nearly everyone has easy access to safe drinking water. We might remindourselves once in a while that our water will not giveus typhoid, dysentery, or cholera. These diseases arestill very common in other parts of the world, wherethe nearest river or stream is the laundry, the sewer,and the source of drinking water. The World HealthOrganization (WHO) estimates that more than 2.5billion people do not have basic sanitation, and morethan 1 billion do not have dependable access to cleanwater to drink. Emerging Diseases and Biological Weapons The term emerging diseases may be a bit misleading, because some of the pathogens are not really new.What has happened is that we have become aware ofthem. A good example of this is Lyme disease. Lymedisease in the United States was named for the town inConnecticut where a cluster of cases was discovered inthe 1970s. When the causative bacteria were laterfound and the disease fully characterized, health offi-cials realized that the disease had been described inScandinavia in the early years of the 20th century.Lyme disease was not a new disease after all, merely anewly encountered disease for Americans. Other emerging diseases are those caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses, by Hantavirus, West Nile virus, and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syn-drome) virus, by certain strains of E. coli , and by antibi- otic-resistant strains of enterococci. The tasks of publichealth officials are to keep track of all cases of thesediseases and to educate medical personnel about them. Anthrax is no longer in the news, as it was in the autumn of 2001 when spores were sent through theU.S. mail. As of 2006, no other instances of the use ofbiological weapons have been reported, though use ofthe smallpox virus as a weapon remains a concern.Public health officials had hoped that improvementsto public health policies and procedures that werespurred by the use of anthrax as a weapon would not506 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 506be wasted but would be applicable to the emerging diseases as well. Unfortunately, that has not proventrue, because as of 2006 most nations were not at allprepared for a possible pandemic of avian flu. Avian influenza A (H5N1) is truly an emerging dis- ease. The virus is a natural parasite of wild birdsand has infected domestic flocks in Asia, Europe, andAfrica. Although not a frequent event, people havecaught the virus from infected chickens or ducks,and the human mortality rate has been 50% (thoughwith a relatively small number of cases, fewer than 500,this may not be accurate). The great concern is thatthe virus will mutate and become contagious for peo-ple, that is, easily transmissible from person to person.By way of plane travel, the virus could be spreadthroughout the world in a matter of weeks. The avianflu virus H5N1 may never mutate into a \"people\"virus, but we have to be prepared for just that. As of2006 we have no vaccine for this virus (some are in thetesting stages) and only one antiviral medication that iseven somewhat effective. Because this would be a\"new\" disease for people, it is possible that no group ofpeople will have evolved any kind of resistance to it.Bird flu may be for us what measles was to the Hawaiian islanders in the 18th and 19th centuries. Themeasles virus was brought to the islands by Europeans(for whom it was usually not fatal, reflecting thousandsof years of coexistence) and nearly wiped out the nativepopulation, for whom it was a new virus. However, this is by no means certain. It may be that milder cases of human avian flu have been overlookedthus far, that H5N1 causes a wide spectrum of diseasein people, from mild to fatal. It may even be possiblethat some human cases are asymptomatic (antibodystudies would be needed to determine that). We havemuch to learn. See also Box 22-3: Microbiology in the 21st Century; you may be able to add to it. THE PATHOGENS In the sections that follow, each group of pathogenswill be described with a summary of important char-acteristics. Examples of specic pathogens will begiven to help you become familiar with them. T ablesAn Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 507 BOX22-3 MICROBIOLOGY IN THE 21ST CENTURY 2004 SARS vaccines are tested, but the human SARS virus seems to disappear. Avian influenza A (H5N1) causes sporadiccases in people in East Asia.A vaccine for the human papillomavirusesthat cause most cases of cervical cancerproves to be very effective.The incidence of whooping cough in theUnited States rises markedly. 2005 A U.S. teenager becomes the rst person to survive rabies without having received therabies vaccine. Avian flu is recognized as a pathogen withthe potential to cause a human pandemic.Vaccines for the Ebola and Marburg virusesare successful in monkeys.A vaccine for shingles is effective in adults.A more effective tuberculosis vaccine is in thetesting stages.The 21st century has just begun; here is a micro- biological perspective. 2001 In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 25 million people have AIDS or are HIV positive. Anthrax spores are sent through the U.S. mail, causing 22 cases of the disease, with 5fatalities. 2002 In China, the number of AIDS cases increases ever more rapidly. Multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis proliferate throughout the world. A strain of Staphylococcus aureus is found that is fully resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin. 2003 Cases of SARS are reported by China (after a delay of 4 months\u2014the disease was rstfound in November 2002), and the disease spreads to Europe and North America, affect- ing more than 8000 people. The rst cases of mad cow disease arereported in Canada and the United States.In the United States, 35 human cases ofmonkeypox are acquired from prairie dogs.Donated blood and organs are screened forthe West Nile virus.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 507of important human diseases caused by each group of pathogens are found at the end of this chapter. BACTERIA (SEE TABLE 22-3) Bacteria are very simple unicellular organisms. All aremicroscopic in size, and a magnication of 1000 timesis usually necessary to see them clearly. A bacterial cellconsists of watery cytoplasm and a single chromosome(made of DNA) surrounded by a cell membrane.Enclosing all of these structures is a cell wall, which isstrong and often rigid, giving the bacterium its char-acteristic shape. Based on shape, bacteria are classied as one of three groups: cocci appear round. Certain prexes may beused to describe the arrangement of spheres. Staphylo means clusters, strepto refers to chains of cells, and diplo means pairs of cells. A bacillus (plural: bacilli ) is a rod-shaped bac- terium; rods depending on thegenus. A spirillum (plural: spirilla ) is a long cell with one or more curves or coils. Some spirilla, such asthose that cause syphilis and Lyme disease, are calledspirochetes . Many of the bacilli and spirilla are capa- ble of movement because they have flagella . These are long, thread-like structures that project from thecell and beat rhythmically. Bacteria reproduce by the process of binary s- sion, in which the chromosome duplicates itself, and the original cell divides into two identical cells. Thepresence or absence of oxygen may be important forbacterial reproduction. Aerobic bacteria can repro- duce only in the presence of oxygen, and anaerobic bacteria can reproduce only in the absence of oxygen.Facultatively anaerobic bacteria are not inhibited in either situation; they are able to reproduce in eitherthe presence or absence of oxygen. This is obviouslyan advantage for the bacteria, and many pathogensand potential pathogens are facultative anaerobes. The Gram Stain Based on the chemicals in their cell walls, most bacte-ria can be put into one of two groups, called gram positive or gram negative . A simple laboratory pro- cedure called the Gram stain (see Fig. 22-2) shows us the shape of the bacteria and their gram reactions.Gram-positive bacteria appear purple or blue, andgram-negative bacteria appear pink or red. Some bac-teria do not stain with the Gram method (many spir-illa and spirochetes do not), but for those that do, each genus is either gram positive or gram negative. Thisdoes not change, just as the characteristic shape of thebacteria does not change. The genus Streptococcus , for example, is always a gram-positive coccus; the genusEscherichia is always a gram-negative bacillus. If a Gram stain is done on a sputum specimen from apatient with pneumonia, and a gram-positive coccus isfound, this eliminates all of the gram-negative cocciand bacilli that may also cause pneumonia. The Gramstain, therefore, is often an important rst step in theidentication of the pathogen that is causing a partic-ular infection. In T able 22-3 (at the end of this chap-ter), the gram reaction (where applicable) and shapeare included for each pathogen. Special Characteristics Although bacteria are simple cells, many have specialstructural or functional characteristics that help themto survive. Some bacilli and cocci have capsules (seeFig. 22-2); a capsule is a gelatinous sheath that enclo- ses the entire cell. Capsules are benecial to the bac-teria because they inhibit phagocytosis by the host'swhite blood cells. This gives the bacteria time toreproduce and possibly establish themselves in thehost. This is notbenecial from our point of view (remember that we are the hosts), but bacterial cap-sules are also antigenic , which means that they stim- ulate antibody production by our lymphocytes. Thisstarts the destruction of bacteria by our immune responses. We take advantage of this by using bacter- ial capsules in some of our vaccines, such as those usedto prevent pneumonia and meningitis. Some bacilli are able to survive unfavorable envi- ronments by forming spores. A spore is a dormant (inactive) stage that consists of the chromosome and asmall amount of cytoplasm surrounded by a thick wall.Spores can survive conditions such as heat (even boil-ing), freezing, or dehydration, which would kill thevegetative (active) forms of the bacterial cells.Fortunately for us, most pathogens are unable to formspores, but some that do are the causative agents of gasgangrene, botulism, tetanus, and anthrax. These bac-teria are decomposers in the soil environment, andtheir spore-forming ability enables them to survive theextremes of temperature and lack of water that mayoccur in the soil. Many bacteria cause disease because they produce toxins , which are chemicals that are harmful to host tissues. Often these toxins are the equivalent of our508 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 508An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 509 G IH JA DB EC FSpirillum Bacterial sporesBacillus E and specialized structures(magnication x 2000) ( G) Gram- positive Staphylococcus aureus (x 1000).

QUESTION: In parts A-F, most of the bacteria are blue or pink. Whatdo these colors indicate? The spiril-lum, C, is neither color. What doesthis tell us? digestive enzymes, which break down the food we eat. Some bacterial toxins such as hemolysins and pro-teases literally digest host tissues such as red bloodcells and proteins. The bacteria then absorb thedigested nutrients. The toxins of other bacteria have very specic effects on certain cells of the host. Botulism andtetanus toxins, for example, are neurotoxins that disrupt the functioning of nerve cells, leading to thecharacteristic symptoms of each disease. The diph-theria toxin causes heart failure, the pertussis (whoop-ing cough) toxin immobilizes the cilia of therespiratory tract, and the cholera enterotoxin causesdiarrhea.The cell walls of gram-negative bacteria are made of chemicals called endotoxins. Endotoxins all have the same effects on the host: They cause fever and cir-culatory shock (low blood pressure and heart failure).Endotoxin shock (also called gram-negative shock ) is a life-threatening condition that may accompany any serious infection with gram-negative bacteria. Rickettsias and Chlamydias These two groups of bacteria differ from most otherbacteria in that they are obligate intracellular para-sites. This means that they can reproduce only withinthe living cells of a host.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 509The rickettsias (also: rickettsiae) are parasites of mammals (including people) and are often spread byarthropod vectors. In the United States, the mostcommon rickettsial disease is Rocky Mountain spottedfever, which is spread by ticks. In other parts of theworld, epidemic typhus, which is spread by body lice,is still an important disease. From a historical per-spective, until World War I, more people died of epi-demic typhus during times of war than were killed byweapons. The chlamydias (also: chlamydiae) cause several human diseases, including ornithosis (parrot fever)and trachoma, which is the leading cause of blindnessthroughout the world. In the United States, chlamy-dial infection of the genitourinary tract has becomeone of the most prevalent sexually transmitted dis-eases, with estimates of 4 million new cases each year. Both rickettsial and chlamydial infections can be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics Antibiotics are chemicals that are used to treat bacter-ial infections. A broad-spectrum antibiotic is one that affects many different kinds of bacteria; a narrow- spectrum antibiotic affects just a few kinds of bacteria. The use of antibiotics is based on a very simple principle: Certain chemicals can disrupt or inhibit thechemical reactions that bacteria must carry out to sur-vive. An antibiotic such as penicillin blocks the forma-tion of bacterial cell walls; without their cell walls,bacteria will die. Other antibiotics inhibit DNA syn-thesis or protein synthesis. These are vital activitiesfor the bacteria, and without them bacteria cannotreproduce and will die. It is very important to remember that our own cells carry out chemical reactions that are very similar tosome of those found in bacteria. For this reason, ourown cells may be damaged by antibiotics. This is whysome antibiotics have harmful side effects. The mostserious side effects are liver and kidney damage ordepression of the red bone marrow. The liver isresponsible for detoxifying the medication, which mayaccumulate and damage liver cells. Similar damagemay occur in the kidneys, which are responsible forexcreting the medication. The red bone marrow is avery active tissue, with constant mitosis and proteinsynthesis to produce RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. Anyantibiotic that interferes with these processes maydecrease production of all of these blood cells.Patients who are receiving any of the potentially toxicantibiotics should be monitored with periodic tests of liver and kidney function or with blood counts toassess the state of the red bone marrow. Another problem with the use of antibiotics is that bacteria may become resistant to them, and so beunaffected. Bacterial resistance means that the bacte- ria are able to produce an enzyme that destroys theantibiotic, rendering it useless. This is a genetic capa-bility on the part of bacteria, and it is, therefore,passed to new generations of bacterial cells. Let us use an example with small numbers and say that, of 1000 bacterial cells, 998 are killed by a certainantibiotic. The remaining two bacteria have the genefor an enzyme that breaks the antibiotic molecule, sothey survive. What will these two bacteria do? Eachwill divide by binary ssion, becoming two cells, fourcells, eight cells, and so on. At the end of 20 divisions(which under optimum conditions may take less than24 hours) each bacterium has become more than amillion bacteria. And what is true of all of these bacte-ria? They all have the gene for resistance to that par-ticular antibiotic. This is exactly what has happened with Staphylo- coccus aureus , most strains of which are resistant to penicillin, and some strains of which are resistantto many other antibiotics as well. Most of the gram-negative intestinal bacilli are resistant to a great vari-ety of antibiotics. This is why culture and sensitivity testing is so important before an antibiotic is chosen to treat these infections. Education is also important, and healthcare person- nel must help educate the general public not to demand antibiotics for colds or the flu. These are viral diseases for which antibiotics are useless. What hap-pens is that the antibiotic kills all susceptible bacteria(even benecial ones) and leaves resistant bacteria tobecome the most numerous, perhaps to cause seriousdisease in the future. T o counteract bacterial resistance, new antibiotics are produced that are not inactivated by the destruc-tive bacterial enzymes. Within a few years, however,the usefulness of these new antibiotics will probablydiminish as bacteria mutate and develop resistance.This is not a battle that we can ever truly win, becausebacteria are living organisms that evolve as their envi-ronment changes. We must never underestimate theability of bacteria to evolve ways to neutralize theantibiotics we use to kill them. The development ofnew antibiotics is crucial if we are to stay a step aheadof these remarkably adaptable microorganisms. Antibiotics have changed our lives, although510 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 510we may not always realize that. A child's strep throat will probably not progress to meningitis, and bacterialpneumonia does not have the very high fatality ratethat it once did. But, we must keep in mind that antibi-otics are not a \"cure\" for any disease. An infection,especially a serious one, means that the immune sys-tem has been overwhelmed by the pathogen. Anantibiotic diminishes the number of bacteria to a levelwith which the immune system can cope. Ultimately,however, the body's own white blood cells must elim-inate the very last of the bacteria. VIRUSES (SEE TABLE 22-4) Viruses are not cells; their structure is even simplerthan that of bacteria, which are the simplest cells. Avirus consists of either DNA or RNA surrounded by aprotein shell. The protein shell has a shape that ischaracteristic for each virus (Fig. 22-3). There are noenzymes, cytoplasm, cell membranes, or cell walls inviruses, and they can reproduce only when inside theliving cells of a host. Therefore, all viruses are obligateintracellular parasites, and they cause disease whenthey reproduce inside cells. When a virus enters a hostcell, it uses the cell's chromosomes, RNA, and enzymesto make new viruses. Several hundred new viruses maybe produced from just one virus. The host cell rup-tures and dies, releasing the new viruses, which thenenter other cells and reproduce. The severity of a viral disease depends upon the types of cells infected. If the virus affects skin cells, forexample, the disease is usually mild and self-limiting,such as chickenpox. Small numbers of skin cells arenot crucial to our survival, and these cells can be replaced by mitosis. If, however, the virus affects nervecells, the disease is more serious and may be fatal.Rabies is such as disease. Neurons are much more vitalto us, and they cannot be replaced once they die. Some viruses, such as those that cause German measles (rubella) and chickenpox, are able to cross theplacenta, that is, pass from maternal circulation tofetal circulation. Although the disease may be verymild for the pregnant woman, the virus may severelydamage developing fetal organs and cause congenitalbirth defects such as blindness, heart malformations,and mental retardation. In the most serious cases, fetalinfection may result in miscarriage or stillbirth. Some viruses cause an initial infection, become dormant, then are reactivated, causing another infec-tion months or years later. The herpes viruses thatcause cold sores \"hide out\" in nerves of the face fol-lowing the initial skin lesion. At some later time whenthe host's resistance is lowered, the viruses emergefrom the nerves and cause another cold sore. Thechickenpox virus, which most of us acquire as chil-dren, is a herpes virus that may become dormant innerves for years, and then be reactivated and causeshingles when we are adults. A few human viruses are known to be tumor viruses, that is, they cause cells to develop abnormallyand form tumors. The Epstein-Barr virus, whichcauses mononucleosis in North America, is associatedwith Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa and with nasopha-ryngeal carcinoma in China. There are environmentalfactors, as yet unknown, that contribute to the devel-opment of these cancers in specic parts of the world. An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 511 Figure 22-3. Viruses: rep- resentative shapes and relativesizes.QUESTION: The influenza virus shows the two parts of a virus. What are these two parts?22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 511Several of the human papillomaviruses have also been associated with cancers of the mouth or larynx, andthree of these viruses are found in 90% of cervical car-cinomas in women. Important viral diseases are described in T able 22-4 at the end of this chapter. Antiviral Medications The treatment of viral diseases with chemicals posessome formidable challenges. First, viruses are active(reproducing) only within cells, so the medicationmust be able to enter infected cells to be effective.Second, viruses are such simple structures that thechoice of which of their chemical processes to attemptto disrupt is limited. Third, viruses use the host cell'sDNA and enzymes for self-replication, and a medica-tion that interferes with DNA or enzymes may kill thehost cell even as it kills the virus. These problems are illustrated by zidovudine (AZT), the rst medication that was effective againstHIV , the virus that causes AIDS. Zidovudine works byinterfering with DNA synthesis, which the virus mustcarry out to reproduce. The side effects of zidovudine,which are experienced by a signicant number ofAIDS patients, are caused by the disruption of DNAsynthesis in the person's own cells. Despite these obstacles, successful antiviral drugs have been developed. Acyclovir, for example, hasproved to be useful in the control (not cure) of herpesviruses. Ribavirin has been quite effective in the treat-ment of respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia ininfants and young children. This is an area of intensiveresearch, and more antiviral medications willundoubtedly be found within the next decade. We must be aware, however, that many viruses undergo mutations with great frequency. Influenzaviruses do (this is the reason we need a new flu vaccineevery year), and it was perhaps inevitable that flu virusmutations would provide them with resistance toantiviral medications. In January 2006 the CDCadvised physicians not to prescribe amantadine andrimantadine for patients with influenza, because morethan 90% of the strains of influenza A virus had devel-oped resistance to both drugs. Staying one step aheadof such viruses may prove to be difficult. FUNGI (SEE TABLE 22-5) Fungi may be unicellular, such as yeasts, or multicel-lular, such as the familiar molds and mushrooms. Mostfungi are saprophytes (also called saprobes ); that is,they live on dead organic matter and decompose it to recycle the chemicals as nutrients. The pathogenicfungi cause infections that are called mycoses (singu- lar: mycosis ), which may be supercial or systemic. Yeasts (Fig. 22-4) have been used by people for thousands of years in baking and brewing. In smallnumbers, yeasts such as Candida albicans are part of the resident flora of the skin, mouth, intestines, andvagina. In larger numbers, however, yeasts may causesupercial infections of mucous membranes or theskin, or very serious systemic infections of internalorgans. An all-too-common trigger for oral or vaginalyeast infections is the use of an antibiotic to treat abacterial infection. The antibiotic diminishes the nor-mal bacterial flora, thereby removing competition forthe yeasts, which are then able to overgrow. Yeasts mayalso cause skin infections in diabetics, or in obese peo-ple who have skin folds that are always moist. In recentyears, Candida has become an important cause of noso- comial infections. The resistance of hospital patients isoften lowered because of their diseases or treatments,and they are more susceptible to systemic yeast infec-tions in the form of pneumonia or endocarditis. Another supercial mycosis is ringworm (tinea), which may be caused by several species of fungi (see T able 22-5 at the end of this chapter). The nameringworm is misleading, because there are no worms involved. It is believed to have come from the appear-ance of the lesions: circular, scaly patches with reddened edges; the center clears as the lesion grows.Athlete's foot, which is probably a bacterial-fungalinfection, is perhaps the most common form of ring-worm. The systemic mycoses are more serious diseases that occur when spores of some fungi gain access tothe interior of the body. Most of these fungi grow in amold-like pattern. The molds we sometimes see onstale bread or overripe fruit look fluffy or fuzzy. Thefluff is called a mycelium and is made of many thread-like cellular structures called hyphae. The color of amold is due to the spore cases (sporangia) in which thereproductive spores are produced (see Fig. 22-4).Each spore may be carried by the air to another site,where it germinates and forms another mycelium. Because spores of these fungi are common in the environment, they are often inhaled. The immuneresponses are usually able to prevent infection andhealthy people are usually not susceptible to systemicmycoses. Elderly people and those with chronic pul-monary diseases are much more susceptible, however,and they may develop lung infections. The impor-512 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 512tance of the immune system is clearly evident if we consider people with AIDS. Without the normalimmune responses, AIDS patients are very susceptibleto invasive fungal diseases, meningitiscaused with the protozoa, its DNA sequences suggest it is closer to the fungi) is an impor-tant cause of pneumonia in people with AIDS. Thisspecies is usually not pathogenic, because the healthyimmune system can easily control it. For AIDSpatients, however, this form of pneumonia is often thecause of death. Antifungal Medications One of the most effective drugs used to treat serious,systemic mycoses, amphotericin B, has great potentialto cause serious side effects. Patients receiving thismedication should have periodic tests of liver and kid-ney function. Newer medications include ketocona-zole, fluconazole, and caspofungin, which are lesstoxic to the recipient and may prove to be as effectiveas amphotericin B. Supercial mycoses such as ringworm may be treated with certain oral medications. T aken orally, thedrug is incorporated into living epidermal cells. Whenthese cells die and reach the stratum corneum, they areresistant to the digestive action of the ringworm fungi. An effective topical spray has also been developed. There are several effective medications for mucosal yeast infections, but it is important that the trigger forthe infection (such as antibiotic therapy) be resolved aswell. If it is not, the yeast infection may recur whenthe medication is stopped. PROTOZOA (SEE TABLE 22-6) Protozoa are unicellular animals, single cells that areadapted to life in freshwater (including soil) and salt-water. Some are human pathogens and are able toform cysts, which are resistant, dormant cells that areable to survive passage from host to host. Intestinal protozoan parasites of people include Entamoeba histolytica , which causes amebic dysentery, causes diarrhea called giar- diasis and T able 22-6). People acquire theseby ingesting food or water contaminated with thecysts of these species. Giardiasis can become a prob-lem in daycare centers if the staff is not careful con-cerning hand washing and food preparation. Plasmodium , the genus that causes malaria, affects hundreds of millions of people throughout the world(causing 2 to 3 millions deaths each year) and is prob-ably the most important protozoan parasite.

QUESTION: Which of the fungi shown have amycelium?22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 513Plasmodium species are becoming increasingly resist- ant to the standard antimalarial drugs, which are usedto prevent disease as well as cure it. Work is progress-ing on several malaria vaccines, and some have shownpromise. Medications are available that can treat most proto- zoan infections. Intestinal protozoa, for example, maybe treated with metronidazole or furazolidone. WORMS (HELMINTHS) (SEE TABLE 22-7) Most worms are simple multicellular animals. The parasitic worms are even simpler than the familiarearthworm, because they live within hosts and use thehost's blood or nutrients as food. Many of the parasiticworms have complex life cycles that involve two ormore different host species. The flukes are flatworms that are rare in most of North America but very common in parts of Africaand Asia. People acquire these species by eatingaquatic plants or raw sh in which the larval wormshave encysted. Within the person, each species lives ina specic site: the intestine, bile ducts, or even certainveins. Although rarely fatal, these chronic worm infes-tations are often debilitating, and the host person is asource of the eggs of the fluke, which may then infectothers. T apeworms are also flatworms (Fig. 22-6). Some are 10 to 15 feet long, and the sh tapeworm can be aslong as 60 feet. They are as flat as a ribbon, however, and one could easily be held in the palm of the hand.The tapeworm holds on to the lining of a host's smallintestine with the suckers and hooks on its scolex(front end). The segments, called proglottids, areproduced continuously in most species and absorb nutrients from the host's digested food. The only function of the proglottids is reproduction: Eggs inone segment are fertilized by sperm from anothersegment. Mature proglottids containing fertilizedeggs break off and are excreted in the host's feces. Anintermediate host such as a cow or pig eats food con-taminated with human feces, and the eggs hatchwithin this animal and grow into larval worms thatencyst in the animal's muscle tissue. People becomeinfected by eating poorly cooked beef or pork thatcontains cysts. roundworms and Trichinella (see T able 22-7 at the end of this chapter). Medications are avail-able that can eliminate worm infestations. In endemicareas, however, reinfestation is quite common. ARTHROPODS (SEE TABLE 22-8) Arthropods such as the scabies mite and head lice areectoparasites that live on the surface of the body. The infestations they cause are very itchy and uncom-fortable but not debilitating or life threatening(Fig. 22-7). Of greater importance are the arthropods514 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease F Babesia microti (x blood cellsFigure 22-5. Protozoa. live?22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 514that are vectors of disease. These are listed in T able 22-8. Mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and flies are all insects.Ticks are not insects but are more closely related tospiders. SUMMARY The preceding discussion is an introduction tomicroorganisms and human disease, and is only part ofthe story. The rest of this story is the remarkable abil-ity of the human body to resist infection. Although we are surrounded and invaded by potential pathogens,most of us remain healthy most of the time. Theimmune responses that destroy pathogens and enableus to remain healthy are described in Chapter 14. Alsoin that chapter are discussions of vaccines. The devel-opment of vaccines represents the practical applica-tion of our knowledge of pathogens and of immunity,and it enables us to prevent many diseases. The avail-ability of specic vaccines is noted in the tables of bac-terial and viral diseases that follow.An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease 515 Scolex head (x20) Hooks Sucker Tapeworm (actual Worms.

Most strains resistant to penicillin and many strains to related antibiotics aswell. An important cause of nosocomial infections, carried on the hands or in thenasal cavities of healthcare personnel. Food poisoning characterized by rapid onset (1-8 hours) and vomiting. No vaccine. Normal skin flora; potential pathogen for those with articial internal prostheses such as heart valves and joints. Strep throat, otitis media, scarlet fever, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis; possible immuno- logic complications are rheumatic fever (transient arthritis and permanent damage to heart valves) and glomerulonephritis (transient kidney damage, usually with com-plete recovery). Rare strains cause necrotizing fasciitis, a potentially fatal hemolyticgangrene. Several vaccines are in the testing stages. An important cause of neonatal infection, the bacteria are acquired from the mother during childbirth; risk factors are premature birth and intrapartum fever. May resultin pneumonia, meningitis, or septicemia. May be prevented by testing pregnantwomen for Group B strep colonization and, if present, administering ampicillin. No vaccine. Pneumonia: accumulation of fluids and white blood cells in the alveoli. The vaccine con- tains capsules of the most common strains; recommended for the elderly, and for infants to prevent invasive disease. Possible cause of meningitis in adults with predis- posing factors such as sickle-cell anemia, alcoholism, asplenism, or head trauma. Normal colon flora. Has become an important cause of nosocomial infections of the uri- nary tract. No vaccine. Other species ( E.faecium ) may be acquired from animals. Some strains are resistant to many antibiotics. Gonorrhea: inflammation of the mucous membranes of the reproductive and urinary tracts. May cause scarring of reproductive ducts and subsequent sterility; in womenmay cause pelvic inflammatory disease. Infants of infected women may acquire the bacteria during birth; this is ophthalmia neonatorum and is prevented by antibiotic eyedrops. No vaccine. Meningitis: inflammation and edema of the meninges; pressure on the brain may cause death or permanent brain damage. Also causes internal hemorrhages, DIC, and gan- grene. Most common in older children and young adults, many of whom are asymp- tomatic carriers. Most cases are sporadic, not part of epidemics. The vaccine is givento military recruits and is strongly recommended for children ages 11-12, summercampers, high school freshman, and college freshmen living in dorms; the vaccine also prevents the carrier state. Post-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) involves antibi- otics. Otitis media and upper respiratory infection in children; pneumonia in adults, especially the immunocompromised or elderly. No vaccine. Anthrax: spores in soil may be acquired by cattle or sheep. People acquire disease from these animals or from animal products such as wool or leather. The three forms arepulmonary, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal, reflecting the portal of entry. The toxincauses death of tissue, and the pulmonary form may be fatal. Rare in the U.S., because grazing animals are vaccinated. The vaccine for people was reserved for the military, but has been offered to people thought to be exposed to spores. Anthrax isa potential biological weapon. Gas gangrene: normal soil flora may contaminate wounds; spores require anaerobic environment (dead tissue); toxins destroy more tissue, permitting the bacteria to spread; gas produced collects as bubbles in dead tissue. Food poisoning: from con-taminated meat, self-limiting diarrhea. Some species have contaminated human tis-sue (ligament, tendon) used for transplants. No vaccine.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 516517 Table 22-3 DISEASES CAUSED BY BACTERIA (Continued) Bacterial Species Caused Clostridium tetani and other spores require anaerobic condi- tions. The toxin prevents muscle relaxation, resulting in muscle spasms. May be fatalif respiratory muscles are affected. The vaccine contains the toxoid (inactivated toxin)and has made this a rare disease in the U.S. Boosters are strongly recommended for older adults. Botulism: normal soil flora; spores present in anaerobic food containers germinate and produce the toxin, which causes paralysis. Respiratory paralysis may be fatal without assisted ventilation. May cause infant botulism in children less than 2 years of age who have ingested spores. No vaccine. Treatment is antitoxin (antibodies). Diarrhea: the most common identiable cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (pseudomembranous enterocolitis); has become a signicant nosocomial pathogen. No vaccine. Diphtheria: toxin causes heart failure and paralysis; a pseudomembrane that grows in the pharynx may cover the larynx and cause suffocation. Vaccination of infants (DTP)has made this a very rare disease in the U.S. Older adults should receive boosters (combined with tetanus: DT). Listeriosis: septicemia and meningitis in the elderly, infants, and unborn; may cause mis- carriage or stillbirth. The bacteria are found in soil and in animals such as cattle. Inthe U.S., food poisoning outbreaks traced to contaminated milk or milk products. Sporadic cases traced to undercooked hot dogs or chicken or to cold cuts from deli- catessen counters. No vaccine. Typhoid fever: intestinal infection with erosion and septicemia; subsequent infection of liver, gallbladder, or kidneys. Upon recovery, the carrier state (bacteria in gallbladder) may occur. Rare in the U.S. because of chlorination of drinking water. The vaccine is used in endemic areas of the world such as Asia. Salmonellosis: food poisoning following consumption of contaminated animal products such as poultry or eggs. Diarrhea is usually self-limiting, but it may be fatal for the elderly. In the U.S. estimates are 4 million cases per year. No vaccine. Bacillary dysentery: mild to severe diarrhea; may be fatal because of dehydration and circulatory shock. Usually transmitted by food prepared by people with mild cases. No vaccine. An important cause of illness in daycare centers. Normal colon flora; cause opportunistic infections when introduced into any other part of the body. This group is one of the most common causes of nosocomial infections(urinary tract, pneumonia, skin infections). Hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome, potentially fatal. The bacteria may survive in undercooked meat, especially ground beef. A vaccine is in the research stage. Normal soil and water flora; also transient in human intestines. A serious potential pathogen for patients with severe burns, cystic brosis (causes pneumonia), or can-cer. May even survive in disinfectant solutions. No vaccine. Pneumonia: especially in people with cystic brosis or those with compromised immune systems. No vaccine. (Former genus name: Pseudomonas .) Bubonic plague: swollen lymph nodes, septicemia, and hemorrhagic pneumonia; often fatal. Animal reservoirs are prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and other rodents. Rats and people are infected by fleas (the vector). In the U.S., the few cases each year occur in the Southwest. The vaccine is no longer available. Tularemia (rabbit fever): septicemia and pneumonia; not often fatal but very debilitat- ing. Reservoirs are wild animals and birds. People are infected by vectors (ticks, lice, and biting flies), by ingestion of contaminated animal meat, or by inhalation. No vaccine. Tularemia is a potential biological weapon. (Continued on following page)22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 517518 Table 22-3 DISEASES CAUSED BY BACTERIA (Continued) Bacterial Species Discussion/Disease(s) Caused Brucella species gram fever): extreme weakness and fatigue, anorexia, a fever that rises and falls. Reservoirs are cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs; people acquire infection bycontact with contaminated animal products. In the U.S., this is an occupational dis- ease: meat processing workers, vets, farmers. Vaccines are available for animals. Meningitis in children, especially those less than 2 years of age. Older people may have mild upper respiratory infections or a potentially fatal epiglottitis. The vaccine (Hib) contains the capsules of the bacteria and is recommended for infants beginning at age 2 months. This was the most common cause of meningitis in the U.S., approxi-mately 20,000 cases per year. The vaccine has provided a 90% reduction. Conjunctivitis: painful inflammation of the conjunctiva; spread by direct contact or fomites; may occur in epidemics among groups of children. No vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis): paroxysms of violent coughing that may last for several weeks. Adults may have less severe coughing and go undiagnosed. Pneumonia is acomplication that may be fatal, especially for children less than 1 year of age. People are the only host. Concern about the safety of the original vaccine has prompted the development of newer vaccines, but in the U.S. the number of cases has increasedsharply, in part because of parental complacency. Cholera: profuse watery diarrhea; infection ranges from mild to fatal. Spread of infection is usually by way of water contaminated with human feces. Rare in the U.S.; epi- demic in Asia, Africa, and South America. A new oral vaccine seems very effective. Enteritis: diarrhea and nausea. Acquired by ingestion of raw or lightly cooked seafood; usually self-limiting. Gangrene and septicemia: acquired from ocean water that contaminates a wound or by the ingestion of raw shellsh. Illness is often severe and protracted, and it may be fatal, especially for people who are immunosuppressed or who have liver disease. No vaccine. Enteritis: diarrhea that is often self-limiting but may be severe in the elderly or very young. Reservoirs are animals such as poultry; people acquire infection from contam- inated meat. In the U.S., estimates are 2 million cases per year. No vaccine. Gastric ulcers: most are caused by H.pylori , which has also been implicated in cancer of the stomach. Legionellosis, which occurs in two forms: Legionnaire's disease is a pneumonia that may be fatal; Pontiac fever is a mild upper respiratory infection that is usually self-limiting.The bacteria are found in natural water, including soil, and may contaminate air con-ditioning systems or water supplies. Person-to-person transmission does not seem to occur. Has become an important cause of nosocomial pneumonia. No vaccine. Tuberculosis (TB): formation of tubercles containing bacteria and white blood cells, usu- ally in the lung. Lung tissue is destroyed (caseation necrosis) and is removed bymacrophages, leaving large cavities. The bacteria are spread by respiratory droplets from people with active cases. Many people acquire a primary infection that becomes dormant and is without symptoms, yet may be triggered later into anactive secondary infection. The BCG vaccine is not used in the U.S., but is in otherparts of the world. In the U.S., TB cases are frequent among homeless people, those with AIDS, and in closed populations such as prisons. Worldwide, the WHO estimates that there are 7-8 million new infections each year and 3 million deaths; 30% of theworld's people are infected with active or latent TB. Strains of the bacteria resistantto the standard TB medications are becoming much more common and pose a diffi- cult treatment problem. New vaccines are being tested.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 518519 Table 22-3 DISEASES CAUSED BY BACTERIA (Continued) Bacterial Species Discussion/Disease(s) Caused TB; usually in the lungs. These bacteria are pathogenic for people with AIDS or other forms of immunosuppression, and for those with chronic pulmonary diseases. Leprosy (Hansen's disease): chronic disease characterized by disguring skin lesions and nerve damage that may cause paralysis or loss of sensation. The bacteria are acquired by cutaneous contact or respiratory droplets. The incubation period may be several years; children develop clinical disease more rapidly than do adults. A vaccine is in the testingstage. Syphilis: a sexually transmitted disease that progresses in three stages. Primary syphilis: a painless, hard chancre at the site of entry on skin or mucous membrane. Secondary syphilis: a rash on the skin and mucous membranes (indicates systemic infection). Tertiarysyphilis (5-40 years later): necrotic lesions (gummas) in the brain, heart valves, aorta,spinal cord, skin, or other organs. Congenital syphilis (the bacteria can cross the placenta) may cause bone and teeth defects, and mental retardation. The WHO estimates that more than 12 million new cases occur worldwide every year, a serious public health prob-lem. No vaccine. Leptospirosis: a disease of wild or domestic animals that excrete the bacteria in urine. People acquire the bacteria by contact with contaminated water. Disease is usually mild, resem- bling intestinal virus infection. Weil's disease is the serious form, with hemorrhages in theliver and kidneys, and jaundice always present, indicating severe liver damage. A vaccineis available for dogs. Lyme disease: begins as a flu-like illness, often with a bull's-eye rash at the site of the tick bite. May be followed by cardiac arrhythmias, self-limiting meningitis, or arthritis. Animalreservoirs are deer and eld mice; the vector is the deer tick (genus Ixodes ). The vaccine was taken off the market because of poor sales. Trench mouth (Vincent's gingivitis): an ulcerative infection of the gums and pharynx caused by overgrowth of Borrelia and other normal oral flora. Triggered by poor oral hygiene or oral infection, which must be corrected to make antibiotic therapy effective. Epidemic typhus: high fever and delirium, hemorrhagic rash; 40% fatality rate. Vector is the human body louse. Very rare in the U.S. but still endemic in other parts of the world. Endemic typhus: similar to epidemic typhus but milder; 2% fatality rate. Reservoirs are rats and wild rodents; vectors are fleas. The few cases in the U.S. each year usually occur in the Southeast. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF): high fever, hemorrhagic rash, and pneumonia; 20% fatality rate. Reservoirs are wild rodents and dogs; vectors are ticks. Despite its name,RMSF in the U.S. is most prevalent in the Southeast coastal states (North Carolina, South Carolina) and in Oklahoma. Genitourinary infection (nongonococcal urethritis): in men, urethritis or epididymitis; in women, cervicitis, although many women are asymptomatic. Complications in womeninclude pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and miscarriage. Newborns of infected women may develop conjunctivitis or pneumonia. This is one of the most preva- lent sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. No vaccine. Trachoma: conjunctivitis involving growth of papillae; vascular invasion of the cornea leading to scarring and blindness. Spread by direct contact and fomites. The leading cause of blindness throughout the world, especially in dry, dusty environments. Pneumonia, usually community-acquired and mild enough to be called \"walking pneumo- nia,\" with fever, cough, and hoarseness. No vaccine. C.pneumoniae as a factor in coro- nary artery disease has not yet been demonstrated conclusively. Psittacosis, also called ornithosis or parrot fever. Reservoirs are wild and domestic birds, which shed the pathogen in feces. Acquired by people by inhalation of fecal dust. Diseaseranges from mild upper respiratory infection to a more serious pneumonia. No vaccine.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 519520 Table 22-4 Measles virusType 1: fever blisters (cold sores) on the lip or in oral cavity; the virus is dormant in nerves of the face between attacks. Spread in saliva; may cause eye infections (self-inoculation). Type 2: genital herpes; painful lesions in the genital area; a sexually transmitted disease. Many people have few or no symptoms but may still spread the virus to sexual partners. Several vac-cines are being developed. Either type may be oral or genital, and may cause systemic infection and herpes encephalitis in newborns, whose immune systems cannot contain the virus. Chickenpox: the disease of the rst exposure; vesicular rash; pneumonia is a possible complica- tion, especially in adults. The virus then becomes dormant in nerves. Shingles: painful, raised lesions on the skin above the affected nerves following reactivation of the dormant virus. Usually occurs in adults. The (HVZ) chickenpox vaccine is recommended for children. A shin-gles vaccine has been approved for adults. Mononucleosis: swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, fever, possible spleen or liver enlargement. Spread by saliva. Has been statistically implicated as a contributing factor to the onset of multiple sclerosis. EBV is linked to Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa and to nasopharyngeal carcinoma inChina. No vaccine. Most people have asymptomatic infection; the virus does no harm but remains in the body. Fetal infection may result in mental retardation, blindness, or deafness. CMV is the most frequent viral infection following organ transplants, and may cause a serious pneumonia. A cause ofblindness in people with AIDS. No vaccine. Sixth disease (the 6th childhood illness that includes a rash, also called roseola or exanthema subitum): high fever and a rash predominantly on the trunk. Most common in infants, and most infections are mild. The virus remains dormant in T lymphocytes, may be reactivatedand spread by saliva. No vaccine. Kaposi's sarcoma: a malignancy of blood vessels often seen in people with AIDS; the virus is sexu- ally transmitted. No vaccine. More than 100 types, some of which cause genital warts. Several stimulate abnormal growth of cells and cause cervical cancer in women. A vaccine for HPV-16 and HPV-18 (the causes ofapproximately 70% of all cervical cancers) has had excellent results. Many different types: some cause acute respiratory disease (ARD) similar to the common cold; others cause pharyngoconjunctival fever and may occur in epidemics related to swimmingpools. The ARD vaccine is used only in the military. Common cold: sore throat, runny nose, low fever; usually self-limiting. No vaccine, though sev- eral are in the research stage (there are more than 100 types of rhinoviruses). Influenza: muscle aches, fever, fatigue, spread in respiratory droplets. Three types: A, B, and C. Type A is responsible for most epidemics. These are mutating viruses, and new vaccines are needed as the virus changes. The most serious complication is secondary bacterial pneu- monia. Pneumonia: especially at risk are infants and young children, esp. those who must be hospital- ized. Decades of work have yet to produce an effective vaccine. Lower respiratory tract infection: bronchiolitis and pneumonia, especially in infants and probably in elderly adults. Most infections occur during the winter. This is a newly discovered pathogen, related to RSV, and much remains to be learned. No vaccine. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: fever, cough, pulmonary edema, hypotension. Mortality rate is 40%-50%. Acquired by contact with rodent feces or urine, or inhalation of virus in rodent-infested areas. No vaccine. Measles (rubeola): fever, sore throat, Koplik's spots (white) on lining of mouth, rash. Complications are ear infections, pneumonia, and measles encephalitis, which may be fatal.The vaccine is given to infants in combination with mumps and rubella (MMR).22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 520(Continued on following page) 521 Table 22-4 DISEASES CAUSED BY VIRUSES (Continued) Rubella virus Parvovirus B19 Mumps virusPolio virusesCoxsackie viruses types) Rabies virus viruses West Nile virus Dengue virus (4 serotypes) Rotaviruses Norwalk virusesEbola viruses Marburg virus Yellow fever virusGerman measles: mild upper respiratory symptoms; a rash may or may not be present. The virus may cross the placenta and cause congenital rubella syndrome (CRS): blindness, deafness, heart defects, mental retardation, or miscarriage. CRS is most likely to occur if the fetus isinfected during the rst trimester. The vaccine is given to infants (MMR). Fifth disease: a childhood illness characterized by a rash on the cheeks and limbs. Adults may develop transitory arthritis; anemia may occur in immunocompromised people or those with sickle-cell anemia. The virus can cross the placenta and may cause miscarriage or severe dam-age to the fetal liver. No vaccine yet for human disease (as there are for animal parvoviruses)because development of one is not seen as commercially protable. Mumps: fever, swelling of the parotid salivary glands and perhaps the others (asymptomatic infections do occur); the virus is spread in saliva. Complications are rare in children butinclude pancreatitis, nerve deafness, and mumps encephalitis. Adult men may develop orchi-tis, inflammation of the testes. Adult women may develop oophoritis, inflammation of the ovaries. The vaccine is given to infants. Polio: most infections are asymptomatic or mild; major infection may result in paralysis. Two vac- cines: IPV (Salk) contains a killed virus and cannot cause polio; booster injections are needed.OPV (Sabin) contains an attenuated virus, is given orally, and carries a very small risk of caus- ing polio. In the U.S., polio cases are vaccine related; polio is still endemic in other parts of the world. The WHO has set 2007 as the revised goal for the eradication of polio. Hand, foot, and mouth disease: fever, blisters on the palms, soles, tongue, and throat; most com- mon among children. May also cause conjunctivitis, myositis, and myocarditis. Highly conta- gious, spread by the fecal-oral route and by respiratory droplets. No vaccine. Rabies: headache, nausea, fever, spasms of the swallowing muscles; seizures; fatal because of respiratory or heart failure; virtually 100% fatal. Reservoirs are wild animals; the virus is pres-ent in their saliva. Post-exposure prevention requires Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG- antibodies) and the rabies vaccine. Encephalitis: most infections are mild; CNS involvement is indicated by confusion, lethargy, or coma. Several types of these viruses occur in the U.S. Reservoirs are wild birds and smallmammals; vectors are mosquitoes. Vaccines are available for horses and for people whose occupations put them at risk. West Nile encephalitis: rst found in North America in New York City in 1999 (well known in Africa and the Middle East). Natural reservoirs are birds; several species of mosquitoes are vec- tors. Symptoms include headache and confusion, but most infections are mild or asympto- matic; fatalities are not common. No vaccine. Dengue fever: illness charac- terized by vascular leakage and defective clotting. Vectors are species of mosquitos in the genus Aedes . Endemic in the tropics and subtropics, with an estimated 100 million cases per year and 25,000 fatalities, and is moving north. Vaccines are in the testing stages. Enteritis: worldwide the leading cause of diarrhea and potentially fatal dehydration in infants and children. Two vaccines have passed clinical tests. Gastroenteritis: vomiting; called by many \"stomach flu.\" Acquired from food such as shellsh, or from food handled by people with mild cases. No vaccine. Hemorrhagic fever: high fever, systemic hemorrhages, necrosis of the liver; mortality rate 25%-90%. The viruses also affect monkeys, which may be reservoirs of infection. Vaccines are in the testing stage. Hemorrhagic fever similar to that caused by Ebola virus. A vaccine is in the testing stage.Yellow fever: hemorrhages in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and other organs. The vector is a mos- quito. The vaccine is recommended for travelers to endemic areas: Central and South America and Africa.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 521522 Table 22-4 DISEASES CAUSED BY VIRUSES (Continued) Virus Discussion/Disease(s) Caused Hepatitis viruses: types A,B, and C Human immuno- deciencyvirus (HIV) Variola major SARS virusHepatitis: anorexia, nausea, fatigue, jaundice (may not be present in mild cases). HAV is spread by the fecal-oral route; contaminated shellsh or food prepared by people with mild cases. No carriers after recovery. HBV is spread by sexual activity or contact with blood or otherbody fluids. Carrier state is possible; may lead to liver cancer or cirrhosis. HCV transmission issimilar to that of HBV. Carrier state is possible. There are vaccines for hepatitis A and B. Other hepatitis viruses are designated D, E, F, and G. AIDS: destruction of helper T cells and suppression of the immune system; opportunistic infec- tions; invariably fatal, often after many years. HIV is spread by sexual activity, contact withblood, or placental transmission. No vaccine. Smallpox: declared eradicated in the wild by the WHO in 1980. Is a potential biological weapon. A contagious disease characterized by a hemorrhagic rash and internal hemorrhages. Fatalityrate is 30%-50%. In the U.S., childhood vaccination was stopped in 1982. Severe acute respiratory syndrome: a pneumonia in which the lungs ll with fluid. The reservoir of the virus is the horseshoe bat of China. The rst cases of SARS were in China in 2002; thevirus mutated and spread easily among people. Plane travel carried the virus to Europe andNorth America. From 2002 through 2003, there were approximately 8000 cases, which resulted in 800 deaths; then the human form of the virus disappeared. Vaccines are in the development stage. Table 22-5 DISEASES CAUSED BY FUNGI Fungus Genus Discussion/Disease(s) Caused red loss of hair. Tinea pedis is ath- lete's foot. May also infect damaged nails. Spores of these fungi are acquired from people or animals. Yeast infections: mucosal infections are called thrush; may be oral or vaginal; yeasts have come from resident flora. Systemic infections include pneumonia and endocarditis. Important nosocomial pathogens. Cryptococcosis: pulmonary infection that may progress to meningitis, especially in AIDS patients. Spores are carried in the air from soil or pigeon droppings. Histoplasmosis: pulmonary infection that is often self-limiting. Progressive disease involves ulcerations of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; usually fatal. Spores are car- ried by the air from soil. Coccidioidomycosis: pulmonary infection that is often self-limiting. Progressive disease involves the meninges, bones, skin, and other organs; high mortality rate. Spores are carried by the air. Common bread mold that is harmless to most people, but may cause invasive disease in those with compromised immune systems or poorly controlled diabetes. The sporesmay be inhaled or ingested and establish themselves in tissues, leading to systemic infection characterized by clotting and necrosis. Also causes digestive disease in cattle and pigs. A common mold found on fruits, harmless to healthy people. In those who are immuno- compromised it may cause sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, or more invasive disease. Pneumonia: only in very debilitated or immunosuppressed persons, such as people with AIDS. Although its antibiotic susceptibility is that of a protozoan, its DNA sequencesare more similar to those of fungi. Many people become infected during childhood, but a normal immune system prevents any damage. Such a latent infection may become symptomatic and very serious when cell-mediated immunity is impaired.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM lesions in the colon, bloody diarrhea; abscesses may form in the liver, lungs, or brain. Spread by the fecal-oral route in water or food. Amebic meningoencephalitis: inflammation of the meninges and brain; uncommon in the U.S. but almost always fatal. Amoebas in fresh water are acquired when swimmers sniff water into the nasal cavities; the amoebas move along the olfactory nerves into the brain. Balantidiasis: abdominal discomfort and diarrhea; often mild. Reservoirs are pigs and other domestic animals; spread by the fecal-oral route. Giardiasis: fatty diarrhea; may be mild. Reservoirs are wild and domestic animals and people. Spread by the fecal-oral route in water or food prepared by people with mild cases. Animportant cause of diarrhea in daycare centers. Trichomoniasis: a sexually transmitted disease. Women: causes cervicitis and vaginitis; men are often asymptomatic. African sleeping sickness: lethargy progressing to coma and death. Reservoirs are wild and domestic animals; vector is the tsetse fly. No vaccine. Malaria: the protozoa reproduce in red blood cells, causing hemolysis and anemia. The vector is the Anopheles mosquito. Cerebral malaria is the most severe form, and it is often fatal for children. The WHO estimates that at least 500 million people are affected, and 3 million people die each year of malaria. Several promising vaccines are in the testing stages. Toxoplasmosis: asymptomatic infection in healthy people. Congenital infection: miscarriage or mental retardation, blindness. Reservoirs are cats and grazing animals. Pregnant womenmay acquire cysts from cat feces or from ingestion of rare beef or lamb. Diarrhea: ranges from mild to severe; spread by the fecal-oral route. An important cause of diarrhea in daycare centers and in AIDS patients. Is very resistant to chlorine, may contam-inate municipal water supplies or swimming pools and cause extensive epidemics. Babesiosis: rst symptoms similar to influenza; the protozoa reproduce in and destroy RBCs. In severe cases the hemolytic anemia may lead to renal failure. The vectors are Ixodes ticks. No vaccine. Table 22-7 INFESTATIONS CAUSED BY WORMS Worm ( Genus ) Adult worms (1/2 inch) live in bile ducts. Acquired by people from ingestion of raw sh that contains worm cysts. Bloating and abdominal discomfort; constipation or diarrhea. People acquire the worms by eat- ing poorly cooked beef, pork, or sh (the alternate hosts) that contain worm cysts. Adult worms (1/8 inch) live in colon; females lay eggs on perianal skin while host is asleep, causing irritation and itching of skin. Eggs are spread to family members on hands and bed linens. In the U.S., this is probably the most common worm infestation. Adult worms (1/2 inch) live in the small intestine; their food is blood. Heavy infestations cause anemia and fatigue. Eggs are excreted in feces; larval worms burrow through the skin of abare foot and migrate to the intestine. Worldwide, in tropical and subtropical regions, an estimated 800 million people are infested. Hookworm is now rare in North America. Adults are 10-12 inches long, and live in the small intestine. Large numbers of worms may cause intestinal obstruction. Eggs are excreted in feces and are spread to others on hands orvegetation contaminated by human feces. Trichinosis: severe muscle pain as migrating worms form cysts that become calcied. Acquired by eating poorly cooked pork (or wild animals) that contains cysts.22Scanlon(p3)-ch22 8/17/06 11:05 AM Page 523524 An Introduction to Microbiology and Human Disease Table 22-8 ARTHROPOD VECTORS Arthropod Disease (Type of Pathogen)* Mosquito Flea Body louse TickTsetse fly Deer fly, horse fly *These diseases are described in previous tables.Malaria (protozoan)Encephalitis (virus)Yellow fever (virus) Plague (bacterium) Endemic typhus (rickettsia) Epidemic typhus (rickettsia) Tularemia (bacterium) Relapsing fever (bacterium) Lyme disease (bacterium) Rocky Mountain spotted fever (rickettsia)Tularemia (bacterium) African sleeping sickness (protozoan) Tularemia (bacterium) Classication of Microorganisms 1. a Arthropods\u2014insects, ticks, or mites vec- tors of disease or cause infestations.

Polio is the next target of world health officials,then measles. What characteristics must a dis-ease or its pathogen have that would allow us evento consider trying to eradicate it? T ry to thinkof ve. 2. T o understand the epidemiology of a disease, we must know several things about the disease or itsagent (pathogen). Again, try to think of ve. 3. Many working mothers depend on daycare centers to care for their children. What pathogensare likely to flourish in a daycare center if properprecautions are not taken? There are two generalkinds. Besides being sure that all children havethe proper vaccinations, what do you think isthe most important proper precaution (think: lunchtime)? 4. We're still at the daycare center.

For example, fallopian tube is named for Gabriele Fallopio, an Italian anatomist of the 16th century. In recent years it has been suggested that eponymous terms be avoided because they are not descriptive and that they be replaced with more informative terms. Such changes, however, occur slowly, because the older termsare so familiar to those of us who teach. Some of us may even use them as opportunities to impart a little history,also known as \"telling stories.\" In this edition, the most familiar eponymous terms have been retained, with the newer term in parentheses after the rst usages. The list below is provided to show the extent of reclassication of eponymous terms asrelated to basic anatomy and physiology.
