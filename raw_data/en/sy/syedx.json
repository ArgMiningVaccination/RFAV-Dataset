If we don't get enough of these compounds, it may hinder our body's ability to defend us against microbes, bacteria, and viruses, increasing the chances that we'll get sick or fall victim to some medical disorder or disease. The best way to provide our bodies with essential vitamins and antioxidants is by eating nutrient-dense food sources, such as fruits and vegetables, but how many Americans are consuming a proper diet on a regular basis? Fortunately, Balance Factor is here to help, as we understand that it may not always be feasible to eat a perfect diet, which is why we've developed a variety of supplements and vitamins for immune support.
