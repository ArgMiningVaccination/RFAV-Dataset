VITT may also be called vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome (TTS). Because VITT is a new condition, there is limited evidence available to inform clinical management, identification and management of the condition is evolving quickly as the case definition becomes clearer. This guideline was produced to support clinicians to diagnose and manage this newly recognised syndrome. NICE is continually monitoring the evidence. Future versions of the guideline will reflect changes in the evidence base and clinical practice. On 22 June 2022, we updated the advice on plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma in people at high risk of a poor prognosis to recommend it is considered earlier in the care pathway. We have published this guideline in MAGICapp, a global evidence ecosystem already being used by key partners such as the Australian Taskforce for COVID-19 and the World Health Organization. The MAGICapp platform allows the efficient sharing of evidence between guideline developers from around the world. This means NICE can develop and update its COVID-19 guidance more quickly and efficiently as new evidence is assessed.

The guideline is part of a suite of products that NICE has developed to support healthcare staff during the pandemic.

Your responsibility The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian. All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the [Yellow Card Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/report-problem-medicine-medical-device). Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties. Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should [assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations](https://www.nice.org.uk/about/who-we-are/sustainability) wherever possible.
