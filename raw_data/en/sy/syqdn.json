Time worked beyond the regularly scheduled shift in one day, the standard week in one seven (7) day period, or eighty (80) hours within a fourteen (14) day period as defined above shall be considered overtime. Sick leave paid for will not count toward the calculation of overtime. For Respiratory Care Specialists, only time worked over forty (40) hours in the defined workweek of Monday through Sunday will be paid at the overtime rate. All time which is compensated at a rate of time and a half (1 \u00bd) the rate of pay will be considered overtime whether or not such compensation is characterized as overtime or premium pay.

Overtime work must be approved in advance by the Employer and shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half times the employee's straight time hourly rate, or double time for registered nurses as appropriate. The straight-time hourly rate of pay shall include shift differential. - Compensatory Time.

All compensatory time must be used by June 30th of each year, however if the balance exceeds 240 hours prior to June 30th, the excess amount will be cashed out to bring the balance back to 240 hours. The employee's compensatory time balance will be cashed out to zero every June 30th or when the employee leaves University employment for any reason. The employee's compensatory time balance may be cashed out when the employee: - - Transfers to a position in their department with different budget or funding sources or, - Transfers to a position in another department.

Time spent on the rehire list shall not be included in computing seniority (layoff or non-layoff seniority) but does not constitute a break in service. Bargaining unit employees taking non-bargaining unit permanent positions, intermittent positions, or nonpermanent positions at HMC will have their layoff seniority bridged but will not earn seniority while in the position nor will they be able to exercise their seniority prior to return to a permanent bargaining unit position. For the purpose of this article, service of less than full-time shall be considered full-time. Seniority shall only be earned by permanent employees. 38.2 Military Service Credit. Permanent HMC employees who are veterans or their unmarried widows/widowers shall have added to their unbroken service the veteran's active military service to a maximum of five (5) years in accordance with applicable state and federal law. 38.3 Termination of Seniority. Seniority (layoff and non-layoff) shall terminate upon cessation of the employment relationship. Solely for the purpose of example, the following are set forth as events which evidence cessation of the employment relationship: discharge, resignation, retirement, removal from the rehire list in accordance with this Article, and failure to return from a leave of absence. 38.4 Essential Skills. Essential skills are the minimum qualifications listed in the job description for the classification and any specific position requirements, credentials, certifications or licenses. 38.5 Layoff. A layoff is defined as a permanent or prolonged reduction in the number of employees in a given bargaining unit resulting from a lack of funds, curtailment of work, and/or good faith reorganization for efficiency purposes. Prior to implementing a layoff, the Employer, within the context of its determination of the staffing needs of the layoff unit, will minimize overtime in the layoff unit impacted, the use of agency or traveler nurses in the layoff unit impacted, reliance on intermittent and nonpermanent and hourly staff in the layoff unit. The Employer will also seek volunteers in the layoff unit impacted who are willing to be reassigned or to be laid off in lieu of the employee(s) whose position is identified to be eliminated. Individuals who volunteer to be laid off will not have a displacement option but will retain the right to be placed on the rehire list. 38.6 Layoff Unit. The layoff unit shall consist first of the employee's unit and shift, then the clinical group for the purpose of determining layoff options. 38.7 Layoff Notice. Employees identified for layoff and the SEIU 1199NW union office shall receive not less than thirty (30) calendar days' notice prior to the abolishment of the positions. The notice shall include the effective date of the layoff and a reference to the employee's rights under this Article. The notice to the union shall also include the most recent classified hire date seniority list. Upon request, the Union and the Employer will meet to discuss possible alternatives to the layoff. 38.8 Layoff and Displacement Options. The Employer shall identify the position to be eliminated and employee(s) to be affected. Layoff shall be by seniority within the layoff unit, least senior employee first as long as the remaining employees possess the essential skills to perform the necessary work. Employees subject to layoff shall be offered one of the following employment options in descending order, provided they meet the essential skills of the offered position: - a funded vacant posted position within the layoff/seniority unit. An employee who accepts a funded vacant position will have the option to resign within six (6) weeks after accepting the position and be placed on the rehire list. This employment option will count as one (1) of the two (2) offers of placement under Article 38.12 (B). - the opportunity to replace the least senior employee in the affected job class within the unit or department or base; - the opportunity to replace the least senior employee in their clinical group (see Appendix VII); - the opportunity to replace the least senior employee within the same department who is in a lower classification in the same series as the employee affected by the layoff. Employees may request to be laid off and have the right to be placed on the rehire list(s) instead of accepting an employment option above. An employee laid off due to the exercise of another employee's displacement option shall not have any displacement option. Such an employee shall be offered any vacant position available on the employee's unit or in the employee's clinical group and shall also have the right to be placed on the rehire list(s) per Article 38.10. 38.9 FTE Reduction. An employee in a position that is not abolished but is reduced by more than .2FTE and who will remain benefit eligible after the reduction will have the choice of staying in the reduced position and going on the rehire list for the position and FTE status held by the employee immediately prior to the reduction or exercising available layoff rights under (a) above. The employee must exercise this choice within three (3) working days of the reduction notice. 38.10 Rehire. Laid off employees will be placed on an eligible rehire list(s) designated by the employee for twenty-four (24) months. Employees will be automatically placed on the rehire list for the classification and FTE status from which they were laid off. In addition, based on employee request, employees identified for layoff may be on the following rehire lists: - Positions of a lower FTE status in the classification from which the employee was laid off; - Lower classifications in the series from which the employee was laid off. The University will refer an employee from the designated rehire list(s) for any open positions in the layoff unit from which the employee was laid off for which the laid off employee possesses the essential skills. Employees referred from the rehire list(s) who possess the essential skills needed for a vacant position in the layoff unit will be offered the position prior to the University offering it to any other applicant. The University will refer employees from the rehire list(s) in order of seniority, most senior employee on the list first. 38.11 Rehire Trial Period. Employees placed into vacant positions from the rehire list will serve a two (2) month rehire trial period. During the rehire trial period either party may, at its sole discretion and without resort to the grievance procedure, initiate return to the rehire list. Time spent in a rehire trial period will not count toward the twenty-four (24) month rehire list period. The two (2) month rehire trial period will be adjusted to reflect any paid or unpaid leave taken during the period. 38.12 Removal from List. Removal from the rehire list(s) will occur for any of the following circumstances: - If placement does not occur within twenty-four (24) months; - If the employee refuses two (2) offers of placement for a position having the same pay, shift from which the employee was laid off. In such case, the employee will be removed from all other rehire lists and will have exhausted all rehire rights; - If the employee was placed into two (2) vacant positions for which the employee has failed to complete the rehire trial period; - If the employee accepts an offer of placement and completes the rehire trial service period; - Employees who reject one (1) offer of placement from a list for a position in a classification other than that from which the employee was laid off will be removed from that list. 38.13 Other Layoff and Rehire Issues Rehire Wages and Progression Start Date. When employees are rehired from layoff status, the progression start date and months of service towards higher accrual rate will be reestablished and extended by an amount of time in calendar days equal to the period of time spent on the rehire list prior to rehire. Employees placed from the rehire list into positions with the same salary range held at the time of layoff shall be placed at the same step in the range held at the time of layoff. Employees placed from the rehire list into positions with a lower salary range than held at the time of layoff shall be placed in a salary step nearest to, but not in excess of, the salary held at time of layoff.

For purposes of periodic salary step increases, the progression start date will be determined as follows: - The first of the current month for actions occurring between the first and the fifteenth of the month; or, - The first of the following month for actions occurring between the sixteenth and the end of the month. When an employee returns from layoff status, the progression start date will be reestablished and extended by an amount of time equal to the period of layoff to give credit for time served in a salary step prior to layoff. When a progression start date coincides with a promotional date, the appointment to a new salary range, and/or a market adjustment, the progression start date will be applied first. Upon promotion or reclassification the new progression start date shall be the first of the current month for effective dates falling between the first and fifteenth of the month and the first of the following month for effective dates falling between the sixteenth and the end of the month.

For Flight Nurses working in Juneau: In a rolling three month period, Flight Nurses will not be required to use more than twenty-four (24) hours of vacation time, compensatory time, holiday credit, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for any aircraft out of service for three or more consecutive days. If an aircraft is out of service two or more times in a rolling three month period as described above, this will trigger an emergency JLM to discuss the impacts. If the nurse has already reported to work and the Employer assigns the nurse to work at another Airlift Northwest facility, travel time will be considered duty time. ALNW will make a best faith effort to allow staff enough drive time to be included such that they could be back at their original Base by their scheduled time off (currently no guarantee under any shift) and will pay the appropriate rate of pay (over-time or double-time) if on flight-related duty. ALNW will pay one and a half (1 \u00bd ) hour of drive time from Boeing Field for Arlington, Olympia, and Bremerton, two (2) hours for Bellingham, and up to two and a half (2 1/2) hours for Yakima, and up to three (3) hours for Wenatchee and three and a half (3 \u00bd) for Pasco all at straight time, if the employee does not get off at their originally scheduled shift's end from Boeing Field. If there is no other work to do, the nurse may choose to use leave without pay or annual leave, if available, to cover the nurse's scheduled work time. 47.12 Stuck out of Town. When employees are stuck out of town on their duty off time past their scheduled shift, they will receive pay, at an overtime rate, for all hours (hour for hour) until they return to their home base.

If management must change a start time, affected RNs will be notified of the change at least four (4) weeks prior to its implementation. 47.15 Nurse Replacement. If a flight RN calls in sick the shift will first be offered as extra straight time to other flight RNs at the base. If not filled, the shift will be offered as extra straight time to other flight RNs at other bases. If there are open shifts or FMLA after schedule posts, shifts will be filled in this order: - Anyone needing to meet their FTE including sick floats (if they have not gotten their FTE); - Intermittent and Nonpermanent (if it does not put them into overtime); - Base staff at EST; - All staff at EST; - Pro-staff or residents, if they have gone through MD core and signed off by Dr./Education; - Base staff at OT; - All staff at OT. 47.16 Hours of Work and Overtime. - Work Day. The length of the workday may vary depending on the base and/or aircraft. The Employer and the Union will make a good faith to discuss changes to the scheduled length of a workday at a given base and/or aircraft at a JLM. Except in emergent medical situations, the employer will make a good faith effort to end duty shifts on time in an effort to minimize mandatory overtime. - Overtime. Both the Employer and the Union concur that overtime shall be minimized. Overtime at time and one half (1 \u00bd) shall be paid for hours worked beyond an employee's regularly scheduled shift in one day, or for hours worked beyond the full-time work schedule in accordance with the definition of the work period for a full-time classified employee in Article 47.2. Overtime at the rate of double time (2x) will be paid for continuous hours worked beyond twelve (12) for a twelve (12) hour scheduled shift and for continuous hours worked beyond twenty four (24) hours when the flight nurse is in flight status. This includes time to complete all aspects of the mission including but not limited to charting. Sick leave paid for will not count toward the calculation of overtime. The straight time hourly rate of pay used for the calculation of overtime shall include all differentials and premiums that are considered part of the employee's regular rate of pay. Under the KRONOS system, overtime will be triggered and compensated to the nearest minute beyond a seven (7) minute grace period before/after a scheduled shift. As an option to wage payment above, an employee may request to accrue compensatory time on the basis of one and one-half (1 \u00bd) the amount of overtime worked, or double time for registered nurses as appropriate. The Employer will allow the accrual of up to forty (40) hours of compensatory time calculated on a rolling basis. The Employer will consider special circumstances when deciding whether or not to grant the accrual of compensatory time in excess of forty (40) hours (e.g. advanced knowledge that an employee will be taking a long-term leave in the near future and the accrued time would be used to cover for all or part of that leave). This is not intended to upset any formal department policies regarding the accrual and use of compensatory time that exceed this unless there is agreement to do so. Accrued compensatory time will be scheduled off in a manner similar to the scheduling of vacation days requested off. Sick call coverage at designated bases will be offered based upon desired crew skill mix, to the official duty station nurses first then if they remain uncovered will be offered to other duty station nurses for coverage. - Compensatory Time Cash Out: If compensation is paid to an employee for accrued compensatory time, such compensation shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the employee receives such payment. All compensatory time must be used by June 30th of each year. The employee's compensatory time balance will be cashed out every June 30th or when the employee leaves University employment for any reason. The employee's compensatory time balance may be cashed out when the employee: - Transfers to a position in their department with different funding sources or, - Transfers to a position in another department. Sick call coverage at designated bases will be offered based upon desired crew skill mix, to the official duty station nurses first then if they remain uncovered will be offered to other duty station nurses for coverage. - Work Schedule. The Employer shall plan and post the work schedule. The work schedule will be posted at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the schedule. Schedule requests should be submitted at least four weeks before the schedule is posted. Prior to the schedule being posted, factors such as staff requests, unexpected leaves of absence or terminations may affect the approval of schedule requests. After the schedule is posted an individual employee's schedule may be changed only by mutual agreement between the supervisor and employee concerned. Should the Employer propose changing either the length of the schedule or work day, the Employer will comply with the requirements of, \"Change in Working Conditions,\" contained in this Article. - Weekends. Weekend scheduling will be done in accordance with current practice. Weekend premium will be based on a majority of hours worked over the weekend period (e.g. - a nurse who works a twenty-four (24) hour shift beginning at 7:00am on Friday will receive no weekend premium. A nurse who works a twenty-four (24) hour shift beginning at 7:00am on Saturday or Sunday morning will receive weekend premium for twenty-four (24) hours). - Work in Advance of Shift. When an employee at the request of the Employer reports for work in advance of the assigned shift and continues working through the entire scheduled shift all hours worked prior to the scheduled shift shall be paid at the appropriate overtime rate. 47.17 Change in Working Conditions. The Employer will give the Union notice and opportunity to bargain the impact of any change in working conditions including, but limited to, crew skill mix, team configuration, or mode of transportation. The Employer will make a good faith effort to discuss potential changes in working conditions at a JLM prior to notifying the Union. 47.18 Sick Leave Usage for Travel. Nurses may use sick leave to account for travel time for medical appointments/procedures that require the nurse to leave the nurse's home area. To use sick leave the travel time must overlap with the nurse's regularly scheduled work. Nurses will make a good faith effort not to schedule medical appointments/procedures after the work schedule has been posted. 47.19 Union Delegates. Union delegates are Airlift Northwest employees who are members of the bargaining units. The Employer recognizes the right of the Union to designate one union delegate from each Base and an additional delegate for the Seattle Base. A Union delegate who is a bargaining unit employee and is processing a grievance in accordance with the Grievance Procedure shall be permitted reasonable time to assist in the resolution of recognized employee grievances on the Employer's property without loss of pay or recorded work time. Time off for processing grievances which have been filed shall be granted to a Union delegate by supervision following a request but in consideration of any job responsibilities. If permission for time off cannot be immediately granted, the supervisor will arrange for time off at the earliest possible time thereafter or the Employer and Union representative may provide for a Union delegate outside the area of jurisdiction to assist in the Grievance Process. The Union shall prevail upon all employees in the bargaining units and especially Union delegates to make a diligent and serious attempt to resolve complaints at the lowest possible level. The Employer, likewise, shall prevail upon its supervisory personnel to cooperate fully with the Union delegates and other Union representatives in the speedy resolution of any grievances that may arise. Delegates will normally process grievances only in their own base. The Union shall annually submit an up-to-date list to the Office of Labor Relations indicating the names of all Union delegates, their work locations and jurisdiction.

Employees will be made aware of open ALNW positions prior to making those positions known to external to ALNW candidates. Employees will be made aware of the location of the base, as well as the FTE needed for that base. When selecting between internal candidates, if all other qualifications are considered equal, Seniority (first by Base and then by length of unbroken service with ALNW) shall be the determining factor on a transfer to a different shift or section providing skill, competence, ability, experience are considered equivalent. Such a transfer may be delayed until the vacancy created by the transfer is replenished, if a nurse's vacancy of their position will unduly impact the operations of the base they are leaving. All ALNW nurse job openings will be emailed internally two (2) weeks prior to being posted externally. If the internal transfer is requested by a nurse prior to completion of their commitment, initial moving cost incentive will be paid back at a prorated amount based on the amount of the commitment that was completed as long as the nurse has completed at least eighteen (18) months of the commitment. ALNW will make every best faith effort to make the internal transfer within six (6) months, but such internal transfer may take up to nine months to occur. 47.25 Service Commitment.

Appendix VIII - PA-ARNP New Hire Wages All employment application resumes are reviewed for consideration of all applicable educational background and work experience. Equal or similar education and work experience criteria will apply for both PA and NP positions to determine wage steps. A new grad PA or NP without related health care experience would normally be set at step A. A PA or NP with PA or NP work experience would be given one-one credit: years experience equal wage step. Additional related health care experience (as described below) may be given credit. The resume is reviewed to determine the amount of credit, if any, that will be included when making the employment offer. Having a Masters or Doctorate degree which enhances function as a provider at the academic medical center would allow for one extra step for a Masters and two steps for a Doctorate on the salary range. Step setting for ARNP/PA with background in nursing: The candidate's experience would be evaluated at the appropriate RN step and then placed on the step that most closely aligns to the PA-ARNP range without a reduction. From there, ARNP/PA experience would be calculated. Related health care experience. Work experience that is calculated when making an offer is assessed from an individual's resume. Below are several types of work experience that will be granted consideration when making an offer to a prospective HMC employee. - Military (medic, corpsman, pararescuemen, etc.) All positions typically would receive one step for every two years of experience. - Emergency medicine (EMT, paramedic, emergency department technician, etc.) One (1) step for every two (2) years of experience for paramedics. Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) experience, depending on scope of work as outlined in the resume may be given credit typically up to one (1) step for every four (4) years of experience. - Nursing (registered nurse, license practical nurse, certified nursing assistant, etc.) LPN experience is credited at two years to one year on the RN scale and is added to the calculation of RN experience. Once placed on the RN scale, their experience is aligned to the steps on the PA-ARNP scale and all relevant PA-ARNP experience is then added on the PA-ARNP scale. - Certified Medical Assistant - Under very limited circumstances, the MA may receive credit for time worked, partial credit may be granted at a ratio of four (4) years of experience for one step. - Community health aid/practitioner (CHA/CHP): A certified CHA would be granted credit at a rate less than one year for every two (2) years of experience. - Mental health practitioner: experience may be granted at a rate of less than one (1) year for every two (2) years worked as an MHP. - International medical graduates: Credit at a rate greater than one (1) step for every two (2) years, depending on the experience and location of the candidate's work in the practicing country. - Laboratory/medical technician: under certain circumstances could receive partial credit for time worked, depending on the credential and work history. - Radiology technologist, Respiratory therapist, CT, Nuclear Med, or Ultrasound: - Clinical research: depending on the candidate's role in clinical research, credit may or may not be given. - Chiropractor: research into the position and provider's education would occur prior to setting a salary. Nursing Recruitment's goal when setting a new hire's salary is to fairly compensate the candidate for applicable past experience while also balancing the equity of all the healthcare specialists already employed. If there are any questions on a resume regarding experience, the nurse recruiter follows up with the candidate. It is the candidate's responsibility to ensure their submitted resume is complete and comprehensive; if experience is omitted, it cannot be counted.
