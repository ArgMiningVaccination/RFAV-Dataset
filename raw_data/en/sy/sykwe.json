Rite Aid is proud to play a role in helping protect you and your community. We want your experience to be as quick and comfortable for you as possible.

You can still get a vaccine if you do not have ID or insurance. Side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine such as pain, discomfort, fever, or itchiness are normal. Your Rite Aid pharmacist can help answer any questions about your COVID-19 vaccination or products that can relieve symptoms. Call your doctor if redness or tenderness in the injection area worsens after 24 hours, or if side effects last more than a few days. If you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction, seek immediate medical care by calling 911.

Check in at the store's designated COVID-19 vaccination area. We ask that you do not check in until 5 minutes before your scheduled appointment. Remember to wear your mask and maintain social distancing during your appointment and for the duration of your time in the store! Be sure to eat a nutritious meal and hydrate before your appointment to potentially lessen any side effects on the day of your vaccination. An important note about over-the-counter pain relievers: Please do not take pain relievers for the purpose of preventing vaccine side effects before your appointment as it may impact the effectiveness of the vaccine. You will need to remain in a waiting area for 15 minutes after you receive the vaccine so we can monitor you for rare potential allergic reactions to the vaccine.
