These Clinical Recommendations are intended for use only as a tool to assist clinicians and health care professionals and should not be used to replace clinical judgment. Adherence to these Clinical Recommendations will no t ensure successful treatment in every situation. Furthermore, these Clinical Recommendations should not be interpreted as setting a standard of care or be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care nor exclusive of other methods of care re asonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding th e appropriateness of any specific therapy and monitoring must be made by the clinician and the patient in light of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient, and the known variability and biological pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease. These Clinical Recommendations also are not inte nded to serve as a basis to approve or deny financial coverage for any specific therapeutic or diagnostic modality. The NSTC has based its recommendations on the evidence available in the literature and the expert opinion of the authors at the time of this Clinical Recommendations publication. These Clinical Recommendations reflect the best available data and expert opinion at the time the document wa s prepared. The results of future studies and evolution of expert opinion may result in revisions to the Clinical Recommendations to reflect new data and the publication will be updated accordingly.

incidence rate of active tuberculosis (TB) disease in the United States is decreasing gradually, recently by 1. 3% per year. However, an estimated 13 million persons in the United States have latent TB infection (LTBI) and face a lifelong threat of active TB diseas e, which treatment would prevent. For the United States to speed its progr ess toward eliminating TB requires prevention: interrupting exposures to c ontagious cases, investigating contacts, and treating those persons who are at risk of developing TB disease. LTBI testing and treatment is an essential component of prevention and elimination of TB in our communities that reduces the lifetime risk of TB for these patients and the future transmission of TB in the community. Historically, several barriers have blocke d the effective, widespread use of LTBI testing and treatment to prevent active TB disease. TB programs in state and local health departments have been unable to reach and treat many of the persons who are infected with TB. When testing for TB infection is possible, imprecise testing algorithms require treati ng many persons in order to prevent one case of active TB disease. When treatment for LTBI is possible, lengthy isoniazid regimens have poor completion rates and potentially serious isoniazid- associated adverse effects. Further comp licating these challenges, there have been misconceptions about TB testing and prevention in the general medical and patient communities. There are techniques and tools to overcome several of these barriers. Risk-based testing is used to prioritize those wh o might benefit from treatment. Newer, shorter rifamycin-based trea tment regimens have dramatically increased rates of treatment completion and decreased rates of serious adverse effects. However, reaching a greater proportion of persons wh o are infected has proven difficult for state and local health departments. Im proving TB prevention will depend on integrating it into primary health care and specialty medical care for persons with specific risk factors for TB, such as diabetes or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To promote these advances in TB prev ention and broaden the foundations of knowledge about LTBI testing and trea tment among health care providers throughout the United States, the National Society of Tuberculosis Clinicians has drawn upon published evidence and a netw ork of national experts to prepare practical guidance on diagnosing and treating LTBI. We developed Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States: Clinical Recommendations for community health care providers PREFACE Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | v and managers in diverse settings where TB prevention is not a primary focus, as well as for practitioners in state and local TB programs. Our recommendations include the latest information on assessi ng for TB risks, testing for infection, evaluating the patient, selecting a regi men, and monitoring treatment. This document serves as a companion to the national guidance on treatment regimens, \"Guidelines for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection: Recommendations from the National Tube rculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020.\" We also briefly introduc e nurse case management and provide resources for practitioners who want to learn more about it. Nurse case management is an effective strategy for integrating the multiple aspects of patient care and improving outcomes. It has been adopted in many state and local TB control programs and in other settings, such as health maintenance organizations, community health center s, and correctional facilities. We hope that Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States: Clinical Recommendations will inform and empower more health care providers to test more patients at ri sk for TB and to treat those with LTBI. With each patient who completes a course of LTBI therapy, we not only reduce the future risk of TB for that patient, bu t we also bring the United States closer to eliminating TB in our communities.

Testing for M. tuberculosis infection is indirect and base d on immune recall responses following prior sensitization to M. tuberculosis antigens. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tw o methods of immunologic testing for M. tuberculosis infection: interferon-gamma release assays ( IGRAs) and the tuberculin skin test (TST). GENERAL PRINCIPLES Follow these general principles when testing and interpreting tests for M. tuberculosis infection: \u00a1 Test only persons at increased risk for TB to minimize the number and proportion of positive test results that are false-positives, which can be expected from testing low-risk persons. (However, in some jurisdictions and institutions these tests may be required by law.) \u00a1 Select the optimal test for each patient. \u00a1 When interpreting test results for a diagnosis, consider patient-related and test-related variability factors. \u00a1 None of these tests is 100% sensitive or 100% specific: \u0017 People with active TB disease can have negative tests for infection. These tests should not be used to exclude active TB disease in someone with signs or symptoms consistent with active disease. \u0017 A positive test is not diagnostic of active TB disease in someone with signs or symptoms that are suggestive of active TB disease. A full clinical evaluation must be completed. \u00a1 None of these tests definitively predicts which persons with a positive result will develop active TB disease. \u00a1 During or after treatment, IGRA and TST results are not informative for monitoring response to treatment of LTBI or active TB disease and should not be used for this purpose. \u00a1 TST results can be expected to remain positive during and after treatment. Positive IGRA test results are less durable than positive TST results. CLINICAL BACKGROUND Review the information below to guide test selection and interpretation of results: 1. Test Descripti ons 2. Test Selection 3. Test Procedures and Interpretation 4. Next: Section 2: When to Test for LTBI RELATED TOPICS \u00a1 Section 2: When to Test for LTBI \u00a1 Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations WARNINGS \u00a1 Patients who have signs, symptoms, or findings suggestive of active TB disease should be evaluated with bacteriologic studies and other methods specific to the site of disease. \u00a1 Screen and test persons with an increased risk of TB, especially when there is also an increased risk of progression to active TB disease because of comorbidities. SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 3 TEST DESCRIPTIONS INTERFERON-GAMMA RELEASE ASSAYS The two IGRAs currently available fo r use in the United States are T T-SPOT\u00ae.TB (T- Spot) and Q QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), the fourth generation of this test. Both tests require heparin-antic oagulated whole blood. For each, the specimens must be collected and handled in strict accordance with the test's instructions. The IGRA antigens are designed to op timize test specificity. In these tests, synthetic polypeptide mixtures simulate proteins (antigens) that trigger sensitized T cells to release interferon- gamma. Each IGRA test runs two antigen mixtures simultaneously and includes a mitogen (positive) control and a nil (negative) control. In the positive cont rol, the mitogen triggers the release of interferon-gamma to confirm that the sa mple contains enough responsive T cells and that interferon-gamma can be released and detected during the test. The nil (negative) control adjusts for nonspeci fic background release of interferon- gamma and other factors. When interpreting the results, the nil (negative) control is subtracted from the unadjusted antigen response values for both tests. The nil (negative) control is also subtracted fr om the unadjusted mitogen response value for QFT-Plus but not for T-Spot. For test specificity, the IGRA antigens were selected because they are not found in bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), a live vaccin e against TB that is administered at birth or during childhood in many coun tries but not in the United States. The IGRA antigens also do not match antigens from the majority of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. However, the IGRA antigen mixtures szulgai , so infection with one of these organisms can cause po sitive IGRA results. Additionally, a positive T-Spot result was repo rted for one patient with M. xenopi infection. The IGRA antigens match antigens from M. leprae , but depending on the form of leprosy, the altered immunity from th at disease can confound the results. TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST Two tuberculin-purified protein derivative (PPD) solutions are FDA approved for use in skin testing: Aplisol\u00ae and T Tubersol\u00ae. In a TST, 0.10 ml of antigen solution is injected intradermally. The in durated reaction at the injection site is measured by palpation at the transverse axis of th e arm after 48 to 72 hours and interpreted using cut-points established for different populations. The tuberculin PPD solution contains an tigenic compounds, mostly proteins secreted by M. tuberculosis -complex organisms. They also match or resemble antigens from BCG and non-tuberculou s mycobacteria, which contributes to cross-sensitivity. SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 4 BCG vaccination and infectio n cause false-positive TST results in some recipients because of the shared antigens. The likelihood of a false-positive TST result increases with the number of BCG doses given and decreases with time after the BCG vaccination. Persons who were vaccin ated at birth are unlikely to have a false-positive TST result from BCG after 2 years of age. However, repeating TSTs can cause sustained BCG-associated false-positive TST results. IGRA results are not affected by BCG vaccination. Infections with common non-tube rculous mycobacteria, such as M. avium, also can cause false-positive TST results. Asymptomatic infections with these mycobacteria are common, especially in persons from rural areas or tropical countries. IGRAs are not affected by this cross-reactivity except with M. kansasii , , and M. which be pathogenic and can cause false-positive IGRA and TST results. TEST SELECTION In current diagnostic guidelines, IGRAs are generally preferred, but the TST is acceptable. Refer to Table 1 for a comparison of the IGRA and TST. In choosing which test to use, consider the patient's hi story of BCG, age, and ability to return for a second appointment. IGRAs offer gr eater specificity than a TST in persons who were BCG vaccinated or who ha ve non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. For this reason, IGRAs are preferred for most non-US-born patients who received, or may have received, BCG vaccination. For other persons, either a TST or IGRA can be used dependin g on test availability and cost. BCG VACCINATION POLICIES BY COUNTRY Most people born outside of the United States have received BCG vaccination. To review the current and past national vaccination policy of a specific country, the BCG World Atlas offers a convenient way to find the information online at http://bcgatlas.org/index.php IGRAs and TST have similar sensitivity for diagnosing infection in clinical studies among patients who have culture-confirmed active TB disease, and this similarity is assumed to extend to patients with LTBI, that is, with TB infection that has not progressed to active TB disease. In studie s directly comparing the IGRA tests and TST, discordance of results is common . The most common pattern of discordance is a positive TST result with a negative IG RA result. This disc ordance is partially attributable to the known effects of BCG va ccination on test results, but it has not been fully explained by studies to date. SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 5 For the pediatric use of IGRAs, relatively few infants and toddlers were included in the early studies of these tests. The rates of indeterminate or invalid results were greater in younger age groups in some studies, and the reliability of negative results was unconfirmed, leading to in itial hesitation in adopting IGRAs in pediatrics. That opinion may be changing as findings from recent studies and general experience with IGRAs have been favorable. Some experts now prefer IGRAs over TST for testing all BCG-va ccinated children, regardless of age. However, 2016 Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention (CDC) guidance lists TST as the preferred test for healthy ch ildren aged <5 years, and 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics guidance lists TST as the preferred test for children aged <2 years. In FDA-approved labeling, QFT- Plus has not been extensively evaluated in persons aged <17 years, and T-Spot has not been adequately evaluated in persons aged <2 years. Pregnant women have not been included in high enough numbers in studies of IGRAs for QFT-Plus or T-Spot labeling to advise on the use of these tests during pregnancy. No evidence has accumulate d for a preference between TST and IGRAs during pregnancy, and eith er test can be used when testing is indicated by risk for infection or progression. IGRAs may be preferred for testing women who were born in countries with systematic BCG vaccination or who might not return for the reading of a skin test. Skin testing requires two health care a ppointments: the first to administer the test and the second to measure the reacti on. IGRAs are preferred for persons who would have difficulty returning for a second appointment. Table 1.

In direct patient-by- patient comparisons of T-Spot and pr evious generations of QuantiFERON, concordance of results was moderate, wi thout clear patterns that would explain discordant results. The IGRA selection can be made based on convenience, cost, turn-around-time, customer service, dependability, and fa miliarity. An excess of unexplained indeterminate (QFT-Plus) or invalid (T-Spo t) results or test wastage because of specimen handling errors may indicate a need to switch between products for operational reasons or to investigate an d correct the causes of these issues. IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS Both of the general test methods, TST and IGRAs, depend on intact immunity for positive results. Immunosuppression can ca use false-negative results from either test method. Neither method used alon e is superior for testing immuno- suppressed patients. However, dual testing with TST and an IGRA simultaneously increases the overall sensitivity for in fection. With human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the likelihood of false-negative results from TST and IGRAs increases progressively with decrea sing CD4 <600/mm3. The rates of false- negative results with other immunosuppressive conditions are less well known. DUAL TESTING Simultaneous testing with a TST and an IGRA can increase overall sensitivity for M. tuberculosis infection, with a probable loss of specificity. When seeking increased sensitivity, this strategy can be useful, and a positive result from either test is taken as evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Dual testing should not be routine, but it may be considered for patients when there is concern about their ability to mo unt a strong immune response to a test, for persons who are at risk of severe form s of TB disease, or for persons in whom TB infection is strongly suspected becaus e of exposure risks or symptomatology. Children aged <2 years old can be included in a dual testing strategy if one of the above circumstances is present. SERIAL TESTING When serial or periodic testing is required, as with some health care personnel at ongoing risk for TB exposure, either an IGRA or the TST may be used. For TST testing, the initial test should be a two-s tep TST. Because IGRAs do not cause boosting, serial testing with IGRAs does not require two-step testing to establish a baseline. SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 7 Positive TST results persist indefinitely on retesting for the majority of persons. However, in some persons who were infected with M. tuberculosis in the remote past and had no further exposure to TB, waning sensitivity can lead to a false- negative TST result. In such instances, an initial TST with a negative result can invoke an immune memory response so that a repeat TST, as soon as 1 to 2 weeks or as late as a year afterwards, would have a positive result, which is referred to as boosting . For persons who will be tested repeatedly (for example, in serial testing), who have an initial negati ve test, and who have not been tested in more than 1 year, two-step testing is us ed to distinguish between boosting and a positive TST result from recent M. tuberculosis infection. LOW-RISK PERSONS When persons at low risk for TB infection or active TB disease are required to be tested by law or for other reasons, use eith er an IGRA or TST. If the result is positive, perform a second test with the same or a different method to confirm the test result. Using an IGRA first avoids the potential complication of skin test boosting from testing first with a TST. TIMING WITH LIVE VIRUS VACCINATION Due to the concern that live virus vacc ines may impair immune responses, when both the MMR vaccine and a TB test ar e indicated, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends the following: \u00a1 Administer the TST or IGRA simultaneously with the live vaccine (preferred scenario). \u00a1 If a TST or IGRA has already been administered, a live vaccine can be administered at any time >1 day after the administration of the TB test. \u00a1 If a live vaccine has already been administered, wait at least 28 days before administering a TST or IGRA. In two-step testing, wait at least 28 days after the live vaccine is administered before administering the first TST. Contin ue from there to complete the two-step testing. Wait to administer any additional doses of live vaccine until after the second TST is measured. For more informat ion on live virus vaccines, refer to the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization. TIMING WITH COVID-19 VACCINATION The CDC has issued national guidance on th e timing of IGRAs, TSTs, and COVID-19 vaccinations. As this guidance may ch ange when new vaccines and data are available, please refer to the NTCA COVD-19 Web page for current guidance: http://www.tbcontrollers.o rg/resources/tb-and-covid-19/ SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 8 TEST PROCEDURES AND INTERPRETATION T-SPOT\u00ae.TB The FDA-approved labeling of T-Spot provid es this advisory on using the T-Spot: \"Diagnosing or excluding tuberculosis di sease, and assessing the probability of LTBI, requires a combination of epid emiological, historical, medical and diagnostic findings that should be taken into account...\" Currently this test is run at two main laboratories in the United States, with a uniform laboratory report. During the test, white blood cells are se parated from the whole blood sample, washed, and resuspended to a defined range of cell counts. The white cell suspension is transferred to test wells for incubating with the nil (negative) control, two antigen mixtures labele d Panel A and Panel B, and the mitogen (positive) control. During incubation, each cell that releases interferon-gamma is bound to a matrix, where a reaction creates a dye spot. The spots in each well are machine counted, and then a technician in spects all tests with positive results and tests meeting other criteria. The spot counts for the Panel A and the Panel B antigen wells are adjusted by subtracting the count for the nil well, and the results are derived from the test kit algor ithm. For more information on how to interpret T-Spot results, see Appendix 1: T-SPOT\u00ae.TB Test. Positive Result If the spot count in the Panel A or the Panel B antigen well or both is t8 after subtracting the spots in the nil (negativ e) control well, the result is positive, regardless of the response to mitogen. Th is is evidence of TB infection, and it should be followed by further examination to exclude the possibility of active TB disease. Negative Result If the spot count in the Panel A and the Panel B antigen well is <5 each after adjusting for the spots in the nil (negat ive) control well, and the response to the mitogen (positive) control is t20 spots, the result is negative. This is evidence of no TB infection; however, see warnings that negative results cannot exclude LTBI or active TB disease. Borderline (Equivocal) Result T-Spot is the only test for infection with a results category of borderline (equivocal). If the spot count in either the Panel A or the Panel B antigen well is 5, 6, or 7 after subtracting the spot count in the nil (negative) control well, and the adjusted spot count for both antigen wells is <8, the result is borderline (equivocal), regardless of the response to mitogen. SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 9 After a borderline (equivocal) result, another T-Spot or a different test can be done. Alternatively, if the likelihood of infection is low, the clinician can decide that the initial result is evidence of no infection, or, if the likelihood of infection is high or the hazards of a missed TB diagnosis are substantial, the initial result can be regarde d as evidence of infection. Invalid Result The T-Spot result is designated as invalid primarily for one of two conditions: a mitogen (positive) control response <20 spots when the response in each antigen well is <5 sp ots after correcting for the count in the nil (negative) well; or a nil (negative) control count >10 spots, regardless of the responses to antigens and mitogen. Rarely, the result can be declared invalid for background staining that hinders counting the spots. After an invalid result, another T-Spot or a different test is recommended. Note: Immunosuppression, especially in volving cellular immunity, can lead to a spot count <20 in the mitogen well and thus an invalid result. However, a response >20 spots is not assurance that a negative result is reliable for excluding TB infection in a pati ent who is immunosuppressed. With immunosuppression, the possibility of false-negative results should be considered, regardless of the response to mitogen. Cancelled Test The specimen can be rejected or the test can be cancelled because of administrative errors, specimen stor age or transportation outside the recommended temperature ranges, arrival at the laboratory beyond the approved time limits, and insufficient quantity of blood or other blood problems such as clotting. Rarely, a second specimen of greater volume could be needed because of insufficient white blood cells in the initial specimen. Refer to the Test Variability topic at the end of this section. QUANTIFERON\u00ae-TB GOLD PLUS The FDA-approved labeling provides this advisory on using QFT-Plus: \"QFT-Plus is an indirect test for M. tuberculosis infection (including disease) and is intended for use in conjunction with risk assessm ent, radiography, and other medical and diagnostic evaluations...\" QFT-Plus can be run in any laboratory with capacity for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Numerous hospitals, free- standing clinical laboratories, and contract laboratories offer QFT-Plus. Clinicians need to be familiar with th e submission requirements of the laboratory where their QFT-Plus is run. Bl ood can be collected into a single heparinized tube SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 10 and transferred to the four QFT-Plus blood co llection tubes, or it can be collected directly into the QFT-Plus tubes. The QFT-Plus tubes are part of the test kit. During the test, whole blood is incubated in the QFT-Plus tubes: a nil (negative) control, an antigen (TB1) tube containi ng peptide mixtures simulating two specific M. tuberculosis antigens, an antigen (TB2) tube containing the same mixtures plus peptides intended to stimula te CD8+ cells, and a mitogen (positive) control. After centrifuging, the plasma fr om each tube is collected for measuring the concentration of interferon-gamma by colorimetric ELISA. The interferon- gamma concentration of the TB1, the TB 2, and the mitogen (positive control) tubes are adjusted by subtracting the conc entration in the nil (negative control) tube, and the results are derived fr om the test kit algorithm. For more information how to interpret QFT-Plus results, see Appendix 1: QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold Plus Test. The calculations and readout are automated in many laboratories. The format of QFT-Plus laboratory reports is not standardized between laboratories. Clinicians need to be fami liar with the reporting formats of the laboratory where their QFT-Plus is run. QFT-Plus results are reported as \"Negative,\" \"Positive,\" or \"Indeterminate, \" but clinicians should become familiar with the quantitative/numerical ranges of the test and insist on these values in the laboratory reports. Positive Result If the interferon-gamma concentration from TB1, TB2, or both, minus the interferon-gamma concentration from the nil (negative) control, is t0.35 IU/ml and t25% of the interferon-gamma concentration from the nil control, the result is positive, regard less of the response in the mitogen (positive) control. A positive QFT-Plus result is evidence of infection with M. tuberculosis and should be followed by furt her examination for active TB disease. Note: The comparison between the resp onses from the two tubes cannot be used to distinguish LTBI from active TB disease. Negative Result If the interferon-gamma concentrations from TB1 and TB2, after subtracting the concentration from the nil (negative) control, both meet the criteria of <0.35 IU/ml or t0.35 IU/ml but <25% of the interferon-gamma concentration from the nil control, and the interferon-gamma concentration from the mitogen (positive) control, after subt racting the concentration from the nil control, is t0.50, the result is negative. This is evidence of no TB infection. However, per the FDA-approved labe ling: \"A negative QFT-Plus result does not preclude the possibility of M. tuberculosis infection or TB disease: false- negative results can be due to stage of infection (for example, when a SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 11 specimen is obtained prior to the development of cellular immune response), co-morbid conditions that affect immune function, incorrect handling of the blood collection tube s following venipuncture, incorrect performance of the assay, or other individual immunological variables.\" Indeterminate Result The QFT-Plus result is designated as indeterminate for either of two sets of criteria: (1) the interferon-gamma co ncentration from the mitogen tube minus the concentration from the nil tu be is <0.5 IU/ml in the absence of responses for a positive result from TB1 or TB2; or (2) an interferon-gamma concentration from the nil tube >8.0 IU/ml, regardless of concentrations from any other tubes. An indeterminate result could be caused by patient factors or problems at any stage of the testing. It does not have a clinical interpretation. The test should be repeated with a new specimen , or a different test should be done. Note 1: For healthy persons, a typica l interferon-gamma concentration from the nil tube is 0.00 to 0.05 IU/ml. Al though the manufacturer-defined upper limit is 8.0 IU/ml before the result is declared indeterminate, concentrations >0.10 IU/ml should raise concerns a bout problems with blood collection, storage, or shipment. Note 2: Immunosuppression, especia lly involving cellular immunity, can lead to an interferon-gamma concentration from the mitogen tube, minus the concentration from the nil tube, <0.50 IU/ml, which is defined as an indeterminate QFT-Plus result, unless criteria are met for a positive result. However, a mitogen response (corre cted for nil) >0.50 IU/ml is not assurance that a negative result is reliab le for excluding TB infection in this scenario. With immunosuppression, the possibility of false-negative results should be considered, regardless of the response to mitogen. Cancelled Test The routine causes of cancelled tests ar e administrative errors in labeling or specimen storage and delivery times later than the limits set by the manufacturer or the laborat ory. Tests also can be cancelled for insufficient volume or clotted blood. Refer to the Test Variability topic at the end of this section. SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 12 TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST Persons who administer and read TSTs should have specific training to be qualified to do so. In the second appoin tment 48 to 72 hours after the injection, the indurated reaction at the injection si te (not the redness) is palpated then measured across its transverse diameter. Test readings outside of the defined time interval are not supported by clinical studies and do not have standard interpretations. The measurements are in terpreted using cut-points established for different populations. For more inform ation on interpreting TST results, see Appendix 1: Tuberculin Skin Test. Positive Result The indurated reaction (induration inst ead of redness) at the TST site is measured in the transverse axis of (a cross) the arm 48 to 72 hours after administration, and the reading is risk stratified by patient group. (See Appendix 1.) The risk stratification is a method of adjusting the test sensitivity and specificity based on di fferences in risk for infection and progression among individuals. A positi ve TST result is evidence of infection, either LTBI or active TB dise ase. It should be followed by further examination for active TB disease. Note: Some experts recommend performing a confirmatory IGRA when a patient has a positive TST result and no known risk for TB exposure or history of BCG vaccination. The role of IGRA in confirming a positive TST result in persons with known TB e xposure has not been established by studies. Negative Result An indurated reaction smaller than a cu t-point on the risk stratification is read as a negative result. This is eviden ce of absence of infection. However, a negative TST result cannot fully exclude M. tuberculosis infection. A negative result should be disregarded in persons who have signs, symptoms, or diagnostic findings sugge stive of active TB disease. False- negative results are more likely when testing persons who have compromised or suppressed immunity. Note: TST results are false-negative in up to 20% of patients with active pulmonary TB disease at the time of di agnosis and 40% of patients with TB meningitis. False-negative results are common in patients with compromised or suppressed immunity. The use of skin test controls (diluted tetanus toxoid, for example) is not recommended because it does not improve the reliability of a negativ e tuberculin PPD skin test result. SECTION 1: IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS FOR TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 13 Tuberculin Skin Test Boosting, Two-Step Testing, and Serial Testing For an explanation of boosting and the use of two-step testing to distinguish between boosting and a positive TST result from new M. tuberculosis infection, see the Test Selection: Serial Testing topic above. Although boosting may be attributed to infection in the remote past, it is also epidemiologically associated with BCG vaccination and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Therefore, the interpretat ion of boosting for the diagnosis of LTBI requires assessing the likelihood of M. tuberculosis infection from a history of exposure risks. Two-step testing is not recommended for routine diagnosis of LTBI. TEST VARIABILITY When interpreting test results, consider the sources of variability for the test chosen. For IGRAs, factors related to the patient and test can cause variability with results, especially when the response to an antigen is near a defining cut-point. Specimen collection and handling and laboratory step s of the IGRA test pose other potential sources of variability. For the TST, factors related to the patient and test, such as cross-reactivity with BCG, can cause variability with results. Other sources of TST variability involve errors in technique. Incorrect injection of the antigen solution can cause false- negative results. Incorrect interpretation of the reaction can cause either false- positive or false-negative results. The tu berculin PPD solutions can be inactivated by incorrect storage of the reagent vial or by keeping the solution drawn up in a syringe for too long. Confusion between reagent vials has led to the inadvertent administration of the wrong antigen, such as tetanus toxoid, causing clusters of false-positive results. THE ONLINE TST/IGRA INTERPRETER This tool from McGill University may be useful for evaluating a specific person. You can access this guide at http://www.tstin3d.com/en/calc.html . However, take into consideration the following limitations of this assess ment tool (version 3.0). It tends to overestimate risks of treatment beca use it considers the rate of side effects only for 9 months of isoniazid; it does not consider a negative IGRA result if a TST is also done in determining probability of a true positive TST; and it does not calculate lifetime risk of disease beyond age 80.

Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommen dations | February 2021 | 15 Section 2: When to Test for Latent Tuberculosis Infection SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 16 OVERVIEW Approximately 80% of active TB disease in the United States is a result of the reactivation of LTBI, making greater implemen tation of testing and treatment for LTBI crucial to progress toward eliminating TB in the United States. To find persons with LTBI, screening for TB risk factors for infe ction and progression to active TB disease should be incorporated into primary health care for all persons. Patients with risk factors should be tested for TB and treated if they have LTBI. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Follow these principles when assessing risk for TB disease and testing for LTBI: \u00a1 Assess TB risk at least once. All adults and children should receive an assessment of TB risk factors at least once as part of routine primary care. At subsequent preventive health visits, screen persons for new risk factors that might have arisen since the previous screening. \u00a1 Do not conduct routine testing of low-risk populations, defined as persons with no known risks for exposure or progression to TB disease. Testing low-risk persons can result in unnecessary evaluations and treatment because of false-positive test results. \u00a1 Testing only persons at risk can simplify decisions regarding treatment because most persons with a risk factor and a positive TB test result should be treated for LTBI. \u00a1 When a person who previously had a negative TB test result has new risk factors since the last test, repeat the TB test. In general, retest with the same assay as used for the first test. Examples of new risk fact ors include the following events and conditions: \u00a1 New close contact to a patient with infectious TB disease \u00a1 Residence or travel in a high-incidence country for an extended time (>1 month) \u00a1 New or anticipated immunosuppressive therapy CLINICAL BACKGROUND Review the information below to guide risk assessment and testing for LTBI: 1.

SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 17 PERSONS AND POPULATIONS TO TEST LTBI testing should be conducted for person s with the following risk factors: \u00a1 Birth or residence in a country with a high or medium incidence rate of TB, regardless of year of arrival These countries include most countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Pacific Islands, and Eastern Europe. Refer to Table 2: Countries with High or Medium Tuberculosis Incidence Rate. \u00a1 Close contact to someone with infectious TB disease \u00a1 Immunosuppression, current or pplanned This includes HIV infection; organ or treatment mg/day for month), or other immunosuppressive medication. \u00a1 Other medical conditions or social circumstances that meet criteria in state or local recommendations, such as homelessness, incarceration, or occupational risk of TB When setting TB testing policies, check wi th state or local TB control programs for recommendations and consider information about local epidemiology, regulations, legal mandates, and patient populations. TUBERCULOSIS RISK ASSESSMENT Designed to be used among all patients and consistent with guidelines, a simplified assessment of TB risk can help to incorporate TB prevention into routine primary care. The California Tuberculosis Risk Assessment was developed jointly by the Tuberculosis Control Branch at the Ca lifornia Department of Public Health, the California Tuberculosis Controllers Association, and the Curry International Tuberculosis Center to help clinicians select adults for LTBI testing who are at high risk for TB exposure or progression to TB disease. To access the tool and more informati on about its use, see th e Curry International Tuberculosis Center product Web page: http://www.currytbcenter.ucsf.edu/products /view/california-tuberculosis-risk- assessment . SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 18 Table 2. Countries with High or Medium Tuberculosis Incidence Rate TB Incidence Rate Comparison TB incidence rate per 100,000 person years High incidence countries (estimated) >100/100,000 Medium incidence countries (estimated) 10-100/100,000 United States (2019, reported) 2.7/100,000 Most Common Countries of Origin for Non-US-born Persons Diagnosed with Active TB Disease in the United States Among persons in the United States with active TB disease who were non-US born, the most common countries of birth were Mexico, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, and China. The TB incidence rates in 2019 in those countries were estimated by the World Health Organization to be \u0017 Mexico: (Medium) Persons who were born in, or resided in, these countries should be tested at least once regardless of how long they have resided in the United States. Sources: For more information, refer to the World Health Organization's TB country profiles: https://www.who.int/teams/global -tuberculosis-programme/data States - 2019\": https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/vo lumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6911a3-H.pdf SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 19 RECENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Recent TB infection is a significant risk fa ctor for progression to active TB disease. Recent infection is defined as any of the following: \u00a1 Newly positive TST or IGRA result in a person who had close contact with a patient with active infectious TB disease within the prior 2 years or other circumstances suggesting recent exposure: For more information, see the Contact with a Person with Infectious Tuberculosis Disease topic below. \u00a1 Positive TST or IGRA result in a ch ild aged <2 years: TST is recommended for testing children aged <2 years because of a lack of data on IGRAs in this age group, but in some situatio ns both the TST and an IGRA are done to increase sensitivity. For more information on using both the TST and an IGRA, see Section 1: Immunologic Tests for Tuberculosis Infection: Test Selection: Dual Testing. \u00a1 TB test conversion within the past 2 years with a confirmatory test for people with no known risk for TB exposure: A TST conversion is an increase in TST reaction by >10 mm from negative to positive in 2 years or less. An IGRA conversion is a change fr om negative to positive IGRA result in 2 years or less. CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS BIRTH OR RESIDENCE IN A COUNTRY WITH A HIGH OR MEDIUM INCIDENCE RATE Persons born in, or former residents of , countries with high TB rate TB rate person- years) have an increased risk of TB expo sure. The majority of persons with active TB disease in the United States were bor n in countries where TB is more common than the United States. The National TB Controllers Association (NTCA) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend testing all persons who were born in, or resided in, a country with higher TB incidence. Baseline testing should be performed regardless of how long persons have resided in the United States. For more in formation countries with elevated TB rates, see Table 2: Countries with High or Medium Tuberculosis Incidence Rate. SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 20 CONTACT WITH A PERSON WITH INFECTIOUS TUBERCULOSIS DISEASE Close contact to a person with infectious TB disease poses a risk of TB infection. If the contact was recent (within the last 2 years), there is an added risk of progression to active TB disease. Public health departments or infection c ontrol practitioners typically evaluate persons with recent contact as part of contact investigations. However, these investigations may miss some contacts, or the exposure may have occurred long ago when contact investigation was not commonly practiced (for example, when a household member was sick with or died from TB during a person's childhood). If possible, clarify that your patient's contact was close contact and that it was contact with a person with active infect ious TB disease, not LTBI. Ask for the name and age of the person with infectious TB disease. Especi ally if contact was recent, attempt to verify the exposure with the state or local TB program and obtain the drug susceptibility test resu lts of the index patient. For more information on the testing and treatment of contacts, see Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Recent Contacts to Persons with Infectious Tuberculosis Disease. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION Even in the absence of a specific know n risk factor for exposure to TB, test patients with current or planned i mmunosuppression that is likely to substantially elevate the risk of progressi on from latent infection to active TB disease. The following immunosuppressive co nditions typically el evate the risk of progression: \u00a1 HIV infection, especially in patients with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count <200 cells/mm3 or patients not ing antiretroviral therapy (ART) \u00a1 Treatment with anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive drugs such as anti-TNF-alpha agents and other biol ogic agents targeting specific elements of the immune system \u00a1 Treatment with long-term high-dose st eroids (equivalent of prednisone mg/kg/day, or mg/day for month) \u00a1 Cancer chemotherapy \u00a1 Solid organ or bone marrow transplantation For more information on persons with immunosuppression, see the Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations topics titled Persons with Comorbidities: Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Iatrogenic Immunosuppression. SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 21 OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Medical Conditions All persons should be assessed for their TB risks. Furthermore, the following medical conditions elevate the need fo r TB screening and LTBI diagnosis in persons with a history suggestive of TB exposure because they increase the rate of progression from LTBI to active TB lymphoma \u00a1 Cancer of head or Intestinal bypass or gastrectomy \u00a1 Chronic malabsorption \u00a1 Body mass index \u00a1 Current or former cigarette smoking Having one or more of these conditions without a history suggestive of TB exposure is not an independent reason for being tested for LTBI. However, testing for LTBI may be indicated for other reasons\u2014for example, infection control at a hemodialysis center or local epidemiology showing an association between a condition and LT BI or TB disease. TB prevention should be a part of routine care at spe cialty medical clinics where patients receive care for these conditions, su ch as occupational health clinics treating patients for silicosis. Age Younger persons have more years of expected life during which progression from latent infection to active TB di sease could occur. In addition, children aged <5 years are especially vulnerable to rapid progression to active TB disease if infected and are more like ly to develop life-threatening central nervous system or disseminated TB disease, while they tend to have fewer adverse drug effects with treatment for LTBI. As in adults, assess all children for TB risk factors. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published f four validated risk assessment questions for children in the 2018 edition of the Red Book\u00ae in Table 3.84: https://redbook.solutions.aap.org/c hapter.aspx?sectionid=189640207&boo kid=2205 (A subscription is required for access.) SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 22 The California Pediatric Tuberculosis Risk Assessment, a simple risk assessment tool, is available at no cost on the California Department of Public Health TB Control Branch's website: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs /CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Lib rary/TBCB-CA-Pediatric-TB-Risk-Assessment.pdf For more information on the testing and treatment of children, see Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Children. An upper age limit for testing has not been established. Test sensitivity with TST but not with IGRAs appears to decr ease with age greater than 60 years. Some experts consider testing (or not testing) elderly persons with TB risk to be appropriate depending on the individual patient's risk for progression to active TB disease (for example, immunosuppression) and life expectancy. Social Circumstances Persons who have a history of being ho meless or incarcerated or of being employed in a facility where these persons reside may have an increased risk of exposure to infectious TB. The USPSTF recommends testing and treating persons with these risk factors. Risk of exposure varies by specific faci lity and setting. Screening and testing programs may exist in specific facilities and settings such as screening in certain homeless shelters or correction al facilities. Local TB programs can confirm whether populations in congre gate settings (homeless shelters, for example) require testing. In addition, legal or regulatory requirements may mandate screening or testing among employees of these facilities. Substance use disorders also may be markers of exposure risk. TB transmission has been traced back to communal drug use (methamphetamines and crack cocaine, for example), and substance use is part of a group of social risks fo r TB transmission for some persons. SECTION 2: WHEN TO TEST FOR LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 23 HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL \"Tuberculosis Screening, Testing, and Tr eatment of U.S. Health Care Personnel: Recommendations from the National Tube rculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2019\" recommends the following TB pr evention measures for health care personnel (HCP): \u00a1 TB screening with an individual risk assessment and symptom evaluation upon hire \u00a1 TB testing with an IGRA or TST for persons without documented prior TB or LTBI \u00a1 Confirmatory testing for a positive resu lt: When there is a positive IGRA or TST result in an HCP without known e xposure, do a repeat test with the same or another test. If the second test re sult is positive, it is accepted as evidence of TB infection. \u00a1 No routine serial TB testing at any interval after baseline in the absence of a known exposure or ongoing transmission Exception: In settings where local ep idemiology and experience indicate that patients with undiagnosed active TB disease enter an institution, periodic testing may be practiced for HCP who take care of these patients during aerosol-generating procedures. \u00a1 Annual symptom screening fo r HCP with untreated LTBI \u00a1 Annual TB education for all HCP \u00a1 Strongly encouraged: Treatment for all HCP with untreated LTBI, unless treatment is contraindicated With overall decreasing incidence rates of TB in the United States and more effective infection control programs, HCP are not currently at increased risk for TB. However, some jurisdictions may have legal or regulatory requirements to test HCP, and the local TB epidemiology mi ght indicate the need for testing HCP.

Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommen dations | February 2021 | 25 Section 3: Pretreatment Clinical Evaluation SECTION 3: PRETREATMENT CLINICAL EVALUATION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 26 OVERVIEW A patient with a positive test result for TB infection should be evaluated for active TB disease before starting treatment for LTBI. To exclude active TB disease, the clinical evaluation should include a medical hi story, symptom review, focused physical examination, and chest radiography. Bacteriolo gic studies or other additional evaluation may be needed if indicated based on the init ial evaluation. Report persons with suspected active TB disease to the state or local TB program. GENERAL PRINCIPLES During the pretreatment clinical evaluation, the health care provider should take the following steps to decide whether to treat the patient for LTBI: \u00a1 Exclude active TB disease \u00a1 Confirm the diagnosis of untreated or inadequately treated LTBI \u00a1 Assess the risk of progression to active TB disease We recommend that patients at increased risk of developing active TB disease generally be treated for LTBI and followed until treatment is completed. CLINICAL EVALUATION COMPONENTS Review the following information concerning the essential components of clinical evaluation: 1. Medical History 2. Symptom Review 3. Focused Physical Examination 4. Chest Radiography 5. Bacteriologic Studies 6. Baseline Laboratory Tests 7. Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection 8. Next: Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen RELATED TOPICS \u00a1 Section 1: Immunologic Tests for TB Infection \u00a1 Section 2: When to Test for LTBI \u00a1 As needed, review Section 5: Children, Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, Postpartum, HIV Infection, Iatrogenic Immunosuppression, Liver Disease, Kidney Disease, Contacts, and Substance Use Disorder WARNINGS \u00a1 Do not treat for LTBI until active TB disease is excluded. \u00a1 Contact your state or local health department if you suspect that the patient has active TB disease. SECTION 3: PRETREATMENT CLINICAL EVALUATION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 27 MEDICAL HISTORY Pretreatment clinical evaluation includes a history with a focus on the following information: \u00a1 Positive test results for TB infection Review documentation of quantitativ e test results. For information on how to interpret test results, see Section 1: Immunologic Tests for Tuberculosis Infection. \u00a1 Medical history, including immunosuppressive conditions and medications \u00a1 History of TB exposure, including risk factors \u00a1 Risk of developing active TB disease Patients may be at increased risk of progression to active TB disease because of recent infection. In a ddition, some medical conditions can increase the risk of progression and pla ce patients at high priority for treatment of LTBI. Patients who were born in, or resided or travelled for >1 month in, countries with high or medium rates of TB should also be treated regardless of time in the United States. For more information on recent infection and medical conditions associated with increased risk of progression to TB disease, see Section 2: When to Test for Latent Tuberculosis Infection. Review Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations if your patient belongs to one of these groups: \u0017 Children \u0017 Pregnant, breastfeeding, or postpartum women \u0017 Recent contacts to infectious TB disease \u0017 Contacts to infectious, drug-resistant TB disease \u0017 with the following comorb idities: HIV infection, iatrogenic immunosuppression, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or substance use disorders \u00a1 History of prior treatment for TB or LTBI In general, a patient should be treated for LTBI only once. The health care provider should collect the following information on the patient's history of prior treatment for active TB disease or LTBI, obtaining documentation if possible: \u0017 Dates and duration of treatment \u0017 Mode of treatment administration : self-administered or directly observed SECTION 3: PRETREATMENT CLINICAL EVALUATION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 28 \u0017 History of adverse effects \u0017 Reasons for discontinuing treatment \u0017 For a patient who was in contact wi th an index patient with active TB disease, obtain when possib le the drug susceptibility test results for the index patient Obtain documentation of prior treatment for LTBI. Do not assume that it was completed. If the history of prio r treatment for LTBI is vague or unreliable and if the patient remains at risk of progression to active TB disease, consider recommending anot her course of LTBI treatment after excluding active TB disease. SYMPTOM REVIEW Assess for the following TB symptoms: \u00a1 Prolonged cough (>2-3 \u00a1 Night \u00a1 weight loss \u00a1 Loss of appetite \u00a1 Fatigue \u00a1 Chest pain \u00a1 Other symptoms or signs of ex trapulmonary TB, depending upon the site affected FOCUSED PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examine the oropharynx, neck, lungs, abdomen, and other organ systems depending upon the TB symptoms. Check e specially for enlarg ed lymph nodes. SECTION 3: PRETREATMENT CLINICAL EVALUATION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 29 CHEST RADIOGRAPHY All patients with TB infection should underg o a chest radiograph (CXR) as part of the evaluation. In the request for the study , alert the radiologist that the purpose is to check for TB disease. The CXR sho uld be interpreted with a high index of suspicion for TB, especially in patients who have TB symptoms or who were recently exposed. In persons with TB symptoms, a normal CXR does not rule out TB disease, especially in patients who are immunocompromised. Most experts recommend the following: \u00a1 For all patients: a posterior-anterior CXR. patients aged <5 years: order a lateral CXR in addition to the posterior-anterior CXR to screen for active TB disease. \u00a1 For patients with TB symptoms or patients who are immunocompromised: consider ordering a latera l CXR in addition to the posterior-anterior CXR to screen for active TB disease. \u00a1 For patients needing further evaluation for active TB disease: order additional views (apical lordotic or lateral decubitus, for example) or additional radiographic studies (such as a computed tomography scan) as needed. In general, most experts recommend that if a CXR was done in the 3 months prior to the medical evaluation, its findings were documented as normal, and the person is asymptomatic, then a repeat CXR is not necessary. If the previous study was not done as part of an examination for TB, then the study should be reviewed or repeated for the potential of a TB diagnosis. If an asymptomatic, pregnant woman has a po sitive TB test result, either IGRA or TST, she should receive a medical evaluati on, including a CXR with a lead shield. The CXR may be deferred until after the first trimester u unless she has one or more of the following: \u00a1 HIV or other immunosuppression \u00a1 History of recent contact with a person with infectious TB disease \u00a1 Documented TB infection test conv ersion in the past 2 years For all other asymptomatic patients with a positive TB test result, the CXR may be deferred to the second trimester. The CXR should not be deferred until peri- or post-partum. SECTION 3: PRETREATMENT CLINICAL EVALUATION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 30 BACTERIOLOGIC STUDIES Most patients evaluated for LTBI will not need these studies. If additional evaluation is needed, seek consultation fr om your state or local TB program or regional TB Center of Excellence and d etermine where to access the testing services described below in your community. For information on management of patients with an abnormal CXR while awaiting culture results, see Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Persons with Radiographic Findings of Previous or Inactive Tuberculosis. If the patient has pulmonary TB symptoms or physical or radiographic findings suspicious for active TB disease, obtain 2 to 3 sputa specimens for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture, including at least 1 early morning specimen and 1 specimen tested by nucleic acid amplificati on test (NAAT). If the patient has CXR abnormalities or pulmonary symptoms and is unable to expectorate sputum, collect specimens by sputum induction, ensu ring that airborne infection isolation precautions are observed during sputum collection. Order other bacteriologic studies as needed for extrapulmonary TB. If specimens are collected, do not start treatment for LTBI while culture results are pending. Seek consultation from your state or local TB program or regional TB Center of Excellence. Some patients may benefit from empiric treatment for active TB disease while AFB cultures are pending. The decision is based on the risk to the patient of disease progression and the risk to their contacts of TB transmission while waiting for cultures. The decision about empiric TB treatment should be made in consultation with the state or local TB program. For additional information about bacteriologic testing for TB , refer to links to references 2 and 5 below. BASELINE LABORATORY TESTS Baseline laboratory tests may be indicated in patients with certain medical conditions or who are being started on certain treatment regimens. Patients who do not know their HIV status should be offered testing for HIV infection. For more information on baseline laboratory studies, see Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen: Baseline Laboratory Tests. SECTION 3: PRETREATMENT CLINICAL EVALUATION Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommenda tions | February 2021 | 31 DIAGNOSIS OF LATENT TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION At the completion of pretreatment clinical evaluation, if a patient with a positive test result for TB infection does not ha ve any symptoms of TB, and the CXRs and other diagnostic tests results are normal, then active TB disease is excluded and LTBI is diagnosed. With this diagnosis, the patient should be considered for treatment for LTBI, and the next step is to decide whether to recommend LTBI treatment and to provide appropriate patient education based on the recommendations. For more information on treatment de cisions and patient education, see Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen. REFERENCES 1.

The clinician should decide in consultation with the pa tient whether to recommend LTBI treatment based on several factors, the most important of which is the patient's risk of developing active TB disease, from either risk of TB exposure or risk of progression to active TB disease. We recommend that patients at increased risk of developing active TB disease generally be treated for LTBI and followed until treatment is completed. Other factors to consider include the risk for drug toxicity, the patient's willingness to accept treatment, and the patient's likely adherence. Based on the re commendations, patient education should be provided. For patients at lower risk for active TB disease, who may have been tested for other reasons, treatment for LTBI may be recommended based on an individualized assessment of the risk of TB, the benefits and risks of treatment, and the patient's preference. GENERAL PRINCIPLES To ensure a patient-centered approach, these principles should be followed during the process of decision-making and preparing the patient to start a treatment regimen: \u00a1 Consult with the patient on the decisions whether to proceed with treatment and which regimen to use. \u00a1 Base decisions on the advantages and disadvantages of treatment for the patient, considering the patient's cultural beliefs, understanding of TB infection, behaviors, socio-economic factors, and health care access related to the safety and completion of LTBI treatment. \u00a1 Address barriers to adherence. \u00a1 Educate the patient about LTBI and its treatment. STEPS IN TREATMENT INITIATION Review the following info rmation concerning the essential components of treatment initiation: 1. Decision Whether to Treat 2. Selection of Treatment Regimen 3. Baseline Laboratory Tests 4. Interventions for Treatment Completion Challenges 5. Patient Education 6. Next: Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment RELATED TOPICS \u00a1 Appendix 2: Drugs for Treatment of LTBI \u00a1 Appendix 3: Dosage s for Recommended Treatment Regimens \u00a1 Appendix 5: Directly Observed Therapy and Video Directly Observed Therapy WARNINGS \u00a1 Do not treat for LTBI until active TB disease is excluded. \u00a1 For patients with these conditions or characteristics, review Section 5: Children, Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, Postpartum, HIV Infection, Iatrogenic Immunosuppression, Liver Disease, Kidney Disease, Contacts, and Substance Use Disorders. \u00a1 Educate the patient to stop medications immediately and call the health care provider if any symptoms develop that are concerning for an adverse effect. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 34 DECISION WHETHER TO TREAT The decision to recommend LTBI treatment is made based on the patient's risk of developing active TB versus the risk of an adverse event from treatment. Review the patient's current medical conditions and medications against the list of known contraindications and drug-drug in teractions of LTBI medications and regimens. Counseling the patient in his or he r preferred language, using a medical interpreter when needed, is important. Education and counseling should support a patient-centered approach that emphasi zes shared decision making. Unless a regimen is contraindicated, the patient should be educated about the advantages and disadvantages of different treatments and offered a choice. The rationale for taking a medication with potential toxi city to prevent a possible future event when a patient currently feels well can be difficult to understand. For some patients, the risks of adverse effects or drug-drug interactions may outweigh the risk of progression to active TB disease if untreated. For more information on adverse effects, refer to the treatment regimen descriptions in this section and Appendix 2: Drugs for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection. THE ONLINE TST/IGRA INTERPRETER This tool from McGill University may be useful for evaluating a specific person. You can access this guide at http://www.tstin3d.com/en/calc.html . However, take into consideration the following limitations of this assess ment tool (version 3.0). It tends to overestimate risks of treatment beca use it considers the rate of side effects only for 9 months of isoniazi d; it does not consider a negative IGRA result if a TST is also done in determining probability of a true positive TST; and it does not calculate lifetime risk of disease beyond age 80. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 35 SELECTION OF TREATMENT REGIMEN Regimens are ranked in the 2020 \"Guidelines for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection\" based on tolerabi lity and effectiveness from randomized controlled trials, assumed equivalent effe ctiveness in broad populations with LTBI who were not studied, and the likeli hood of treatment completion. These guidelines emphasize the use of shorter regimens for the treatment of LTBI based on randomized control treatment trials that have demonstrated efficacy and safety. As such, the short-course regimens that include rifampin or rifapentine are listed as preferred while isoniazid-only regimens are listed as alternatives. \u00a1 Preferred regimens: excellent tolerability and efficacy, shorter treatment duration, and higher completion rates \u00a1 Alternative regimens: excellent efficacy but longer treatment duration and lower completion rates Table 3 summarizes the recommendatio ns from the 2020 guidelines. Table 3. Recommendations for Regimens to Treat Latent Tuberculosis Infection Regimen Priority Rank Recommendation Quality of Evidence 3HP: 3 months of isoniazid and rifapentine once weekly Preferred Strong Moderate 4R: 4 months of rifampin daily Preferred Strong Moderate (HIV-negative)* 3HR: 3 months of isoniazid and rifampin daily Preferred Conditional Very low (HIV-negative) Low (HIV-positive) 6H: 6 months of isoniazid daily or twice weekly Alternative Strong^ Conditional Moderate (HIV-negative) Moderate (HIV-positive) 9H: 9 months of isoniazid daily or twice weekly Alternative Conditional Moderate * No evidence reported in persons with HIV infection. ^ Strong recommendation for persons unable to take a preferred regimen (e.g., because of drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions) Source: Adapted from Sterling TR, et al. Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculos is Controllers Associ ation and CDC, 2020. MMWR Recomm Rep. 2020 Feb 14;69(1):1-11. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 36 We now recommend two short-course re gimens: 3 months of isoniazid and rifapentine once weekly (3HP) and 4 m onths of rifampin daily (4R). Many jurisdictions in the United States use th ese regimens because of their higher completion rates and lower rates of associated hepatotoxicity. Three months of isoniazid and rifampin gi ven daily (3HR) is another short-course regimen more often used outside of th e United States. Because there is less evidence from randomized control trials on 3HR than other regimens, there is concern about its hepatotoxicity. Ba sed on this concern, 3HR has only a conditional recommendation. Because of lower completion rates and higher risk of hepatotoxicity compared to 3HP and 4R, two other regimens now have conditional recommendations: 6 and 9 months of isoniazid (6H and 9H) given daily or twice weekly. While 9H was estimated to be more efficacious than 6H at reducing the risk of TB in one analysis, 6H has been studied more exten sively, may be more cost-effective than 9H, and may have lower risk of hepatoto xicity. Nonetheless, 9H is probably more efficacious and is commonly reco mmended for patients who are immunosuppressed, tolerating treatment at 6 months, and willing to continue. Note that twice-weekly isoniazid should be administered by directly observed therapy (DOT) for patients who may no t be able to adhere to daily self- administered therapy (SAT) and cannot take 3HP by DOT. Be sure to use the correct dosing: daily and twice-weekly regimens have different dosages. No single regimen is the best choice for all patients. Each patient must be evaluated based on individual characterist ics, some of which may influence the choice of regimens. For example, women taking oral contraceptives have an increased risk of pregnancy if given a ri famycin, due to the drug-drug interaction between estrogen and rifamycins whic h increase estrogen metabolism and reduce its effectiveness as a contraceptiv e. Alternatives include 6H or 9H, or the use of a barrier method of contraceptio n with or without continuing the oral contraceptive. For a summary table of current treatment regimens, with dosing information, see Appendix 3: Dosages for Recommended Treatment Regimens. ALERT Concerns about nitrosamine contamin ation in rifapentine and rifampin are under investigation. For a summary of what is currently known and recommended, see the NTCA website at http://www.tbcontrollers.o rg/resources/nitrosamines/ . For information on facilitating trea tment completion, DOT, and on patient education, see the Interventions for Treatment Completion Challenges topic in SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 37 this section. Public health TB progr ams may provide nurse case management services and DOT for patients with LTBI. Contact the local health department to determine its policy for LTBI treatmen t services. For more information, see Section 7: Nurse Case Management. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 38 RIFAPENTINE AND ISONIAZID ONCE WEEKLY FOR 3 MONTHS (3HP) Currently, 3HP is one of the preferred regi mens for the treatment of patients with LTBI. In a multi-center, randomized clinical trial, 3HP given by DOT was shown to be as effective as 9H for the treatment of LTBI, with a greater likelihood of completion and a lower incidence of hepatotoxicity . In a separate study, completion of 3HP given by SAT was noninferior to direct observation among participants enrolled in the United States. For 3HP, the decision to give it by DOT or SAT should be based on local practice, individual patient a ttributes, preferences, and risk for progression to severe forms of TB disease. See the Methods of Treatment Administration topic below and Appendix 5: Directly Observed Therapy and Video Directly Observed Therapy. CAUTION Prescribing providers and pharmacis ts who are unfamiliar with the rifamycins might confuse the three drugs: r rifampin, rifapentine, and rifabutin are different drugs, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medica tion and the correct dose for the intended regimen. Advantages \u0017 Lower hepatotoxicity than with daily isoniazid monotherapy \u0017 Better treatment completion than with isoniazid regimens \u0017 Shortest currently approved treatment regimen \u0017 Fewest number of doses and to tal pills (12 doses; 120 pills for most) Disadvantages \u0017 Higher drug cost \u0017 Drug-drug interactions \u0017 Large pill burden for single dose \u0017 Rare hypotension and syncope SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 39 Contraindications \u0017 Aged <2 years (studies have not been completed) \u0017 Pregnancy \u0017 Exposure to a patient with an isolate resistant to isoniazid or rifampin Relative Contraindication \u0017 HIV-positive status and taking an ART regimen with serious drug- drug interactions (possibility of inducing a virologic relapse) Completion of Treatment \u0017 Completion of treatment for 3HP is 12 doses within 16 weeks. (For patients who are unable to complete 12 doses, treatment can be considered complete if 11 doses are taken within 16 weeks.) Doses should be separated by >72 hours to be counted. For LTBI treatment of persons on ART, see Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Persons with Comorbidities: Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection. SPECIAL NOTE ON MONITORING AND PATIENT EDUCATION FOR 3HP Patients must be educated about potential adverse effects, especially those that may be unique or more common with this regimen such as flu- like symptoms and near-syncope or syncope. Treatment-related side effects are most commonly reported after the third or fourth dose. Treatment should be withheld if seve re adverse effects occur, including uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, head ache, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, or loss of consciousn ess. Anyone experiencing severe symptoms should be eva luated by a clinician who can determine if laboratory testing is needed and whether it is safe to continue versus switching to a different regimen. Minor symptoms often resolve with continued treatment and may be mitigated by taking treatment before going to bed. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 40 RIFAMPIN (OR RIFABUTIN) DAILY FOR 4 MONTHS (4R) In two randomized clinical trials, 4 months of daily rifampin in adults and children was found to be at least as effective in preventing TB disease compared to 9 months of daily isoniazid, as well as to have a lower rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse effe cts and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, 4 months of rifampin daily is a prefer red regimen for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages. It also is recomme nded for patients who may have isoniazid- resistant TB. Some experts recommend treatment with rifampin for only 3 months, but only one older randomized control trial supports this treatment duration. Some experts use rifabutin in situat ions where there would be drug-drug interactions with rifampin, such as when a patient has a substance use disorder involving opioids or benzodiazepines. So me experts also substitute rifabutin when rifampin has elevated bilirubin and serum transaminase concentrations; however, there are no studies or evidence related to this substitution of rifabutin. See Appendix 2: Drugs for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection for more information on situations in which you may want to consider substituting rifabutin for rifampin. CAUTION Prescribing providers and pharmacis ts who are unfamiliar with the rifamycins might confuse the three drugs: r rifampin, rifapentine, and rifabutin are different drugs, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medica tion and the correct dose for the intended regimen. Advantages \u0017 Lower hepatotoxicity than isoniazid \u0017 Better adherence to treatment than with isoniazid regimens \u0017 Treatment option after exposure to isoniazid-resistant but rifampin-susceptible TB \u0017 Treatment option for persons unable to use isoniazid because of prior reaction to isoniazid or high risk of intolerance (baseline liver disease, for example) Disadvantage \u0017 Many drug-drug interactions SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 41 HIV-positive status and presen ce of significant drug-drug interactions with ART \u0017 History of allergic or other significant adverse effect to rifamycins Completion of Treatment \u0017 Completion of treatment is 120 doses within 6 months. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 42 ISONIAZID AND RIFAMPIN DAILY FOR 3 MONTHS (3HR) Combination therapy for LTBI with isonia zid and rifampin given daily extends 3 months in duration. It is listed as a preferred regimen that is conditionally recommended in the 2020 LTBI treatmen t guidelines. However, because of concerns about its tolerability and toxicity and the lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials, the 3HR regi men is infrequently used in the United States. CAUTION Prescribing providers and pharmacis ts who are unfamiliar with the rifamycins might confuse the three drugs: r rifampin, rifapentine, and rifabutin are different drugs, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medica tion and the correct dose for the intended regimen. Advantages \u0017 Potentially effective treatment of infection with an unsuspected isoniazid-resistant organism \u0017 Shorter duration of therapy co mpared to 4R and isoniazid regimens Disadvantages \u0017 Less experience with this regimen for the treatment of LTBI in the United States than with the other regimens \u0017 Potential additive hepatotoxicity Contraindications \u0017 information on isoniazid and rifampin. Completion of Treatment \u0017 Completion of treatment for 3HR is a total of 90 doses taken within 4 months. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 43 ISONIAZID FOR 6 MONTHS (6H) OR 9 MONTHS (9H) Numerous large, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of treatment of LTBI with isoniazid given daily. A risk-benefit analysis of these trials indicated that a treatment duration of 9 months would be more efficacious than 6 months. The most widely used regi men for LTBI treatment in the past 20 years was 9 months of daily isoniazi d (9H). However, its acceptance and completion are reduced by its long durat ion and risk for hepatotoxicity. In the 2020 guidelines for the treatment of LTBI, 6 months of isoniazid given daily is strongly recommended for HIV-ne gative patients and conditionally recommended for persons with HIV infect ion. Nine months of isoniazid given daily has a conditional recommendation. For patients who are at increased risk of not completing treatment and for whom 3HP or 4R is unfeasible or contraindica ted, some experts recommend treatment with isoniazid twice weekly for 6 to 9 months by DOT. Advantages \u0017 Low cost \u0017 Few drug-drug interactions Disadvantages \u0017 Hepatotoxicity, more commonly in adults than in children, which can be serious and lead to liver failure and death \u0017 Long duration of treatment leadin g to poor completion rates Contraindications \u0017 Acute active hepatitis \u0017 Chronic hepatitis with liver-associated enzyme levels >5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) \u0017 Prior significant adverse effect related to isoniazid \u0017 Heavy or daily alcohol use Relative Contraindication \u0017 Chronic hepatitis with liver enzyme levels that are abnormal, but <5 times the ULN \u0017 For monitoring persons with chronic hepatitis, see Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 44 Completion of Treatment DOT is required for intermittent dosing. 9H Regimen \u0017 Daily: Completion of treatment is 270 doses within 12 months. For patients who are unable or unlikely to complete 270 doses, treatment may be considered to be completed if they have taken the number of doses in the time frame needed to complete the daily 6H regimen below. \u0017 Twice weekly by DOT: Completion of treatment is 76 doses within 12 months. 6H Regimen \u0017 Daily: Completion of treatment is 180 doses within 9 months. \u0017 Twice weekly by DOT: Completion of treatment is 52 doses within 9 months. See Appendix 2: Drugs for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection for information on each drug's preparat ions, dosages, administration, contraindications, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions.

SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 45 BASELINE LABORATORY TESTS Obtain baseline blood tests for aspart ate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and complete blood count (CBC) for the following patients: \u00a1 All patients with HIV infection \u00a1 Patients with daily or heavy alcohol us e, liver disease, or chronic hepatitis \u00a1 Pregnant and postpartum patients (up to 2 to 3 months after delivery) \u00a1 Patients currently injecting drugs \u00a1 Patients on other potentially hepatotoxic medications \u00a1 Patients with prior elevated se rum transaminase concentrations \u00a1 Patients with hematologic conditions \u00a1 Other patients based on clinical discretion Test for hepatitis A, B, and C antibodies, as indicated. Offer HIV testing for all patients who do not know their HIV status . Some patients will require periodic follow-up laboratory studies based on the results of the baseline tests, the prescribed regimen, and indivi dual patient characteristics. For recommendations on follow-up laboratory studies Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment. INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT COMPLETION CHALLENGES None of the treatment regimens is effect ive unless it is completed. The health care provider should ask the patient abou t practical challenges to treatment\u2014for example, clinic access, work schedule, lack of transportation, homelessness, or substance use\u2014and should learn about the pa tient's perspective on LTBI and its treatment. To address adherence barriers, consid er one or more of the following interventions: prescribing a shorter treatm ent regimen, using directly observed or video directly observed therapy, provid ing incentives, ensuring enablers, and educating the patient. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 46 Although studies have shown that adhere nce to treatment is unpredictable, it may be reasonable to decide not to start treatment when a patient has one or more of the following barriers to adherence: \u00a1 History of medical nonadherence \u00a1 Life challenges affecting the abili ty to take scheduled medications regularly \u00a1 Current substance use disorder \u00a1 Poorly controlled mental illn ess or cognitive dysfunction \u00a1 Homelessness For information on monitoring a dherence and addressing treatment interruptions, see Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment. METHODS OF TREATMENT ADMINISTRATION The three types of treatment administra tion are in-person directly observed therapy (DOT), video directly observed ther apy (vDOT, live or recorded), and self- administered therapy (SAT). With DOT, a trained health care worker is physically present when the patient ingests the medications and uses a symptom checklist for adverse effects. DOT is the best method to ensure medication adherence and monitor for side effects, but it is the least patient centered. vDOT has emerged using secure platforms for live or recorded videos that facilitate observing medication ingest ions remotely. vDOT provides greater patient flexibility while still ensuring the safe and effective completion of treatment. SAT allows the greatest flexibility but places most of the responsibility for treatment adherence and monitoring of side effects on the patient. Daily LTBI treatment regimens are typica lly administered by SAT. Depending on the individual patient and available resour ces, 3HP may be admi nistered by SAT, DOT, or vDOT. Twice-weekly 6H and 9H should be administered by DOT or vDOT. In special circumstances, such as when patients are at high risk for adverse reactions, providers may want to administ er other regimens by DOT. In certain settings, such as correctional facilities, all treatment is administered by DOT. For more information on DOT and vDOT, see Appendix 5: Directly Observed Therapy and Video Directly Observed Therapy. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 47 INCENTIVES AND ENABLERS Incentives and enablers can sometimes be provided by the state or local TB program for patients treated in their progr ams. Incentives motivate the patient to complete treatment and can include gift ca rds or small cash payments. Enablers, which facilitate treatment completion, in clude a range of measures such as convenient office hours, transportatio n vouchers, using pharmacists and other health care providers to pr ovide DOT, and providing cell phones or additional cell phone minutes for patients on vDOT. Remi nder calls for patient clinic visits, minimizing clinic wait times, and pe rforming pill counts can help promote adherence. NURSE CASE MANAGEMENT Public health TB programs may provid e nurse case management services, DOT, incentives and enablers, and educ ational materials for patients with LTBI. Contact your state or local he alth department to determine its policy for LTBI treatmen t services. For more information on nurse case management, see Section 7: Nurse Case Management. PATIENT EDUCATION The health care provider should educat e the patient about TB. Education can promote adherence by addressing any confusion and questions about transmission, exposure, infection, tes ting, and disease progression and by explaining the advantages of treatment. All encounters with the patient should be conducted in the pa tient's preferred language and at the patient's educational le vel. A certified medical interpreter (by phone, video, or in person) and other assistance should be used as needed. During patient encounters, allow ample opportunity for the patient to ask questions. CAUTION For patients taking 3HP, see the S Special Note on Monitoring and Patient Education for 3HP in the treatment description Rifapentine and Isoniazid Once Weekly for 3 Months (3HP) above in this section. Educate the patient to \"STOP all LTBI medications immediately and CALL\" the clinical care team if an y symptoms of adverse effects are suspected. SECTION 4: DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT AND CHOOSING A REGIMEN Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 48 Education is an ongoing process that shou ld occur at every patient encounter. Before starting treatment, provide the patient an oral explanation and, whenever possible, written educational ma terials on the following topics: \u00a1 Advantages of completing LTBI treatm ent in the absence of symptoms or radiographic abnormalities \u00a1 Treatment plan \u00a1 Symptoms of adverse effects \u00a1 What to do about a suspected adverse effect \u00a1 Disease process \u00a1 Differences between injections, vaccines, and a TST or an IGRA \u00a1 The meaning of test results and of th e words \"positive\" and \"negative\" as they relate to test results \u00a1 The meaning of a normal CXR in the context of infection \u00a1 Modes of TB transmission and prevention \u00a1 Difference between exposure and becoming infected \u00a1 Safety of family and friends around someone with LTBI Patient education should be provided at ea ch regular appointment as a tool to support the patient through treatment co mpletion. Education is also important for early patient recognition of potential side effects and of signs and symptoms of adverse effects. If the patient declines treatment, provide education on the symptoms of active TB disease and the impo rtance of seeking care promptly if TB symptoms should occur. NURSE CASE MANAGEMENT A state or local TB nurse consultant or liaison may provide expertise on the use of nurse case management services and patient education. Check the NTCA online directory for a state or local TB nurse consultant in your area: http://www.tbcontrollers.org/c ommunity/statecityterritory/ For information on nurse case management, see Section 7: Nurse Case Management.

SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Review the following info rmation on testing and treatment approaches when working with the following populations: 1. Children 2. Pregnant, Breastfeeding, and Postpartum Women 3. Persons with Comorbidities 4. Recent Contacts to Persons with Infectious TB Disease 5. Contacts to Persons with Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Disease 6. Persons with Radiographic Findings of Previous or Inactive TB 7. Persons with Culture-Negative TB Disease RELATED TOPICS \u00a1 Section 1: Immunologic Tests \u00a1 Section 3: Pretreatment Clinical Evaluation \u00a1 Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen \u00a1 Section 6: Monitoring Treatment \u00a1 Appendix 2: Drugs for Treatment of LTBI \u00a1 Appendix 3: Dosage s for Recommended Treatment Regimens WARNINGS \u00a1 Do not treat for LTBI until active TB disease is excluded. \u00a1 Educate the patient to stop medications immediately and call the health care provider if any symptoms develop that are concerning for an adverse effect. \u00a1 Consult with your state or local TB program or regional TB Center of Excellence. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 54 CHILDREN WHOM TO TREAT Treatment is recommended for all childr en and adolescents diagnosed with LTBI because of the following biological, medical, and social factors: \u00a1 Infants and young children are at higher risk for progression to TB disease. \u00a1 The medications used are generall y well tolerated by children. \u00a1 Infection with M. tuberculosis is more likely to have been recent. \u00a1 Children have more potential time in which to develop TB disease during their entire life. WINDOW PERIOD TREATMENT AFTER CLOSE CONTACT Window period treatment refers to LTBI treatment given to someone with a negative test result but who had recent cl ose contact to a person with pulmonary TB disease. The window period is 8 to 10 weeks after the period of last potential exposure and represents the time it takes to develop an immunologic response that is detectable by a TST or IGRA. Wind ow period treatment is most often given to young children but may also be co nsidered for adults who are severely immunosuppressed. A child aged <5 years (or older, at the disc retion of the health department) who is a close contact to a person with infect ious TB disease should be tested for TB infection and have a pretreatment clinic al evaluation (including a symptom review and CXR) to exclude active TB disease. If the evaluation excludes active TB disease, treatment for LTBI should be initiated immediately after evaluation fo r all contacts aged <5 years regardless of the initial test result. For contacts age d between 5 and 17 years with a negative test result, treatment for LTBI may be started at the discretion of the physician in consultation with the state or loca l TB program. A second test should be administered 8 to 10 weeks after the last exposure to infectious TB. For information on contact investigations, see the topic Contacts to Persons with Infectious Tuberculosis Disease below in this section. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 55 Window period treatment can be discontinued if a all of the following conditions are met: \u00a1 The infant is at least 6 months of age. \u00a1 The second test result is also negative. \u00a1 The second test was performed at leas t 8 weeks after the child was last exposed to an adult with infectious TB disease. TREATMENT OPTIONS For regimens for LTBI treatment in children, see Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen and Appendix 2: Drugs for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection. Do not treat children aged <2 years with the 3HP regimen, as the studies in children in this age range have not been completed. Medications for LTBI may be crushed or the capsules opened, mixed with food, and immediately administered with minima l effect on bioavailability. Review the following tips on administering TB medications to children: \u00a1 Liquid formulations of medications may need to be compounded by a pharmacy. Sorbitol-based isoniazid formulation may cause diarrhea. \u00a1 Medications can be mixed with semi-sol id food, such as yogurt, or with sugar preparations, such as grape jelly. \u00a1 Administer medications that are crushed and mixed with a food substance within 30 minutes of mixing. As the bioavailability of medications mixed with food can decr ease rapidly over time, administer them as quickly as possible after mixing. They should not be stored overnight as glucose will chemically combine with isoniazid, producing an inactive substance. \u00a1 Older children can be encouraged to practice swallowing tablets using similarly sized candies. Routine laboratory testing is generall y not necessary in healthy children. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 56 PREGNANT, BREASTFEEDING, AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN WHOM TO TREAT Pregnancy may not in itself be a risk fact or for progression from LTBI to active TB disease. Screen pregnant women for risk fa ctors and test them only if they have a risk factor for infection or for pr ogression to active TB disease. If an asymptomatic, pregnant woman has a po sitive TB test result, either IGRA or TST, she should receive a medical evaluati on, including a CXR with a lead shield. The CXR may be deferred until after the first trimester u unless she has one or more of the following: \u00a1 HIV or other immunosuppression \u00a1 History of recent contact with a person with infectious TB disease \u00a1 Documented TB infection test co nversion in the past 2 years In general, if a CXR was done in the 3 mo nths prior to the medical evaluation, its findings were documented as normal, and the person is asymptomatic, then a repeat CXR is not necessary. For all other asymptomatic patients with a positive TB test result, the CXR may be deferred to the second trimester. The CX R should not be deferred until peri- or post-partum. Many experts recommend treating these pregnant women for LTBI after the first trimester. Otherwise, treatment may be delayed until 2 to 3 months after delivery. Many women access medical care only when they are pregnant. Therefore, prenatal visits may represent a unique opportunity for targeted testing and treatment of LTBI. Bear in mind, howeve r, that women may lose their maternal health care benefits after one postpartum visit. If treatment is deferred, a referral should be made to a facility that offers treatment of LTBI. For information on risk for progression from LTBI to active TB disease, see Section 2: When to Test for Latent Tuberculosis Infection. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 57 TREATMENT OPTIONS Isoniazid and the rifamycins are consid ered safe in pregnancy, and all LTBI regimens in Section 4 with the exception of 3HP can be used to treat LTBI during pregnancy. 3HP has not been studied in pregnant women and should not be prescribed for women who are pregnant or expect to be pregnant in the next 3 months. Rifampin monotherapy offers the shortest and most tolerable treatment option and should be considered. Isoniazid monothe rapy should be used with caution in pregnant women, especially those with HIV. Isoniazid and rifampin are found in brea st milk at low levels. Women can safely breastfeed while taking any of the a pproved regimens for LTBI treatment. Prescribe supplemental pyridoxine for a pregnant or breastfeeding woman who is receiving isoniazid for the treatment of LTBI. The infant does not need supplemental pyridoxine unless the infant is receiving isoniazid treatment in addition to the mother. MONITORING DURING TREATMENT Some studies have shown an increase in hepatotoxicity in the first 3 months postpartum in women taking isoniazid for LTBI; however, no studies have been done on the tolerance of other regimens given in the postpartum period. Consider laboratory monitoring througho ut LTBI treatment if the patient is pregnant or in the postpartum pe riod and taking isoniazid. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 58 PERSONS WITH COMORBIDITIES The treatment of patients with comorbid conditions may be challenging because of increased complications from drug-dru g interactions and adverse effects. The treatment of LTBI in patients with some comorbidities has not been specifically studied. TB prevention for patients with HIV co-infection has been specifically studied, with proven effi cacy for 6H and 3HP. HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION All persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection should be screened for LTBI, which should include a test for TB infection, as soon as HIV infection is diagnosed regardless of thei r epidemiologic risk of TB exposure. Patients with a negative TB test result with advanced HIV infect ion (defined as a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3) who may have a false-negative test result should be retested once they attain a CD4 count cells/mm3 or if they have ongoing risk for TB exposure. The sensitivity of immunologic tests for TB infection is reduced in persons with HIV infection and further declines as the CD 4 count is depleted. For this reason, if the HIV-infected person with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 has a negative test result for TB infection and has a signific ant risk factor for having acquired TB infection (close contact with a person wi th infectious TB disease, for example), many experts recommend performing a second test for TB infection. Because of the high rate of progression to TB, window period treatment for possible LTBI is recommended for persons with HIV infection after exposure to TB, regardless of TB test results or prior history of treatment for TB infection or disease. Window period treatment refe rs to LTBI treatment given to someone with a negative test result but who had re cent close contact to a person with pulmonary TB disease. The window period is 8 to 10 weeks after the period of last potential exposure and represents the time it takes to develop an immunologic response that is detectable by a TST or IGRA. A pretreatment clinical evaluation should exclude TB disease before treatm ent for LTBI is started. Treatment for LTBI in these patients generally should be completed even if LTBI testing is negative. Detailed recommendations for coadministra tion of rifamycins and antiretroviral drugs have been published in the tr eatment of drug-susceptible disease guidelines and also in a prior publication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on management of drug -drug interactions in the treatment of HIV-related TB. For patients taking ART wi th interactions with rifamycins, many experts recommend isoniazid daily for 6 to 9 months. For patients not taking ART or taking an ART regimen that does not have interactions with rifamycins, a shorter, rifamycin-based regimen such as 3H P or 4R can be prescribed. Rifabutin, SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 59 with dose adjustments, may be able to be substituted for rifampin for use with certain ART regimens. Consider consulting an expert in managing HIV and TB for treatment of LTBI. IATROGENIC IMMUNOSUPPRESSION Adults and children with iatrogenic immunosuppression because of anti- inflammatory immune-modulating drugs, ca ncer chemotherapy, or solid organ or bone marrow transplants are at increased risk of LTBI progressing to active TB disease. The risk of progression depend s upon the underlying disease state and the immunosuppressive treatments used. A test for TB infection should be performe d prior to initiation of any immuno- suppressive treatment, and patients with LTBI should begin treatment prior to the start of immunosuppressive treatment. Most experts recommend starting an immunosuppressive agent after at least 1 month of LTBI treatment has been completed to ensure adherence to and to lerance of the selected LTBI regimen. This recommendation is particularly appli cable when initiating biologic agents (see below). However, sometimes 1 month of LTBI treatment cannot be completed prior to immunosuppression, and the medical necessity of an immunosuppressive treatment or transplant may outweigh the risks of not having 1 or more months of LTBI treatment completed. In a contact investigation, window pe riod treatment for possible LTBI is recommended for contacts with iatr ogenic immunosuppression regardless of their immunologic test results because of this population's high rate of progression to TB. Window period treatm ent refers to LTBI treatment given to someone with a negative test result but wh o had recent close contact to a person with pulmonary TB disease. The window pe riod is 8 to 10 weeks after the period of last potential exposure and represen ts the time it takes to develop an immunologic response that is detectabl e by a TST or IGRA. A pretreatment clinical evaluation should exclude TB dise ase before treatment for presumed LTBI is started. Treatment for LTBI in these patients should be completed. Transplantation Solid organ transplant recipients and persons receiving bone marrow transplants are at higher risk of having LTBI progress to active TB disease. Bone marrow transplantation is associ ated with a risk of progression to active TB disease at approximatel y 10 times the background rate. Cancer and Chemotherapy Both cancer and cancer chemotherapy could be associated with an increased risk of progression to active TB disease, and these patients should be screened for TB risk factors. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 60 Anti-Inflammatory Immunosuppressive Drugs Anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive drugs can increase the risk of progression to active TB disease by downregulating the immunologic functions that contain TB organisms. Th is risk varies by drug class and mechanism of action. Corticosteroid-induced immunosuppressi on increases the risk in a dose- dependent fashion, with higher rates of disease seen with prolonged ($)$./- particul arly inhibitors of TNF-alpha, leads to markedly higher rates of progression to active TB disease. The risk from biologic agents varies by the drug and its mechanism of action. Infliximab and adalimumab (monoclonal anti-TNF- alpha antibodies) are associated with a higher risk than etanercept (s oluble TNF-alpha receptor). The risk profiles of other anti-TNF-alpha agents and agents with different mechanisms of action are less well define d, but also likely elevated in some cases. Synthetic targeted small molec ules such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors also increase TB risk, probab ly to a similar extent as TNF blockers. Patients should be tested prior to starting such therapies. Before initiating any biologic agent, refer to the manufacturer's package insert to see if testing for LTBI is in dicated. Patients should be tested and, if diagnosed with LTBI, started on tr eatment, prior to starting the immunosuppressive treatment. Pati ents taking immunosuppressive medications should be screened for new TB risk factors periodically while using these agents. Repeat screening during immunosuppressive use is indicated if the patient has ongoing risk for TB exposure or has contact with a person with infectious TB disease. Table 4 summarizes the risk of TB for a select list of biologic and small molecule therapies as of May 2020. The highest risk is with biologic agents that block JAKs, interleukin-6 (IL-6), an d TNF-alpha. There is lower risk with interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin -23 (IL-23). Note that this list of immunosuppressive drugs does not in clude all immunosuppressive drugs. There are new biologic agents coming into the market. For patients who are receiving these agents, consult with a TB specialist.

SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 62 LIVER DISEASE AND CHRONIC VIRAL HEPATITIS If LTBI treatment is indicated, some experts recommend treatment with 4R. Isoniazid may cause drug-induced hepato toxicity. The risk and severity of hepatotoxicity with isoniazid is increa sed when a patient has underlying liver disease. Less frequently, rifamyci ns also may cause hepatotoxicity. Be aware of the following risk factors for underlying liver disease: \u00a1 History of regular alcohol ingestion \u00a1 Injection drug use \u00a1 HIV infection \u00a1 History of liver disease including non-alcoholic steatosis \u00a1 Known hepatitis B or C \u00a1 Birth in Asia or Africa wher e hepatitis B and C are common \u00a1 Malnutrition \u00a1 Use of other hepatotoxic drugs For patients with risk factors for, sympto ms of, or clinical signs of liver disease, check baseline laboratory tests in cluding CBC, serum transaminase concentrations, and serologic testi ng for hepatitis A, B, and C. For monitoring persons with risk factors for liver disease, see Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment. Isoniazid is contraindicated for patients with advanced liver disease indicated by any of the following test results: transam inases >3 times the ULN, international nor malized ratio prothrombin or partial thromboplastin time (PTT ). If LTBI treatment is indicated, some experts recommend treatment with 4R. Patients treated with isoniazid should li mit or avoid the concomitant use of alcohol, hepatotoxic drugs such as acet aminophen, and herbal supplements. CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE Persons with chronic kidney disease (C KD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased risk of TB compared to the general population. Some of these patients have other comorbidities, such as diabetes, that also increase the risk of progression to active TB disease. Preven tion of TB in CKD patients is very important because of the possibility of TB transmission in health care facilities SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 63 such as dialysis centers, the anticipat ion of renal transplantation, and the difficulty diagnosing and treating TB disease in CKD/ESRD patients. CKD/ESRD patients have impaired ce ll-mediated immunity, and some have cutaneous anergy, making a negative TST re sult less reliable because of concerns about a false-negative result. In a small case series of IGRA testing in ESRD patients, the rate of indeterminate QuantiFERON results or invalid T-Spot results was greater than among healthy subjects. Evaluate a patient for TB infection as soon as the diagnosis of CKD is made. Testing for TB infection during the earl ier stages of CKD, when cell-mediated immunity may be less impaired, may maintain the sensitivity of the TST or IGRA. If the patient is diagnosed with LTBI, treatment is generally indicated. Isoniazid and rifamycins are primarily m etabolized by the liver and can be used for LTBI treatment in patients with CKD. Dose adjustment of these medications is not necessary. These medications should be given after hemodialysis on the day of dialysis. There is limited data on the use of 3H P in CKD/dialysis patients, but small reported case series demonstrate that this regimen is well tolerated and completion of treatment is high. Administ er 3HP after hemodialysis and at the start of the longest interval between hemo dialysis treatments to allow the drugs to stay in the system for as long as possible. If the patient is on hemodialysis, consider providing DOT at the dialysis facility. To facilitate DOT, provide dial ysis staff with medications, medication administration reporting forms, education on the possible adverse effects, and instructions to stop the treatment and contact the health care provider if the patient reports adverse effects. For information on providing DOT at a dialysis facility, refer to Appendix 4: Collaborations Between the Public Health Department and Community Service Providers. DIABETES Poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of progression from LTBI to active TB disease two- to three-fold. In some populations with high incidence of TB and diabetes (including, but not limited to, Pacific Islanders and Native Am ericans), TB testing should be routine. All patients with diabetes should be screened for TB risk factors. If risk factors are present, they should be tested for TB. In a low-TB-incidence country like the United States, testing for LTBI is no t recommended solely on the basis of diabetes. However, persons with LTBI and diabetes should generally be treated for LTBI. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 64 For a full discussion of TB risk factors, see Section 2: When to Test for Latent Tuberculosis Infection. Rifamycins decrease the levels of many anti-diabetic agents including sulfonylureas, meglitinide analogues, rifamy cins are generally not contraindicated when patients are taking these anti-diabetic agents, monitor blood glucose more closely while the patient is on LTBI treatment. Isoniazid may exacerbate diabetic peripher al neuropathy during the treatment of LTBI, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 25 to 50 mg daily should be routinely prescribed. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Persons with substance use disorders, in cluding alcohol or other recreational drugs, tend to be overrepresented in patien ts with active TB disease in the United States. Transmission of TB has been docume nted to occur in this population, and substance use is known to be biologically and socially connected with progression to TB. For these reasons, te sting and treatment of persons with substance use disorders is recommended. To minimize drug toxicities when choo sing an LTBI treatment, determine which prescription or non-prescription drugs, in cluding herbal medications, the patient is taking. If a chosen TB medication decr eases the effectiveness of another drug being taken, the patient may have decrea sed incentive to continue treatment. In general, patients with substance use diso rder should be counseled and referred to drug treatment programs based on thei r motivation and available resources. Alcohol LTBI treatment in persons with alco hol use disorder requires careful monitoring, and the patient should be counseled to avoid other hepatotoxic agents. In some cases, the risk of li ver toxicity with continued alcohol consumption may outweigh the benefits of treatment. Persons consuming alcohol are at 4 ti mes greater risk of isoniazid-induced hepatitis than persons who do not co nsume alcohol. In these patients, 3HP or 4R may be a better choice. If 3HP is used, you may decide to check transaminases 2 weeks into treatment. If a patient does not stop consuming alcohol and is unable to tolerate tr eatment with 3HP or rifampin, then isoniazid may be used with caref ul monitoring of transaminases. For information on monitoring hepatotoxicity, see Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 65 Opioids The rifamycins increase the metabolism of opioids such as heroin, codeine, morphine, and methadone. Rifabutin has less effect than other rifamycins on the metabolism of opioids and gene rally is preferred as a treatment option. If the rifamycins cannot be used, isoniazid is an acceptable alternative in patients using opioids. In situations where rifampin or rifape ntine may need to be used, be aware that starting these rifamycins can indu ce an opioid withdrawal. Conversely, when stopping the rifamycin, pati ents should be counseled about the increased risk of opioid overdose, part icularly if use or dosages increased while on LTBI treatment. The prov ider should contact the methadone maintenance program, and many progr ams will adjust the dosage of methadone accordingly. DOT is recommended for such patients if feasible. If the patient is enrolled in a methadone maintenance program, LTBI treatment can be observed at that facility. Benzodiazepines Rifampin also greatly increases the metabolism of benzodiazepines, which may negate many of the anxiolyt ic effects of these drugs. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 66 RECENT CONTACTS TO PERSONS WITH INFECTIOUS TUBERCULOSIS DISEASE A TB contact is someone who has been exposed to M. tuberculosis infection by sharing air space with a person with infectio us TB disease. TB contacts are at high risk of both being infected with TB and, if infected, progressing to active TB disease, commonly within 2 years of infection. For each person diagnosed with active infectious TB, the state or local TB program will perform a contact investigation to identify that person's contacts and ensure appropriate evaluation and treatment that may be conducted by providers outside of the TB program. If a contact presents for care before being identified by the TB program, the health care provider should contact the TB program to discuss the evaluation and treatment. Contacts should be tested with an IGRA or TST and evaluated for active TB disease unless documented to ha ve been previously positive. If the initial test result is negative, th e test is repeated 8 to 10 weeks after the period of last potential exposure, and window period treatment may be considered. Window period treatment refers to LTBI treatment given to someone with a negative test result but who had recent cl ose contact to a person with pulmonary TB disease. The window period is 8 to 10 weeks after the period of last potential exposure and represents the time it takes to develop an immunologic response that is detectable by a TST or IGRA. Wind ow period treatment is most often given to young children but may also be co nsidered for adults who are severely immunosuppressed. All contacts aged <5 ye ars, regardless of the initial test result, should be evaluated immediately with a symptom review and chest radiography. If there are no findings sugge stive of TB disease, treatment for LTBI should be initiated promptly after evalua tion. For contacts aged between 5 and 17 years with a negative test result, tr eatment for LTBI may be started at the discretion of the physician in consulta tion with the state or local TB program. Immunosuppressed contacts, who may have a false-negative TB test, should generally complete treatment for LTBI regardless of their test results. Consult with your state or local TB program on treatment of these contacts. For more information on evaluation and treatment, see the topic Children above in this section. Evaluation of a contact with a positive test result should include a symptom review, assessment for additional TB risk factors, physical examination, and a CXR. For information on evaluation, see Section 3: Pretreatment Clinical Evaluation. If active TB is excluded, the patient sho uld be treated for LTBI with a regimen to which the organism in the index case wa s susceptible. If the isolate showed isoniazid monoresistance, the patient should generally be treated with 4R. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 67 In general, patients are treated for LTBI only once. Some circumstances, such as re-exposure to a highly infectious source case patient, may indicate re-treatment for presumptive reinfection, especially in immunocompromised patients. Seek consultation from your state or loca l TB program, regional TB Center of Excellence, or an expert clinic ian in these circumstances. For more information on testing and treatment: \u00a1 Testing for TB infection, see Section 1: Immunologic Tests for Tuberculosis Infection. \u00a1 Additional risk factors see Section 2: When to Test for Latent Tuberculosis Infection. \u00a1 How to diagnose LTBI, see Section 3: Pretreatment Clinical Evaluation. \u00a1 Treatment regimens see Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen. For information on testing, evaluati ng, and treating high-risk groups: \u00a1 Pediatric contacts see Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Children. \u00a1 Contacts with HIV see Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Persons with Comorbidities: Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection. \u00a1 Contacts with other immunosuppressive conditions, see Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Persons with Comorbidities: Iatrogenic Immunosuppression. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 68 CONTACTS TO PERSONS WITH INFECTIOUS DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS DISEASE There is no direct test for drug susceptibi lity in a patient with LTBI. When the index patient is known, treatment decisions should be based on the drug susceptibility test results of the index patient. ISONIAZID RESISTANCE Isoniazid resistance with rifampin susceptibility is the most frequently encountered TB drug resistance pattern in the United States. Recent contacts to isoniazid-resistant TB disease generally should be treated with the 4R regimen. MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB is defined as resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin, with or without resistance to other drugs. Consider MDR-LTBI in a patient with LTBI who is known, or like ly, to be a contact to a person with infectious MDR-TB disease. Expert consultation should be obtained for these patients. Contact your state or local health department or your regional TB Center of Excellence. Prior to the decision to treat, evaluate the contact to determine the likelihood that LTBI resulted from exposure to MD R-TB based on the infectiousness of the source MDR-TB case patient, the closen ess and intensity of exposure, and the likelihood of prior infection wi th a drug-susceptible strain. Individualized treatment should be given to those for whom LTBI is likely to be due to MDR-TB based on the source case patient's drug susceptibility results. Optimal regimens and duration of treatmen t for MDR-LTBI are not known. Several clinical trials are in progress. Current LTBI treatment regimens most frequently use use levofloxacin or moxifl oxacin for 6 to 12 months. The length of treatment can vary based on clinic al and epidemiological factors. \u00a1 Some experts extend treatment to 12 months for persons who are immunocompromised. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 69 \u00a1 Some experts recommend a fluoroqui nolone with or without a second drug to which the organism is likely to be susceptible. Pyrazinamide is no longer recommended because of the high risk of drug-induced hepatotoxicity. \u00a1 No fluoroquinolones have an FDA-appr infection (LTBI or active TB disease) . All fluoroquinolones are labeled for short-term administration, and the potential adverse effects of long-term administration should be reviewed with the patient. If the source case patient's isolate is resistant to fluoroquinolones and the contact is at increased risk of progressi ng to active TB disease, LTBI treatment decisions should be made in consultati on with an expert in treating drug- resistant TB. DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS: A SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR CLINICIANS For detailed information regarding dr ugs for treatment after exposure to drug-resistant TB, see the Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Survival Guide for Clinicians, 3rd Edition , Curry International Tuberculosis Center (2016, updated 2019) available at http://www.currytbcenter.ucsf.edu /products/view/drug-resistant- tuberculosis-survival-guide-clinicians-3rd-edition . Whether or not a contact with LTBI is treated, the CDC recommends follow-up of contacts to persons with infectious MDR- TB disease with clinical and radiographic evaluation at 6 to 12-month intervals for a total of 2 years. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 70 PERSONS WITH RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS OF PREVIOUS OR INACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS Decisions on the evaluation and treatment of patients with this condition should be made in coordination with the state or local TB program. All patients started on empiric treatment for suspected active TB disease should be reported to the state or local TB program. Persons with radiographic evidence (CXR or computed tomography) consistent with prior active TB disease and wh o were not adequately treated are at increased risk of recurrent active TB di sease. Radiographic findings consistent with prior active TB disease include fibr o-nodular lesions and fibrosis, frequently in the upper lobes. The radiographic findin gs alone cannot differentiate active TB disease from latent TB infection even in people who are asymptomatic. Active TB disease should be evaluated in people with an abnormal chest imaging by collecting sputum for AFB smear, culture, and NAAT testing. For more information on these tests, see Section 3: Pretreatment Clinical Evaluation: Bacteriologic Studies. Patients with signs or symptoms of active TB disease or who have a high risk of transmitting TB if the diagnosis is dela yed should be considered for empiric treatment of active TB disease with 4 drugs and reported to the public health department while awaiting culture results. Do not start treatment for LTBI until culture results have been finalized. SECTION 5: CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 71 PERSONS WITH CULTURE-NEGATIVE TUBERCULOSIS DISEASE Decisions on the evaluation and treatment of patients with this condition should be made in coordination with the state or local TB program. All patients started on empiric treatment for suspec ted active TB disease should be reported to the state or local TB program. Lack of success in isolating M. tuberculosis from satisfactorily collected specimens in persons with radiographic evid ence of previous or inactive TB does not exclude a diagnosis of active TB disease. Depending on the clinical presentation, alternative diagnoses must be considered, and other appropriate diagnostic studies should be performed before making a probable diagnosis of AFB smear- and culture-negative TB disease. A short 4-month treatment regimen is re commended for AFB smear- and culture- negative pulmonary TB with an intensive isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide and a cont inuation phase of 2 drugs (isoniazid and rifampin) for 2 months.

Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommen dations | February 2021 | 77 Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 78 OVERVIEW Patients undergoing treatment for LTBI will have different risks for progression to active TB disease, medical conditions that may increase their risk for toxicity, and socio-economic barriers to adherence that require differen t approaches to clinical and laboratory monitoring and interventions to support treatment completion. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Treatment monitoring is recommended for all patients being treated for LTBI to detect potential adverse effects of the medication and to support treatment completion. To ensure a patient- centered approach, these principles should be followed in monitoring treatment: \u00a1 Always talk to patients in their preferred language using a medical interpreter unless a patient specifically indicates a preference to have a family member or friend translate. \u00a1 Ask if patients have any concerns about their treatment before asking targeted questions about specific potential side effects. \u00a1 Approach adherence difficulties with an openness to understanding what barriers the patient is experiencing and a willingness to make changes to address these barriers. STEPS IN TREATMENT MONITORING Review the following information concerning the essential components of monitoring treatment: 1. Periodic Assessment 2. Clinical Monitoring 3. Laboratory Monitoring 4. Interventions for Treatment Completion Challenges 5. Management of Adverse Effects 6. Management of Treatment Interruption 7. Follow-up after Treatment Completion RELATED TOPICS \u00a1 Appendix 2: Drugs for Treatment of LTBI \u00a1 Appendix 3: Dosage s for Recommended Treatment Regimens \u00a1 Assessment Tool WARNINGS \u00a1 Educate the patient to stop medications immediately and call the health care provider if any symptoms develop that are concerning for an adverse effect. \u00a1 Consult with your state or local TB program or regional TB Center of Excellence. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 79 PERIODIC ASSESSMENT The health care provider should conduct a clinical assessment at least monthly. Assess the patient for signs and symptoms of active TB disease, medication adherence, and adverse effects at least monthly during treatment. This assessment may be performed in person or by telephone or via other electronic technology, considering the risk of hepato xicity or other serious adverse effects. Most experts recommend a face-to-face evaluation when a patient has symptoms of an adverse effect. During the periodic assessment, the heal th care provider should complete the following tasks: \u00a1 Assess the patient's adherence with treatment. \u00a1 Perform a symptom review for sympto ms of an adverse effect and further assess a patient who reports any such symptoms. \u00a1 Conduct directed clinical examinations as needed. \u00a1 Obtain laboratory tests as needed. \u00a1 Provide medications sufficient to la st until the next assessment, with a few extra doses to minimize disruptions in treatment. \u00a1 Continue to educate the patient about the symptoms of adverse effects, the advantages of completing treatmen t, and the length of treatment. All encounters with the patient should be conducted in the patient's preferred language and at the patient's educational level. A certified medical interpreter (by phone, video, or in person) and other assistance should be used as needed. Continue to educate the patient about the symptoms of adverse effects and the need to immediately stop medication and call the health care provider if symptoms of adverse effects occur. Give ample opportunities for the patient to ask questions. For patients taking 3HP by DOT, the health care worker who administers medications should ask specif ically about any symptoms that may have followed the previous dose. Patients taking 3H P by SAT should be educated at baseline and asked specifically about any symptoms durin g monthly evaluations. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 80 Communicate carefully to ensure that th e patient does not miss appointments or doses: \u00a1 Send reminder communications. \u00a1 Remind the patient to bring in medication bottle(s). \u00a1 Follow up promptly on missed appointm ents to prevent interruption or cessation of treatment. CAUTION Educate the patient to \"STOP all LTBI medications immediately and CALL\" the clinical care team if an y symptoms of adverse effects are suspected. PATIENT PERIODIC CLINICAL ASSESSMENT State and local TB programs may have a state TB nurse consultant or liaison who can provide nurse case ma nagement services or information on clinical standardized assessments tools or that may be utilized. Check the NTCA online directory at http://www.tbcontrollers.org/c ommunity/statecityterritory/ See Section 7: Nurse Case Management for links to examples of nursing assessment tools and resources and more information on nurse case management. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 81 CLINICAL MONITORING At the periodic assessments, perform a symptom review for adverse effects, including unexplained symptoms such as the following: \u00a1 Flu-like symptoms \u00a1 Rash bruising \u00a1 Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss \u00a1 Abdominal pain (especially in the right upper quadrant) \u00a1 Jaundice, dark urine \u00a1 Paresthesia of the hands or feet \u00a1 Persistent fatigue and weakness For patients with symptoms of a possi ble adverse effect, perform directed physical examinations as need ed to evaluate those symptoms. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | isoniazid-containing regimens (3HP, 3HR, 6H, 9H), obtain baseline blood AST, ALT, and CBC for the following patients: \u00a1 All patients with HIV infection \u00a1 Patients with daily or heavy alcohol us e, liver disease, or chronic hepatitis \u00a1 Pregnant and postpartum patients (up to 2 to 3 months after delivery) \u00a1 Patients currently injecting drugs \u00a1 Patients taking other potentially he patotoxic medications or with other risks of hepatotoxicity \u00a1 Patients with prior elevated se rum transaminase concentrations \u00a1 Other patients based on clinical discretion Obtain follow-up tests monthly (or more fr equently when clinically indicated) for patients with the following test results, symptoms, and medical history: \u00a1 Abnormal prior transaminase results \u00a1 Symptoms or signs suggestive of drug-induced hepatotoxicity \u00a1 Inability to give a reliable history for the absence of symptoms of hepatotoxicity \u00a1 Continued heavy or daily alcohol use, regardless of symptoms Additional baseline and periodic labor atory testing should be performed as clinically indicated to evaluate for other potential adverse effects related to LTBI treatment. Offer HIV testing for all patients who do not know their HIV status. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 83 INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT COMPLETION CHALLENGES The health care provider should assess wh at motivates the patient and identify any barriers that may interfere with adhere nce to treatment. The state or local TB program may be able to offer nurse case management services to assist patients in completing treatment. Fo r more information, see Section 7: Nurse Case Management. Treatment with DOT or vDOT provides a direct assessment of the doses taken and missed and offers opportunities to enfo rce patient understanding and assess for adverse effects. For patients taking SAT, gather information for an accurate assessment of medication a dherence. Check patient pill bottles to monitor pill counts. If pill bottles are not avail able, contact the patient's pharmacy to determine the dates and quantities of medication dispensed. Patients commonly over-estimate the number of doses actual ly ingested. Patients who experience minor adverse effects may skip doses to reduce these symptoms; this practice should be discouraged. For patients who have missed doses of their medication, assess and address barriers to treatment adherence to th e extent possible. For example, many patients simply forget to take their medi cation regularly. Advise the patient to take the medication at the same time each day, perhaps in association with a specific meal or an activity such as brushing teeth. Using a calendar or an electronic reminder may be helpful. Other patients may have psychosocial problems, such as homelessness or a substance use disorder, that make adherence difficult. For these patients, co nsider a referral to a social services support agency. For information on identifying ba rriers to treatment completion, see Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen: Interventions for Treatment Completion Challenges. For information on managing regimens when treatment is interrupted, see the Management of Treatment Interruption topic below. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 84 MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EFFECTS Adverse effects vary in severity fr om minor reactions, during which LTBI treatment may be continued with symptomatic management of the adverse effect, to severe reactions, during which treatment must be discontinued. Adverse effects can result in hospitalizati on, serious complications such as liver transplantation, or death. Ea rly detection of adverse effects, especially by the patient, can minimize the risk of such events. When the LTBI regimen needs to be stopped and the adverse effect has resolv ed, often an alternative regimen can be used. The following recommended responses to adverse effects are based on expert opinion. For a list of adverse effects to each drug, see Appendix 2: Drugs for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection. ARTHRITIS \u00a1 Arthralgias are fairly common with is oniazid, sometimes very challenging for the patient although they resolve when drug is stopped. These are not associated with positive markers fo r systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). \u00a1 Isoniazid can also induce SLE or a lupus-like syndrome, with arthralgias and even alopecia. If markers for SL E are positive, discontinue isoniazid and refer the patient to a rheumatologist. \u00a1 Joint pain rarely is caused by the rifamycins. DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS \u00a1 Evaluate for other causes of a rash by obtaining a history for exposure. \u00a1 Discontinue treatment if fever, mu cous membrane involvement, or systemic toxicity occurs with the rash. \u00a1 Maculopapular rash (a fine pink rash) usually resolves without discontinuing an LTBI regimen. It can be treated with over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, other topical agents, or an antihistamine. \u00a1 Significant dermatologic reactions may involve other organ systems. Check laboratory test results for liver, renal, and hematologic toxicity. Consider a dermatology consultation. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 85 GASTROINTESTINAL REACTIONS \u00a1 Gastrointestinal discomfort can be seen early in treatment and may resolve. \u00a1 Nausea may be averted by consuming food with the medication. \u00a1 More severe nausea and sometimes vomiting can occur early in treatment, and LTBI treatment may need to be discontinued. Test serum transaminase concentrations. HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONS thrombocytopenia develo ps, do not re-start rifamycins. \u00a1 If the white blood cell count (WBC ) is decreased, check the absolute neutrophil count (ANC). If the ANC remains >1000, rifampin can generally be continued with frequent mo nitoring of the ANC count. \u00a1 Follow the WBC as needed if a rifam ycin is continued. If leukopenia is marked, stop the rifamycin and refe r the patient to a hematologist. \u00a1 Educate the patient to notify the he alth care provider if signs or symptoms of infection occur or, if th e health care provider cannot be reached, to seek care at a local emergency department. \u00a1 Isoniazid can cause leukopenia, although this is unusual. If the WBC is only slightly decreased, it can be monito red. If leukopenia is marked, stop isoniazid and refer the patient to a hematologist. HEPATOTOXICITY Isoniazid can cause hepatotoxicity, which can be serious and may lead to hospitalization, liver transplantation, or death. Less frequently, rifamycins also may cause hepatotoxicity. ALT (serum glutamic-pyruvic transami glutam ic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) also may indicate injury to heart, kidn ey, and skeletal muscle. Mild elevations in ALT less than 3 times the ULN occur co mmonly in the first month of treatment and are not a reason to stop LTBI treatment. If the bilirubin, alkaline phosphat ase, or both are increased, but the hepatocellular enzymes are minimally elevated, consider evaluation for hepatocellular obstruction and consider othe r causes of hepatitis, such as viral hepatitis, gallstones, or pancreatitis, in the differential diagnosis. Rifampin more commonly causes a cholestatic pattern. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 86 If transaminase levels are >3 times the ULN and the patient is symptomatic, or if the transaminase levels are >5 times the ULN and the patient is not symptomatic, discontinue treatment. If the transaminase levels are greater than normal but <5 times the ULN and the patient has no symptoms, continue treatm ent, but advise the patient to stop medication immediately if symptoms oc cur. Monitor serum transaminase concentrations at least monthly, even if the patient remains asymptomatic. If treatment with isoniazid is discontinu ed, continue laboratory monitoring until transaminases return to normal. Consid er completion of treatment with the 4R regimen, depending on the patient's risk of TB and willingness to complete treatment. See the topic below on Management of Treatment Interruption. CAUTION Counsel all patients t to immediately stop LTBI treatment and return to the clinic for clinical evaluation if they develop symptoms of drug- induced hepatotoxicity. For symptoms of hepatotoxicity, see the symptoms listed above under Clinical Monitoring. Most patients with drug-induced hepato xicity will improve over time after the offending medication is discontinued. Consider a specialty consultation for patients with any of the following: \u00a1 INR or PT/PTT \u00a1 Serum transaminase concentrations persistently greater than normal despite negative initial evaluation for hepatotoxicity, hepatitis, gallstones, and pancreatitis SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 87 HYPERSENSITIVITY (FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS) \u00a1 Fever, chills, muscle pain, headache , and dizziness can occur with any LTBI regimen but are more common wi th intermittently administered rifampin and rifapentine. \u00a1 Patients with mild symptoms can usually complete the 3HP regimen. \u00a1 If symptoms are severe, discontinu e 3HP and consider completion of treatment with isoniazid. Consultati on with a TB expert is advised. OPTIC NEURITIS \u00a1 In rare instances, isoniazid can cause optic neuritis. \u00a1 If the patient experiences blurry visi on or loss of color vision, perform testing for visual acuity with correc tive lenses (Snellen) and red-green color \u00a1 If optic neuritis is suspected, stop isoniazid, and refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. If no abnormalities are found, isoniazid can be resumed. PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY \u00a1 Isoniazid can cause peripheral neurop athy because of induction of the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), especially in patients with HIV infection, poorly controlled di abetes, substance use disorder, and malnutrition. Symptoms include parest hesias and numbness of the feet and hands (with or without peripheral motor weakness). If the patient is not receiving pyridoxine, it should be started. If symptoms persist, discontinue isoniazid and consider an alternative regimen. \u00a1 The neuropathy usually subsides ov er weeks to months, but, if not, consider other causes of neuropathy and consult with a neurologist. \u00a1 Note that daily doses of 100-200 mg or more can cause cumulative toxicity manifesting mainly as neur opathy when pyridoxine is taken chronically. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 88 MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT INTERRUPTION Completion of treatment is based on the number of doses taken in a specified period. Many patients who miss doses can extend treatment until the correct number of doses has been taken. For more information on the number of do ses and duration for each regimen, see Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen and Appendix 3: Dosages for Recommended Treatment Regimens. OPTIONS FOR WHEN DOSES ARE MISSED Most of the following recommendations for management of patients with treatment adherence challenges are based on expert opinion. For patients whose treatment has been interrupted, but who are still able to complete their regimen within the specified period, most expe rts recommend that their treatment be extended until the designated number of doses has been ingested to complete treatment. For patients taking isoniazid, for whom 9 months of treatment is preferable to a shorter duration, consider those who miss doses to ha ve completed treatment if 180 doses (6 months) have been ingested within 9 calendar months, as they are unlikely to complete 270 doses within 12 calendar months. To help overcome identified barriers, consider providing DOT, enablers, and incentives. For more information on strateg ies to facilitate treatment completion, see Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen: Interventions for Treatment Completion Challenges. Consult with your state or local TB program or your regional TB Center of Excellence. For patients who are unable to complete tr eatment within the specified period of time, options include the following: \u00a1 Consider DOT: Change the mode of tr eatment administration to DOT or vDOT, if available, to complete the cu rrent, or an alternative, regimen. For more information on DOT, see Appendix 5: Directly Observed Therapy and Video Directly Observed Therapy. \u00a1 Switch to a different regimen: See the topic below on Changing Treatment Regimens. \u00a1 Discontinue all therapy for LTBI: Reinforce patient education on the symptoms of active TB disease and the importance of seeking care promptly if TB sy mptoms should occur. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 89 CHANGING TREATMENT REGIMENS Many experts recommend completing a full course of the new regimen when switching treatment, particularly if the pers on is at high risk for progression. To minimize the overall duration of trea tment, some experts consider switching from one regimen to another using the foll owing method to calculate the number of doses needed to complete treatment with a different regimen. 1. Completed Dose Count: Count the dose s taken during the first regimen. 2. Proportion of 1st Regimen Completed: Calculate the proportion of the first regimen that was completed. 3. Proportion of 1st Regimen Not Complete d: Subtract the proportion of the regimen completed from 100%. 4. Doses to Complete 2nd Regimen: Mult iply the percentage of the first regimen that was not completed by the number of doses for the full second regimen. The result will be the number of doses needed to complete treatment in the second regimen. SECTION 6: MONITORING AND MANAGING TREATMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 90 FOLLOW-UP AFTER TREATMENT COMPLETION The following recommendations for patient management are based on expert opinion. When the health care prov ider determines that the patient has completed the prescribed regimen, docu mentation of the treatment completion should be entered prominently into the patient's medical record. The patient should be given written documentation of completion as well. Educate the patient about the symptoms of active TB di sease, the importance of seeking care promptly, and where to call if symptoms occur. Patients who had normal findings on chest radiography do not need a follow -up study if they remain asymptomatic. No routine TB follow-up, including chest radiography in the absence of specific indications, is necessary fo llowing treatment completion. The duration of positive IGRA results after M. tuberculosis infection, whether LTBI or active TB disease, has not been ex tensively studied. In some patients, the response to the antigens decreases over m onths or years, but in others, it is durable. Positive TST results are durable in the majority of patients, although the reaction size can decrease over an interval of years, even with intact immunity. In general, patients should not be treated for LTBI more than once, and patients who have completed treatment should not be re-tested for LTBI, even if re- exposed. In certain circumstances, such as a patient who has completed treatment for LTBI who is re-exposed to a patient with active, infectious TB disease, it may be appropriate to re-treat a patient for possible recurrent LTBI due to possible re-infection. Other factors to consider are the infectiousness of the second index patient, whether th e re-exposed patient is immunosuppressed, and whether the patient was previously tr eated by DOT or SAT. Such decisions should be based on the recommendation of the state or local TB program. REFERENCES 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Nurse-guided treatment management has been a model successfully used in public health to promote safety during treatment and incr ease treatment completion rates for persons with LTBI. Health care providers treating patien ts with LTBI are encouraged to use existing nurse case management services in their co mmunity to which their patients may have access or to create new nurse case manage ment programs in their own facilities. GENERAL PRINCIPLES \u00a1 Nurse case management is a strategy for integrating the multiple aspects of patient care and improving outcomes. \u00a1 Nurses providing nurse case management should receive specialized training. RELATED TOPICS \u00a1 Section 3: Pretreatment Clinical Evaluation \u00a1 Section 4: Deciding Whether to Treat and Choosing a Regimen \u00a1 Section 6: Monitoring Treatment \u00a1 Appendix 2: Drugs for Treatment of LTBI \u00a1 Appendix 3: Dosage s for Recommended Treatment Regimens \u00a1 Assessment Tool SECTION 7: NURSE CASE MANAGEMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 94 ROLE The nurse case manager is an integral part of the patient care team and, qualified by knowledge and experience, brings to the team an understanding of the clinical process of assessment, planning, implem entation, and evaluation. The nurse case manager coordinates all aspects of patient care before and during treatment and often works with standardized protocols and procedures under the supervision of the health care provider. With other health care provider staff members and the patient, the nurse case manager works to assess and advocate for the most effective treatment regi men to meet the goal of completing treatment. To help meet that goal, the nurse ca se manager works before and during treatment to assess adherence barriers, the need for incentives, enablers, and DOT or vDOT and to educate the pa tient about LTBI and its treatment. Effective follow-up services, which may in clude nurse case management, with or without DOT, may be provided in a variety of settings: \u00a1 Public health departments \u00a1 Community health centers \u00a1 Employee health programs \u00a1 Correctional facilities \u00a1 Hemodialysis centers \u00a1 Residential and outpatient drug treatment centers \u00a1 Schools and universities \u00a1 Private medical offices \u00a1 Other settings (such as pharmacies, etc.) SECTION 7: NURSE CASE MANAGEMENT Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 95 RESOURCES Nurses providing nurse case management should receive speciali zed training in the treatment of LTBI. Innovative approache s have been developed in many state and local TB programs to provide commun ity health care providers with ongoing education to develop expertise in treating LTBI. A state or local TB nurse consultant or liaison may provide expertise on utilization of nurse case management services and patient education. Check the NTCA online directory for a state/ local TB nurse consultant in your area at http://www.tbcontrollers.org/c ommunity/statecityterritory/ . To review and download an assessment tool for LTBI treatment, see the NTCA website at http://www.tbcontrollers.org/res ources/tb-infection/clinical- recommendations/ . The regional TB Centers of Excellence ar e good sources for further information and assistance on training. A map of the regions and contact information is available at https://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/tb_coe/ . The National TB Nurse Coalition's Tuberculosis Nursing: A Comprehensive Guide to Patient Care manual will provide a comprehensi ve explanation of the role and responsibilities of nurse case managers related to LTBI diagnosis and treatment.

Results for the T-SPOT. TB test are interpreted by subt racting the spot count in the nil control well from the spot count in each of the panels, according to the following algorithm: \u00a1 The test result is positive if (Panel A-Nil) or (Panel B-Nil) is spots and if the nil well has d10 spots. \u00a1 The test result is negative if both (Panel A-Nil) and (Panel B-Nil) are spots and if the nil well has d10 spots and the mitogen well has t20 spots. This includes values less than zero for the corrected Panel A or Panel B. \u00a1 Results where the highest of the Panel A or Panel B spot count is such that the (panel minus nil) spot count is 5, 6, or 7 spots shou ld be considered borderline (equivocal). Retesting is the routine option for a result of borderline. \u00a1 If the result is still borderline (equivocal) on retesting with another specimen, then other diagnostic tests or epidemiologic information should be used to help determine TB infection status of the patient. \u00a1 The test result is invalid for one of tw o conditions: (1) a mitogen (positive) control response is <20 spots while both (Panel A-Nil) and (Panel B-Nil) are spots; or (2) a nil (negative) cont rol count is >10 spots, regardless of the responses to antigens and mitogen.

There are three antimycobacterial rifamy cins used for the treatment of LTBI: rifapentine, rifampin, and rifabutin. Thes e drugs are used in different dosages and for specific purposes, and they may not be interchangeable in the regimens. CAUTION Prescribing providers and pharmacis ts who are unfamiliar with the rifamycins might confuse the three drugs: r rifampin, rifapentine, and rifabutin are different drugs, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medica tion and the correct dose for the intended regimen. ALERT Concerns about nitrosamine contamin ation in rifapentine and rifampin are under investigation. For a summary of what is currently known and recommended, see the NTCA website at http://www.tbcontrollers.o rg/resources/nitrosamines/ . DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION CHECKERS Known drug-drug interactions are li sted under each drug. However, because information on drug-drug interactions changes frequently, research potential interactions online at the following websites: x Drugs.com: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 102 RIFAPENTINE (P, RPT, or RFP) is a long-acti ng rifamycin that has been shown to be effective for LTBI when given in combination with isoniazid once weekly for 12 doses. It should not be used alone. It is used in combination with isoniazid for the treatment of LTBI. PREPARATION \u00a1 Tablets: 150 mg DOSAGE Adults and kg: 900 mg \u00a1 Maximum dose 900 mg ADMINISTRATION Administration of rifapentine with high-f at meals increases the area under the curve and the maximum serum concentration by 40 to 50%. However, the clinical significance of such an effect is unknown, as rifamycins generally have a wide therapeutic window (that is, that they are safe and effe ctive at a wide range of serum concentrations). For persons who cannot swallow tablets, the tablets may be crushed and added to a small amou nt of semi-solid food and consumed immediately. Oral bioavailability is 70%. abdominal pain diarrhea vomiting APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | and cerebrospinal fluid); fl u-like syndrome (usually only with intermittent administration) MAJOR DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS The drug-drug interactions of rifapentin e are similar to the other rifamycins. Like all rifamycin drugs, rifapentine is an P450 isoenzymes. Potential drug-drug interactions with rifapentine should be anticipated for all drugs that have been found to interact with rifampin. The magnitude of the interactions may be less when the drug s are used intermittently and at a lower dose. Similar to rifampin, rifapentine has seri ous significant interactions with some drugs used for hepatitis C, rilpivir ine, warfarin derivatives and other anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, hormonal contraceptives, opioids, some HIV antiretrovirals, glipizide, glyburide, oral contraceptives, trazadone, and sildenafil. See the rifampin section below for ot her potential drug-drug interactions. After determining what medications and drugs the patient is taking, research potential interactions online using one of the interactive online drug checkers in the introduction to this appendix.

APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 104 RIFAMPIN Rifampin (R, RIF, or RMP) is a bactericidal drug. PREPARATIONS \u00a1 Capsules: 150 and 300 mg \u00a1 Oral liquid: Powder from capsules ca n be suspended by a pharmacist for oral administration. \u00a1 IV: Lyophilized powder Daily: 20-30 mg/kg, maximum 600 mg/day ADMINISTRATION Rifampin should be administered on an empt y stomach (i.e., 1 hour prior to, or 2 hours after meals or antacid s) for increased and rapid absorption; food (high-fat meals) delays absorption and decreases bioavailability (by ~16%). However, the clinical significance of such an effect is unknown, as rifamycins generally have a wide therapeutic window (tha t is, that they are safe and effective at a wide range of serum concentrations). For persons who cannot swallow tablets, op tions include: (a) mixing the contents of capsule(s) with applesauce or jelly ; and (b) extemporaneously compounded oral solutions that should be shake n well before ingesting and have any remaining solution discarded after 28 days. (Suspensions may need to be compounded by a pharmacist.) Oral bioavailability is initially 90 to 95% but decreases to 68 to 70% after 3 weeks due to autoinduction of its own metabolism. RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS \u00a1 Active viral hepatitis \u00a1 End-stage liver disease APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 105 ADVERSE Pruritus, skin rash (0.8%), flushing \u00a1 Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal in tolerance (nausea and/or vomiting and cerebrospinal fluid); fl u-like syndrome (usually only with intermittent administration) DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS Rifampin has numerous drug-drug interact ions. Rifampin induces the activity of cytochrome P-450 enzymes, thereby increa sing the metabolism and decreasing serum levels and effectiveness of many drugs, including opioids, warfarin derivatives and other anticoagulants, gl ucocorticoids, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, theophylline, and levothyroxine. Patients on hormonal contraceptives should be encouraged to continue the hormonal contraceptive but also to use a barrier method for contraception. For more information on the CDC recommendations on the use of contraceptive methods during treatment with rifampin, see the Summary Chart of U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use at https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth /contraception/pdf /summary-chart- english-bw-508-tagged.pdf Before prescribing any drug, health ca re providers should use one of the interactive online drug checkers in the introduction to this appendix. ALERT Concerns about nitrosamine contamin ation in rifapentine and rifampin are under investigation.

APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 106 RIFABUTIN Rifabutin (RB, RBT, or RBU) is a bacterici dal drug. Although clinical studies have not directly assessed the efficacy of ri fabutin for the treatment of LTBI, some experts consider that it may be substituted for rifampin in many cases. Like rifampin, rifabutin induces the activity of cytochrome P-450 enzymes, but to a lesser degree. Rifabutin is not approved fo r treatment of LTBI, so this is an off- label use. PREPARATION \u00a1 Tablets: 150 mg 5-10 mg/kg, maximum 300 mg/day ADMINISTRATION Rifabutin can be administered with or without food. It can be administered with food in persons with gastrointestinal into lerance. A high-fat meal may decrease the rate, but not the extent, of absorpt ion. For persons who cannot swallow tablets, options include mixing of t ablet(s) with applesauce. The oral bioavailability is approximately 16 to 20%. ADVERSE EFFECTS \u00a1 increased by concomitant administration of drugs that increase serum concentration) \u00a1 Other: Orange-red discoloration of sputum, feces, and cerebrospinal fluid); flu- like syndrome (usually only with intermittent administration) APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 107 MAJOR DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS Rifabutin induces the activity of cyto chrome P-450 enzymes, but to a lesser degree than rifampin, thereby increasing the metabolism and decreasing serum levels and effectiveness of many drugs, including opioids, warfarin derivatives and other anticoagulants, glucocorticoid s, hormonal contraceptives, oral hypoglycemic agents, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, theophylline, and levothyroxin e. Rifabutin reduces the efficacy of the antiretroviral medication tenofovir alafenamide through another mechanism to a similar degree as rifampin. Patients on hormonal contraceptives should be encouraged to continue the hormonal contraceptive but also to use a barrier method for contraception. For more information on the CDC recommendations on the use of contraceptive methods during treatment with rifabutin, see the Summary Chart of U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use at https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth /contraception/pdf /summary-chart- english-bw-508-tagged.pdf Before prescribing any drug, health care providers should use one of the interactive online drug checkers in the introduction to this appendix. APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 108 ISONIAZID Isoniazid (H or INH) is a bactericidal drug. PREPARATIONS \u00a1 Tablets: 100 and 300 mg \u00a1 Syrup: 50 mg/5 mL (not recommended because of sorbitol-induced gastrointestinal side effects and the difficulties of accurate measurement of dose and assessment of adherence) DOSAGE Adults: \u00a1 Daily: 5 mg/kg/day, maximum 900 mg (DOT) \u00a1 Dosing for 3HP (rounded to the nearest 50 to 100 mg): \u0017 Aged 12-17 years: 15 Aged 2-11 years: 25 mg/kg, maximum 900 mg NOTE ON ISONIAZID PEDIATRIC DOSING The isoniazid dose ranges for children are taken from Table 4 in Sterling TR, Njie G, Zenner D, et al. Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendatio ns from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and MMWR Recomm Rep . 2020;69(No. RR-1):1-11. doi: http://dx.doi.or g/10.15585/mmwr.rr6901a1. However, some pediatric experts recommend lower dosages, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an isoniazid dosage of 10-15 mg/kg for the daily regimen and 20-30 mg/kg for the twice-weekly regimen. APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 | 109 ADMINISTRATION Isoniazid should be taken with water on an empty stomach 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals because food significantl y reduces bioavailability. If the patient is unable to swallow tablets, the tablet may be crushed and mixed in a portion of soft food or liquid, or starch-based pud ding (chocolate pudding, for example) and administered as a slurry. Oral bioavailability of isoniazid is near ly 100% on an empty stomach, but peak concentration may be reduced up to 50% with a fatty meal. CONTRAINDICATIONS \u00a1 History of a severe adverse reaction to isoniazid (such as drug-induced liver injury, fever, chills, or arthritis) \u00a1 Hypersensitivity to isoniazid or any component of the formulation \u00a1 Acute liver disease \u00a1 Close TB contact with a person with isoniazid-resistant TB RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS \u00a1 Active viral or exfoliative); acne (exacerbation that does not respond to topical anti-acne medications and that resolves when isoniazid is discontinued) \u0017 Hair: Minor hair loss (uncommon, and recovers after completion of treatment); alopecia (rare; may be the first manifestation of SLE, so check for markers of SLE includi ng anti-nuclear antibodies; if associated with mucous membrane involvement, exfoliation, or fever, then stop isoniazid immediately and consider consultation with a dermatologist) APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | hepatitis from isoniazid is idiosyncratic (i.e., independent of do se) and the risk increases depending on risk factors (increasing age, pre-existing liver disease, heavy alcohol use, HIV infection, injection drug use, possibly the immediate postpartum period, and concomitant administration of medications with hepatotoxic potential. \u0017 Mild and transient elevation of transaminases (10-20%) that is asymptomatic and resolves despite continuation of therapy (See Section 5: Considerations for Specific Populations: Persons with Comorbidities: Liver Disease and Chronic Hepatitis and Section 6: Monitoring and Managing Treatment: Management of Adverse Effects.) \u0017 Severe hepatitis, with transaminase greater than 5 times the ULN (0.5% in persons <35 years of age without identifiable risk factors, to as high as 5.2% in persons wi th a renal failure) which, if not recognized early, can be fatal (1 to 7 per 100,000). The FDA has issued a black box warning. Severe hepatitis may be ameliorated by promptly (dose-related: in adults, 0.2% at dosage of 5 mg/kg/day but without pyridoxine supplementation; 10-20% in adults if dosed at 10 mg/kg/day; increased risk in persons with pre-existing ne uropathy or the following conditions: age >50 somnolence; insomnia; toxic psy chosis; memory impairment Note that daily doses of pyridoxi ne of 100-200 mg or more can cause cumulative toxicity manifesting mainly as neuropathy when pyridoxine is taken chronically. APPENDIX 2: DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LTBI Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommendati ons | February 2021 itraconazole, and ketoconazole. \u00a1 Isoniazid's serum decreased by systemic corticosteroids. \u00a1 Isoniazid's absorption may be reduced if taken less than one hour before, or less than 2 hours after, taking a luminum-containing antacids (Mylanta or Gelusil, for example). DRUG-FOOD INTERACTIONS When taking isoniazid, the consumption of foods and beverages with a high monoamine content\u2014tyramine (aged cheeses, red wines, soy sauce, bananas, avocadoes, for example) or histamine (scombroid fish, including tuna, for example)\u2014can cause monoamine poisoning (headache, skin flushing, sweating, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pruritus). Before prescribing any drug, health ca re providers should use one of the interactive online drug checkers in th e introduction to this appendix. VITAMIN B6 (PYRIDOXINE) Isoniazid can increase pyridoxine me tabolism, which can lead to peripheral neuropathy. Give 25 mg/day of pyridoxine for patients with symptoms of, or at increased risk of, peripheral neuropathy (see above). Note that daily doses of pyridoxine of 100-200 mg or more can ca use cumulative toxicity manifesting mainly as neuropathy when pyridoxine is taken chronically.

Rifapentine is formulated as 150 mg tablets in blist er packs that should be ke pt sealed until use. \u00a7 Intermittent regimens must be provided via directly observed therapy (i.e., a health care worker observes the ingestion of me dication). \u00b6 Rifampin (rifampicin) is formulat ed as 150 mg and 300 mg capsules. ** When rifampin cannot be used because of significant drug-drug interactions, you may be able to use rifabutin. Note that rifa butin has a different dosing. See Section 4 and Appendix 2 . The American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges that some ex perts use rifampin at 20-30 mg/kg for the daily regimen when pre scribing for infants and toddlers (Source: American Academy of Pediatrics.

Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberc ulosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommen dations | February 2021 | 116 Appendix 4: Collaborations Between the Public Health Department and Community Service Providers PURPOSE Collaborations between clinical care serv ices outside the health department and those within the health department wi ll increase the number of patients completing treatment for LTBI in the community by bringing together complementary resources: \u00a1 Stable connections to specific communi ties where the prevalence of LTBI or factors associated with the risk of progression to TB disease warrants a focused intervention \u00a1 Systems that are designed for cont inuity of health care and data collection \u00a1 Infrastructure, such as clinic space, vehicles, and communication networks \u00a1 Personnel, such as nurses, midlevel health care providers, pharmacists, community outreach workers, mental health social workers, community councils, and volunteers \u00a1 Funding, as part of programs for prev entive or general integrated health care \u00a1 Integration of expertise and experi ence, in the areas of community relations, communications, health education, public health and surveillance, quality assu rance, system operations, infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and TB diagnosis and treatment APPENDIX 4: COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARMTENT AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberc ulosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommen dations | February 2021 | 117 SETTINGS Settings where primary care services ar e delivered, such as health care maintenance organizations, community he alth centers, and private medical clinics, should add or improve TB prevention services selectively based on the TB epidemiology for their service population. Consultation with the state or local TB program is recommended for making this determination. Some settings have service populations or circumstances that may be historically associated with TB. Examples of these settings are listed below. \u00a1 Health care systems that are dedica ted to specific groups, such as the following: \u0017 Clinics providing services for hi storically underserved populations including minorities, low-income communities, migrant or seasonal farm workers, or persons experiencing homelessness \u0017 Health clinics at colleges and universities with substantial immigrant or international student enrollment \u0017 Centers for refugees and immigrants \u0017 Clinics with designated civil surgeons \u0017 Employee health clinics of selec ted institutions or facilities \u00a1 Specialty care for conditions that are associated with TB disease, especially if patients can be tested and treated at these clinics with continuity of care, for example: \u0017 Dialysis centers or nephrology clinics clinics \u0017 Rheumatology, dermatology, gastroenterology for patients who are immunosuppressed by biologic agents \u0017 Treatment centers for persons living with HIV/AIDS \u0017 Drug treatment programs including methadone treatment facilities \u00a1 Institutions such as correctional facilities, long-term care facilities, or shelters with onsite health care for persons experiencing homelessness \u00a1 Facilities of national agencies for he alth care or including health care services: \u0017 Indian Health Service \u0017 Tribally operated hospitals and clinics \u0017 US Department of Veterans Affairs \u0017 Military installations \u0017 Bureau of Prisons Testing and Treatment of Latent Tuberc ulosis Infection in the United States NSTC/NTCA Clinical Recommen dations | February 2021 | 118 Appendix 5: Directly Observed Therapy and Video Directly Observed Therapy The three common types of treatment admi nistration in the United States are in- person directly observed therapy (DOT), video directly observed therapy (vDOT) live or recorded, and self-administered th erapy (SAT). With DO T, a trained health care worker is physically present when the patient ingests the medications and uses a symptom checklist for adverse e ffects. Studies have shown that DOT ensures that the number of doses ingested and treatment duration are as close as possible to the target and verifies that treatment is completed . DOT is generally recommended for persons who are not adhe rent with SAT or have one of the following barriers to adherence: use of drugs or alcohol, homelessness, or psychiatric or cognitive impairment. In practice, individual providers or programs may use additional or different criteria for selecting the mode of administration. vDOT (sometimes referred to as electr onic DOT or eDOT) has emerged using secure platforms for live or recorded videos that facilitate observing medication ingestions remotely. vDOT provides greater patient flexibility while still ensuring the safe and effective completion of trea tment. Live vDOT usually requires the patients to take treatment during normal business hours when a trained health care worker is available to observe them. Recorded vDOT also allows patients to take medications at a time that is most convenient for them. vDOT can also facilitate more frequent dosing whil e still maintaining observation including weekends, holidays, and when a patient is travelling.
