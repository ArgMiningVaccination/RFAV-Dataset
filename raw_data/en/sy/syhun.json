Huang et al. developed and tested their own single-dose mRNA vaccine, mRNA-RBD, on groups of transgenic mice, using polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) RNA as a placebo control. Their goal was to address the questionable lasting power of the current vaccines by evaluating the duration of the neutralizing antibody response following immunization with their RBD-mRNA vaccine. Groups of female mice were injected with 15 micrograms of either the mRNA vaccine or the poly(C) control; half the group was euthanized at 8 weeks, and the other half was tested periodically to determine their humoral immune response. Their results demonstrated that for more than 6 months following inoculation, there were high levels of the protective antibodies present. This data indicated that their RBD-encoding mRNA vaccine was successful at providing long-term protection. However, the paper indicated that further studies are necessary to investigate the involvement of memory B cells in the vaccine response. Presence and strength of binding of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19 infection2 The researchers performed a high throughput Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) assay to measure the level of IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Samples were collected from 53 unique COVID-19 patients and controls were collected from healthy pregnant women. According to the analysis, the results from IgG SPR correlated with the results from S1 domain ELISA and the total Ig SPR results were also similar to the ECLIA total Ig results, showing the efficiency of the technique. Additionally, the affinity equilibrium constant (KD) correlated with the off-rate (Kd), making the off-rate good ranker of binding strength for SARS-CoV-2 antigens and simplifying the high throughput test. Through this analysis, the researchers concluded that low concentrations of high avidity anti-RBD antibodies can effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and the SPRi can be used to adequately determine the neutralizing effects of IgG after vaccination. COVID-19 Research Watch May 31, 2021 2 CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND MANAGEMENT Estimating infectiousness throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection course3 Using viral load and viral replication in cell culture, Jones et al. evaluated the course of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity among patients with varying ages, genders, and symptom severity. The authors analyzed 936,423 RT-PCR results from patients between 0-100 years in Germany, from February 24, 2020 to April 2, 2021. In addition to age and gender, patients were sorted as pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic (PAMS). Patients who tested positive were sorted into three categories: hospitalized, PAMS, and other. Across all ages, hospitalized patients held higher viral loads than PAMS patients. The time between the start of viral shedding and peak viral load was estimated to be 4.3 days, indicating that infectivity can begin before patients experience symptoms of COVID-19. Patients infected with the B.1.1.7 strain of SARS-CoV-2 were estimated to have a 1 log10 higher first-positive viral load compared to those infected with a wild-type strain (meaning cell replication was 2.6 times more likely). The authors acknowledge that estimating viral load was difficult because samples were obtained at unknown points in the disease course of the tested individual, and it is possible that differences in behavior due to milder symptoms may have caused PAMS subjects to be tested later than hospitalized patients, on average. Overall, PAMS patients were found to have similar levels of infectivity has hospitalized patients, with the authors suggesting that individuals experiencing mild symptoms can still trigger outbreaks in communities. Patient care and clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to African high-care or intensive care units (ACCCOS): a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study4 The African COVID-19 Critical Care Outcomes Study (ACCCOS) was developed to determine which resources, patient comorbidities, and critical care interventions were associated with mortality or survival in study participants. Eligible participants for this prospective, observational cohort study included adults who were referred to intensive care or high-care units with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in 10 participating African countries. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality after 30 days. Out of the 3140 patients that participated, 2995 were confirmed positive for COVID; the in-hospital mortality after 30 days was 48.2%. The most common comorbidities were increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. There was an excess mortality of 11-23 deaths per 100 patients in Africa when compared to the global rate, with critical care in-hospital mortality higher in African countries. The scarcity of critical care resources, inadequate critical care beds, and under-resourced critical care facilities (inability to provide dialysis, proning, ECMO) likely contributed to this reported increased rate.

The data on COVID-19 cases were self-reported by parents, staff members, or local public health officials, and the data on preventative strategies were collected from an online survey sent to principals, nurses, and other school representatives. It was found that in schools with improved ventilation strategies, COVID-19 incidence was 39% lower. In addition, schools with regulations requiring teachers and other staff to wear masks, COVID-19 incidence was 37% lower. Overall, a 35% decrease in COVID-19 incidence was associated with schools which implemented dilution methods, such as turning on fans or opening windows and doors, or a 48% decrease when dilution methods were combined with filtration methods, such as high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). Ultimately, the research team urges teachers and staff members to continue to wear masks, vaccinate themselves, and ventilate, especially in areas where people are most likely to have COVID-19 (nurse's office), to return to in-person learning. PHARMACUETICAL INTERVENTIONS Effects of different types of written vaccination information on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK (OCEANS-III): a single-blind, parallel-group, randomised control trial6 Freeman et al. developed the Oxford Coronavirus Explanations, Attitudes, and Narratives Survey III (OCEANS-III) to understand how different types of written information impact one's willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. First, participants answered a question to determine whether they were \"willing\", \"doubtful\", or \"strongly hesitant\" to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Then, they read different messages addressing personal benefits, collective benefits, seriousness of the pandemic, safety concerns, and combinations of the former, with a statement about the overall effectiveness and safety of the vaccine being the control. After reading their assigned message, participants completed the Oxford COVID vaccine hesitancy scale and the Oxford vaccine confidence and complacency scale. For participants who were \"willing\" or \"doubtful\", statements regarding vaccine efficacy and safety did not change hesitancy levels. As the hesitancy level increased, participants negative attitude towards the vaccine, also increased. For those who were strongly hesitant, learning about the personal benefits was significantly more effective in reducing hesitancy than learning about the collective benefits. Those who were strongly hesitant also had concerns regarding the safety of the vaccines given the speed at which they were developed. When this concern was addressed, hesitancy also decreased. Focusing on the personal benefits and debunking misinformation are key targets for reducing vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 Research Watch May 31, 2021 4 Public Trust and Willingness to Vaccinate Against COVID-19 in the US From October 14, 2020, to March 29, 20217 Daly et al. conducted a nationally representative quantitative study to evaluate the changes in public trust in vaccination and vaccine hesitancy among 7,420 participants following the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Over the course of the 5-month period, participants completed a total of 42,154 questionnaires measuring their likeliness to vaccinate, their trust in the government's approval process for COVID-19 vaccines, and more generally for the development of other vaccines. The researchers found that vaccine hesitancy significantly declined overall across all demographics (10.8% decline) and were most prevalent among Hispanic and Black participants (15.8% and 20.9% decline, respectively). When compared to reports of public trust in vaccination during October 2020, there was an increase across all demographics by the end of the study period in March 2021. The results of this study indicated that a decrease in vaccine hesitancy was consistent with the national vaccine rollout and government's approval of COVID-19 vaccines. Despite the decline in this study, vaccine hesitancy is still prevalent among minority groups who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This research serves as a stepping stone for opportunities to continue building public trust and support and identify the needs of marginalized communities to protect them from COVID-19. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Adolescents Aged 12-15 Years \u2014 United States, May 20218 Wallace et al. published a report highlighting the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) interim recommendation to approve the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for adolescents ages 12-15. The ACIP conducted a systematic review of all available data regarding the benefits, harms, preferences and values of families of the COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, this interim recommendation was largely influenced by evidence of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial using the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine conducted on 2,200 adolescents 12-15 years old. The results of the trial showed 100% efficacy in preventing symptoms, high immune response towards the SARS-CoV-2 infection, low frequency of serious adverse medical events, and no safety concerns were reported. Overall, the researchers emphasized that addressing COVID-19 among adolescents is critical to slowing and controlling transmission. In order to address health disparities and inequity among populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, collaboration and engagement is required at a community level and systems level. COVID-19 Research Watch May 31, 2021 5 TRANSMISSION PATTERNS COVID-19 in Amazonas, Brazil, was driven by the persistence of endemic lineages and P.1 emergence9 Researchers in the Brazilian state Amazonas investigated how the progression of COVID-19 outbreaks in the state were driven by different lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Between March 16, 2020 and January 13, 2021, the authors created 250 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from different patient samples in the region. Five lineages were identified; during the first peak in early May 2020, the B.1.195 lineage dominated the prevalence of viral strains. This strain was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 over the summer, and quickly replaced by P.1, a CDC-classified variant of concern, in December 2020. Between December 2020 and January 2021, P.1 exponentially grew to become the most prevalent strain in Amazonas. The authors suggest a relationship between the different SARS-CoV-2 clades and social distancing protocols in Amazonas. They concluded that the rise of Re values in different clades correlated with more relaxed social distancing regulations. They also predicted that the population of Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas, reached herd immunity from natural infection in October 2020, suggesting that the P.1 variant that caused the December 2020 outbreak and collapse of the Manaus health system successfully evaded immunity gained from prior infection with different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The authors recognize that their modelling may have overestimated the SARS-CoV-2 attack rate in Manaus, and therefore possibly overestimating the natural immunity in Manaus in late 2020. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Iquitos, Peru in July and August, 2020: a population-based study10 Alvarez-Antonio et al conducted a population-based cohort study in Iquitos, Peru, interviewing eligible individuals and collecting Rapid test results to examine the seroprevalence of IgG or IgM antibodies. The first test was completed July 13-18, 2020, as a baseline, and a second follow-up test was completed August 13-18, 2020. From the 716 participants included, results estimate a seroprevalence of 70% at baseline and an adjusted seroprevalence of 66% during the follow-up period. It was observed that there was a significantly higher seroprevalence of COVID-19 in children younger than 12 years, which was similar to that of adults older than 60. The seroprevalence findings at the two time points showed that most people were infected with COVID-19 by July 2020 and transmission was low, indicated by a small increase in seroprevalence in August 2020. Low transmission did not stop the second wave of infections experienced in Peru in January 2021, which may have been due to a COVID-19 variant.
