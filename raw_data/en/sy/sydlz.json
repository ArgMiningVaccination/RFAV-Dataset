We also feature the Character, Service and Leadership programme at Rhodes h ouse, a set of focal events where we discuss the core values behind the Scholarship and the elements of a good life. This same ethos lies behind one of our most significant partnerships to date, with The Atlantic Philanthropies, which provides support for the core Rhodes Scholarships, enables greater convening, as well as hosting mid-career Fellows. We outline this in more detail within this issue of the magazine, as well as the tremendous news of the geographic expansion of the Scholarships. I hope you enjoy reading it! Rhodes House NewsCharles Conn (Massachusetts & Balliol 1983) Warden of Rhodes h ouse Selected Speakers at Rhodes House Naomi Wolf (Connecticut & New College 1985) and Elleke Boehmer (South Africa-at-Large & St John's 1985) advised and coached Rhodes Scholars on how the female voice has been suppressed, and how it can be expressed. Male and female Rhodes Scholars listened to e lleke's thoughts on her recently published fifth book, The Shouting in the Dark and Indian Arrivals: 1870-1915 . Naomi raised awareness of the pervasive inequities that exist in society and politics. She encouraged Scholars to take charge of their lives, voice their concerns and enact change. Naomi particularly focused on reclaiming the strong female voice. Patrick Pichette (Qu\u00e9bec & Pembroke 1987), formerly Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc., spoke to Rhodes Scholars about the impact of the d igital e conomy, his life and travels after Google, and how he co-founded the Kenauk Institute, a centre for ecological studies. h e left Scholars pondering several questions. Will robots replace workers? Will the world continue to be divided into countries? Is capitalism failing? You can follow his travels via his blog: pichette.org. Swati Mylavarapu (Florida & Wolfson 2005), a venture investor at KPCB, gave a co-talk with her husband Matt Rogers, Co-Founder of Nest, on ' entrepreneurship, Innovation and Impact: Lessons from Silicon Valley'. They provided honest and practical advice on tech start-ups and whether you can build great companies, change the world for the better, and be successful on an individual basis. Rhodes Scholar Blog Since we launched this new online initiative in January 2016, the Rhodes Scholar Blog has hosted an engaging variety of articles on subjects ranging from refugee rights to celebrations of Pi. The blog showcases the excellent research of Rhodes Scholars and allows them to share their insights on topical issues. So far we have featured blogs on health access, social justice, issues of the day, life at Oxford, global challenges, and leadership and public service. Our most read posts have covered topics on stroke care in Canada, why young people apply for a Rhodes Scholarship, and the urgent need to improve global healthcare standards. We have reached across the generations with Scholars from 1971 to 2015 contributing their knowledge and expertise to the blog, and we look forward to its continued growth with great anticipation. If you would like to write a post, please email Claire at claire.skilton@rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk Portrait Unveiled Lucy Banda-Sichone (Zambia & Somerville 1978) was an influential Zambian human rights activist and her life has been honoured through the commissioning of the first female Rhodes Scholar portrait in Milner h all at Rhodes h ouse. The artist, d eidre Saunders (Rhodesia & Somerville 1978), has captured the essence of the 'Lucy she knew at Somerville' - an individual full of passion and determination. The portrait was unveiled by two Zambian Rhodes Scholars from the Class of 2015, Karen Mumba and Kabeleka Kabeleka. They spoke passionately about the impact Ms Banda-Sichone had during her lifetime and the need for such life stories to be celebrated through visual representation. This project was supported by Ann Olivarius (Connecticut & Somerville 1978), Chair of McAllister Olivarius and Founder of the Rhodes Project, Tony Abrahams (Australia-at-Large & Balliol 1998), Chief executive Officer of Ai-Media and Charles Conn (Massachusetts & Balliol 1983), Warden of the Rhodes Trust. Rhodes Biomedicine The Rhodes Biomedicine Conference brought Rhodes Scholars and leading industry experts together to discuss the opportunities and challenges in medicine over the next 20 years. It also provided a space for networking, sharing ideas and career guidance for current Medical Sciences students at Oxford. The conference is part of the annual calendar of events at Rhodes h ouse. 4 5 Rhodes Scholar Making Waves with Big Bets On 1 June we announced a \u00a375 million partnership with The Atlantic Philanthropies, which includes support for the core Scholarships, expanded convening, and hosting of a new international network of Atlantic Fellows at the Atlantic Institute at Rhodes House. \"From its inception, Atlantic has invested in people and in their vision and ability to realise a better world. In our final year of grantmaking, we are making our largest philanthropic investment ever, in people. Atlantic's grant to the Rhodes Trust is one of a series of big bets to create an interconnected set of Atlantic Fellows programmes. Our vision for the Atlantic Fellows programmes is to connect and empower a new generation of people who are committed to working together, across disciplines and borders, to build fairer, healthier, more inclusive societies. The Rhodes Trust has built an unparalleled community of leaders with a commitment to serve others and better society. Their experience and their vision to amplify the impact of the existing network of Rhodes Scholars make them an ideal partner to connect and strengthen the new Atlantic Fellows programmes and their prospect for impact. \" Christopher G. Oechsli, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Atlantic Philanthropies\"The Rhodes Trust is delighted to be announcing the launch of the Atlantic Institute. This is a significant development in the Trust's 113 year history and allows us to advance our goal of promoting collaboration among global leaders. The Rhodes Scholarships are designed to inspire generations of talented young people to do good throughout the world. \" Sir John Hood (New Zealand & Worcester 1976), Chairman of the Rhodes TrustWhat is the new Atlantic Institute? up to six Atlantic Fellowship Programmes with hubs across the globe will each select 20-40 mid-career Fellows a year, to complete one to two year programmes in a variety of countries. The Atlantic Institute is a convening and knowledge-sharing central hub for this global network of Atlantic Fellows, which will be hosted at Rhodes house. dynamic, accomplished leaders and thinkers, Atlantic Fellows are researchers, teachers, health professionals, activists, scholars, entrepreneurs, artists, writers, government officials and others dedicated to tackling global challenges to health, equity, opportunity and inclusion. Why partner with The Atlantic Philanthropies? The Atlantic Philanthropies is an international, limited-life foundation established by entrepreneur Charles F. Feeney. There is a terrific overlap of ethos and values between us. They are interested in supporting the Scholarships, as well as their new programme of mid-career fellows working in areas such as brain health, health equity, inequality and social change. There is a strong correlation with current Rhodes Scholar interests, and the potential for joint convening in these areas. It is supportive of our move from individual achievement towards collaborative problem solving and lifelong fellowship.What is the future vision? Connecting Atlantic Fellows around the world, the Atlantic Institute will maximise their impact in addressing persistent challenges to societies locally and globally. The grant will also enable the Atlantic Institute to provide support to Fellows and alumni throughout their careers, including global topic convenings, leadership development and cohort building. There will also be annual innovation prizes for Atlantic Fellows and alumni to develop and implement particularly creative and effective ideas. What else will this new partnership provide? The Atlantic Institute grant also includes a capital project at Rhodes h ouse to develop an expanded convening space. It will grow the capacity of Rhodes h ouse to 750, including a large presentation, arts and theatre space below ground level. The funding from The Atlantic Philanthropies is also fortifying the core Rhodes Scholarships. How will Rhodes Scholars and Atlantic Fellows connect? We expect a high degree of interaction between Rhodes Scholars and Atlantic Fellows, including mentoring and Rhodes Scholars becoming candidates for future Atlantic Wilson, researcher at u CSF Medical School.

You have described the role of Baltimore City Health Commissioner as your dream job - what makes it so great? It is a humbling realisation as a physician that what will impact care and outcomes for our patients is not just what happens in our hospitals but the services provided outside of the healthcare setting including housing, transportation and the built environment. In my role, I can influence policy and deliver services so that we can care for our most vulnerable individuals. I oversee an agency of over 1,000 people. It is the oldest continuously operating health department in the u nited States and our core principle is creating health equity. We believe that health is not just healthcare, it is also about delivering the right services across the city and changing longstanding policies to reduce rampant disparities and level the playing field of opportunity. Did you predict this career path when you were still a Rhodes Scholar in Oxford? I never thought I would have this opportunity at this time in my career - perhaps twenty years further down the line - but to have this opportunity now is not only something I am very grateful for, but something I intend to make the best use of. I want to serve Baltimore at a time of great need. I get to combine I consider all 620,000 residents of Baltimore as my patientsmy experience of clinical medicine with public policy and serving the community. Receiving the Rhodes Scholarship has been instrumental in my career; it gave me a lot of confidence and enabled me to pursue my goals boldly. If you could have three wishes for the city of Baltimore, what would they be? First, I would address poverty. Almost all diseases are diseases of poverty and unless we can increase the standard of living and the rate of employment we are not going to be able to improve health. Secondly, I would want health to be considered when all public policy decisions are made. We always discuss the fiscal impact; why not also ask about the health impact of every decision? Thirdly, I would want people to see addiction and mental illness as the diseases that they are. We should not stigmatise any disease and we should prioritise mental and emotional wellbeing as much as we prioritise physical wellbeing. There is a difference between how addiction is perceived between rich and poor, so it is also a question of equity and social justice. You have a terrific Twitter feed and you recently mentioned being on a panel with President Obama. What was the conversation? It was another of those incredible opportunities which I never expected I would have! I was honoured to be invited to share Baltimore's innovative approaches to addiction treatment with the President. Baltimore has often been in the news for all the wrong reasons, with violence, crime and unrest, but we have done a great deal - we are also a national model of addiction recovery and resilience. I was glad to share this with the President, though I was very nervous as I wanted to represent our city well. My Chief of Staff's advice to me was: \" don't throw up\" so at least I was starting with a low baseline! Addiction needs to be tackled nationally - we have to increase funding for treatment as if we only save a life at the point of overdose then we simply tread water. We have to share stories that recovery is possible.You have worked together with another Rhodes Scholar - Fagan Harris (Maryland/DC & St John's 2011), who is the founder of Baltimore Corps. What did that collaboration entail? Fagan and I have been working closely together. This year, I fundraised for and recruited seven Baltimore Fellows from Baltimore Corps to work at the health department on public health priorities. It works for both of us as the Fellows have brought incredible value to the department, and, for Fagan, his programme has been able to expand. The model works very well but requires both investment by the host organisation and a partner like the Baltimore Corps who are committed to selecting and training great people committed to service. What does the public policy aspect of your job involve? I can get involved in the entire spectrum, from problem identification to policy change to service delivery. For example, when synthetic drugs became a problem and sickened Baltimore youth, we mobilised the community, conducted outreach to young people and teachers, educated over 1,000 grocers and storeowners to stop selling them, and then passed legislation to impose civil and criminal penalties. Within three months we identified the problem, advocated for legal change, succeeded, and tangibly changed our community for the better. When drug overdoses killed more people in our city than homicide, we got legislation changed so that I issued a 'standing order' - a blanket prescription - for the antidote to all 620,000 residents. Policy change translates directly to lives saved. What would you say to the current Rhodes Scholar cohort about how to approach career planning? don't forget why you chose your particular path so far and why you chose to take on the world's fight. Be intentional about your choices going forward and don't let anyone tell you that it can't be done. There is not a single point in time to make 'the' career choice; think about where you can have the biggest impact and whether it is what will fulfill you. For any particular position, don't think about the title of the role; instead think about what you can do in it. dr Leana Wen on a panel with President Obama discussing addiction treatment dr Leana Wen speaking during World AI dS day A visit of the Surgeon General, Vice Admiral Vivek Murthy 8 9 Rhodes Scholar Sarah Smierciak (Illinois & St Antony's, 2012) Sarah Smierciak (Illinois & St Antony's, 2012) Sarah Smierciak (Illinois & Antony's & Hertford Sarah Smierciak (Illinois & St Antony's Sarah Smierciak (Illinois & St Antony's 2012)Eleanor TaylorRhodes Scholars' Art The Current Scholars in residence find time in their busy schedules to pursue the creative, artistic and imaginative. 10 11 Rhodes Scholar The Aloha State: Haleakal and the Future of Solar Energyrenewables act as emissions reduction technologies since they in essence are able to contribute to energy generation that would have otherwise been supplied by fossil fuels. It is also thought that renewable energies like solar are also valuable in providing power to remote and rural areas that have little to no access to electricity. And even in the urban landscape, technologies like photovoltaics and solar water heating have been thought to blend in quite seamlessly since they are conventionally installed on the roofs of buildings, considering the lack of land space that usually hampers urban development. hawaiian solar energy has been such a growth market because of two main reasons: the high costs of electricity and a proactive policy environment. Since hawaii is a rather isolated location and one that has no indigenous fossil fuels, the Aloha State imports all its energy. And because of this importation, the costs of the State's import bills are passed on through the power generation sector that uses these imported fuels, to the consumers that ultimately use the electricity in the homes. So this makes solar energy an economically competitive alternative. This economic motivation to invest in solar is also encouraged through a mixture of State and Federal policies. h owever, the most attractive of these are the State's net energy metering, feed-in-tariffs and tax incentives. Without giving overbearing technical detail, the first two, net energy metering and the feed-in-tariff are, in essence, policies that allow household photovoltaics to be connected to the rest of the electricity network, i.e. the grid. So doing means that there is now a two-way stream of electricity that can be produced from the solar panels and sent to the grid, and likewise sent from the grid to the home when energy is needed. So this grid-connected arrangement allows householders to be paid for the energy they generate and send into the grid over the lifetime of their solar system (20 to 25 years). The payment scheme and per unit rate remuneration however varies based on size of solar system, and which policy is being subscribed to, i.e., net energy metering or feed-in-tariff. The latter, tax incentives, are designed to help reduce the upfront capital costs of investing in a household solar energy system and applies to both photovoltaics and solar water heating. These tax incentives can be combined with either net energy metering or the feed-in-tariff to make residential solar a substantially cheaper investment. And for these reasons, h awaii's solar future seems to be as bright as the sun that's driving it. A solar panel on Waikiki BeachThe Waikiki skyline seen from the beach Quintessential Hawaiian skyscapeKiron Neale (Commonwealth Caribbean & Linacre 2013) is working on a DPhil in Geography and the Environment. His academic interests include islandic energy systems, solar energy and the socio-cultural perceptions of energy. The Aloha State is an archipelago of eight islands so remote that it is located almost in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. Perhaps because of this geographic solitude, it is one of the most e den-like landscapes on the planet with its lush tropical rainforests, crystal clear waters, volcanic lineage, and rich indigenous culture and history. This imagery and perhaps every conceivable image that comes to mind when one thinks of h awaii suggests that it is no surprise that it's a destination frequently amongst the best places to vacation - with one of the meanings of 'Aloha', 'peace', perhaps summing up the reason why it's such a great place to be. But as a researcher interested in islandic solar energy systems, h awaii attracted me for a different reason (despite me trying and failing to continuously convince my peers of this). As one might guess, hawaii's tropical nature gives it a great climate for solar energy hence why tanning on the beach is an immediate association for many. But this limitless resource has been put to more technical uses across the islands. My work focuses on the governmental policies that promote residential solar energy (specifically solar water heating and photovoltaics) and in this respect, h awaii has proven to be outstanding in not only promoting solar as an alternative to fossil fuels, but also in the implementation and adoption of these technologies. This is why ' haleakal,' meaning 'house of the sun,' is a quite fitting literary adaptation of indigenous hawaiian culture to the role of the sun in h awaii today; albeit a more technical and technological role. Solar energy is one of the world's available alternative energies but it is also a form of renewable energy, considering that not all alternatives are renewable. In the climate change arena, renewable energy resources are considered mitigation options that represent a cleaner means of generating energy as opposed to the conventional hydrocarbons like coal, oil and natural gas. The technologies that harness these This is why 'Haleakal,' meaning 'house of the sun,' is a quite fitting literary adaptation of indigenous Hawaiian culture to the role of the sun in Hawaii today; albeit a more technical and technological role 13 Rhodes Scholar 12Coming Out of the Shadows: Why it's Finally Getting Brighter for Global Mental Health Joshua Chauvin (Ontario & New College 2011) founded the mental health campaign, It Gets Brighter, which shares video messages of hope and support for those struggling with a mental health issue. He is also an Associate Fellow at the Evidence-Based Practice Unit (UCL), the Executive Director for TalkAbout Guides, and a final year DPhil student in Experimental Psychology at Oxford. For the millions living in high-income countries who experience mental health challenges, there has never been greater reason to believe It Gets Brighter. With few exceptions, things legitimately seem to be improving: resources and access to treatment are more widespread than ever, especially in major cities, society is becoming increasingly accepting; governments are putting mental health on the agenda, and innovations in technology are multiplying, making it easier for people to get access to the kind of help and support they need. unfortunately, such advances have not been universal. d espite the fact that mental and substance use disorders account for 7.4% of the global burden of disease as represented by disease-adjusted life years (dALYs) and remain the leading global cause for all non-fatal burden (measured in years lived with disability), in many low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) mental health remains low on the list of priorities - if it is acknowledged at all. Compared with communicable and non- communicable diseases, mental and substance abuse disorders have gone largely unrecognised as a global health priority. Services in mental health have been neglected and left incommensurate with the burden, leaving up to 85% of people in LMICs with severe mental disorders without treatment for their mental health conditions. Moreover, with 80% of the world's population living in LMICs, and 90% of the global mental health resources located in high-income countries, the treatment gap is substantial. While disconcerting, the failure to meet the needs of those with mental disorders in LMICs isn't altogether surprising or without explanation. In part, the neglect stems from a strong temptation to view mental healthcare as non-essential in environments where some basic needs aren't being met, or where conflict is widespread. After all, in countries that lack resources, and where economic wealth is limited, how can we justify shifting our attention to mental health? At face value, this seems to be a fair criticism; however, such a criticism fails to appreciate just how fundamental mental health is. It also fails to recognise that increased attention to mental health need not come at the expense of meeting other needs. If we consider health as a prerequisite to being able to participate fully in society and take advantage of opportunities - and if having a mental disorder prevents this - then the importance of providing adequate mental health care can hardly be overstated. Without mental health needs being met, people are left unable to provide for themselves and their families, and existing physical health problems can often become exacerbated. The shift in emphasis from disease mortality to disease morbidity has meant challenging the prevailing notion that mental illness is a less legitimate health concern, and has led to the prioritising of mental health around the globe. Not only has the u N included mental health in its sustainable development goals, but the World Bank Group and World h ealth Organisation are beginning to focus some of their efforts and resources on meeting the needs of those in impoverished environments, with a particular focus on fragile and conflict states. As part of a larger agenda to meet some of the objectives of the W hO's Comprehensive Mental h ealth Action Plan 2013-2020, their most recent spring meeting, Out of the Shadows: Making Mental h ealth a Global Priority, has fuelled the momentum and firmly fixed mental health on the global health agenda. With increasing emphasis being placed on mental health, and attention from major international organisations, there is some reason to feel hopeful. One ray of light for members of communities where mental health resources are scant, and societal acceptance is rare, comes from the advent of technological solutions. e ntrepreneurs are re- imagining how people access help (e.g. with the advent of tele-health models, and online peer-to-peer support such as bigwhitewall.com), and there is increasing recognition that these technologies - especially those that can be adapted to fit local realities and diverse cultural contexts - can be leveraged to support people in environments burdened by a lack of resources. As technology becomes ever more ubiquitous and accessible worldwide, the mental health treatment gap between high and low-to-middle income countries will continue to close. Further, as people become increasingly connected, videos and social media have the potential to be used as an effective mode of educating people, reducing mental health related stigma, raising awareness, and inspiring sufferers to seek the available help in their region. Such interventions also have the potential to be more scalable and cost-effective than many social contact interventions. While there is no panacea for the challenges surrounding global mental health, recognising that there is no single solution to global mental health challenges is the first step to inspiring innovation that is carefully crafted to fit the needs of people living in a range of contexts. We ought to be investing in projects that support, inspire, and enable people to be the change agents for their communities. As just one example, It Gets Brighter* enables people from around the world to share their stories, as part of local efforts and campaigns to change the conversations around mental health. With the global health community finally shining its light on mental health, and technological solutions to mental health challenges beginning to take off, there's never been greater cause to feel hopeful. Mental health is well and truly coming out of the shadows, and for so many, it is indeed getting brighter. *It Gets Brighter is an initiative that endeavours to empower young people struggling with a mental health challenge (often for the first time) to seek out help and support. To that end, their website (itgetsbrighter.org) collects and publishes video messages of hope for those struggling with a mental health issue.

Here moderators and Scholars comment on the experience of the intensive three-day retreats which happen for first and second year Scholars. After a recent retreat at Rhodes House, we asked Scholars two important questions...Michael Lamb (Tennessee & Trinity 2004) on the purpose of the retreats at Rhodes House Inscribed in the Rhodes h ouse rotunda are large, golden Greek letters that form one of Rhodes's favorite quotes - Aristotle's definition of the good life: 'activity of soul in accordance with virtue'. In many ways, that's what these retreats are about - helping scholars live good lives in accordance with virtue. For years, when Rhodes Scholars were selected, it was just assumed they would come to Oxford and, through some magical process of osmosis, acquire the vision and virtues needed to 'fight the world's fight.' The current Warden has offered a different vision - one where Rhodes h ouse takes a much more active role in the development of Scholars, helping to expose them to diverse perspectives and equip them with the tools, resources, and practices needed to lead lives of meaning, impact, and purpose. The Character, Service, and Leadership Programme has become a defining element of what it means to be a Rhodes Scholar in this era.In addition to skills workshops, talks with visiting speakers, and programmes such as the e thics through Fiction and Film reading group, the highlight of the programme has been the three-day retreats for first and second-year Scholars. The retreats challenge Scholars to grapple together with difficult questions about who they are and who they want to become: What is the difference between effective leadership and ethical leadership? how do we pursue justice and community in light of our current challenges? how do we negotiate conflicts between different values and commitments? When should we take risks, and how should we deal with failure? Why - and how - do we serve? What practices are needed to sustain lives of leadership and service over the long-haul? Through a very diverse set of readings, reflections, and conversations, Scholars and Senior Scholar moderators come away with a much deeper sense of themselves and their work in the world. Perhaps the most important outcome of these retreats is the deep sense of the community that emerges over three days, as Scholars from different disciplines, traditions, and constituencies come together to share their personal stories. The friendships I've developed and deepened during the retreats have certainly been the highlight for me. Name one idea which particularly resonated with you concerning how to build a life of purpose, meaning and balance? \"The discussion on friendships, relationships and mentors particularly resonated with me. The Oxford (and especially the Rhodes) experience has enabled the development of many new friendships and shared experiences, which has been wonderful, but it is bittersweet to know that we won't all be huddled into the same small bubble come the end of the year. \" \"The idea that most resonated with me was Charles Conn's idea of identifying the aspects of life that sustain me, and making sure I incorporate these into my life regardless of the pressures of the outside world, as these will help me stay balanced, happy and well. \" \"I really liked the idea that even if things don't turn out as you expected, it doesn't mean it was a failure but only that in a different way you can find meaning in it. \" \"Maria Popova's article discussing fixed versus growth mindsets really resonated with me - the idea that what can be achieved with passion and hard work is unknowable; that our skills sets are malleable. It suggests that we can continue to grow and learn as individuals, and in turn, can find new ways to work towards our goals. \"What are you grateful for? \"The opportunity to re-connect with my cohort reminded me of the care, thoughtfulness, humour, insight and commitment that are such hallmarks of the Rhodes community - I'm grateful for the privilege of learning more about the backgrounds, passions and aspirations of my classmates. \" \"I am grateful for many things - for sunshine and blue skies, for the community of friends and mentors at Oxford, for the feeling of belonging and recognition, and for the inspiring company. \" \"I am grateful for the Rhodes Trust, who do a fantastic job of looking after us here in Oxford.\" The conversations and friendships that have emerged out of these three days have not only challenged me to continue living the questions, but they have also reminded me of why the Rhodes community is so special Michael Lamb (Tennessee and Trinity 2004) 16 17 Rhodes Scholar Nadiya Figueroa (Jamaica & St. Catherine's 2007) is a member of the Warden's Programme Advisory Council. She completed her d Phil in International development and has worked in the Caribbean with development agencies, the regional university and think tank, and in government and non-government roles since leaving Oxford. The Trust is very pleased to announce that she will be joining the Rhodes House senior team as Dean of Scholarships and Director of Leadership and Change, with a portfolio of responsibilities that includes the Character, Service and Leadership Programme, building strategic linkages with new programme partners, furthering relationships with Oxford University divisions and departments, providing mentorship to Scholars, developing roll-out strategies for new jurisdictions, and liaising with National Secretaries and alumni organisations on selection, orientation and integration of Scholars, as well as outreach to less served populations. Welcome Nadiya!Valuing Silence: Reflections on Moderating the Scholar Retreats Nadiya Figueroa (Jamaica & St Catherine's 2007) has been a moderator on a number of the Rhodes House retreats, and in this piece she shares her thoughts on that experience. It is a silence, which, to the uninitiated, feels uncomfortable. After letting go of some false sense that I, as a moderator, am at all in control of this experience for the participants, Scholars on their first or second year retreat - I tune further into the energy in the room. Some are clearly grappling, confronted by something that was said or read aloud. Many are feeling challenged, interrogating a norm or view that had previously been taken for granted. And there are a few, I am sensing, who are grateful for the pause - a pause in the active listening, and steady stream of sharing and engaging with others. Without a doubt, it is the internal conversations that are rumbling loudest at this point. And then, someone does it. It is less a breaking of the silence and more of a tuning of the group's collective attention back into the personal conversation of one brave soul. We've been taking turns at doing this. Someone is now playing out loud with the ideas put on the table, pushing back on points made by another, peeling away at their own layers and giving us insight into their unique perspective, into their own personal experiences, beliefs and aspirations. As the days go on I become aware of patterns. On balance, the longer the silence the more illuminating the idea, the more raw the contrasts drawn and challenges made, and the more revealing and resonant the sharing. Towards the end of each day more comments end with, \"I can't believe I just said that...\". Or are prefaced with some variation of, \"I've never shared this before, but here goes...\". The willingness to be vulnerable is palpable, and the sharing with compassion, the learning from each other, is awesome. This is not what I expected when I replied in the affirmative to a request to moderate on the Character, Service and Leadership retreats at Rhodes h ouse. This aspect of my own experience and education while at Oxford was, for the most part, self-organised, under-resourced and fought for on the margins. I often felt as though I had misplaced priorities, pulling all-nighters to participate in discussions on what is the good life? What vision and values are steering me through my work and life decisions? h ow are my notions and practices of home, family, relationships and friendships shifting? It is increasingly clear to me, almost ten years on from arriving at Oxford, that there are few greater priorities than these exact discussions and contemplations - than working through what contribution I aim to make through my life and how I will keep myself content and happy in it. Imagine my amazement, then, at the extent to which these young people already get it! I was awed watching them nudge and test each other, catch and support each other, stun and shock each other. And then, adjust, recover and show up fully for another round. It was difficult for me to observe moments of hurt and tension, to not always be able to facilitate conciliation or deal adequately with unearthed disappointments and frustrations. h owever, this was not my role as moderator or the intention of the retreats. There is no solving of problems, no provision of a master roadmap, no reaching for the 'right' way or the 'right' answer. The retreats ask questions, seek to carefully raise concerns and contentions, to purposefully create room and supply tools and materials for the journey of self-discovery. And what of my role as moderator? I found it most critical not to rush it, not to be tempted to overly steer or control. As if a group of young, dynamic and diverse Rhodes Scholars would permit me that kind of control anyway! My role was to guide and to allow the silences to become meaningful and constructive. And to learn, to myself become more open and vulnerable. And what kind of gems emerged through the silence? To share a few: that life, with its varying opportunities and challenges, presents choices. And it is empowering that we each have a role of creativity and resourcefulness, informed by our own sense of morals and ethics, to play in crafting our lives. That the urges to push it to the limit with work, to contribute to society and to nurture intimate relationships may well be in competition with each other. And being aware of this while striving for balance is a part of the lifelong journey. That we each exist on complex axes of privilege and oppression, that as one person is entitled to their tears and shame another is entitled to their curses and anger. And hopefully we can meet each other honestly and openly in this, with an understanding that no one is wholly to blame or wholly blameless. That gratitude and humor are characteristics to be practiced and embraced. That life involves doses of pain, loss and trauma. And the best preparation for weathering these storms may include building solid routines of self-care, consistently investing in collectives that offer enduring love and support, and prioritising art, exercise, travel and spirituality, whatever it is that returns us to our core. It struck me that as the Rhodes Scholarships undergo a significant transition, expanding into new territories and engaging on what it means to identify as a Rhodes Scholar and what a sense of the Rhodes community looks like and feels like, it is fitting that the experience of Scholars while in residence is being reinvigorated in this way. To the extent that its people determines the ethos and direction of an institution, I've never been as optimistic about the future of Rhodes as after this interaction with the youngest cohorts of Scholars. I would even go as far as to say I am more optimistic about the possibilities for the world, far beyond the confines of Rhodes and Oxford. 18 19 Rhodes Scholar Did Shakespeare Invent characters? Professor Blair Hoxby (Ohio & Pembroke 1989) is an Associate Professor of English at Stanford University. He writes on the literature and culture of England, France, Italy, and Spain from 1500 to 1800 and his recent research has focused on the theory and practice of tragedy during that period. To mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death in 2016, he considers how the Bard approached character development and individuality on the stage. If we can believe h arold Bloom, Shakespeare invented the human. But did he invent characters? There are reasons to think he did not: actors doubled roles, plays often lack lists of dramatis personae or regular speech prefixes, and the word 'character' could not even be used of a dramatis persona until the late seventeenth-century. In Shakespeare's day, actors 'personated' roles. That character could be a source of dramatic unity was one of the great critical discoveries of the eighteenth century, a discovery that had to await the publication of works such as John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) and Samuel Richardson's long novel Clarissa (1748). Only then was it possible to write about characters as if they were the record of minds shaped in childhood, scarred by experience, and distinguished by chains of remembrance and anticipation. It could even be warranted, maintained Maurice Morgann in his Essay of the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), the first great example of 'character criticism', to account for the conduct of Shakespeare's characters 'from the whole of character, from general principles, from latent motives, and from policies not avowed'. The Romantics' emphasis on organic development and self-cultivation led them to add that literary characters, like living beings, should develop and find their own form. They declared Shakespeare to be the master of conferring such freedom on his characters. 'hamlet is not a person whose nativity is cast, or whose death is foretold by portents', writes William hazlitt in 1826; 'he weaves the web of his destiny out of his own thoughts'. This critical tradition has some basis in Shakespeare's reading, for one of his chief sources was Plutarch, who explains that while traditional historians document deeds, the purpose of his life-writing is to understand thos (or the 'manners and disposition' of a man, as his e lizabethan translator renders the word). That's why even trivial words or actions may be worth recording: 'a light occasion, a word, or some sport makes men's natural dispositions and manners appear more plain than the famous battles won'. Michel de Montaigne, another of Shakespeare's favorite authors, reiterates the lesson: 'The very same mind of Caesar we see in directing, marshaling, and setting the battle of Pharsalia is likewise seen to order, dispose, and contrive idle, trifling, and amorous devices'. Such life-writing lies behind many of the scenes that we cherish in Shakespeare, such as Cleopatra's idle talk of the pranks she and her lover played while fishing. Modern critics often translate thos as character , but the translation can be misleading if we do not construe it in a strictly ethical sense. Most early modern englishmen preferred manners (via the Latin mores ). This is an important category to keep in mind for interpreting any literature from Shakespeare's tragedies to Jane Austen's comedies of manners, not least because readers of Aristotle knew that poets imitated the actions, manners, and sentiments of human beings. Because critics tended to gloss Aristotle in light of h orace's instructions on how to fit the manners of persons to their native country, sex, rank, profession, and time of life, playwrights drew on a range of texts (medical, geographical, political) that treated the manners and dispositions of whole populations as facts of nature or statistical generalisations. Both classical literary criticism and the accounts of manners in early modern medical and geographical texts encouraged audiences to type the persons on stage rather than to focus on their radical individuality. But because the manners of a stage person could be conceived as the product of choices influenced by humoral disposition, social rank, gender, national customs but nevertheless freely undertaken, manners as a critical category also negotiated the interstices between the individual and the group, agency and determinism. In Othello , for example the Moorish general thinks he is not given to jealousy because he has the cold temperament that some classical geographers ascribed to a black complexion, but readers of the Arabic geographer Leo Africanus might have suspected a Moor of being jealous and prone to violence. Othello supposes that d esdemona should be cold, moist, and chaste, but her young palm feels hot; and sea-faring and commercial peoples were known for their changeable ways and their capacity for deception. By trading in this language of natural law, national custom, and humoral disposition, Iago infects Othello's imagination, insinuating that for d esdemona, 'Not to affect many proposed matches / Of her own clime, complexion, and degree' smells of a 'will 'thoughts unnatural' (3.3.229-33). The tragedy of Othello is that the calculus of manners sullies the lovers' initial purity of perception and imagination. Thus an attention to manners, and not just to character, can reveal some of the otherwise unobservable tensions between volition and determinism, the individual and his or her class, faith and probability, that the early modern stage explores with such penetration. ...manners as a critical category also negotiated the interstices between the individual and the group, agency and determinism 20 21 Rhodes Scholar Eradicating Ebola Rhodes Scholars around the world are helping to tackle Ebola David Quammen (OHIO & MERTON 1970) Article Ebola and the New Isolationism, argues against closing borders between countries Grace Yu (NEW YORK & TRINITY 2002) Created a public awareness film which was the launching platform for the Ebola Survival Fund Professor Antoinette Handley (NATAL & ST ANTONY'S 1993) Published a research article entitled Ebola: why we are worried for all the wrong reasons Dr Pardis Sabeti (FLORIDA & NEW COLLEGE 1997) Led a team that sequenced the RNA of 99 Ebola viruses collected during the first weeks of the outbreak Dr Amanda Rojek (QUEENSLAND & UNIVERSITY 2012) Worked in camps administering the Ebola treatment clinical trial Dr Kopano Mabaso (SOUTH AFRICA-AT-LARGE & MAGDALEN 2010) Leading a group of Rhodes Scholars for THINK Liberia, establishing a transit centre for children orphaned by Ebola President Bill Clinton (ARKANSAS & UNIVERSITY 1968) The Clinton Global Initiative, coordinated the largest single shipment of aid to the Ebola zone Dr Adhiambo Odaga (KENYA & ST ANTONY'S 1986) Former CEO of the charitable arm of the Dangote Group, which has donated $3m to contain the disease AwarenessFundingResearch 22 23 Rhodes Scholar The Ebola Emergency - From a Public Health perspective Dr S.S. Vasan (India & Trinity 1998), Professor of Public Health as well as Public Health England's Senior Business Development Manager, discusses Ebola, emergency response models and how to promote international collaboration - when it is a matter of life and death. What was Public Health England's role in the Ebola outbreak? Public health england (P he) has a domestic remit but a global role. The agency helped mobilise and train frontline staff, establish laboratories and strengthen safe working practices in the affected countries. Many of my colleagues won the e bola Medal for their bravery and knowledge transfer to West Africa to combat the outbreak. however, Phe's role should be seen in the larger context of the uK working with the u N, W hO and the wider international community to combat e bola at the source in the affected African countries. Significant funds to provide direct support to help contain, control, treat and ultimately defeat ebola have helped early recovery in these countries. The RCuK-Praxis unico Impact Awards recognise the role of knowledge exchange and commercialisation (KeC) professionals in maximising research impact. We are honoured to have been chosen as the winner under 'contribution to society' from a list of equally deserving projects, in recognition of our K eC stewardship during the ebola response. This involved phenomenal work for our team under intense pressure to develop systems, build new business relationships, write proposals, negotiate contracts, and troubleshoot issues. We were also featured as a cover story by the Science in Parliament magazine. Looking back at how Ebola was handled, what are the biggest lessons learnt? ebola and other infectious diseases like it are global health challenges that require sustained, long-term investment and collaboration to strengthen emergency preparedness and response ( ePR) in identified areas. The ideal response would be from enabled local experts who are able to stop it at the source. KeC professionals can greatly enhance the effectiveness of response by ensuring a robust, prompt and fair way to exchange knowledge between academia, industry and public bodies. Failure to achieve quick consensus is not an option during public health emergencies. Finally, we have limited Bio-Safety Level 4 (BSL4) capacity in the world therefore such laboratories should share information in near real-time to ensure an effective response. Can you elaborate on how BSL4 laboratories could collaborate better? We are trying to achieve this domestically through the uK InterLab Forum, and with our counterparts in Australia, Canada and u SA through the Medical Counter- Measures Consortium and the recently-formed Four e yes BSL4 Laboratories Network. For instance, current u K regulations on biosafety make us better suited to perform rapid down-selection of pharmaceuticals, so that promising leads could be evaluated further elsewhere. When P he down-selected pharmaceuticals against e bola with support from the Wellcome Trust, we successfully convinced developers, many of them private companies, to let us publish negative results because time is of the essence and we do not want another BSL4 laboratory to evaluate something that we know is unlikely to work against this pathogen. We have shared these clauses with our international partners so we can move towards a unified template for contracts during a crisis. It can save time and, more importantly, lives. You mentioned enabling local experts to stop Ebola at the source. How is PHE working towards this long-term goal? The u K played a major role in Sierra Leone during the outbreak, including contributing regular cargo flights carrying u K aid. With the epidemic no longer out of control, d FId has funded P he over \u00a36 million to strengthen Sierra Leone's laboratory diagnostic capacity and e PR capability, including training and skills transfer to local staff to maintain Resilient Zero for e bola. I am also involved with another d FId grant to help strengthen e PR in Bengaluru and Chennai metropolitan regions of India. We hope this pilot can be converted into self-sustaining training opportunities for global cities and airport hubs in partnership with the BMJ. Has the Ebola experience influenced the way the Zika outbreak is being handled?In some ways. For instance, the W hO made its fourth declaration of 'public health emergency of international concern' promptly, even before the link between microcephaly and Zika virus was conclusive. In P he, we have been reusing e bola contract templates and legal agreements so collaborative work can start within days. e bola also set a good precedent where people and organisations, including the private sector, were willing to set aside their interests and come together for an effective global response. But the two are also different - ebola needs BSL4 facilities but Zika work can now be performed under BSL2. Zika is Aedes mosquito-borne, therefore integrated vector control and entomological factors are more important, as is the now proven link to microcephaly. When you were a Rhodes Scholar did you think this was the sort of work you wanted to do? How did you get into public health? I have always been interested in public service and health, but I took my own path and time to get into public health service. After the customary McKinsey rite of passage, I returned to Oxford as visiting fellow and head of public health for its spin-out company Oxitec. In 2011, I joined the British government's h ealth Protection Agency which became Public health e ngland through a merger with 128 other public bodies in 2013. Isn't Oxitec in the news for Zika? What were you focused on when you worked there? Indeed - Oxitec was established in 2002 and successfully acquired last year for $160 million. Its genetically sterile mosquitoes are being considered in the Americas as part of integrated control of Aedes aegypti - one of the two mosquito species transmitting Chikungunya, dengue, Yellow Fever and Zika. I was Oxitec's head of public health from 2005 to 2011, and led the world's first semi-field (and subsequently open-field) trials involving these mosquitoes, and the commercial foundations for translating this technology from laboratory to field.Failure to achieve quick consensus is not an option during public health emergencies 24 25 Rhodes Scholar West AfricaIsrael MalaysiaChina JordanSyriaLebanon Palestine West AfricaIsrael MalaysiaChina JordanSyriaLebanon PalestineExpanding the International Reach of the Rhodes Scholarships The Rhodes Trust has announced major global expansions recently, with ambitious plans for the future also being discussed. The ultimate goal is to make the Rhodes Scholarships accessible to any young person, regardless of where they were born or where they undertook their education - a truly global Scholarship. In 2015, we announced four new Scholarships for China, and in 2016 we added Scholarships for regions including Africa, Israel and the Middle east, and Southeast Asia. In partnership with the Sa\u00efd Foundation, the u niversity of Oxford, and selected Oxford colleges, there will be new Scholars from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine, and with support from the Salama Bint h amdan Al Nahyan Foundation, from the u nited Arab e mirates. A partnership with Yayasan Khazanah has allowed for a reinstatement of the Rhodes Scholarship for Malaysia. There will also be new Scholarships for Israel, supported by an international coalition of donors. Furthermore, there is an increase in the number of Scholars from Africa, with the addition of a West Africa Scholarship supported by investor and philanthropist Miles Morland and the Cohen Charitable Trust. Africa will also be a focus for further Scholarship expansion in 2017.With these recent additions, the total number of Scholarships awarded each year will increase from 83 to 95. This increases the number of Rhodes Scholars studying at the u niversity of Oxford at any one time to approximately 250. \"Our aspiration is to identify and support innovative, energetic and ethical young leaders globally. The addition of these new Scholars from regions that have an important international role to play in the 21st century marks a substantial step in that direction. We see the value of additional cultural diversity in our cohorts of Scholars every day: they learn from each other in profound ways, leaving behind the narrow interests of individual nationalities. The new Rhodes Scholars will contribute significantly through sharing their skills, experiences and energy with their peers at Oxford and we look forward to welcoming them to Rhodes House. \" Charles Conn (Massachusetts & Balliol 1983), Warden of Rhodes House\"I am absolutely delighted that there will now be Rhodes Scholarships for students from across Israel and the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and more Rhodes Scholarships in West Africa. Embracing global talent and diverse perspectives is a hallmark of pre-eminent universities and bringing more Rhodes Scholars to the University will enhance Oxford as a truly international community of scholars.\" Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford 26 27 Rhodes Scholar First Rhodes Scholars from China Rhodes Scholarships have been awarded in China for the first time ever and the selection committee chose four outstanding individuals: Gong Chenzhuo, Ren Naying, Zhang Chunying and Zhang Wanyu. Hundreds of individuals submitted applications, and selectors reviewed their records and interviewed them over the course of three rounds, culminating in final interviews in Shanghai. The selectors were deeply impressed by the calibre of the applicants, a testament to the talent and the accomplishments of China's young generation. The Scholars e lect will begin their studies at Oxford in the autumn of 2016. Biographies of the Scholars Elect GONG Chenzhuo graduated from Fudan u niversity with a Bachelor's in International Politics, receiving the Star Graduates award given to the top-10 undergraduates. h e completed study exchanges around the world: in Brazil, Britain, America and Finland. This past year Chenzhou has worked with uNeSCO in d ar es Salaam, Tanzania, as a trainee in the communications and information team. It is Chenzhuo's second time in Tanzania, having previously volunteered for a summer as an e nglish teacher in primary school there. h e has also volunteered as a teacher in rural parts of China, going back to the same county every winter vacation for three consecutive years. Chenzhuo is an avid footballer and has also completed a 'vertical marathon', climbing to the top of the 101-floor Shanghai World Financial Center. At Oxford, Chenzhou will read for the MSc in Social Science of the Internet, followed by an MBA in his second year. his objective is to create an NGO that empowers rural students and other marginalised groups in China.REN Naying has just completed her degree in english language and literature at Tsinghua u niversity. Naying is co-founder of the China LGBT+ Youth Network, supervising the organisation with a focus on the development of gender education and academic research. She has extensive volunteer experience both at the Beijing LGBT Centre as well as at the LGBT North West centre in Manchester, where she studied for a term. Naying has taught e nglish to the children of migrant workers in Beijing and has also been a long-time member of the Tsinghua Association of Student International Communication, participating in exchanges with students from France and around Asia. A lover of the arts, from film to musicals, she has researched differences in humour between Western and Chinese cultures. Naying will study an MPhil in Social Anthropology at Oxford. her ambition is to help develop the theoretical foundations of gender studies in China.ZHANG Chunying has completed her Master's in journalism at Columbia u niversity, having previously earned an honors degree in economics and e nglish at Zhejiang u niversity. Chunying has interned with Reuters and the New York Times in Shanghai and Xinhua new-media centre in Zhejiang, exploring topics from labour disputes to corruption. She was coach and captain of the Chu Kochen College debating team at Zhejiang u niversity and also secretary-general of the Morningside Cultural China Annual Forum, organising three-day conferences in both 2012 and 2013 with discussions on social innovation, youth leadership and more. Chunying will read an MSc in Sociology in her first year at Oxford. She dreams of creating a media organisation in China that will provide a platform for keeping track of and appraising public policies.ZHANG Wanyu studied law at Peking u niversity, ranked first in her class. From her beginnings in a small town in southwestern China, Wanyu has gone on to receive a national scholarship for the top 0.2% of university students in the country. She also excelled as an exchange student at Stanford Law School and was Chinese champion of the Jessup Moot Court Competition. Wanyu has been active as a legal-aid volunteer both at Peking u niversity and in Sichuan province, focusing on factory workers who have suffered workplace injuries, with a special emphasis on those afflicted by silicosis. h er favourite quote in legal literature is from jurist Oliver W. h olmes: 'if [a man] has the soul of an idealist, he will make - I do not say find - his world ideal.' Wanyu will read for a second BA in Politics, Philosophy and economics at Oxford, hoping to explore the theoretical underpinnings of social justice to make law meaningful for marginalised populations. 28 29 Rhodes Scholar Recognising Inspirational Educators These awards are a new initiative from the Rhodes Trust, in recognition of the profound effect outstanding educators can have on a young person's life. Current Rhodes Scholars were asked to nominate a teacher or lecturer who had gone above and beyond the call of duty, inspired a love for learning, and facilitated new dreams for the future.The nomination letters included some very powerful and moving tributes, a short selection of which is given below. helen Baxendale (Australia-at-Large & h ertford 2014) nominated Anthony Strazzera Senior English Teacher at Geelong Grammar School\"Anthony Strazzera's classes were a sort of Socratic dialogue or rambling tutorial. In the hands of a less erudite practitioner this style of teaching would have been a disaster, but such was his command of his subject and his capacity for hilarious and absorbing diversions, that he could hold the attention of students who'd never previously evinced any appreciation for English literature, while thoroughly engrossing those who did. \" Jacob Burnett (Indiana & Corpus Christi 2015) nominatedScott Himsel Professor at Wabash College \"I was the first person in my family to go to college. Before enrolling in Wabash College, I visited the campus five times. I've never been one to make decisions without thorough analysis! During one of my visits, I came in contact with Scott Himsel and, after talking with him briefly, he made me feel as if I could achieve any of the dreams I had. Little did I know that it would be the start of a life-changing mentor- mentee relationship. \"Brett Rosenberg (New York & Corpus Christi 2012) nominated Steven Houser Social Studies teacher at Horace Greeley High School \"Steven Houser was my social studies teacher and cross-country coach. Since graduating from his classes and teams, I've majored in history, begun work on an International Relations DPhil, and run two marathons. This confluence of interests is no coincidence: Mr Houser is the thread that ties them all together. I can unequivocally state that he is the best teacher I have ever had. \"elliot Akama-Garren (California & St John's 2015) nominatedTyler Jacks Director, Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research \"With ten postdoctoral fellows, eight graduate students, seven technicians, five undergraduates, and three support staff, and while serving as Director of MIT's Center for Cancer Research, Tyler Jacks is a busy man. Without fail, one of the first questions I would routinely get asked was: \"Do you ever see him?\". And the surprising answer is yes, more often that I even saw some of my friends. I am not nominating Tyler because he inspired me to be a scientist. I already knew from a fairly young age I wanted to be a scientist), but because he taught me how to be a leader. \"Amy Steinepreis (Western Australia & Merton 2015) nominated \"Throughout my 13 years at St Mary's, Lynne Thomas was a passionate and impactful advocate for the education of girls. In retrospect, I see how her attitude that there were to be no limits, and no glass ceiling determining where we could go, permeated the whole school ethos, and undoubtedly changed many of our lives. \" Bhaskar Choubey (India & hertford 2002) nominatedKamakhya Singh Secondary school teacher \"Kamakhya Singh taught Biology and Chemistry to me in a very remote and poor school. I was the first batch of students to study to secondary level in the school and my school did not have even a basic laboratory, library or any other resource. Despite these limitations, he taught science in the best tradition and inculcated the process of enquiry, reasoning and experimentation. Using hand-made tools from readily available materials, he showed us that science is more than knowledge in books - rather, it is a part of our lives. I am now an academic in Oxford but I wish I could be a small percentage of the teacher he was. \"Andrew d ean (New Zealand & New College 2012) nominated Paul Millar Head of School, Humanities and Creative Arts at the University of Canterbury \"After the Canterbury earthquakes, when things were really tough at the University, Paul Millar helped do a number of different things for his students - he helped with the Canterbury-Oxford exchange, for a start - but he also brought as many recent graduates on board a new initiative he had set up, 'UC Ceismic', which is a digital earthquake archive, a creative response to make something good out of the disaster. He is someone who showed me the best of what being an academic can be, in the most trying of circumstances, and is a model for so many others. \"Lynne Thomas Principal of St Mary's Anglican Girls' School We are looking for the next set of recipients of the Rhodes Inspirational e ducator Awards. If you had a teacher at school or a professor at university who particularly inspired you and who you would like to acknowledge in this way, please contact Babette Tegldal, d irector of Communications at babette.tegldal@rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk. Please include your name and Rhodes identifier, the name, position and institution of the educator, and a short description about why you are nominating them. 30 31 Rhodes Scholar OXFORD NEWS OXFORd NeWSOxford News Zika Research Oxford's Infectious disease specialists, particularly Professor Trudie Lang (Professor of Global h ealth Research at the Nuffield department of Medicine and head of the Global health Network), have been leading the research into the Zika outbreak in South America. Crucially, they are using the lessons from e bola to tackle the growing problem of Zika, which can cause birth defects in babies born to women who have had the virus. The Global h ealth Network and ISARIC (global network of researchers who aim to enable research in disease outbreaks) provide vital and quick support to frontline health organisations to help them understand, manage and treat Zika. First female Vice-Chancellor for Oxford Oxford welcomed its new Vice-Chancellor, Louise Richardson, on 1 January 2016 Professor Richardson is the former Principal of the u niversity of St Andrews and an internationally renowned scholar of terrorism and security studies. On her admission at the Sheldonian Theatre, the Chancellor, Lord Patten of Barnes, stated: \"You have an outstanding record as a teacher and scholar. I know you wish to be judged primarily not by the glass ceilings you have smashed, but on your achievements\". Professor Richardson has spoken out on the increasing cost of compliance with bureaucratic regulation, and advocated free speech and diversity. \"I feel incredibly privileged to be taking on the leadership of this extraordinary institution. Oxford has been at the forefront of higher education for 800 years, transforming lives through the quality of its teaching and generating world-changing new ideas through the quality of its research. I want to bring all my energy and commitment to maintaining those high standards, working with the remarkably talented colleagues and students that we have at Oxford. \" One Year Anniversary of Weston Library The Weston Library has exceeded expectations in its opening year, welcoming a staggering 770,000 visitors. It has become an inviting tourist attraction as well as a research library. Formerly known as the New Bodleian, the library underwent an \u00a380 million transformation between 2012 and 2015. In recognition of a \u00a325 million donation to the project by the Garfield Weston Foundation, matched by O uP, the Weston Library was thus renamed. An anonymous generous benefactor also helped the Bodleian attain its 12 millionth book - a lost poetical essay by Percy Bysshe Shelley on the existing State of Things. Shelley, one of e ngland's great nineteenth century poets, wrote the poem at Oxford u niversity in 1810. It is the only known copy in existence and is now freely available online. The Bonavero Institute of Human Rights at the University of Oxford Mansfield College, near Rhodes h ouse, is in partnership with Oxford's Faculty of Law and will soon be home to the Bonavero Institute of human Rights. It will be dedicated to the study and promotion of greater understanding of human rights law through teaching, research and interdisciplinary collaboration. Rick Mather Architects have designed the building over two floors, featuring a lecture auditorium, a seminar room, and study rooms. There will also be 74 student rooms for Mansfield undergraduates. This new initiative is generously supported by the Bonavero family. Baroness h elena Kennedy QC, Mansfield Principal, believes the 'Institute will be at the heart of one of the greatest conversations of mankind - how to make a better world.' The Institute will open for the 2017-2018 academic year.Understanding Shakespeare's life and times Acrowdfunded research project to transcribe the handwritten documents of Shakespeare's contemporaries is being undertaken by Zooniverse. org at Oxford u niversity, the Oxford e nglish d ictionary and the e arly Modern Manuscripts Online Project at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington d C. Letters and recipes can be recorded on the Shakespeare's World website, and family papers, legal documents, poetry and unfinished plays will later be added to the collection. Academics hope to identify new words, phrases and dates of interest which will provide new contributions to the scholarly study of Shakespeare and his contemporaries.

He read and reviewed The Laws of Medicine by Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee (India & Magdalen 1993) for this magazine. Dr Mukherjee is an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University and staff physician at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. His earlier book, The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer , was awarded the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction and it was named one of the 100 most influential books written in English since 1923 by the magazine Time. There is an unspoken universal contract in the interaction between patients and physicians. The patient comes in with a complaint, and leaves with a diagnosis and (hopefully) a treatment. In between those two steps, the doctor works with the patient to unpack the story of how their symptoms came about, using the physical examination and laboratory tests to then identify a likely diagnosis and treatment plan. But what if the patient, owing to stress or a leading question, misremembers key bits of their story? What if the test the doctor thought she could rely on to make the diagnosis was, in this particular case, falsely negative? What if the large trial that guided the doctor's treatment recommendation, was, unbeknownst-to-her, fundamentally flawed? Suddenly, we see that there are various hidden holes all along the pathway, and the doctor and patient could fall through them at any point. dr Siddhartha Mukherjee's newest book deals with this fundamental challenge of medicine, which is that we are called to make 'perfect' decisions with ultimately imperfect information. his 'Laws' are principles that help frame the way one interprets this clinical information, and he presents them in the context of compelling tales from his own medical practice and from the larger world of clinical research. The book is especially welcome as it comes at a time when other professionals like engineers and data scientists are increasingly trying to tackle issues of clinical decision-making, and inevitably grappling with this unfamiliar uncertainty. In the present-day hype of 'Big d ata' in medicine (which, like quantum mechanics, is poorly understood and misused as a term), it is easy for patients and even physicians to buy into the idea that diseases and their management can be boiled down to algorithms: if A, then B; if not, then C. Sure, certain aspects of disease management can be optimized through an algorithmic approach, aided by digital technology and insights from individual-patient and population-level data. But what Mukherjee skillfully demonstrates through his anecdotes and case studies is that no matter how sophisticated our monitors or how granular our data, clinical decision-making at its core will remain a very human pursuit, charged with making tricky calls in the face of uncertain, inaccurate, and imperfect information. This is what leads him to confidently proclaim: 'the medical revolution will not be algorithmized'. The Laws of Medicine will help lay readers better appreciate the blurry, murky world of medical problem-solving that they step into every time they enter a doctor's office or hospital. It will also help healthcare professionals appreciate the pitfalls that we can experience when we ignore the unknowns and mistake our fund of medical knowledge for absolute truths.dr Siddhartha Mukherjee Poetry Corner Julian Gewirtz (Connecticut & Merton 2013) received a Master's degree in History at the University of Oxford in 2014 and is currently completing his Doctorate. His book Unlikely Partners: Chinese Reformers, Western Economists, and the Making of Global China is forthcoming from Harvard University Press this winter. His poems have been published in Boston Review , The New Republic , and the Yale Review . The poem below was first published in Ploughshares (2016).THE GANG'S ALL HERE \"Nature's Grand h otel has its Season, like the others.

The Trust has raised over \u00a3200m in recent years towards (i) the Campaign for the Second Century to secure the core Scholarships, (ii) funding for new expansion Scholarships and (iii) the partnership with the Atlantic Philanthropies to invest in mid-career Fellows and increase our convening capacity. Over 2,500 people (including more than half of all living Rhodes Scholars) and institutions have contributed towards this success. Thank you to all of you who have given so generously.Campaign Progress Over \u00a320m of the Atlantic Philanthropies gift is allocated to supporting the core Scholarships. This gift plus the many others received means that, as of June 2016, there is just \u00a320m remaining to achieve the \u00a3150m goal of the Campaign for the Second Century.It is our ambition to preserve the Rhodes Scholarship as the leading postgraduate Scholarship programme. Once the capital campaign goal is achieved, we will continue to seek support from Rhodes Scholars each year through a new Annual Fund to support the endowment returns that are available for the Scholarship. The purpose of the Fund will be to ensure the best possible support for the development of young leaders and to enhance the Rhodes Scholarships into the future, including: The Character, Service and Leadership programme Providing hardship, travel and research funds Alumni community and events Every gift in the coming months will make a difference in closing the campaign All gifts to the Campaign for the Second Century directly support the development of young leaders and take us closer to our goal of funding the core Rhodes Scholarships in perpetuity. We are enormously grateful to our donor community for their philanthropy in support of the next generation of Rhodes Scholars. e ach and every gift makes an impact on the funding requirements and can also catalyse other giving. Major donors often make their gifts subject to others' giving, and donors previously unconnected to the Trust have taken confidence from the high level of Scholar fundraising and involvement in the Trust's activities. The McCall MacBain Foundation's \u00a350m gift to the Campaign for the Second Century has very successfully been employed as an innovative match funding scheme. \"We need leadership and donations from our own Scholars to provide inspiration for others to give life to our collective dreams for the Rhodes Scholarships.\"John McCall MacBain O.C.

After two years he returned to Otago university, where he had been an undergraduate and graduate student, as a lecturer in zoology. In 1964 he was invited to the faculty at Rutgers, Newark, and so became a member of the Psychology department there. This was something of an irony since, as a youth, he had despised psychology as soft science - a case of the arrogance of ignorance. he ended up half seriously arguing that you could get a complete liberal education by studying psychology alone since it comprises everything from molecules to myths. he remained at Rutgers until his retirement at the end of 2009, except for the years 1969-1970 when he was a Tutorial Fellow at New College and Lecturer in the Zoology department at Oxford. In addition to teaching, his activities included field research on the breeding behavior of gulls, service on Federal grant reviewing panels, and editorial work for several journals. he has an active interest in the history and philosophy of science. he had a substantial career as a long-distance runner, which included completion of 30 marathons. he is married to Jeanette Beer, a noted scholar of medieval French.

Rhodes Scholars had been unable to marry until sometime after he had surrendered his Scholarship in order to marry, with unfortunate consequences for both marriage and studies. But the need to earn opened a different side to life and learning in Oxford through working for Boffins Bakeries, then a major supplier of bread to the area. A couple of years later, through a grant from the Rhodes Trust and the kindness of his college, he was able to complete his undergraduate degree. Robert D. Sider (Saskatchewan & Exeter 1956) retired in 1997 from his position as Charles A. dana Professor of Classical Languages at dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and returned to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, his wife's native province. he continued research and publication in the field of his dPhil (Theology - Patristics) during the early years of his career. In 1979 he was invited to join the 'erasmus Project', for which he was appointed General editor of the New Testament Scholarship, 20 volumes (41-60) in the Collected Works of erasmus, university of Toronto Press. his latest volume, 41, prolegomenous to the 20, is in Press. he will celebrate with his wife the 60th anniversary of their engagement in July, proud of their three children and nine grandchildren.

John Baird (New Zealand & Merton 1966) and his wife Marge are slowly retiring and now live in the wine area of Marlborough, N Z. however, their industry participation is currently limited to that of supportive tasters. After a career in the food industry, John became an independent director and has continued some business interests. he has also been a member since 1999 of the Waitangi Tribunal (which investigates claims arising from Treaty of Waitangi breaches).

Bergman (Massachusetts & Balliol 1966) by the flicker of a butterfly's wing, Stephen was on a boat to Oxford. he had wanted to be a writer; his harvard teacher declared he had no talent. In the wild, roaring '60s at Oxford he learned to join together and dare - to resist the warmongering systems. 'Samuel Shem' was born. The House of God, his first novel, about medical internship, is called 'a classic'. Five other novels, and - with Janet Surrey his 50-year love and partner - other writings. In writing and life, Shem, Stephen, and Surrey focus: staying human is to shift from the centrality of 'self' to that of 'relationship'. Our 'world's fight' is to speak out with others in resistance to injustice, on the danger of isolation and the healing power of good connection. But for that butterfly's wing, Stephen declares he would now be a divorced, alcoholic neurosurgeon. Michael C. Bonello (Malta & St Edmund Hall 1966) is currently Chairman of Lombard Bank Malta p.l.c after having served as Governor of the Central Bank of Malta from 1999 to 2011. during this time, he steered the Bank towards adoption of the euro in 2008 and was also a member of the Governing Council of the european Central Bank (eCB) and of the Board of Governors of the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).

Those experiences, and accompanying insights into leadership, found their way into adjunct teaching, service at several NFP organizations and participation in local politics. In addition, contributing to the Association of American Rhodes Scholars (AARS), as President and now as a Board member, provides the opportunity to renew friendships and to meet many amazing members of the Rhodes community.

After the first 12 years of the Mandela Rhodes Scholarships programme, 325 Mandela Rhodes Scholarships have been awarded in total.Scholars have been drawn from 21 different African countries. They have studied at postgraduate level at 19 different South African institutions of higher learning.Their average age on election was 23. New Scholarships awarded for the Class of 2016 numbered 50, a record, and the total number of Mandela Rhodes Scholars in residence in the year is 72. The preserved Scholarships endowment for sustainability surpassed all targets.New voluntary Peer Mentoring and Class Giving programmes were successfully implemented.The Class of 2016 is participating fully in three residential leadership development workshops facilitated by MRF Programme director (and Mandela Rhodes Scholar) Judy Sikuza, assisted by the MRF team.More than 8,000 registrations of interest were recorded on the Foundation's electronic applications platform for the Class of 2016, a 55% increase over 2015.Of these, more than 1,000 met the requirements to be qualified for further consideration.For the Class of 2016, some 300 were 'long listed'; 75 were then 'short listed'; and 50 were selected - another record. At the Completion Workshop for the Class of 2015, we marked the 10th anniversary of the pioneering Class of 2005 - the very first group of Mandela Rhodes Scholars.

We decided to track her down before she shut the Rhodes House gate for the final time. Have you always been the accountant here or did you start in a different role? I have always been the accountant, but when I started I was part time and joined a team of three other members of staff. It was a very different set-up and it resulted in me also being very involved in the administration. Why did you want to work for the Rhodes Trust? I was working just down the street at the e xperimental Psychology d epartment, and wanted a change. I was very impressed by the architecture of Rhodes h ouse and it has always been a beautiful place in which to work. I have been in the basement office, the h awksley room, the Michell room and twice in the front office. So I have seen it from all angles!What have been some of the highlights during the 21 years here? The Centenary celebrations were a big highlight - meeting Nelson Mandela, President Clinton and the Queen. every year I have met incredible people from all walks of life - there aren't many places where that could happen. What will you miss most? definitely getting to know the Scholars each year. For eight years I baked a cake for them every Wednesday, I have hosted countless Sunday lunches for them at home, several dinners on Christmas day, and recently started an annual cricket match. What are your plans for your well-earned retirement? I want to do a lot more gardening, do more upholstery and woodworking, and also learn some entirely new crafts. Sheila Partridge with Rhodes Scholar Sishuwa Sishuwa (Zambia & St Antony's 2010) 8 May 1951 Dear GodfreyI have often felt the need for an Adding Machine here. It would save a lot of time with some of our accounts which are made up of a large number of separate items. It occurs to me also that your office might like to use it form time to time, and perhaps it coud be shared in that way - unless Miss Bain feels that a mechanical aid is not worthy of her mathematics! Yours everThe Secretary 8 May 1951 I did consult our auditors about an adding machine some time ago and they were extremely sceptical. They said that they could not think that the sort of totals that Rhodes House would have to deal with would be appropriate fodder for a machine, even if they were all left to be added at considerable intervals when they had reached their maximum! Apparantly it is quite easy, even after considerable practice to touch the wrong key. I have no experience whatever of adding machines myself. Godfrey 14 May 1951 Dear GodfreyWith regards the adding machine: the one I mentioned, costing only \u00a316, is quite a different matter. I have tried it myself and am convinced it is well worth the money, as a saver of time, and as a check on figures, and totals. I firmly believe that any mechanical aid, which, without disproportionate expense, can save time and labour, is a good investment for any office. Yours everThe SecretaryConnecting both Sheila's link to the Rhodes h ouse archives, and her role as accountant, we have tracked down some wonderful correspondence from 1951, and the mystery of new-fangled technology, namely The Adding Machine.
