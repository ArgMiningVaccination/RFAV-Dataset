As well as helping those with specific health conditions, such as stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia (and many more), I also see people who are simply looking to refocus their energies or seek a new direction in life. Energy Healing is a holistic approach, recognising that all aspects of the self are linked, and that it is necessary to treat the whole person to bring about deep healing on all levels. Energy work is particularly effective at helping those with chronic health conditions, chronic pain and auto-immune conditions where more conventional approaches are often lacking. It can also be an excellent complement to Western medicine. I also have a special interest in spiritual awakening, especially grounding and embodiment, working with individuals who are sensitive (empaths, HSPs, those experiencing psychic phenomena). I combine hands-on energy work with psychotherapeutic and somatic techniques, to help you reconnect to the creative energies at the core of your being. What I Offer I specialise in hands-on therapeutic energy work for healing and personal transformation. I am trained in multiple [energy medicine](https://www.luminousegg.com/articles/what-is-energy-medicine) modalities including and [energetic cellular healing](https://www.luminousegg.com/articles/what-is-energetic-cellular-healing) (based on the work of Barbara Brennan). Basically, I am passionate about this field, and will work to the very best of my abilities to help you. As a healer, I am concerned with the underlying balance of energy, intention and consciousness that support health, or become unbalanced and allow for disease. I create [bespoke sessions](https://www.luminousegg.com/about-energy-healing) tailored to your own unique needs. Energy Healing & Spiritual Development Energy Healing & Trauma Resolution Trauma is a pervasive fact of modern life. It affects everyone not just soldiers & victims of abuse - Peter Levine The nature of our vital energy is dynamic. It flows. However, when faced with painful difficulties in our life, we can suppress our feelings in order to carry on functioning. If long held patterns of suppression are not resolved, the blocked energy that results may eventually manifest as chronic or acute conditions of ill health. dive deep within Yourself Become more integrated and internally undivided.
