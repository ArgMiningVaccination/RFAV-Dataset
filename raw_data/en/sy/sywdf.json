Preferred Gonorrhea treatment Neisseria gonorrhea gonococcal infections increased 63% since 2014 complications can include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and increased transmission of HIV 6 ,, 7.7x higher rate in Blacks as compared to Whites in 2018 Disparity greatest in Midwest and Northeast than in South and West National disparities 1.6x higher rate among Hispanics compared to Whites Greatest in the Northeast 0.5x rate among Asians compared to Whites Consistent for all four regions of the US Disparities in MN- 2019 8 9 33, 725 cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis in MN in 2019 8,063 cases of gonorrhea #2 second most common STI in Minnesota CUHCC Data 2020 76 positive STI tests 17 Gonorrhea cases 10 received treatment Updated Gonorrhea Treatment 11 Gonorrhea treatment recommendations 12 Previously A single 250 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone + single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections Updated A single 500 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone for persons weighing <150 kg or a single 1 g IM dose of ceftriaxone for persons weighing 150 kg AND doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days if chlamydial infection has not been ruled out Maybe you need to divide the content 13 Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest one in the Solar System\u2014it's only a bit larger than our Moon. The planet's name has nothing to do with the liquid metal since it was named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury Venus has a beautiful name and is the second planet from the Sun.

However, test-of-cure is recommended for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea 7-14 days after initial treatment. Pharmacokinetics 250 mg ceftriaxone doesn't achieve levels >MIC for extended duration Azithromycin resistance percentage of N. gonorrhea isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility has increased more than sevenfold between 2013 and 2018 Rationale for the change: 15 Azithromycin resistance: 16 Question 2: What would you prescribe for this patient? 17 A. Ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 B.Cexime 800 mg orally x 1 C.Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM x 1 D.
