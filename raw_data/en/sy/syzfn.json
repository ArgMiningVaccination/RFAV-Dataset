A vaccine is a type of medicine that is given to help our body's immune system learn how to fight against different types of sickness (Understanding How Vaccine Work). Vaccines Available via Emergency Use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Pfizer-BioNTechModernaJohnson & Johnson-Janssen (currently paused for use) Why vaccinate? The COVID-19 vaccine helps protect you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience the sickness and the risk associated with it. Benefits of the COVID-19 Vaccine: Shown to be effective at preventing COVID-19May help keep you from getting seriously ill, even if you do get COVID-19May help protect those around youSafer way of building immunityImportant tool in stopping the pandemicSource: CCDPH Why Vaccine? adapted from CDC Source: CCDPH Why Vaccine? adapted from CDC Who is eligible to get vaccinated? And if I am eligible, where can I go to get vaccinated? What should I do after the COVID-19 Vaccination? What: After vaccination continue to follow COVID-19 precautions. Why: There is limited information on how much the COVID-19 vaccines may reduce transmission and how long protection lasts. When: At all times, even after receiving both doses. How: Quarantine if a close contactWash handsPhysically distanceCover coughs and sneezesFollow work and school guidanceWear a maskSanitize surfacesGet tested if having symptoms What steps are taken when a vaccine is created? Creating a vaccine is a complex process and there are a number of steps it has to go through before it can be released to the public. Learn more about the vaccine journey. Additional Frequently Asked Questions Additional Frequently Asked Questions Can the vaccine give me COVID-19? If I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated? Can my child get vaccinated for COVID-19? Is it safe to get a COVID-19 vaccine if I have an underlying medical condition? Is it better to get natural immunity to COVID-19 rather than immunity from a vaccine? Why do I need two COVID-19 shots? Will the shot hurt or make me sick? Are there long-term side effects from COVID-19 vaccine? How do I know if COVID-19 vaccine is safe? Why would a vaccine be needed if we can do other things, like physical distancing and wearing masks, to prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading? No. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use or in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID-19. However, it typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination. That means it's possible you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. Yes. CDC recommends that you get vaccinated even if you have already had COVID-19, because you can catch it more than once. While you may have some short-term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we don't know how long this protection will last. No. More studies need to be conducted before COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for children younger than age 16. Yes. COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people with underlying health problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity. People with these conditions are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. No. While you may have some short-term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we don't know how long this protection lasts. Vaccination is the best protection, and it is safe. People who get COVID-19 can have serious illnesses, and some have debilitating symptoms that persist for months. Currently authorized vaccines, and most vaccines under development, require two doses of vaccine. The first shot helps the immune system recognize the virus, and the second shot strengthens the immune response. You need both to get the best protection. There may be side effects, but they should go away within a few days. Possible side effects include a sore arm, headache, fever, or body aches. This does not mean you have COVID-19. Side effects are signs that the vaccine is working to build immunity. If they don't go away in a week, or you have more serious symptoms, call your doctor. Because all COVID-19 vaccines are new, it will take more time and more people getting vaccinated to learn about very rare or possible long-term side effects. The good news is, at least 8 weeks' worth of safety data were gathered in the clinical trials for all the authorized vaccines, and it's unusual for vaccine side effects to appear more than 8 weeks after vaccination. All COVID-19 vaccines were tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people to make sure they meet safety standards and protect adults of different ages, races, and ethnicities. There were no serious safety concerns. CDC and the FDA will keep monitoring the vaccines to look for safety issues after they are authorized and in use. Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools available. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and staying at least 6 feet away from others, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC's recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19.
