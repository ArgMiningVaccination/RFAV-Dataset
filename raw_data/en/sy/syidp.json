The call for withdrawing the vaccine is getting stronger. Recently, MIT Professor Retsef Levitook to Twitter to share the harm mRNA vaccines are causing in young people. \"The evidence is mounting and indisputable that mRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!,\" the MIT Expert in Analytics, Risk Management, Health Systems, Food & Agriculture Systems, Manufacturing & Supply Chain Management has tweeted. Professor Levi's video, in which he has warned against the use of mRNA vaccine, has received more than 1 million views so far.\"All COVID mRNA vaccination programs should stop immediately\" \"I'm filming this video to share my strong conviction that at this point in time, all COVID mRNA vaccination programs should stop immediately,\" Professor Levi has said. \"They should stop because they completely failed to fulfill any of their advertised promises regarding efficacy. And more importantly, they should stop because of the mounting and indisputable evidence that they cause unprecedented levels of harm, including the death of young people and children,\" he continued.\"mRNA vaccines indeed cause sudden cardiac arrest\" \"I believe that the cumulative evidence is conclusive and confirms our concern that the mRNA vaccines indeed cause sudden cardiac arrest as a sequel of vaccine-induced myocarditis. And this is potentially only one mechanism by which they cause harm,\" he said.

Motivated by that, we decided to analyze the Israel National EMS data to see if there are any signals of increased out of hospital adverse events,\" he added and continued to substantiate his claims with the results of several studies.

We detected an increase of 25% in the cause with cardiac arrest diagnosis among ages 16 to 39. In the first half of 2021, exactly when the vaccination campaign in Israel was launched, a smaller increase was also detected in the older ages. Moreover, we also detected a statistically significant temporal correlation between the number of the Pfizer vaccine doses administered to this population and the number of EMS calls with cardiac arrest diagnosis,\" says Professor Levi. \"Data from the UK, Scotland, and Australia replicate the data from Israel. Additional data from Israel indicates that in 2021, the EMS in Israel conducted more than 3,000 more resuscitations compared to 2019, which amounts for an increase of 27%. Two prospective studies from Thailand and Switzerland in which vaccines were tested before and after they received a vaccine, indicate that the rates of heart damage are likely to be significantly higher than the rates detected by clinical diagnosis. This is exactly the same finding that the US. military found in 2015 when it conducted a similar study on the smallpox vaccine.\" [\"A biopsy can spread cancer\": Myths oncologists wish you never believed](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/a-biopsy-can-spread-cancer-myths-oncologists-wish-you-never-believed/photostory/97580118.cms) He continued, \"Another study from the Harvard Medical School detected in the blood of children with vaccine-induced myocarditis, an entire spike, which is another indication of the underlying mechanism of harm, but in fact has even broader implications about the safety of the vaccine given the repeated evidence that we have that the mRNA and the lipids are actually penetrating the blood system.\" \"And finally, autopsies of people that died closely after they received the vaccine indicate that in a large number of cases, there is strong evidence that the death was caused by vaccine-induced myocarditis. So presented with all of this evidence, I think there is no other ethical or scientific choice but to pull out of the market these medical products and stop all the mRNA vaccination programs. This is clearly the most failing medical product in the history of medical products, both in terms of efficacy and safety,\" he said.

When the cells produce the viral protein using the mRNA an immune response is triggered. Not just COVID, mRNA vaccines have also been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Cancer research also uses mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells.How do mRNA vaccines work? A little portion of a protein typically located on the viral outer membrane is introduced as part of an mRNA vaccine's delivery mechanism. (People who receive an mRNA vaccination are not exposed to the virus and cannot contract the infection through the vaccine). There are three different types of COVID vaccine which are administered to improve the immunity against the virus which had emerged in 2019 in Wuhan, China. While mRNA is administered to people, vector vaccine and protein subunit vaccines are also in use. Here are the answers to few common questions related to mRNA vaccines: - What is mRNA vaccine? mRNA vaccines use a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein. - How to mRNA vaccines work? These vaccines work by using laboratory synthesized mRNA to teach our cells how to make a protein to trigger immune response. - What vaccines are mRNA? Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA . - What are the other types of COVID vaccines available? The other types of COVID vaccine available are vector vaccine and protein subunit vaccine. "}
