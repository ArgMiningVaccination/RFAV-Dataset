It is intended toprovide a guide for serving people with MS in the adult daysetting, but is not meant to substitute for, or to supersede,individualized physician treatment and advice. ivSECTION1 Introduction The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) developed this document to provide guidance to staff and administrators of adult day programs who are seeking to bettermeet the needs of their participants with MS. Multiple sclerosis is a complex, chronic disorder of the central nervous system that often generates needs for a range of long-term care services, including rehabilitationservices, home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home care. Individualswith MS often present a unique cluster of needs and when program staff are sensitiveto these needs and knowledgeable about MS care, the experience can be a successfulone for all involved. As compared to the more 'traditional' elderly adult day program participant, those with MS are more likely to: be youngerbe more mentally alertbe more physically dependentremain in the program longer As a result, your program staff may require additional training and resources to best address the care needs of this population. The NMSS is considered to be a leader in the initiation, support, and promotion of quality and age-appropriate care options for people with MS. Consistent with thisresponsibility, the Society recently convened an expert panel of NMSS home ofceand chapter staff, MS clinical specialists, adult day program directors and clinicians(from both generic and MS specific facilities), and experts in the fields of mentalhealth, social services, therapeutic activities and rehabilitation, to identify the keycomponents of quality adult day programming for people with MS. This task forcecontributed their knowledge and clinical expertise to the preparation of this documentthrough a series of meetings and research on best practices. This document is designed to be a practical resource for all adult day programs serving people with MS, from those serving only one or two MS participants to those providing specialized care to this population.It should be useful to program directors, nursing staff, rehabilitation professionals, activities staff,social workers, mental health professionals, and others involved in adult day programs. It is organized as follows: Background on multiple sclerosis, to provide the context for the delivery of careIntake and assessment of participants with MSUnique clinical issues that are characteristic of the disease and have implications for adult day programs The complex psychosocial needs that can be generated by MSAppropriate therapeutic activitiesRehabilitation needsStafng, training and physical plant issues We recognize that adult day programs are different in terms of physical plant, stafng, and programming. Some offer primarily social programming, while others have a signicantmedical component. Some may offer on-going rehabilitation services, while others mayonly contract for these services on an individual referral basis. Whatever the nature ofyour particular program, we hope that this publication will provide useful and practicalinformation that will help to enhance your programming for people with multiplesclerosis. Please feel free to contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at 1-800-FIGHT-MS for more information about this document and multiple sclerosis. WHAT IS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS? MS is thought to be an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS).The CNS consists of the brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerves. Surrounding and protectingthe nerve bers of the CNS is a fatty tissue called myelin, which helps nerve bers conductelectrical impulses. In MS, myelin is lost in multiple areas, leaving scar tissue called sclerosis . These damaged areas are also known as plaques or lesions. Sometimes the nerve ber itself is damaged orbroken. Myelin not only protects nerve bers, but also makes their job possible. When myelin or the nerve fiber is destroyed or damaged, the ability of the nerves to conduct electricalimpulses to and from the brain is disrupted, and this produces the various symptoms of MS. 2People with MS can expect one of four clinical courses of disease, each of which might be mild, moderate, or severe. Relapsing-Remitting: People with this type of MS experience clearly dened flare-ups (also called relapses, attacks, or exacerbations). These are episodes of acute worseningof neurologic function. They are followed by partial or complete recovery periods(remissions) free of disease progression. This is the most common form of MS at timeof initial diagnosis. Secondary-Progressive: People with this type of MS experience an initial period of relapsing-remitting disease followed by a steadily worsening disease course, with orwithout occasional flare-ups. About 50% of people with relapsing-remitting MSdevelop this form of the disease within 10 years of their initial diagnosis. Primary-Progressive: People with this type of MS experience a slow but nearly continuous worsening of their disease from the onset, with no distinct relapses orremissions. However, there can be variations in rates of progression over time,occasional plateaus, and temporary minor improvements. Progressive-Relapsing: People with this type of MS experience a steadily worsening disease from the onset but also have clear acute attacks as well. WHAT CAUSES MS? While the exact cause of MS is unknown, most researchers believe that the damage tomyelin results from an abnormal response by the body's immune system called anautoimmune response. Normally, the immune system defends the body against foreigninvaders such as viruses or bacteria. In autoimmune diseases, the body attacks its owntissue. It is believed that MS is an autoimmune disease and that it is the myelin that thebody attacks. Scientists do not yet know what triggers the immune system to do this. Mostagree that several factors are involved, including: genetics, gender, and environmentaltriggers (e.g., a virus or toxic environmental material). It is important to note that MS is not contagious and is not usually fatal. MS is not inher ited, although a genetic predisposition is probable and being studied WHO GETS MS? Anyone may develop MS, but there are some patterns. Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50.Two to three times as many women as men have MS.Studies indicate that genetic factors make certain individuals more susceptible than others, but there is no evidence that MS is directly inherited. 3MS occurs more commonly among people with northern European ancestry, but people of African, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds are not immune. (In fact, insome locations adult day programs will reflect the local community and will have a majority of participants who are not of northern European ancestry.) Approximately 400,000 Americans have MS, and every week about 200 people are diagnosed. W orldwide, MS may affect 2.5 million individuals. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF MS? Symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from person to person and from time to time in the same person. For example, one person may experience abnormal fatigue,while another might have severe vision problems. A person with MS could have loss ofbalance and muscle coordination making walking difcult; another person with MScould have slurred speech, tremors, stiffness, and bladder problems. While some symptomswill come and go over the course of the disease, others may be more lasting. Symptomsseen in individuals in an adult day program may be more severe or disabling. Symptoms include: mobility problems (weakness, incoordination, problems with balance, muscle stiffness, tremors), fatigue, bladder and bowel problems (incontinence, urgency,frequency, constipation), changes in cognition (reduced short-term solving), abnormal sensations (numbness, tingling, painful sensations),vision problems, speech and swallowing problems and sexual dysfunction. HOW IS MS DIAGNOSED? At this time, no single test is available to identify or rule out MS. Several tests and proceduresare needed. These are likely to include: Complete Medical History: Healthcare providers need an overall view of the individual's health picture, including symptoms and when they began. Nervous System Functioning: Testing of reflexes, balance, coordination, and vision\u2014 as well as checking for areas of numbness. Diagnostic Tests such as: MRI scan, which gives a detailed view of the brain.Evoked potential tests, which measure how quickly and accurately a person's nervous system responds to certain stimulation. Spinal tap, which checks spinal fluid for signs of the disease. Two basic signs are required to confirm MS: (1) signs of disease in different parts of the nervous system and (2) signs of at least two separate flare-ups (also called relapses or exacerbations) of the disease. 4HOW IS MS TREATED? Management of MS involves the following: Symptomatic Management: Improve function, relieve discomfort, and prevent complications and secondary disability through medications and rehabilitation. Quality of Life Interventions: Address psychosocial and other issues regarding coping and adaptation. Relapse Management: Treat acute relapses (known as flare-ups, attacks, or exacerbations) in order to shorten the duration and reduce the severity. Most physicians prescribeIV steroids to treat relapses that are severe. Disease Modification: Reduce number of relapses, rate of progression and development of new lesions; current FDA-approved disease modifying drugs and Novantrone\u00ae. PARTICIPANT PROFILE Note: Julie is not a factual person, but a composite of several persons with MS. Thisprofile illustrates some of the wide range ofissues an individual with MS may present.Depending on the level of care your programprovides, you may or may not be able to meetthe needs of this hypothetical participant. Julie is a 49-year-old, married, white female who was admitted to the programfour years ago. She is a college graduate with an advanced degree in education and had acareer working with learning disabled children. Her family consists of her husband, twoteenage sons who are away at college, and elderly parents. Julie had always been a veryindependent person and took great satisfaction in being able to raise her family, maintaina successful career, and run her own life. In her late twenties, when her sons were in elementary school, she had an episode of blurred and diminished vision and went to her ophthalmologist to nd out what washappening. He discovered optic neuritis and suggested she see a neurologist. She wassubsequently diagnosed with MS. The diagnosis came as a shock as she had previouslybeen very healthy. She continued teaching, but after about ten years other symptomsappeared. She was embarrassed about her unsteady gait and worried that people mightthink she had been drinking. She began to have trouble remembering appointments andprocessing information. Her reasoning and problem solving were also diminished. Herdisease progressed rapidly. She experienced trouble walking and progressed from using acane to using a wheelchair if she had to travel any distance. These mobility issues and the 5 MS leaves you by your- self. You feel alone. Itbecomes the focus of your life. It comes to live with you.You have to come to live with it.\"\"cognitive decline ultimately caused her to resign her teaching position. While Julie was coping with these losses, her teenaged sons also struggled with these changes in theirfamily. It was a stressful situation for everyone. Julie began receiving visiting nurse services several days each week. By age 45, she was experiencing frequent falls at home. At that time her sons were already away at college.Her husband worked full time and became increasingly uncomfortable with his wifebeing home alone all day (with the exception of a couple of hours of home health care).He was also nding that at the end of his long workday, he had little patience or energyto care for Julie and he was afraid that he was becoming verbally abusive to her. Herparents were able to provide some assistance, but they were elderly, with health problemsof their own. Julie and her husband decided to try an adult day program so that Julie could socialize with other people during the day, be in a safe, supervised environment, receive help withher injectable medication and self care, and have access to rehabilitation services. Eventhough it was a joint decision, Julie felt angry that she could no longer be alone at home.She was frightened that this was the rst step on the road to greater dependence. The rstseveral months were difficult as she struggled with this new chapter in her life. Further-more, many of the other participants were elderly and she initially didn't think she hadmuch in common with them. After a while, Julie was unable to mobilize her own manual wheelchair. The program referred her to a seating and positioning clinic where a team of occupational and physicaltherapists provided a comprehensive assessment, and enabled her to obtain the mostappropriate power wheelchair for her current and future needs. She was now able to gooutdoors on her own and relax in a private spot in the center's garden. She was able toparticipate in the program's outings to museums and shopping without gettingexhausted. And on weekends, she and her husband could go out to dinner or visit friendsmore easily. Her husband also found that her evening care was reduced because the nurseat the program gave Julie the injections for her disease-modifying therapy on the daysthat she was in the program. Julie was more cheerful and relaxed. Julie made a few friends at the program. She met an elderly man who had been a school superintendent and they enjoyed talking together about education issues. The day programstaff arranged for her to tutor another participant who was a new immigrant and justlearning English and that made her feel that she could still use her teaching skills andthat she had something to give others. The program staff are concerned that her transfers sometimes require the help of two people but they are committed to having her remain in the program. She comes 3 days per week and has been in the program for four years. She seems to benefitfrom the socialization, the group exercise sessions, and the activities program. She isalso monitored medically, and receives her injections regularly. Her husband findsthat the peace of mind and reduced responsibility for her daily care has significantlyhelped their relationship. 6Intake and Assessment INTAKE The intake process most often begins with a telephone inquiry by the individual with MS or his/her caregiver. This brief telephone interview offers staff the opportunity to: Describe the program and clarify the services offered.Begin to gain an understanding of the needs and expectations of the potential participant. Assess interest in the program on the part of the individual and his/her family members/caregivers. Most centers offer potential participants an opportunity to visit the center and/or participate in a 'trial day'. Exposing the potential participant to the activities of theprogram, the environment, and the other participants is valuable in determiningwhether there is an appropriate match between the individual's needs and interestsand the program's offerings. Each state and each program may use different criteria to determine if an individual is appropriate for admission to the program. Some require that the individual be ableto transfer independently or be fully continent. Others may allow Hoyer lift transfersand assistance with toileting. Some programs may be equipped to help a participantchange and shower if they are incontinent; others do not have the facilities to dothis. Be sure the participant fully understands your admission and discharge criteria. Provide information orally and in writing. Explain these criteria to a family member as well.Most importantly, the program must answer the following questions affirmativelybefore admitting any potential participant. SECTION2\"Can we meet the needs of this individual?\" \"Will this individual benet from the program we offer?\"\"Is an adult day program the most appropriate setting for this individual, or do they require referral to other support services?\" Affordability is often a concern for potential participants. Participants who are Medicaid recipients may be eligible for adult day coverage. Home and Community-Based Waiverprograms are now in place in many states and may cover adult day services. (Look forfunding programs with names such as 'community integration\" and \"communityoptions\" in the title.) Medicare may also cover some services (such as PT or OT) in theadult day setting. State and county funding options should be explored as each has itsown unique funding streams. Private and community agencies might also be a resourcefor funding. Once admission to the program is agreed upon, the individual and the center staff should enter into a contract so that expectations are clear. Discharge criteria should be addressedat this time as well, as circumstances under which the participant might be asked to leavethe program must be clearly understood. Providing the new participant with a copy ofthe agreement may also prove helpful. Facilitating the Admission Process MS makes severe emotional demandson those living with the disease.Individuals and families are confrontedwith many functional and physicallosses, major changes in family andsocial roles, and loss of control overmany life decisions. The individual inadult day may be resistant to joining aprogram and participating at rst, andmay experience problems in adjusting. Sensitivity and understanding of the emotionaland social needs generated by MS can help program staff facilitate adjustment for newparticipants. Assigning both a staff member and veteran participant as a 'buddy' to thenew person may help to give needed initial support and orientation. Highlighting the many emotional benets of participating in adult day care\u2014opportunities to meet others, make friends, develop new interests, have a life outside of the home andsomething to talk about at the end of the day, can help potential and new participantsfeel better about this change in their lives with MS. It is also important to address any concern that an applicant might have that attendance at a day program could negativelyimpact their access to home care services, or their relationship with a particular homehealth aide. 8 Ilike having older and younger people together. The olderpeople give us wisdom; we give them youth.\"\"Adult day services can bring a great relief to family caregivers. These services may enable family members to continue working and provide the respite necessary for emotionalhealth. Often adult day services provide the support needed to enable the individual toremain in their own home and delay out-of-home placement. ASSESSMENT Assessment at admission to the program should ideally involve an evaluation of thefollowing areas: Health status (current MS symptoms, other medical needs, medications)Emotional health (evidence of depression, emotional lability, behavioral issues)Cognitive status (symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, ability to participate in the program, self-awareness) Functional status (mobility, transfers, self-care, toileting, bathing, feeding and swal- lowing issues, fatigue, use of assistive technology, fluctuations in ability over courseof day, speech and hearing, vision) Psychosocial status (including family roles, living situation, employment and educa- tion history, sexuality, status or other support services such as hours of home care) Wellness/Fitness status (including tobacco and alcohol consumption, health main- tenance behaviors, exercise history, nutrition, stress management, spiritual outlookand resources) Leisure status (hobbies, interests)Safety (falls, judgment)Caregiver concerns and prioritiesParticipant concerns and prioritiesSource of funding for day program participation Depending on your program's resources, stafng and mission, the extent of your initial assessment will vary. Some programs obtain a brief summary of medical status andconduct an informal interview to gather basic information regarding needs, interests,and function. Other programs may conduct more extensive, formal assessments usingstandardized assessment tools. Below are suggested questions that can help you determine the status, needs and interests of the new participant with MS, as well as recommendations of standardized assessment tools that are availableto more formally evaluate a particular functional area. More information about these tools and howto obtain them is included in the appendices of this document. 910Physical Health StatusWhat are your current MS symptoms? (Include bladder and bowel dysfunction.) What are your current medications? (It is helpful to have the participant actuallyshow you the prescription bottles.) Do you take an injectable medication for your MS? Do you have any allergies? Do you experience other medical prob- lems? Have you had recent hospitalizations, trips to the ER, or other medical inter-ventions? What is your overall health status aside from MS?Standard Medical History Psychosocial StatusAre you depressed, anxious? What are your reasons for coming to the program? What is your marital status? What is your level of education? What is your employment history? i.e., What type of work did you do? Who are the members of your family? What are your family's concerns about your MS? With whom do you live? Do you use tobacco/cigarettes/recreational drugs? How will you be transported to the program? What are the biggest challenges you face in living with MS day-to-day?Multiple Sclerosis Quality of LifeInventory(MSQLI) Standard HistoryAssessment of the New Participant Domain Key Questions Assessment Tools11Functional Status What mobility devices do you use?

This model assessment toolcan be adapted for your program's needs. It contains questions specifically geared to the participantwith MS and will provide you with practical information that will be very helpful in the developmentof a care plan.Clinical Issues and Symptom Implications CLINICAL ISSUES These guidelines for clinical and personal care, while specic to MS for our purpose here, may well apply to other adult day program participants as well. While some ofthe symptoms of MS are seen in other disorders and may be familiar to adult dayprogram staff, the clustering and nature of these symptoms present a unique challengeto the individual with MS and his/her caregivers. It is crucial that staff be aware ofthe ways these symptoms present in persons with MS, how they affect the individuals'day-to-day lives, and potential treatments and strategies for management. Information about intervention and management is provided here to alert staff as to how these symptoms may be addressed and to describe the range of clinical experiences that individualswith MS have. It is not assumed that these interventions will necessarily be provided by the adultday program staff. MS SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT The following symptoms of MS generate a wide variety of care needs. While not all of these symptoms will be present in any one individual, the nature of the disease issuch that multiple symptoms will be present. Access to appropriate health servicesand management of these symptoms are critical to avoiding clinical complicationsand preventing avoidable physical decline. Symptoms are listed in alphabetical order, not in order of prevalence in persons with MS.SECTION314 Balance Problems Balance problems include an unsteady or \"drunken\" type of gait known as ataxia. Balance problems may lead to falls, general unsteadiness, and may pose safety risksespecially when coming to a standing position or transferring to a wheelchair. TIPS: Balance Problems 1. The participant may require close supervision, especially during transfers. 2. Handrails and grab bars strategically placed may provide safe and independent mobility. Canes or walkers can help prevent falls for ambulatory participants. 3. Side trunk supports and seat belts (as positioning devices, not as restraints) are often recommended for seating balance, as are wheelchairs with a \"tilt\" feature ifbalance issues are severe. The appropriateness of these wheelchair features are bestevaluated by specialists in seating and positioning, which include occupationaland physical therapists. 4. Supervised therapeutic exercises that challenge balance may be helpful in stimu- lating balance centers and improving balance, but compensatory measures, suchas use of a cane, may be necessary. These measures are best determined by a physicaland occupational therapy evaluation. Bladder Dysfunction Urinary bladder dysfunction is very common inMS and may occur in several forms. These includefrequency and/or urgency of urination, inconti-nence, and hesitancy in starting urine flow or,in some cases, complete inability to urinate(retention). Frequent nighttime urination (nocturia) may interfere with sleep, which mayincrease daytime fatigue. Proper management isnecessary to prevent urinary tract infections,dangerous urinary retention that may damage thedetrusor (the primary bladder muscle) and damageto kidneys due to back-up of urine into the kidney.The need to urinate frequently or incontinence isdiscouraging to an individual with MS and he/shemay withdraw socially due to embarrassment orfear of having an accident. Frequent bathroomvisits can also be frustrating to staff who need tohelp every time. (more information about bladder dysfunction appears on the next page)Clinical Note: Medications such as oxybutin bladdermuscle and relieve symptomsof urgency and frequency,may be helpful. The majorside effects of these medica-tions are dry mouth and constipation, which will, inturn, need to be managed. In some individuals, anindwelling catheter may benecessary to maintain inde-pendence and quality of life.15 TIPS: Bladder Dysfunction 1. Some individuals report that cranberry extract in gel cap or tablet form or cranberry juice is helpful for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection. 2. Individuals who suffer from urgency and/or bladder spasms should avoid caf- feinated and carbonated beverages. 3. Individuals should NOT necessarily sip fluids all day to remain hydrated. They should try to drink most of their fluids with their meals and go to the toilet60-90 minutes later. A practical intake volume is approximately six 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day. This is based on anecdotal experience. 4. Bathroom facilities placed conveniently near activity areas will make it easier for those dealing with bladder issues. 5. Individuals who leak urine should wear appropriate protection. Suggesting the use of pads or protective garments needs to be approached with sensitivity to theindividual's possible sense of humiliation and loss of dignity. This would best bedone by a trusted staff member, ensuring condentiality and privacy. If leakingurine becomes excessive, a urologic assessment may be indicated. 6. Skin irritation or breakdown may ensue if the individual is frequently wet. Instruct the participant in how to examine and protect the skin. 7. There are many types of leg bags and even a \"belly bag\" which can be worn by individuals with indwelling catheters. These are not visible to others and thus willnot interfere as much with social activities. 8. Some individuals with MS may elect surgical procedures to manage continence.9. The National Association for Continence can be a helpful resource of information on bladder issues. Contact information is listed in Appendix C.Many people with MS have managed bladder issues for many years. Intermittent catheterization is a common intervention, depending on the type of dysfunction.Self-management of intermittent catheterization is often a component of independentliving for this population.16 Bowel Dysfunction People with MS may experience constipation because of inadequate fluid or bulk in the diet, decreased physical activity, medications, and/or from MS involvement thatmay slow the bowel or weaken abdominal muscles. Interventions that the participantmay be doing at home might include increasing fluid and fiber intake, a routine bowel schedule, bulk formers, stool softeners, oral stimulants, laxatives, andmechanical stimulation. Frequent use of enemas is not recommended but may benecessary for optimal scheduling of activities and may also be the preference of the person with MS. Individuals may have decreased rectal sensation, causing the individual to feel uncertainty as to complete elimination. Incomplete elimination may lead to fecalimpaction. Incontinence of stool may occur in some individuals. This often leadsto social isolation if the participant becomes afraid of public incontinence. Diarrhea may occur secondary to fecal impaction, overuse of laxatives, or medications. Incontinence is much more likely to be a problem when diarrhea is present. An additionalcomplication from diarrhea may be skin irritation and ambulation safety issues due to thenature of the 'emergency'. Sensitivity to the person who has had uninhibited bowelelimination is essential. A structured, daily plan for bowel management can lead tomore predictable bowel habits. TIP: Bowel Dysfunction 1. Because of constipation and decreased rectal sensation, some persons may sit on a toilet for excessively long periods. Periodic reminders and checking of the participant is suggested.17 Cognitive Changes Persons with MS may experience a range of cognitive problems and when present, these decits may range from quite mild to severe. Rarely, however, will an individualwith MS present with global dementia or disorientation. Specic cognitive decits,such as impaired short-term memory, ability to multi-task, planning, attention, wordnding, judgment, and organizational skills, are found in MS. Additionally, MS mayaffect the ability to process information in a timely manner and readily adapt tochanging situations. These cognitive impairments may cause a person with MS tobecome dependent on caregivers, even if his/her physical disability is minimal. Thesepersons may isolate themselves because they can no longer 'keep up'. In general, intel-ligence in persons with MS who have cognitive changes remains intact. TIPS: Cognitive Changes 1. Provide training to nursing and direct care staff in recognizing and responding to people with cognitive decits. Sensitivity and awareness of the cognitive andemotional issues that may influence the behavior of the participant can help staffmanage behaviors more effectively. 2. Include training to staff in differentiating the cognitive decits associated with MS from those associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. 3. Recognize that a participant's ability to self-report may be impaired, but their awareness of cognitive impairment will be signicantly greater than older clientswith dementia. Many individuals with MS who experience cognitive impairmentsare very aware of their difficulties, which can increase their frustration anddecrease their willingness to try new things. 4. Develop consistent daily routines.5. Provide stimulating and interesting activities to help participants with cognitive decits use intact skills. 6. Activities requiring mental effort may be better accomplished early in the day, and for a short time period. 7. Repeat information and write down important points. Follow verbal instructions with written back up and visual aids when possible. Encourage the person to keepa notebook, electronic organizer, or calendar to track important information. 8. A participant's judgment, planning and organizational function may have an impact on the safety of operating wheelchairs, especially power-operated wheel-chairs/scooters. An occupational therapist should be consulted to address issuesof safe driving for individuals with MS who are experiencing cognitive problems. 9. A neuropsychology consult can be useful to dene the cognitive dysfunction and work with staff and the participant to compensate for it.Fatigue Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of MS. MS fatigue is a lack of physical energy,mental energy or both. People with MS mayexperience normal fatigue, fatigue of depression,the fatigue of disease, and/or the fatigue ofneuromuscular overuse. Unlike fatigue experi-enced by neurologically normal individuals,fatigue in MS can be overwhelming and truly disabling. Like other MS symptoms,it may come and go over a period of hours or days. A participant may be able toaccomplish tasks independently in the early part of the day and require assistancewith those same tasks in the afternoon due to MS fatigue. Additionally, fatigue inMS may worsen dramatically in the presence of concurrent illness, especially if feveris present, or sometimes by exposure to heat, as in taking a hot shower, or using ahot tub or heated swimming pool. (see TIPS for dealing with fatigue on the next page)Clinical Note: Appropriate medications for the overwhelm-ing lassitude of fatigue includeamantadine, fluoxetine, moda-nil, and methylphenidate. Dysphagia (Swallowing Difficulties) While swallowing is not a problem for mostpeople with MS, some may experience difcultyswallowing or be prone to choking. Changingthe consistency of food and planning rest periodsbefore meals may help prevent possible chokingand aid in adequate nutrition.Clinical Note: Medical inter- ventions to address swallowingproblems include swallowingtherapy, usually performed bya speech and language pathol-ogist. TIPS: Dysphagia (Swallowing Difficulties) 1. Thickened tea and coffee are much more palatable when served iced than when warm. Such iced drinks resemble a milkshake in texture and taste. 2. If you are using a thickening agent, add the thickener just before serving the liquid since it may become too thick if it stands for any length of time. 3. Save some frozen drink containers from local fast food restaurants and ice cream shops for serving thickened juices. The presentation helps the palatability sincewe \"expect\" such drinks to be \"thick\" and \"slushy.\" 4. If the participant eats slowly, and a microwave is handy, reheat food after 20 minutes to make it more palatable. 5. Teach direct care staff how to perform the Heimlich maneuver. Persons identied with swallowing problems should be instructed in the self-Heimlich procedure. 6. Encourage the person to refrain from talking while swallowing. Choking often occurs when these two activities are simultaneous. 18TIPS: Fatigue 1. A sudden increase in fatigue level is often the rst sign of infection in people with MS. Monitor the individual's temperature when there is a sudden onset of fatigue.If the person has a history of urinary tract infections, it is advisable to obtain orrecommend a urinalysis as soon as possible following an increase in fatigue. 2. Overheating should be avoided to minimize fatigue in heat-sensitive individuals.3. Schedule rest periods after activity and meal periods.4. Consult with an occupational therapist to discuss principles of energy conservation and specic energy saving techniques. 5. Meditation and other relaxation techniques may be useful in managing fatigue.6. Fatigue can have a tremendous impact on the ability to carry out activities of daily living during the course of the day. Staff must be aware that the individualmay be independent in the morning, and require a great deal of assistance by theafternoon. 19Hearing and Speech Problems Hearing loss is an uncommon symptom of MS. About six percent of people who have MS com-plain of impaired hearing. Deafness due to MS isexceedingly rare, and most acute episodes ofhearing loss caused by MS tend to improve.Hearing loss is usually associated with othersymptoms that suggest damage to the brainstem(that part of the nervous system that con tains the nerves that help to control vision, hearing, balance, and equilibrium). Because hearing de cits are so uncommon in MS, people with MS who do develop hearing loss should havetheir hearing thoroughly evaluated to rule out other causes. Speech abnormalities are relatively common in MS. These vary tremendously from person to person. Dysarthria is the most common problem. This can range from amild slurring of speech or alteration of the normal speech cadence to a severedysarthria, making communication difficult. Some people with MS may also haveproblems with word-finding. This can slow their communication down and makeordinary conversation more difficult. Hypophonia or other problems with volumecontrol can also be present. Speech problems often become more pronounced duringtimes of stress or fatigue.Clinical Note: Speech/language therapy may be effective inimproving dysarthria, hypo-phonia other speech problems. Also, speech andlanguage pathologists may beable to recommend assistivedevices to aid communication.20Pain and Sensory Disturbances Sensory disturbances include tingling, burning and other unusual skin sensations. Some peoplewith MS may experience hypersensitivity totouch or distorted sensations in response totouch. Sometimes ordinary touch or brushing ofthe skin may be painful. Many individuals experi-ence an electric shock sensation upon flexion ofthe neck called, L'hermitte's phenomenon. Pain can be caused by the sensory disturbances noted above, but can also be present as a severeaching or burning sensation. People with MS willoften have \"phantom pains\", or sharp stabbingpains with no obvious cause. Trigeminal Neuralgiais a sudden, sharp stabbing pain in the face thatlasts only a few seconds, but may re-occur frequently throughout the day. Musculoskeletal injury can also be a source of pain in MS. People with MS often over-use theirstronger muscles in favor of weaker ones, and inso doing, will injure those muscles and joints.Back pain is common, and is often caused by an abnormal gait or posture. Individualswho use walkers or wheelchairs will often develop arm and hand injuries from over-use of the upper extremities. In addition, injuries to the shoulders and back are com- monly caused by care-givers during assistance in transfers. These types of pain should be tr eated with physical therapy, heat, anti-inflammatory medications, and other pain medicines as needed. Pain from spasticity and tight muscles is also a com- mon complaint. (See section on spasticity.) Diminished sensation may present a safety concern in bathing and feeding (exposure to hot water, beverages, and food), smoking and use of ambulatory aides, and loss ofsensation or discomfort to touch may affect a person's sexual activity. (see TIPS for dealing with pain and sensory disturbances on the next page)Clinical Note: The most effec- tive medical treatment for painshould be geared as much aspossible to the source of thepain. A careful examination, todetermine the presence ofinjury, non-MS causes for pain,and the type of pain is essentialin choosing the appropriatetreatment. Many medicationscan be topicalanesthetics. Narcotics in some cases. Sometimesa pain management clinic canbe helpful in controlling painwith injections.21 TIPS: Pain and Sensory Disturbances 1. Some people with MS may experience burning or stinging sensations on their legs and feet that may lead them to prefer to be barefoot or wear slippers rather thanshoes and socks, and may worsen with weight bearing, leading them to prefer awheel chair over walking. 2. Persons with decreased sensation and mobility impairments need to check them selves for scrapes and cuts and redness over pressure-sensitive areas as this may be a warning of a potential pressure sore. 3. Heat or ice may be effective for local pain in the muscles and joints. However, use caution when using heat as this may exacerbate symptoms. 4. Not all pain in persons with MS is from MS. Be sure to encourage the individual to work with their physician to identify the source of pain and obtain appropriatetreatment. 5. Some people with MS report that massage and relaxation techniques have helped them deal with their pain but there is no research to conrm such a connection Respiratory Muscle Weakness Weakness of the respiratory muscles due to MS predisposes persons with MS topulmonary infections. Persons with MS should be encouraged to receive both theinfluenza vaccine annually and the pneumovax (every seven to ten years). While asimple cold may not pose a problem to most people, the presence of respiratorymuscle weakness and inadequate deep breathing and cough increase the risk ofdeveloping pneumonia. Individuals with weak respiratory muscles should beencouraged to focus on deep breathing exercises. Seizures Seizures occur only in about ve percent of persons with MS and usually respond to anticonvulsant medications.22 Spasticity Spasticity (muscle stiffness, tightness, or involuntary muscle contractions) is one of the most challengingof all MS symptoms. Spasticity of the legs affectsmobility and may cause significant discomfort.As with many MS symptoms, it is experienceddifferently by different people and can changeover the course of the day or week within oneperson. Management of spasticity may include stretching programs and prescription of antispasticitymedication. Reduction of spasticity with thesemeasures may reduce complications such asincreased fatigue and pain, as well as seriousproblems, such as skin breakdown and contrac- tures. If the individual has a home program ofstretching, staff might be asked to assist the individual in carrying out the programat the adult day center. While many programs do not have full time rehabilitation staff, consider bringing in an OT or PT for periodic consultation and to offer ideas forgroup exercises that include stretching and spasticity management.Clinical Note: Medicines used to reduce spasticity includebaclofen, diazepam, tizanidine. If a per-son is having serious problemswith spasticity, there are med-ical interventions that can beconsidered such as an implant-able pump that delivers a drugcalled baclofen directly into thespinal column, botulinum toxin injections to relax muscles, orphenol blocks, which reducestimulation of the muscle. TIPS: Spasticity 1. Remember that muscle spasms are involuntary. Telling the individual to \"relax\" will not help and may even make things worse, since spasticity is often aggravatedby anxiety. It is best to have the person stop whatever they are doing if possible,and wait until the spasm passes before proceeding. 2. Clonus (rhythmic jerking of the muscles, often the ankle) can often be stopped by having the individual take weight off of the jerking ankle or change position. 3. Avoid quick, sudden movements that can set off spasms. Guide the individual to move slowly and smoothly. 4. Stretching is different from the passive range of motion. It is slower and positions are held longer. It is advisable to have a qualied medical professional (physicaltherapist) train the staff. A typical maintenance schedule is 20 minutes threetimes a week. The stretching exercise program can be self-directed. It is preferableto perform stretching on a physical therapy mat for maximum stretch. 5. People with spasticity who are ambulatory should be encouraged to use a cane or walker to help stabilize balance in walking and transfers. (TIPS for dealing with spasticity continue on the next page)23 TIPS: Spasticity (continued) 6. Correct positioning may decrease spasticity. A physical or occupational therapist can train participants and caregivers in the best positioning techniques to controlspasticity. 7. An unusual increase in spasticity may be indicative of a bladder infection or other change in metabolic status. 8. Some individuals report positive outcomes from massage therapy and other relaxation techniques. (Be sure that massage therapists are certied and obtainreferences if your program opts to offer this service.) Tremor Tremor, or involuntary shaking, can be very disabling for people with MS when it affects thelimbs or head. Tremor, which appears with use ofa limb, is referred to as intention tremor or actiontremor and may greatly impair functions such asreaching or grasping or placement of a foot instanding or walking. This is the most commonand generally most disabling form of tremor thatoccurs in people with MS. Like spasticity, tremormay worsen primidone, and may help reduce only a modesteffect. Physical techniques,e.g., weighting, immobilization,and patterning may also help.Tremors are very challenging to control. Speech therapy mayhelp control tremors of thelips, tongue, and jaw. TIPS: Tremor 1. Handrails and grab bars strategically placed may provide for safe and independent mobility. 2. Weights and other devices can be attached to a limb to inhibit or compensate for tremors. An occupational therapist is the health professional that can best adviseabout assistive devices to aid in the management of tremor.24 Vision Deficits MS may affect vision in several ways. Abnormalities in activation of muscles that move the eyes may result in double vision. Malfunction in the brain centers that control eyemovement may also result in jerking movements of the eyes, known as nystagmus.This can result in difculty in focusing on objects, since sometimes the individual willsee the world as constantly in motion. In addition to problems focusing, this can alsocause vertigo, which can be debilitating. Damage and inflammation to the opticnerves themselves, known as optic neuritis, results in varying degrees of visual loss,ranging from clouding or dimming of vision to, in some cases, severe visual loss.Cataracts may develop at a younger age in persons with MS because treatment with corticosteroid medications may promote their development. As with other MSsymptoms, visual disturbances may increase with fatigue, stress, and high temperatures.Some individuals may benefit from a consultation with an ophthalmologist or lowvision center, though loss due to optic nerve damage, unlike ordinary visual impair-ment due to changes in the lens of the eye, are not correctable with lenses. TIPS: Vision Deficits 1. Some persons with MS qualify for services for the legally blind such as large print books, talking book players, and free rental of talking books that are maileddirectly to the individual. 2. Many participants with MS will require large screen TVs to view videos or TV programs. 3. The easiest written material for persons with visual impairment due to their MS is plain black lettering on white paper in at least a size 14 font. 4. Contrasting colors on doorframes will assist persons with MS to enter and exit rooms in their power operated wheelchairs and scooters with fewer collisions. 5. Occupational therapy can help in devising adaptations for persons with visual problems.25 Weakness Muscle weakness is a common symptom of MS. Weakness can cause problems such as toe drag, foot drop, or other gait abnormalities. Weakness in the arms may causeproblems in carrying out activities of daily living. Weakness may result from disuse or from interrupted neurotransmission. Strengthening exercises may improve the strength of muscles weak from disuse butwill not improve muscle weakness secondary to poor neurotransmission. Managingweakness must be done in conjunction with management of spasticity and fatigue to be effective. TIPS: Weakness 1. Use of mobility devices may offset the effects of weakness. Participants should be encouraged to use mobility aides such as canes, crutches, or wheelchairs whennecessary to preserve independence. 2. Be attentive to safety when a participant comes to the program with a new (or never used) power wheelchair. If possible, have a physical or occupationaltherapist perform a safety evaluation and 'driver's test'. 3. There is a proper and safe technique for using mobility aids. These need to be the appropriate height and size for an individual. Proper adjustments should bemade by a physical therapist. 4. Wheelchairs may have removable arm and leg rests to improve safety and independence in transferring. Power-operated wheelchairs may have handcontrols, or other adaptive devices for mobilization. Choosing features for amanual or power wheelchair should be done as part of a comprehensive seat-ing and positioning assessment. These assessments are best done at a clinicwith this expertise, with both occupational and physical therapists. 5. Power-wheelchair batteries need to be recharged every evening. 6. A physical or occupational therapist can demonstrate various transfer techniques, such as stand and pivot and sliding boards, and determine which technique ismost appropriate for the individual. 7. Improper transfers can lead to injuries, both to the individual and the caregiver. Be sure that all caregivers are trained in appropriate transfer methods. 8. Wheelchairs should always be in a locked position before transferring.9. Proper body mechanics (bent knees and straight back, legs widely placed) should be used when assisting participants. 10. A belt around the waist can improve safety and function by providing something to hold on to during a transfer.PRIMARY HEALTH CARE NEEDS Issues that relate to good general health and wellness are often neglected in persons with MS. Symptoms that stem from a non-MS cause are often considered as just anothersymptom related to the disease. Health concerns of younger participants, such asmenopause, may not be adequately addressed. Furthermore, some illnesses, most notablyinfections and other causes of fever, may affect individuals with MS in a unique way. Help participants identify accessible health care providers in the area and encourage regular medical check-ups. People with MS should adhere to the health-screening schedule recommended for all adults: Cholesterol once under age 50 and every 5 years over age 50Fecal blood annually over age 50Sigmoidoscopy every 5-10 years over age 50Clinical breast examination annually over age 40Mammography every 1-2 years over age 50Vision exam annually over age 65Hearing exam every 5 years over age 50Direct rectal exam (DRE) for prostate and colorectal cancers annually over age 40; PSA blood test annually for men over 50 PAP smear/gynecological exam annually (based on history and risk)Bone density testing (baseline by age 60-65, but younger in high risk individuals, such as those with MS) Health screenings, such as mammography, are very important, particularly for this younger population, and may not be routinely provided. Difculty positioning someonewith impaired posture for a mammogram may lead to inattention to this and otherimpor tant preventive health measures. Neither disability, nor the need for escort service and/or specialized transportation, should defer these screening procedures. Familymembers should be supported in helping their family member with MS access regularhealth care. In the general care of people with MS, providers should consider: Menstrual Cycle: Sometimes symptoms such as fatigue, numbness, and neuropathic pain may increase in people with MS just before menses and improve as the flowbegins. Menopause: In women with MS, as with other women, menopause can cause uncomfortable symptoms. These have been controlled for some people with hormone replacement therapy. Recent studies have offered a new perspective on 2627 hormone replacement therapy and the risks and benets of such therapy should be discussed carefully with the participant. Heat and Humidity: People with MS can be extremely sensitive to heat and cold. Traditionally, heat sensitivity has been considered the most common problem forindividuals with MS, but excessive cold can be equally troubling. Those who areheat sensitive may notice an increase in their MS problems, including fatigue, visualdisturbances, balance, and strength when body temperature rises. Cooling theperson down will likely restore them to their previous level of functioning, but itmay take some time. People with MS who are sensitive to the cold generally findthat their spasticity worsens when cold. Some individuals report other weather-related problems. TIPS: Heat and Humidity 1. Keep the environmental controls at an even temperature. 2. Put fans in the exercise areas.3. In the summer, encourage the use of cold packs or cloths on the neck, back, or head. 4. In the summer, encourage iced drinks or \"slurpees\".5. If you are having outdoor activities, limit the time outside, make sure shaded areas are available, and make sure the transportation is comfortablebefore having the individuals enter the vehicle. 6. Encourage the participants to work with their physician for appropriate changes in antispasmodics in the winter. Osteoporosis: All individuals with multiple sclerosis should be considered at risk for osteoporosis. Long term use of steroids and physical inactivity promote osteoporosisin both men and women with multiple sclerosis. Treatment and prevention withcalcium rich foods and dietary supplements (including vitamin D) as well as withosteoporosis medication is likely to be indicated. Particular care for transfers andprevention of falls is very important as fractures may occur easily and heal slowly inthis population. Yearly bone density testing and monitoring by physician is recom-mended. Exercise: Some people with MS note worsening of symptoms, weakness, or even blurring of vision with exercise. Cooling strategies (wearing a cooling vest or scarf,drinking cold beverage) can alleviate these changes, caused by the temporary elevation in core body temperature. Avoid being over-zealous in organized exerciseprograms. Activities such as Tai chi and Aquatherapy (in cool water) are particularlypopular with people with MS. Infections: While infections, such as urinary tract infections or flu, can precipitate acute attacks of MS, they may also produce fevers that temporarily worsen existingsymptoms. This type of pseudo-exacerbation will subside as the fever subsides. Symptoms that occur in the presence of a fever should becarefully assessed to determinewhether they are indicative of atrue attack that should betreated. Hypothyroidism: This condition can cause slowing down, fatigue,weight gain, slowed thinking,and even neurologic symptoms that may be confused with MS symptoms. Referralto the family doctor or neurologist of the person with MS should be made if there isan unexplained worsening of symptoms. Arthritis and Fibromyalgia: The aches and pains of arthritis and fibromyalgia are often ascribed to MS, since about half of people with MS have nonspecific pain.Assessment of pain should consider fibromyalgia and arthritis. Insomnia: Sleep disturbances are common in the MS population and can exacerbate daytime fatigue. They may be related to nighttime muscle spasms, bladder disorders,pain, depression, or other factors. These disturbances in sleep must be assessedto determine specific contributing factors so that treatment may be designedappropriately. Obesity: Inactivity secondary to disability and depression may contribute to obesity. Treating this common health condition is challenging, as many peoplewith MS have limitations to participating in vigorous exercise. However, exerciseas tolerated, diet, and medication should be considered, since obesity may contribute to a number of other serious health disorders. Given the deleteriouseffects of obesity on independence for many disabled individuals, day treatmentstaff should monitor weight and provide a diet that meets nutritional needs andprevents serious weight gain. Immunizations: Recent studies indicate that influenza (flu) vaccination does not cause MS attacks or accelerate progression of the disease. Having MS should notpreclude an individual from having a flu shot. The flu can be very serious in aperson with MS who has compromised respiratory status, and the high feveraccompanying flu may exacerbate MS symptoms. The decision should be made onan individual basis, in consultation with a physician, taking into consideration allhealth risks of both receiving and avoiding a flu vaccination. Pneumonia: Pneumonia in sedentary persons is not uncommon. Multiple sclerosis, because it can cause swallowing problems and weakness of respiratory muscles,predisposes individuals to pneumonia. When you notice individuals choking orhaving swallowing difculties a referral for a swallowing evaluation is appropriate,and recommendations from that evaluation should be followed to prevent aspiration that can contribute to pneumonia. 28 Igot very depressed and lost a lot of weight. The nurse at the dayprogram noticed the weight loss and referred me to a counselor. I'venow gained my weight back.\"\"Psychosocial Issues MS makes severe emotional demands on those living with the disease. Individuals and families are confronted with many functional and physical losses, major changesin family and social roles, and loss of control over many life decisions. Particularissues such as child rearing, marital and dating relationships, sexuality, physicalattractiveness, and depression about the future (career, independence, etc.) are critical areas of concern for this younger population. Access to social work or psychiatric support is an important feature of any long-term care program thatserves people with MS. FAMILY AND CAREGIVER ISSUES Adult day services can bring great relief to family caregivers. These services mayenable family members to continue working and provide the respite necessary foremotional health. Often adult day services provide the support needed to enable theindividual to remain in their own home and may delay out-of-home placement. Most people with MS who require adult day services do not meet the traditional prole of those who generally use these services, particularly with regard to age.Their on-going care at home is most likely provided by family members. These familycaregivers are also not typical. Caregivers of people with MS tend to be workingspouses who may also have child care responsibilities. These MS caregivers areoften too young to be eligible for many support services and may be stretchedbeyond their emotional and physical resources by the demands of caregiving. Some MS caregivers are elderly parents of adults with MS. The issues that these care- givers face include their inability to manage the physical demands of caregiving asthey age or become disabled themselves and the uncertainty of who will take overthese responsibilities when they can no longer manage them or when they die. Somecaregivers are children. While it may be appropriate for adult children to provideSECTION4care, people with MS may also be cared for by their teenagers or younger children. Whenever possible, personal care by children must be avoided. Adult day programs canprovide the family with the services required to avoid placing young children in inappro-priate caregiving situations. Caregiver needs that have exceeded the resources of the family are often the prompt that leads to enrollment in adult day care. Attention to the needs of caregivers is a veryimportant component of the adult day program. If the day care team is sensitive to familyissues, the impact of stresses at home on the participant's experience can be minimized.In developing a program, planners should consider what, if any, family services andcaregiver support could be provided within the context of the adult day program. PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF THE ADULT DAY PROGRAM The emotional benets of participatingin an adult day program are many. Itprovides an opportunity to meet others,make friends, develop new interests,have a life outside of the home and'something to talk about at the end ofthe day'. Many participants nd theyhave something to contribute to othermembers of the program\u2014sharing aparticular skill or interest, supporting or advising a peer, sharing their wisdom or experiencein living with MS. Doing so may offer a boost to the self esteem of a participant who hasbeen focused on loss and the things he/she can no longer contribute. Also, activities canprovide opportunities for relaxation and may have a calming affect for those with anxiety. COPING WITH CHANGE While each person's emotional reactions to a chronic, unpredictable disease like MS will differ, there are some fairly common emotions that the program staff would expect toencounter. These reactions will ebb and flow as the disease changes and the demandsit places on the individual increase and abate. Furthermore, many individuals willexperience several of these emotions simultaneously. Grief is an ongoing, if intermittent, response over the course of the disease. From the time of diagnosis, and continuing throughout the course of the illness, the person willexperience periods of grief\u2014a normal reaction to any kind of loss. Every change orsymptom can represent a loss of self and personal identity, of autonomy and personalcontrol, of a particular skill or ability\u2014things that most adults cherish. Every loss of 30 Ilike to be around other peo- ple. Speak about problems.Not the only one. Gives you a different look at your situation.\"\"31 ability or control requires a change in the person's self-image; every time the self-image undergoes a change, the person may grieve. Anxiety is a common response to the unpredictability of MS. From one day to the next, as well as one year to the next, people don't know how they are going to feel, what parts oftheir bodies are going to be affected, and what the future is going to hold for them. Thiskind of unpredictability makes people feel out of control of their bodies and their lives,and when people feel out of control, they get anxious. Family members share a similaranxiety over the unpredictable impact MS may have on their lives. Resentment is another common response to unpredictability and loss of control\u2014for both people with MS and their family members. One of the biggest challenges peopleface is nding a satisfactory outlet for this resentment. They need to learn how to expresstheir anger in a constructive way, focusing it on the disease rather than each other or thedoctor. Even when people with MS feel legitimate anger toward their loved ones for onereason or another, they may be afraid to express it and risk driving their partner/caregiveraway. They tend to feel stuck with an anger that has no outlet. People may also experience guilt as they deal with MS. They feel guilty about their inability to fulll their roles and obligations in different areas of their lives. They worrythat they are letting everybody down, no longer pulling their own weight. There is alsoguilt over uncomfortable feelings\u2014particularly the anger toward care partners, children,and God. TIPS: Coping With Change Staff members can help new participants cope with change by: 1. Encouraging expression of feelings in group support settings as well as in one-one settings. 2. Encouraging friendships with veteran participants.3. Creating an atmosphere that is welcoming to the participant's family and friends.4. Encouraging the participant to continue to pursue former interests.5. Participating in training to understand the psychosocial, emotional and family issues related to MS and how they can affect daily routine and relationships. 6. Understanding depression in MS and how to be sensitive and appropriately responsive. 7. Recognizing the challenge for new participants who must accomplish daily routine tasks in a new environment. 8. Encouraging participants to take a role in the governance and implementation of the program.DEPRESSION At least 50% of people with MS will experience a major depressive episodeat some point over their diseasecourse. Because of feelings of loss, aswell as neurologic changes caused bythe disease itself, depression is very common among persons with MS. Fatigue\u2014which can be an outgrowth of depression or occur as a primary symptom\u2014frequentlycompounds depression in persons with MS. Symptoms of depression include: persistent sadness or unhappiness, lethargy, loss of inter- est in previously enjoyable activities, irritability, sudden change in appetite, disruption ofnormal sleep pattern, physical discomfort, difculty thinking or concentrating, thoughtsof suicide or death. In NMSS-supported studies on suicide and MS, researchers concluded that the level of disability is not the key predictor of suicide risk. Rather, suicide risk was more related to a lack of connectedness withother people, and a negative self-perception of one's self, body, and future. Warning signs of suicide risk include: talking about suicide; statements about hopelessness, helplessness, or worthlessness; preoccupation with death; being suddenly happier orcalmer; loss of interest in things one cares about; visiting or calling people one caresabout; making arrangements; setting one's affairs in order; and giving things away. AFFECTIVE DISORDERS Affective release (also known as \"pseudobulbar affect\") refers to unpredictable episodes of laughing or crying, often having nothing to do with the person's underlying mood. It ismost likely related to lesions in the limbic system or related structures. Medications areavailable to treat this disorder. Emotional crescendo describes an experience in which a person becomes very emotional, crying very easily in response to any stimulus that triggers intense emotion or tension.Once the response is stimulated, it feels uncontrollable until it reaches a crescendo andresolves on its own. It differs from affective release in that the person's mood andexpression are more consistent with one another. While not as upsetting or embarrass-ing as affective release, emotional crescendo interferes signicantly with any efforts toresolve a conflict or have any kind of disagreement. Some success has been achievedwith a behavioral intervention involving focused attention on the build-up of tension,deep-breathing, and relaxation to dampen or halt the response. Euphoria , dened as a sustained mood state involving exaggerated and inappropriate happiness and optimism in the context of a very bleak situation, is generally associatedwith extensive cerebral demyelination and dementia. Once considered the hallmark of 32 Being with other people and seeing other conditions givesme strength.\"\"MS, it is actually seen in less than 10 percent of individuals. There is no known treatment for this phenomenon; supportive interventions for the family are essential. FINDING NEW MEANING FOR CONCEPTS OF SELF, INDEPENDENCE, AND CONTROL A person who becomes increasingly dependent upon assistive devices, personal aides, and other forms of out-side assistance needs to take pride andsatisfaction in being able to identify,obtain and manage these resources. In other words, he or she needs to ndnew ways to think about exerting inde-pendence and control in everyday life. Finding the \"MS-Free Zone\": Severely disabled individuals, who feel that MS has altered every aspect of their lives, need to be encouraged to look for their personal, MS-free zonewhere MS has not reached. For one it might be a sense of humor or love of music, foranother a particular skill or talent, or a religious faith. Whatever it is, the MS-free zoneprovides an emotional respite from the day-to-day challenges and losses. Spiritual Life: Living with losses and disability of MS often precipitates serious existential questions about the meaning of the illness, fate, the existence of God, God's role in lifeevents, life's unpredictability and injustices, values, priorities and more. Programs thatsupport the spiritual life of participants are important in helping them grapple withthese issues. FACTORS INFLUENCING ATTENDANCE The ability of an individual to attend scheduled day program sessions may be influencedby a number of factors including: depression, availability of a caregiver to assist withADLs, accessibility of the home (ability of the individual to safely enter/exit the homewith or without assistance), transportation, availability of reliable child care (if participanthas young children at home), limited finances, and cognitive problems which lead to forgetting scheduled days or transportation times. Exacerbations of MS also may prevent regular attendance or may lead to extended absences. It is vital to have staff inquire as to the barriers to attendance and to provide programming that addressesparticipants' need to feel useful and involved in community (vs. passive recipient ofcare). Failure to do so can also lead to poor attendance. In addition to the emotional responses that are specific to MS, the individual with MS who attends an adult day program brings issues and related emotions from the homewith them to the program. These may include parenting issues, financial worries, and 33 Adult day gets me out of the house, away from thefour walls. I don't have to be by myself.\"\"spouse/partner concerns. In some cases, participants may show signs ofabuse or neglect and it is important forstaff to be trained to recognize the riskfactors and warning signs and knowwhat action to take when suspicionsof either arise. RISK OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT Factors associated with high risk of abuse but not precise predictors include: A history of family violence Abuse of alcohol or other disinhibiting drugs/substancesSocial isolation (from friends, family, community)Attitudes of devaluation and dehumanizationSevere disabilityChronic progressive disease that appears to exceed the caregiver's ability to manageCaregivers who show signs of \"burn-out,\" including exaggerating caregiving involvement and MS disability Individuals with MS whose families are nancially dependent on themFamily members or caregivers who are under increased stress or have impaired ability to provide care because of their own health problems or other factors People with MS who have poorly managed mobility needs, bowel or bladder incon- tinence, problematic cognitive symptoms and/or personality changes, or diseaseworsening Physical dependency, making a person more vulnerable to mistreatment by others. Paid caregivers, drivers, homemakers, and others who provide assistance to peoplewith MS may behave inappropriately and take advantage of this dependence. Physical indicators of abuse and neglect include: Bruises and welts that cannot be explained by falls or bumps related to mobilityproblems; bruises in the shape of a hand or familiar object; bilateral bruising Burns that cannot be explained adequately or that are in the shape of cigarette buttsAbrasions, e.g., marks from restraints on arms or legsGenital pain, irritation, itching that may be indicative of sexual abuse 34 Ilive with my parents.

Like seniors, younger participants with MS enjoy activities that promote cognitive, physical, social, andemotional well-being, and positive involvement in daily life. They want to engage inactivities that reflect their needs, interests, functional levels, and abilities. Activitiesthat emphasize one's abilities and can be enjoyed in spite of physical impairments aremost therapeutic. Programs that specialize in serving people with multiple sclerosis have found that offering activities that promote the various components of 'wellness' can help participants thinkpositively about their health and well-being in spite of having a chronic illness. By 'well- ness' in this context they refer to \"an intentional choice of a lifestyle characterizedby personal responsibility, balance and maximum enhancement of physical, mentaland spiritual health\u2014seeking a balance in lifestyle designed to improve quality of life.\"* All participants want to engage in age-appropriate activities. While many interests overlap, a younger participant may want to see a different movie, learn about differenttopics, or listen to different music than an elderly participant. Program offerings foryounger participants might include discussion sessions, support groups, and otherintellectually stimulating pastimes. Accounting for varied interests is key for theprovision of creative and enjoyable activities. (Information on leisure activity/interestassessment tools is included in the appendices, as well as selected activity resources.) Educational, artistic, and cultural pursuits are essential for all participants' personal growth and well being. All participants, regardless of age, benefit from access toreading materials and music. Connectivity to the community and the world outside the program is of particularly high value to younger participants, fostered both bybringing outside resources in and bringing participants to the outside sources. Inter-generational activities and volunteer opportunities can be particularly enriching.SECTION5Day to day changes in MS symptoms, such as fatigue and cognitive impairments, may affect the participant's degree of general function and participation in activities. Always encourage involvementin decision making to the best of his/her ability. It is recommended that a program of therapeutic activities: Include a variety of individualized activities balanced with small and large group activities Provide a balance of active and spectator participationProvide intergenerational experiencesInvolve interaction with the communityInvolve outdoor activities as appropriateInvolve cultural and ethnically diverse celebrationsSupport self-care and other ADL activitiesEnhance knowledge and skillsSupport and encourage interpersonal relationshipsEnhance self esteem, self condence and moodOffer a positive outlet for energy, emotions and self-expressionTap into creative capacitiesBe balanced with rest and relaxationBe fun and enjoyableSupport physical and emotional health and wellnessSupport self-determination and provide opportunities for participant governance Integrating persons with MS into an elderly-focused day program may have its challenges. There will probably need to be more focus on physical assistance, personal accommodations,and supervision. There may be cultural attitudes about disease and disability that need tobe addressed. Space limitations may havean impact. However, focusing on inclu-sion and integration emphasizes similari-ties over differences and has been foundto enrich the experience for all involved. A FOCUS ON WELLNESS Activities that support personal empower-ment and growth, i.e., 'wellness' activities,can be categorized in terms of physicalhealth, social health, emotional health, intellectual health and spiritual health. Thediagram on the next page describes these aspects of overall health and well-being. 38 We have a young adult group at the center.We decide movies, have discussions, plan parties,and go shopping.\"\"Here are some examples of activities in each one of these domains: Physical Health: Group exercise, Yoga, education and training in self-care, medication management, nutrition education, symptom management, personal health advocacy Social Health: Field trips, dining out, shopping, cooking activities, discussions on areas such as communication and family relationships Emotional Health: Peer counseling, group therapy, pet therapy or assistance with an in-house pet, volunteer work, stress management, sharing personal knowledge andexpertise (\"giving back\") Intellectual Health: Current events discussions, lecture series, book discussions, lms, computer activities, writing and journal programs, resident council participation,continuing adult education Spiritual Health: Meditation, relaxation, expressive ther- apies, guided imaging, religious activities, discussions 39Social Having positive interactions with others. Communicating feelings, practicing empathy and effective listening, balancing work, family, and leisurePhysical Integrating physical activity, nutrition, sleep preventive health behaviors into lifestyle practices Emotional Maintaining good mental health, positive attitude, high self-esteem, strong self-image and able to manage stress Spiritual The quest for meaning, value and purpose within one's own personal beliefs resulting in hope, joy courage and gratitude.Intellectual Responding to challenges and opportunities to grow, developing strategies, maintaining and enhancing the ability to engage in clear thinking and recall, and to think independently, creatively and criticallyMS Health & Wellness Program ModelCOMMUNITY ACTIVITIES AND ACCESSIBILITY People with MS are usually younger and often have stronger ties to thecommunity than the frail elderly.They appreciate attending commu-nity events, shopping at a mall, orengaging in volunteer opportunitiesin schools, homeless shelters, andother settings. It is important to remember that trip planning requires careful consideration of accessibility and appropriateness of destination (stairs, bathroom accommodations, etc.). Even though a site may tell you they are 'accessible' on the phone, the reality may be a different storyentirely. Check out destinations in advance if possible. Consider carefully the needs ofthe individuals who will attend. What equipment, medications, assistive devices mustyou bring along? What are the safety considerations? Planning for all eventualities willassure a safe and enjoyable trip. AFFIRMING ACTIVITIES Opportunities to 'give' to others, e.g., teach a skill, help plan an activity, give a talk about atopic of expertise, lead a current events discussion or book group, all support an individual'sself-condence and esteem and help to build community within the program. Thereforeadult day staff is encouraged to look for ways in which the person with MS can feel usefuland contribute to the program. COMPUTERS Computers are an important part of life for younger participants with MS. Therefore com-puter-based activities may be of great interest to this population. Minimal adaptations tocomputers (e.g., enlarged keyboard) may make these activities accessible to a larger numberof participants. Contact local computer training schools for possible donations of expertise,time, hardware, software, computer modications, etc. If a day program has the interestand resources, more elaborate adaptations can be assessed and prescribed by an occupationaltherapist or assistive technology specialist. Determining activities that are most appropriate for each participant involvesassessment of leisure interests and well-ness goals. By framing participation inactivities as strategies to achieve wellness in various domains of life, in spite of achronic illness, the adult day program canoffer a positive, hopeful and therapeuticenvironment for participants. 40 Ilove to get out in the commu- nity. Travel, even just to the adultday center, is an adventure.\" Ilike being around youngerpeople, whether they have MSor not.\"\" \"Rehabilitation Rehabilitation services are consistently cited as a high priority for people with MS. These therapies represent an opportunity to maximize overall health, comfort, andindependence. Some adult day programs may have rehabilitation professionals on staff, others contract with therapists from community agencies and still others may refer clientswhen there is a distinct need. Whatever your stafng may be, the activities at yourprogram can support many of the rehabilitation needs of your participants.Programs that do not have on-site rehabilitation services may help their participantsaccess these services by bringing in therapists for monthly rounds and rehabilitationclinics, by working with the local National MS Society chapter to contract with arehabilitation consultant, and by working with local hospitals, home health agenciesand OT/PT practices in the community. REHABILITATION REFERRAL Refer participants to physiatrists, neurologists, occupational therapists (OTs),physical therapists (PTs), speech and language pathologists (SLPs), neuro-psychologists, psychiatrists, and other appropriate professionals (e.g., orthopedists,orthotists, assistive technology experts) to provide support in complex situations.These health professionals can offer a customized approach to assessing mobility,positioning, feeding, and equipment needs as well as therapeutic exercise andtraining. You may want to refer the participant to these rehabilitation professionals ifyou notice changes in mobility, slurred speech or an increase in difficulty commu-nicat ing, swallowing difculty, an increase in stiffness or spasticity, increased tremors, fatigue interfering with functioning, etc. Ideally, identify therapists in your communitywho have experience with MS.SECTION6Physical therapy (PT) can help strengthen weakened or uncoordi-nated muscles, and improve balance.PT might include range-of-motionexercises, stretching, strengthening,assistance with walking, and the bestways to be tted for and to use canes,walkers, wheelchairs, or other assistivedevices. PT can also include exercisesto increase overall function and stamina. Occupational therapy (OT) is geared toward maintaining or improving independence in both basic and instrumental activities of daily living. OT includes teaching compensatorytechniques for both physical and cognitive (thinking) problems, energy conservationtechniques, strengthening methods, building tolerance for activity, and improving ability to perform a full range of everydayactivities (e.g., dressing, transfers,home management activities, driving).Occupational therapists provide recommendations and training foractivity and environmental modifi-cations, and assistive devices to facilitate function Speech therapy (ST) may improve communication for those who may have difculty speaking or swallowing due to weakness or poor coordination. Techniques used byspeech/language therapists (also called speech/language pathologists (SLP) might includeexercise, voice training, or the use of special devices. Cognitive rehabilitation offers strategies to improve or compensate for problems with memory, attention, information processing, and reasoning. Cognitive rehabilitationsessions may be with a neuropsychologist, speech/language pathologist, or occupationaltherapist. GROUP EXERCISE Group exercise can provide the opportunity for socialization and peer support as well astherapy (e.g., stretching, range of motion) and skills training (e.g., transfer training, ADLtraining). It is advised that you have a therapist review your group exercise programs tobe sure you are considering the special needs of participants. Other group movement pro-grams can augment more tradi tional exercise programs. For example, T'ai Chi, Yoga and other complementary therapies may enhance the benefit of gr oup exercise. 42 Ilove to do things that can make me feel stronger, such as exer cise classes and physical therapy.\" Occupational therapy is veryimportant to me. Helpswith upper body strength.\"\"\"WHEELED MOBILITY Their younger age and developmental stage in life generates a great need and desire for mobility to socialize, gain access to the community, and participate actively in the adultday program and in the community. The nature and extent of MS disability has an impacton the type of wheelchairs needed, as well as the type and placement of wheelchaircontr ols, transfer aids (e.g., lifts), beds and other mobility equipment. Because of severe physical disability (weakness, paralysis, tremors, spasticity, fatigue, sensory decits, incoordination, visual decits, etc.), people with MS frequently requirepower wheelchairs with tilt and recline capabilities, wide dimensions, customized posi-tioning, and customized drive controls. They may require complex drive systems (e.g.,breath-controlled, head-controlled, tongue switches, joy sticks) due to weakness, tremors,spasticity, or paralysis generated by their MS. Proper positioning can improve comfort,independence, and mobility as well as prevent secondary complications such as skinbreakdown, postural deformities/contractures, and compromised breathing. Ensuring that an individual obtains the right type of wheeled mobility (manual or power), with the features that are most appropriate for his/her physical, cognitive andenvironmental situation is critical and complex. Referral to a specialized seating andmobility clinic will provide the greatest likelihood of ensuring that a person with MSobtains the best and most appropriate wheeled mobility device. Given the restrictionsthat insurance companies often place on the wheeled mobility, the importance of thesecomprehensive assessments cannot be overstated. It is important that staff understand the proper use of the wheelchairs, how tocharge power chairs, and the proper use ofdevices such as splints. Wheelchairs areoften costly and complex machines thatrequire on-going care to remain reliable.Staff should be instructed to clear crumbs and food stains, clean up after episodesof incontinence, and clean up after out-door use (clearing mud, leaves). Staff need to understand proper positioning, e.g., thewearing schedule of splints, checking for skin breakdown or irritation, and proper useof other positioning. They also need to monitor the participants' ability to safelymobilize their wheelchairs or scooters and note when a referral for new equipmentmay be appropriate. Individual rehabilitation plans should be created after initial assessment of function and re-visited frequently as MS changes and the needs and priorities of the individual change. A listing of rehabilitation assessment tools for MS is included in the appendices of this document. 43 Ilike being around people with MS, regardless of theirage.\"\"Staffing and Physical Plant Issues STAFFING ISSUES Careful consideration must be given to a variety of staffing-related issues when providing adult day services for persons with MS. Most center staff are skilled inaddressing the needs of older adults and/or younger adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities. There are, however, a number of unique concerns thatemerge when serving a younger, mentally alert adult population with MS. Thisincludes staff-to-participant ratio, orientation and ongoing training, the need forsupervision and support, along with an interdisciplinary approach. Staff Ratios Given the unpredictability of MS, centers need to closely monitor both the overallparticipant-to-staff ratio as well as the ratio of direct care staff (those who assist withtransfers and personal care along with some basic nursing needs) relative to otherprogram staff. Centers may wish to consider implementation of a \"level of care\"based model to determine the appropriate number and type of staff available on anygiven day. In this model, standardized assessment tools can be utilized to rate each individual enrolled according to the center's stafng needs. For example, higher scores are givenfor those individuals who require assistance with transfers or for those who areincontinent of bowel and/or bladder. Center directors are then better able to adjuststaff levels based on projected participant needs. Due to the changing nature of MS,persons with MS may require more frequent reassessments of their level of careneeds.SECTION7Volunteers Some programs augment staff with volunteers and students. This provides a learning opportunity as well as provides extra hands to implement the program. Sources of volunteers include: Aging advocacy groups, Area Agencies on Aging, National Council on Aging, American Society on Aging, Retired Senior Volunteer Programs (RSVP) Schools: elementary and middle schools, high schools, universities, technical schoolsBusinesses (a source of volunteers for special events)Volunteer organizations, parishes, synagoguesCivic organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis, Rotary, and Lions Clubs Garden clubs Staff Orientation/Training It is unlikely that staff in the adult day setting will have extensive prior experience or knowledge of MS. Therefore it is essential that a thorough orientation, along withcomprehensive ongoing training, be provided so that all staff can collectively deliver ahigh standard of care to meet participant needs and be responsive and sensitive to theparticular issues and challenges that are part of living with MS. The National MultipleSclerosis Society is an excellent resource to you as you plan staff training. They can oftenprovide speakers, materials, and ideas for providing effective training. Call 1-800-FIGHT-MSto be connected with your local NMSS chapter. As previously noted in Section 4, MS makes severe emotional demands on those living with the disease. Individuals are confronted with many functional and physical losses,major changes in their family and social roles, and loss of control over many life decisions.Training that encourages staff to create opportunities for persons served to participate inthe governance of the program and the selection of activities will help foster self-determi-nation. The participant should be allowed as much choice and independence as possiblewithout compromising safety. It is recommended that the following topics, as a minimum, be included as part of the education and training protocols for staff: MS: The Disease 1. The fundamentals of MS, including the disease process, manifestations, and management of the disease and its symptoms. The National MS Society is anexcellent resource for training materials and trainers. 462. The unpredictable nature and often progressive course ofMS; staff may see variabilityfrom day to day as well asincreased disability occurover time and will need to beprepared to be flexible aboutchanging needs. 3. The difculties managing symptoms such as fatigue, tremors. Psychosocial Issues 1. Understanding the psychosocial, emotional and family issues related to MS and how they can affect daily routines and relationships. 2. The role of depression in MS and how to be sensitive and appropriately responsive. 3. Recognition of the challenge for new program participants who must accomplish tasks in a new environment. 4. Establishing professional boundaries between staff (including drivers), volunteers, and a participant who may be looking for a romantic or sexualrelationship. Mobility 1. Proper use and care of assistive devices: walkers, canes, wheelchairs (manual and power). 2. Specic safety risks that can occur with people with MS.3. Proper techniques for assistance with transfers including sit to stand, stand to sit, and on/off the toilet. 4. Recognition that persons with MS are often heavier and less frail than geriatric participants. ADL Management 1. Ability to properly assist a participant to perform activities of daily living. 2. Attention to sensory deficits that may make the participant at risk for burns, scrapes, and pressure sores; knowledge of performing skin checks. 3. Offering as much choice and independence as possible regarding ADLs and therapeutic activities. 4. Focusing on age-related ADLs that are not frequently seen in elderly participants. (These may include shaving and leg waxing, or applying daily make-up; youngerwomen may still be menstruating and will require assistance with managementof their periods.) 47 The social workers are very helpful. You can talk to themabout your problems. They help you with things like housing,Medicaid, family problems . . . .\"\"Monitoring of Health Status 1. Medical management unique to MS (cognitive problems, spasticity and immobility, skin integrity, pain, fatigue, heat intolerance, and bowel and bladder management). 2. Identification of safety risks and needs that must be communicated to appro- priate administrative staff promptly. Cognitive Issues 1. Differentiation of the cognitive issues of MS with the dementia of the elderly. 2. Addressing potential behavioral and cognitive problems that may be a consequence of the progression of MS (e.g., the feeling of loss of control that often accompaniessevere MS, resulting in the participant compensating for such loss by trying tocontrol people around him/her or by angry outbursts). Staff Supervision and Support Staff burnout may become a significant issue as serving persons with MS can be bothphysically and emotionally demanding. Centers may wish to explore interventions suchas regular one-on-one supervision, staff support groups, periodic 'processing' meetingsand retreats, along with opportunities for flex time, job sharing, and rotation of duties.This, in combination with the staff education and training outlined above, can help toaddress the issue of staff burnout. It is important for all staff to be reminded of their needto take care of themselves in order for them to continue to be effective in their ability toprovide support and care for others. Interdisciplinary Approach Finally, due to the complex and changeable nature of MS, it is recommended that centersutilize a multidisciplinary approach that includes professions such as nursing, socialwork, rehabilitative therapies (occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy),therapeutic recreation, dietary nutritional counseling, and pastoral care. In addition,there is an increasing body of knowledge that highlights the potential value of a numberof alternative therapies and the use of the expressive/creative arts (massage therapy, yoga,music therapy, etc.). PHYSICAL PLANT ISSUES Barrier-free, safe facilities are an important requirement for all program participants.Meeting ADA guidelines are a minimum standard. Also, licensure requirements, firesafety codes, and other state regulations will dictate physical space specifications. The 48National Adult Day Services Association and the National Council on Aging Institute on Adult Day Care have each developed facility standards that should be met or exceeded. Below are some key physical plant issues for individuals with MS: Hand rails Non skid flooring or very low pile carpetingAdjustable heat and air conditioningSpecialized active or passive cooling equipment\u2014passive cooling equipment (gel based freezer packs; Steele brand type vests) can be used if freezer space can accommodate extra cooling gel packs; active cooling (cooled fluid flows through avest and hat) equipment can be larger and potentially noisy Wheelchair-accessible activity areas and several bathroomsWater temperatures in bathrooms at safe levelsBathrooms accommodated with items for emptying leg bagsAdequate space to maneuver a walker, wheelchair or scooterGrab bars, hand rails, accessible door pullsAdjustable activity and dining tables that adapt to different wheelchair heightsFabrics and materials that are easily cleaned and flame retardantSecure area to store medical records, medications, etc.Accessible outdoor areas with covered areas to provide protection from the sunParticipant access to telephones (large buttons, volume control, hands-free dialing), light switches, drinking fountains, door knobs (levers), etc. Covered, adequate, accessible drop-off and pick-up areas outside;Accessible private and quiet rest areasAccessible private areas for conferences with participants and/or their familiesAdequate storage spaceKitchen facilities that provide safe and sanitary handling and storage of foodCall lights in bathroom and rest areasRoll-in showers, if providedRehabilitation equipment appropriate for participants, e.g., standing frames, parallel bars, weights, etc. Laundry facilitiesElevators or one-level floor plan; oversized elevators that can accommodate several wheelchairs at a time (including electric wheelchairs) are an important feature 49For those programs that have the resources to consider a dedicated exercise/fitness area, these are items to consider: A large exercise area/room in order to accommodate the maximum amount of wheelchairs for group exercise instruction Floor mats for out-of-chair exercise, stretching, yoga, etc.A folding, wall mounted mat table for range of motion/strength training, etc. and for enabling safe transfer (for client and staff) from manual and power wheelchairsand scooters Small hand weights and fastening wrist/ankle weights for individuals with grip strength deciencies Power Trainer type arm and leg ergometers for aerobic conditioning and active/ passive upper body; cycle-type ergometers for range of motion for clients that areunable to hand/foot pedal (but can still receive benet from ROM/aerobic condi-tioning) The 'usual' rehab equipment for work on ADL's and other specic exercises (standing frames, therabands, grip balls, stability (Swiss balls), stretching aids (blocks and cords)as well as the aforementioned cooling equipment Commercial treadmills with bilateral arm rails. Some treadmills are equipped with balance aids or other devices Adjustable parallel bars that allow clients to gait train in a safe environmentAccess to an accessible therapy pool that is not warmer than 84 degrees TRANSPORTATION Transportation often presents a significant challenge to many programs. Reliable transportation is key to program participation. Some programs contract with localwheelchair transit companies, while others may have their own vans or busses. Stillothers may rely on county or town paratransit services. Paratransit services are transportation services for the disabled that the community must provide to be in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADAguarantees that people with disabilities have the same access to public services such astransportation as people without disabilities. Public bus services are expected to providebuses with wheelchair lifts and other special devices. Curb to curb service may also beavailable, although the person with a disability must be able to be out of their houseand on the sidewalk for pickup. Since many people with MS use large, power wheelchairs, you must be certain that tie- downs and other safety features can accommodate these wheelchairs. Furthermore, air-conditioning is absolutely required for participants with MS. Drivers may require 50specialized training if serving a younger population with significant disability and complicated wheeled equipment. Medicaid will often cover transportation expenses tomedical appointments and services. Because fatigue is a significant factor for many participants with MS, the time it takes to be transported to and from the program must be considered when determining ifthe program will be appropriate and practical to attend. Practical information about community-based accessible transportation services for people with disabilities can be found at: www.projectaction.org. 51Intake and Assessment Tools SAMPLE INTAKE/ASSESSMENT APPLICATION The following is the intake/assessment application for the Marilyn Hilton MS Achievement Center, a specialized day program for people with MS. This intaketool was developed by the Center to particularly highlight issues relative toMS and to help the provider have a clearer picture of the impact of MS on theapplicant. This model assessment tool can be adapted for your program's needs and provide you with practical information that will be helpful in the developmentof an individual care plan.APPENDIXA54For Internal Use Only Intake: ____/____/____Start: ____/____/____ MSAC (name/relationship) (phone #) Social Information ______________________________________________________________________ Do you use tobacco?

Ashworth and Modified Ashworth Spasticity Scale: These are ordinal scales of tone intensity. The Ashworth rates tone on a scale of 0-4, while the Modied Ashworthwas developed to further dene the lower end of the scale making it more discreteby adding the grade 1+. Reference: Lee K.C., Carson L., Kinnin E., and Patterson V.\"The Ashworth Scale: A reliable and reproducible method Neuro Rehab 1989; 3: 205-209. Barthel Index: An ordinal scale of function in ten areas encompassing mobility, ADL function, and continence. 14: 61-65. Berg Balance Scale: An ordinal scale of balance that is sensitive to change. Reference: Berg K., Wood-Dauphinee S., Williams J.I., and balancein the Health 1992; Jul-Aug Suppl 2: S7-11. Box and Block Test of Manual Dexterity (BBT): The Box and Block test was originally developed to evaluate the gross manual dexterity of adults with cerebral palsy. Thetest is made up of a box with a partition directly in the center creating two equal sides.A number of small wooden blocks are placed in one side of the box. The subject beingtested is required to use the dominant hand to grasp one block at a time and transportit over the partition and release it into the opposite side. The subject is given 60 secondsin which to complete the test, and the number of blocks transported to the other sideis counted. The test is then repeated with the non-dominant hand. It is suitable forpersons with limited cognition and manual dexterity. Reference: Mathiowetz V.,Volland G., Kashman N., and Weber K. \"Adult norms for the box and block test ofmanual dexterity.\" Am J Occup Ther Jun 1985; Occupational Performance Measure (COPM): An individualized, client- centered outcome measure focusing on three areas: self-care, productivity and leisure.Information about this measure can be found at www.caot.ca/copm/index.htm. The Dallas Pain Questionnaire: The Dallas Pain Questionnaire was developed to assess the amount of chronic spinal pain that affects daily and work activities,leisure activities, anxiety-depression, and social interest. There is a 16 item self-report that takes about 5 minutes to complete. Each item contains its own visualanalog scale. The scales are divided into ve to eight small segments in which thesubject is asked to mark an \"X\" which indicates where his or her pain impact fallson the continuum. The visual scales are anchored at the beginning with words suchas \"no pain\" and 0%, close to the middle \"some,\" and at the end with \"all the time\"and 100% impact of pain. Reference: Lawlis G., Cuencas R., Selby D., and McCoy C.E.\"The the Dallas pain questionnaire.\" Spine 1989; 14(5): 511-516. 64Functional Independence Measure (FIM): An ordinal scale of functioning in multiple areas including feeding, grooming, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, locomotion,comprehension, expression, social interaction and problem solving. Informationabout obtaining the FIM may be obtained from Uniform Data for MedicalRehabilitation UB Foundation Activities, Inc. at 716-817-7800 or www.udsmr.org. Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36): This is a 36-item patient self-report regarding the patient's perception of health and physical limitations. It is widely used in theUS. It is a component of the MSQLI. It is a registered trademark of the MedicalOutcomes Trust, Inc. (20 Park Plaza, Suite 1014, Boston, Massachusetts 02116).Additional references: http://www.mcw.edu/midas/health/SF-36.html andhttp://www.nationalmssociety.org/MUCS_health.asp. Kurtzke Functional System (FSS) Disability Status Scale (EDSS): The FSS and EDSS constitute one of the oldest and probably the most widely utilizedassessment instruments in MS. Based on a standard neurological examination, the 7functional systems (plus \"other\") are rated. These ratings are then used in conjunctionwith observations and information concerning gait and use of assistive devices torate the EDSS. Each of the FSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 to 5or 6. The EDSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurologicexamination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments. These may be foundat www.nationalmssociety.org/MUCS_FSS.asp. Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS): An expert panel convened by the Consortium of MS Centers in 2001 developed this neuropsychological assess-ment for patients with MS. This is a 90-minute battery of 7 neuropsychological testscovering processing speed/working memory, learning and memory, executivefunction, visual-spatial processing and word retrieval.

Range of Motion (ROM) and Manual Muscle Test (MMT) and Grasp Dynamometry: Range of motion at selected joints is assessed using a goniometer that measures theangle of the joint through its range. Manual Muscle testing uses a 6 point gradingsystem (0 = no contractile ability; 5 = strength through full ROM with maximumresistance) to assess strength where the patient has selective joint control. GraspDynamometer Testing uses a dynamometer to measure grasp and pinch strength inpounds. Tinetti Assessment Tool: Easily administered test that measures gait and balance. The test is scored on a three-point scale to assess the patient's ability to performspecic tasks. Scores are combined to form three measures\u2014an overall gait assess-ment score, an overall balance assessment score, and a gait and balance score. Thescores can be interpreted with regard to risk for falls. Reference: Lewis C. \"Balance,gait test proves simple yet useful.\" PT Bulletin 1993; 2/10: 9, 40. Also, Tinetti M.E. 119-126. Available in Spanish. Consists of severalsubscales: a. The Leisure Attitude Measurement measures the individual's attitude toward leisure on three different levels: (1) cognitive, (2) affective, and (3) behavioral.It can be used to nd areas that are preventing the individual from participatingactively in leisure. Limited normative data is available. b. The Leisure Interest Measurement helps identify the degree to which an individual is interested in each of the eight domains of leisure activities: (1) physical, (2) out-door, (3) mechanical, (4) artistic, (5) service, (6) social, (7) cultural, and (8) reading.It can be used to make sure that the individual has activities available which areinteresting to him/her and to point out areas where the therapist can provideeducation to make more domains of activity interesting. c. The Leisure Motivation Scale measures an individual's motivation for participating in leisure activities. The four primary motivators identified by research are (1)intellectual (the extent to which the individual is motivated to engage in leisureactivities that involve mental activities such as learning, exploring, discovering,creating, or imagining), (2) social (the extent to which an individual engages inleisure activities because of the need for friendship and interpersonal relation-ships and the need to be valued by others), (3) competence-mastery (the extentto which the individual engages in leisure activities in order to achieve, master,challenge, and compete), and (4) stimulus-avoidance (the extent that an indi-vidual needs to escape and get away from over-stimulating life situations). It isuseful for establishing the components of leisure activities that motivate theindividual to participate. d. The Leisure Satisfaction Measure indicates the degree to which an individual feels his/her general \"needs\" are being satised through leisure. The six subscalesof satisfaction are (1) psychological, (2) educational, (3) social, (4) relaxation,(5) physiological, and (6) aesthetic. It is useful for establishing that an individual'sneeds for leisure are being met by the existing programs and for nding areaswhere interventions may increase the individual's level of satisfaction with leisure. Leisure Assessment Inventory (Idyll Arbor, 39129 The Leisure AssessmentInventory was originally developed at Indiana University Center on Aging andAged, Bloomington, IN. The authors of the Leisure Assessment Inventory in 1997are Barbara A. Hawkins, Re.D.; The Leisure Assessment Inventory(LAI), measures the leisure behavior of adults through four components. a. The Leisure Activity Participation (LAP) index reflects the status of a person's leisure repertoire; thus, it presents a measure of activity involvement. The LAP 67evaluates the individual's current leisure functioning as determined by a set of pictures of activities that are typical of adult leisure. b. The Leisure Preference Index (L-PREF) provides a measure of leisure activities in which the individual would like to increase participation. This index indicates adegree of preference for some activities over other activities. c. The Leisure Interest Index (L-INT) measures the degree of unmet leisure involve- ment based on the selection of activities in which the individual has an interest,but in which he or she is not participating or is prevented from participating. d. The Leisure Constraints Index (L-CON) of the LAI assesses the degree of internal and external constraints that inhibit participation in leisure activities. 68Specialized MS Adult Day Programs Some adult day programs target individuals with multiple sclerosis and provide specialized programming to meet the needs of this population. Special considerationsinvolved in this kind of programming include the following: Transportation that can accommodate large, power operated wheelchairs.Space requirements, especially if participants use power wheelchairs; need for rehabilitation/exercise space, rest areas, showers, etc. Funding: For those with high intensity needs, public funding frequently does not cover actual costs. Stafng: Ratios may need to be higher than in a traditional program and there may be a need for more skilled staff, e.g., rehabilitation professionals. Rehabilitation: This component of the program is an important feature for participants and is not generally provided/funded on site in most adult dayprograms. Greater need for medical/nursing services, e.g., injectable MS medications.Competency issues for participants with MS: Cognitive impairments can inter fere with ability to participate fully and may often be subtle. Discharge criteria/increased acuity: When participant's needs exceed the ability of program to meet those needs Need for family support/respite: Support and education programs for family members to enhance the family's coping ability and avoid premature institu-tionalization. Following are brief descriptions of several specialized MS adult day programs.

Through its fifty-state network of chapters, the Society funds research, furtherseducation, advocates and provides a variety of empowering programs for the approxi-mately 400,000 Americans who have MS and their families. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society was founded in 1946. Sylvia Lawry, an extra- ordinary ordinary citizen whose brother suffered from the disease, placed a classiedadvertisement in The New York Times asking to hear from anyone who had recovered from MS. However, all of the letters she received came from others who also soughthelp and hope. Instead of being discouraged, Ms. Lawry mobilized a group of friendsand advisors, including some who had answered her ad. From this the NationalMultiple Sclerosis Society was formed to promote contacts among neurologistsaround the country who treated MS and to raise money to fund a search for answers. Today, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports more MS research, educates more health- care professionals and serves more people with MS than any national voluntary MS organizationin the world and meets the standards of ALL major agencies that rate not-for-profit groups. Across the country, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has 2,700 volunteer leaders and over a million more volunteers to carry out its mission to end the devastatingeffects of MS. The Society has over 600,000 general members, including 280,000 whohave MS. The Society's revenue is a combination of private donations, membershipdues and contributions, legacies and bequests, and fund-raising events.APPENDIXCPrograms Offered by the NMSS The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, through its chapters across the country, offers a wide range of programs and support services to people with MS. The Society also serves as an advocate for disabilityrights, improvements in health-care delivery, access to adequate, affordable health insurance andlong-term care, and federal funding of MS-related research. Many of these activities directly relate tothe need for long-term care services and information. Society efforts include Comprehensive information and referral programs: Each chapter maintains a database of resources and information pertaining to all aspects of multiple sclerosis andservices available in the community to meet the many needs generated by the disease. Education: Chapters offer programs on all aspects of MS for people with MS, family caregivers, and health care professionals.

Self-help groups and counseling programs: These are offered to help people with MS and families cope with the day-to-day challenges of living with the emotionaldemands of this chronic, unpredictable and often disabling disease. There are over2000 Society-afliated support groups across the United States. Caregiver supports: The Society recognizes that informal caregivers\u2014unpaid family, friends, and neighbors\u2014provide the majority of long-term care. Educational andsupport programs are offered by many chapters to help caregivers attend to theirown emotional needs as well as learn how to best care and advocate for their lovedone with MS. Family programs: The Society offers a variety of programs that bring families together for education, emotional support, and/or social activities. These programsare offered in recognition of the fact that MS affects each member of the familyuniquely and generates different needs for each. Advocacy: The Society is a preeminent voice for people with disabilities who require access to the range of affordable, quality, and age-appropriate long-term care services.Through our chapters and national government affairs ofce in Washington DC, ouradvocates have a say in such long-term care issues as the Medicare and Medicaidprograms, policies regulating nursing home care, assisted living, independent livingprograms, insurance and more on a federal, state, and local level. Research: The Society supports a wide range of clinical and scientific research in MS. In addition, research in health services and policy provides data to support ouradvocacy work and helps identify and document the unique long-term care andhealth management needs of our constituents. Specific long-term care programs: Many of our chapters collaborate with long-term care providers to develop and offer specialized long-term care programs for peoplewith MS in their communities. For example, several specialized MS adult day care 76programs and specialized MS nursing home programs are offered across the country. A number of MS care management programs, respite care programs and MS assisted living programs have also been developed. To reach your NMSS chapter call 1-800-FIGHT MS. Collaboration with Local NMSS Chapters The National Multiple Sclerosis Society encourages its chapters to collaborate with local agencies and organizations to have age-appropriate, affordable, and high quality long-termcare programs available to people with MS in their community. NMSS chapters are notencouraged to own or manage these programs, rather, they are encouraged to work withcommunity providers to advocate for and support the development of these programs.Potential benets to you of such collaboration include the following: Access to expertise and experience of the NMSS in serving people with MS.In-service training for your staff.Possibility of nancial support from the chapter for discrete services or program elements.
