While [a survey](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8b5f63562c031c16e36a93/t/5f25b5bfb3f4f86b1bf4d5f5/1596306894541/2020+Survivor+Corps+COVID-19+%27Long+Hauler%27+Symptoms+Survey+Report+%28revised+July+25.1%29.pdf) from Indiana University School of Medicine has circulated in news feeds since publishing last month\u2014showing 423 of 1,567-plus \"long haulers\" surveyed have noticed hair loss\u2014field experts are reporting that even individuals who haven't tested positive for the virus are experiencing similar effects. \"Although there is no doubt the symptom of hair loss occurred in many of those surveyed, this type of study does not provide enough data to directly associate hair loss specifically to COVID infection,\" says board-certified dermatologist Annie Chiu, founder of [the Derm Institute](https://www.thederminstitute.com) in Los Angeles and associate faculty member of dermatology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Hair loss and alopecia are among the most common conditions that she treats at her practice. \"Severe sudden stress can lead to hair loss,\" Chiu says of the condition known as telogen effluvium in the medical world. \"Normally, about 85% of hair is in an active growth phase called anagen, with 15% of hairs in the resting telogen phase, where it can be shed. Physiological or major psychological stressors on the body can essentially shock up to 70% of growing hairs into the telogen phase, where more hairs are shed in a short period of time. This type of hair loss is typically diffuse, not patchy, and patients will notice handfuls of hairs coming out with showering, brushing, or even on their pillowcases.\" She points out that half of the hair or more can be shed with telogen effluvium, and patients typically see a dramatic increase in shedding around two or three months after an acute event or illness. Lars Skj\u00f8th is seeing fallout even faster. He's founder and lead scientist behind [Harklinikken](https://www.harklinikken.com/collections), the Danish-born clinic that's gained a cult following among European royalty and Hollywood elites for its customized hair-restoration treatments. (Celebrity hairstylists like Chris McMillan, Harry Josh, and Tracey Cunningham are known to recommend Harklinikken to their clientele.) As soon as the pandemic hit in March, Harklinikken offered its 50,000 clients spanning six continents free consultations to understand what was happening in real time. \"That has given us the opportunity to see that certain people have been suffering from much more shedding despite that there has been no COVID attack on that individual,\" says Skj\u00f8th, who's spent the last 28 years intensively researching hair loss with a team that spans dermatologists to scientists. \"Because there's been so much stress for so many people for so long before they even get to the place where they may have COVID, I truly believe it has been exacerbating the symptoms of hair loss dramatically,\" he shares. \"More than 30% of the people we've been speaking with have had severe shedding for months, 400 and 500 hairs a day, meaning in a month they're losing 12,000 to 15,000 hairs of maybe 100,000 total. If you go on like that for two or three months, you can lose half your hair.\" Chiu empathizes with the psychological impact this kind of shedding has on her patients but notes that telogen effluvium cases are usually self-resolving\u2014with time. \"Our bodies eventually reset the ratio of growing to resting hairs back towards normal, but this process can take months,\" she says. This phenomenon appears to be different from hair miniaturization, the slow and steady process of shrinking hair follicles that produce weaker strands no longer able to reach their maximum growth potential. Hair miniaturization unfolds throughout a lifetime in what Skj\u00f8th describes as \"the salami method,\" where small \"slices\" of hair disappear so slowly and consistently that you don't immediately realize anything is missing. Interestingly, this COVID-related news comes on the heels of Skj\u00f8th's latest tests showing that hair miniaturization can occur in females as young as teenagers. \"The new research shows that young women are reaching a point where they're experiencing this in their teens before they reach 100% of their hair potential,\" says Skj\u00f8th. \"The gradual thinning of 2% or 3% a year becomes 20% or 30% after 10 years.\" It's a condition that more than one-third of females are expected to experience by the time they exit their 30s\u2014whether they know it or not. \"A lot of women see these short, thin hairs at their temples and think it is breakage or just the way their hair is\u2014but for many this could be a sign of hair miniaturization,\" says Skj\u00f8th. Once a category (and conversation) dominated by male statistics, the American Hair Loss Association reports that nearly 40% of the country's hair-loss sufferers are, in fact, women. Triggers include (but are not limited to) everything from hormone shifts often following pregnancy, stress and emotional trauma, illness, overuse of hot tools or chemical treatments, and, of course, age. \"As we age, most hair is reduced either in the form of balding, receding, or thinning,\" says dermatologist [Dendy Engelman](https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/dendy-engelman-md), who increasingly sees afflicted female clients at her Manhattan-based practice. \"Genetics, as well as life changes, contribute to the interference of hair growth.\" And unfortunately, like most other health-related issues, the longer one waits to address the problem, the harder it is to treat. However, there are at-home and in-office options that can be practiced now. Below, five ways experts suggest caring for your scalp and hair: Incorporate Supplements Into Your Diet With awareness for internal wellness on the rise, the battle for many can start with nutrition. \"Supplements can be enormously helpful, as they strengthen the hair from the inside out,\" says Francesca Fusco, of Manhattan's Wexler Dermatology, who (along Chiu Engelman) recommends [Nutrafol's innovative cocktail of botanicals and antioxidants](https://www.nutrafol.com/product/nutrafol-women/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=nutrafol-q4-2017&utm_content=fpd&utm_term=PRODUCT%20GROUP&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrZHC5Jzv1QIVxLfACh1UywC9EAQYASABEgIdi_D_BwE), like ashwagandha and turmeric, that support the immune system, reduce stress, and balance the body as a whole. To address nutrient deficiencies, she notes that grabbing a hair-skin-and-nails vitamin like [Vital Proteins Beauty Boost capsules](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/beauty-boost/) will do more for the cause than biotin pills alone. Engelman also touts the protein peptides found in keratin supplements. \"By nourishing the body with keratin, which is a building block of healthy hair, strands grow thick and strong throughout the growth cycle,\" she says. Zhou Nutrition's Hairfluence line incorporates keratin along with vitamin B12 and bamboo-stem extract to support moisture, while Moon Juice's SuperHair capsules include saw palmetto, thought to be a natural blocker of DHT (a hormone that induces hair loss). Exfoliate Your Scalp \"Exfoliation of the scalp helps promote hair growth,\" says Engelman. And it sloughs off more than dead skin cells and product debris\u2014it's now believed that it may also remove excess DHT while simultaneously promoting the growth of new follicles. Soft-tipped cleansing tools like Leonor Greyl's Massaging Scalp Brush stimulate microcirculation to oxygenate hair follicles, and physical exfoliants like sea salt in Amika's Reset Jelly Scalp and [Christophe Robin's Cleansing Purifying Scrub](https://www.sephora.com/product/cleansing-purifying-scrub-with-sea-salt-P401452?skuId=1747393&om_mmc=ppc-GG_381463959_27499858119_pla-178173198519_1747393_97594815879_1016367_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIp4GqnJTs1QIVCweGCh2GAQISEAkYASABEgKQJPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) can fight inflammation-inducing buildup while increasing healthy blood flow when used sparingly in the shower. Fusco's DIY recipe? Simply mix a bit of raw sugar into your shampoo and rub gently onto the scalp with the balls of fingers for an easy, natural (and pantry-friendly) crown polish. Gentle pressure from your fingertips alone can be just as important, according to Skj\u00f8th. \"Lean forward, put your elbows on your knees with your head down, and sit in that resting position and give a really careful massage,\" he instructs. \"Spread your fingers and move the actual scalp where it's comfortable but firm.\" Even 60 seconds of this ritual daily is enough to encourage circulation. Leonor\\ Consider a Customized Natural Treatment Harklinikken's signature Hair Extract relies on a natural plant- and milk-based formula customized to each client's scalp and hair health. Extracts from botanicals like burdock root, ginger, and a special breed of apple are isolated, stabilized, and encapsulated (in a recipe safe enough to drink), tailored to each individual. \"Nothing is premade,\" Skj\u00f8th says of each of his extract's proprietary three-step fermentation process. After a consultation online or at a brick-and-mortar location, like their flagship in New York City or offices in Beverly Hills and Tampa, the team first confirms whether or not a person is an ideal candidate. (They do not work with patients suffering from certain forms of alopecia caused by scarring or autoimmune conditions.) If accepted, the ritual of application becomes paramount: daily massages onto clean, dry hair. The results are then carefully documented with microphotographs of the scalp that quantify the exact number of new strands per square inch every month or so. Incorporating Harklinikken's Balancing Shampoo into a care routine can make an impact even without the extract. \"The technology allows us to cleanse in a different way,\" says Skj\u00f8th of the formula's ability to penetrate the hair follicle without irritating toxins. And no matter what you use, he insists on two things: \"Wash your hair more often in general, at least every two days, and do it thoroughly,\" he says of keeping the scalp primed for optimal health with natural ingredients. Second, skip dry shampoo. \"I think I'm the most hated person among dry-shampoo companies,\" he admits. \"It has zero to do with shampoo\u2014it's a styling product, and it contains so many ingredients that should never, ever come into contact with skin.\" Even natural formulas can bind with dead skin cells, dirt, oils, and product residues. \"Then it destroys hair because it creates weak points in the follicle, causing inflammation,\" he warns. \"This can unfortunately lead to a scar, which means you will never have a hair in that follicle again.\" Apply a Follicle Stimulant It's no surprise that day-to-day products applied [directly to the scalp](https://www.vogue.com/article/stress-scalp-and-what-to-do-about-it) are as important as a carefully curated skin-care regimen. \"Even psychologically, it helps to actively do something that can potentially help rebound from hair loss,\" says Chiu, who recommends topical follicle-stimulating products like Foligain's DHT Blocker Serum that lean on panax ginseng root extract. New York City dermatologist Neil Sadick advises that focusing on clean recipes free of fragrances and harmful toxins, parabens, and sulfates can be vital. \"These [toxic] ingredients irritate and inflame the scalp, deplete beneficial nutrients, and ultimately sabotage the natural hair cycle,\" he says. \"Guarana is a natural extract that has anti-inflammatories and anti-androgen capabilities,\" he shares of the natural agent found in products like Taya's Guarana Active Stimulating free from sulfates, petroleum, and paraffins that can irritate sensitive scalps and damage textured hair. In-Office Therapies Like PRP and Lasers Platelet-rich plasma, also known as PRP, has gained popularity in the beauty world for its rejuvenating benefits when reintroduced into skin routines. Formerly used for cell growth after an injury, PRP as a hair treatment requires a patient to draw blood so the processing of the enriched cells can later be injected back into the scalp. \"PRP can stimulate the growth of follicles, thus reversing the hair miniaturization seen in male and female hair loss,\" says Sadick of its growth factors and bioactive ingredients. \"In PRP, our research group is trying to isolate the most active growth factors within the PRP and remove those factors which inhibit hair growth. This will produce a more beneficial and concentrated product that will stimulate the stem cells of the hair follicle and increase blood flow to hair follicles that may be genetically programmed to be shed.\" Sadick has also studied laser and light devices and suggests that money is better spent with a professional appointment. \"In terms of low-energy light treatments, in-office energy light sources like the Omnilux appear to be superior to at-home low-energy LED and light sources,\" he says. \"In the recent study that we published in the Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy, we found that most at-home hair-cap devices have very little differentiation in terms of their beneficial efficacy.\" For telogen effluvium in the wake of the pandemic, Sadick is doing a combination of bimonthly PRP treatments in conjunction with low-energy light and high-dose minoxidil to stop fallout. Still, buyer beware: Progress in hair growth from minoxidil can revert as soon as treatment ceases. Plus, Skj\u00f8th notes that studies have shown symptoms like dizziness caused by just 5% concentrations of minoxidil, and American brands often up the strength to double digits. For clients that do opt for the chemical, think of it like a syringe of Botox or filler: More doesn't necessarily equate to better results. "}
