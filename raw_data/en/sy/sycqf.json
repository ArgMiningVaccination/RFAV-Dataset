One of the most commonly listed benefits for our lite therapy experience is to boost your immune system. However, what does this really mean? In order to better explain, we must first learn some basics about our immune system. The main goal of our immune system is to protect us from foreign invaders, yet not many aware of the complexity in the ways that the immune system performs this function. Innate vs. Adaptive Immunity Our immune system is split into 2 branches, these branches perform similar functions at different times. The key here is that they communicate with one another to ensure a well-rounded immune response. When our body encounters a foreign invader, innate immunity kicks in. This response is general, think of it like putting a band-aid over a paper cut. You want something quick to stop the bleeding but it is not necessarily helping to heal your cut. Similarly, innate immunity buys the body more time. During this time, adaptive immunity develops a more specific response depending on the invader. This ensures that the body generates a response that is both effective and long-lasting. CELLULAR VS. HUMORAL IMMUNITY When you further breakdown adaptive immunity, it consists of many different components. While the words T-cells and antibodies often come to mind, they perform different functions. T-cells are considered a part of cellular immunity. There are many different types but particularly, they are there to physically attack the foreign invader and notify other cells. In comparison, antibodies are part of the humoral immunity. The term humoral refers to the presence of these antibodies in the extracellular space, so think of spaces outside your cells. The act to bind to invaders to neutralize them and prevent them entering the cells in the first place. WHY DO WE GET VACCINES? What makes adaptive immunity so unique is that it can form a memory. When we receive a vaccine, we are getting a small amount of a potential foreign invader. This small amount cannot hurt us but it will help activate our immune system, both innate and adaptive. However, since adaptive immunity is able to form a memory, when do encounter the actual invader, whether it be a virus or bacteria, our adaptive immunity will activate its previous response. This allows an effective and quick response to kick in immediately. **the COVID mRNA vaccine undergoes a different mechanism in the body that is not discussed here. BOOSTING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM?
