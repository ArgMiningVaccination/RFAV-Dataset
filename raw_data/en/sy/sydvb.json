In a phase 3 placebo-controlled study (NCT04886596) in adults 60 years, RSVPreF3 OA showed 82.6% vaccine efficacy (VE) against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD) and 71.7% against RSV-related acute respiratory infection (RSV-ARI). We assessed VE among participants with different BMI and with selected pre-existing metabolic or endocrine conditions (eg, diabetes) that increase the risk of severe RSV disease. Methods: Adults 60 years were 1:1 randomized to receive 1 dose of RSVPreF3 OA or placebo before the RSV season. VE against first occurrence of RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI was calculated for different subgroups (Table). Results: In total, 24,966 participants received RSVPreF3 (placebo) metabolic or endocrine condition (22.9% diabetes). Mean BMI in both groups was 29.1 kg/m2. In participants with overweight/obesity, VE was 85.6% (RSV-LRTD) 76.3% (RSV-ARI). In those 1 efficacious against RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI in adults 60 years with overweight/obesity and in those with 1 metabolic or endocrine condition. R. G. Feldman: K.
