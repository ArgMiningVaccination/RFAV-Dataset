What has caused this increase? Autism and Alzheimer's disease are much more prevalent today than they were just one hundred years ago. What has caused this increase? Certainly not the human genetic makeup, not in such a short period of time. What has drastically changed are the environmental toxins that we are exposed to. But what specific environmental toxins could cause these changes to occur? Aluminum is a known neurotoxin that has been suspected of fueling the rise in Alzheimer's disease for some time now. People with aluminum toxicity display many of the same symptoms as those with dementia, Parkinson's, ADHD, autism and other neurological diseases. By taking steps to protect yourself, you can minimize your exposure while maximizing your body's ability to rid itself of this toxic metal.

This can be done by avoiding aluminum foil, cans, juice pouches, tins and water bottles. But aluminum can be hidden in a wide range of other sources, including; baking powder, self rising flour, salt, baby formula, coffee creamers, baked goods, processed foods, coloring, caking agents, antacids, analgesics, meds, alum), lotions, sunscreens, shampoos and vaccines. Alum is used in water treatment plants to clarify water. Using a reverse osmosis filtration system can eliminate this source of exposure. According to CDC, the average adult in the US consumes about 7 - 9 mg of aluminum per day in food, and a lesser amount from air and water. Approximately 1% of the aluminum you ingest orally gets absorbed into your body, being deposited in brain tissue, nerves, bone, liver, heart, spleen and muscle.

All of these are toxic in their own right, but research suggests they may be even more hazardous in combination. Dozens of studies have shown that fluoride is a potent neurotoxin that causes brain damage and lowers IQ. Roundup, which is technically called Glyphosate, can be found in most processed foods in the American diet. Roundup can be found in genetically modified sugar beets, corn, soy, canola and cottonseed. Research shows Glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of aluminum and fluoride. Meats from animals raised in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) may also contain higher amounts of Glyphosate residues, as GE soy is a staple of conventional livestock feed. "}
