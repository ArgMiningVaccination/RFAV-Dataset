Bearden, Pharm. D. Clinical Assoc. Professor and Chair, Dept. of Pharmacy Practice, ClinicalAsst. Dir., Dept. of Pharmacy Services Oregon State University/Oregon Health & Science University National attention on important issues and urgent causes isgenerally viewed as a plus. As a prime example, even in itsoverall raising of an alarm, the Disneyland measles outbreakhas sparked a new national debate about the necessary role ofvaccines in an era where many have not experienced thediseases being prevented. Similar light shed on evolvinginfectious diseases problems have been seen in outbreakstories of resistant pathogens like the recent CRE infectionslinked to duodenoscopes. For the infectious diseasespractitioner this is yet another brief national reminder to the restof the world that we are in a constant battle with many of theseissues daily - but most don't make the headlines. (I mustconfess I can only now hear the word \"Ebola\" without wantingto yell at the television reports.) Now, however, the latestnational focus is being made not with another frightening publicoutbreak, but with an equally loud mouthpiece - the federalgovernment. I'll admit that having the government involved in things, particularly with the dysfunction that seems the norm at thecapitol, may not always be a very comforting idea. However, inthis case the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria is creating a national spotlight and path toimprove national antimicrobial use. The strategy, created with expert input and multiple national bodies, looks at 5 pillars of effect: slowing the emergence and spread of resistance; improving human and animal pathogen surveillance; advancing rapid diagnostics; accelerating drugand vaccine discovery; and improving international collaborations. While all these areas have a direct impact onthe roles of the infectious diseases pharmacists, the nationalplan for limiting resistance emergence and spread is deeplyrooted in the codified activity of a large portion of our work -antimicrobial stewardship. The Action Plan calls for the eventual implementation of universal antimicrobial stewardship in hospitals and other acutesettings. The methodology suggested is tying stewardshiprequirements to institutional CMS payment. While this methodis certainly not without possible issues, it also presents a new'nationwide' commitment to the necessity of antimicrobialstewardship. It will certainly be a challenge to continue todevelop and support enough practitioners to roll out such anambitious plan. However, this is a challenge we must all meettogether to best impact the resistance problems at hand. The Society has been completely vested in the need for appropriate use of antimicrobials for the past 25 years, allahead of the national wave now gaining ground. We willcontinue to work with our amazing members and growing list ofprofessional partners to capitalize on the current movement.Our patients and our healthcare system require it. The spotlight is on - it's time to keep it center-stage.OOOOOPPORPPORPPORPPORPPOR TUNITIESTUNITIESTUNITIESTUNITIESTUNITIES Vasudha Gupta, vgupta@cnsu.edu Details: Assist ant/Associate Professor Infectious Matt Goetz, Matt.Goetz@va.govDetails: https://www .usajobs.gov/GetJob/V iewDet ails/401827200 Pharmacy City Dallas Hospital Contact: Michael Lawless, Contact: Kate Christmas, 919-977-6186 Details: ASP Pharmacist Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Location: Ryan Moenster, Pharm.D., BCPS (AQ-ID); Ryan.Moenster@stlcop.edu<mailto:Ryan.Moenster@stlcop.edu> Details: Assist Project Director, Antibiotic Resistance Project Location: Washington, DCContact: The Pew Charitable Trusts Details: Project Director Medical Science Liaison - Infectious Disease/Anti-Infective Health System, Phoenix, Arizona Contact: http://jobs.mihs.org/clinical-pharmacy-specialist-pharmacy-hospital/job/5146021 Details: Clinical Pharmacy S pecialist Senior Associate, Antibiotic Resistance Project Location: The Pew Charitable Trusts, Washington, Dist.

It is estimated that only 10% of medications marketed since 1980 have sufficient data regarding infantile risk in pregnancy.7,8 As a method to establish teratogenic potential of these medications, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a pregnancy risk categorization system in 1979.9 This mandate required newly marketed agents to include pregnancy risk categories of A, B, C, D and X supplemented by statements for risk interpretation (Table 1). In December of 2014, the FDA approved and unveiled a new plan for product labeling, effective June of 2015, which abolishes the original FDA Pregnancy Category system.10 Three narrative sections will be required in the product labeling including \"Pregnancy\", \"Lactation\" and \"Female and Male Reproductive Potential\", replacing previous sections, which will apply to all products approved since June of 2001.10 Physiologic changes in pregnancy lead to potential pharmacokinetic changes that may impact drug therapy.11 Increases in total body water, blood volume (40-50%), andplasma volume (40-50%) contribute to increases in volume of distribution of various antibiotics. 11-13 Renal blood flow increases by 50%, possibly due to vasodilation of afferent and efferent arterioles as a result progesterone.11,12 Serum creatinine decreases, while glomerular filtration rate(GFR) increases of renally excreted antibiotics. GFR will approach post-partum values at approximately 3 weeks prior to delivery. 12,14 Alterations in gastrointestinal motility may lead to changes in absorption, oral bioavailability, and delayed onset of action of certain antibiotics.12,13 There are known changes in hepatic enzymes during pregnancy that clinicians may use to adjust doses, but current data are controversial as to whether these changes lead to clinically significant changes in drug metabolism and subsequent serum concentrations.12-15 Finally, decreases in albumin and alterations in maternal plasma pH are expected to lead to decreased protein binding and increased concentrations16of unbound drug.11-13 Antibiotic exposure in pregnancy may have untoward short- term and long-term effects on infant weight. A recent study showed that after adjusting for a number of factors, prenatal exposure of the infant to antimicrobials (via self-reporting by the mother) resulted in a lower birth weight of approximately 138 grams.16 Antimicrobial exposure during pregnancy has recently been linked to childhood obesity, although specific antimicrobial class exposure was not documented in the study.17 Prenatal antibiotic use and the risk of neurologic disease, including cerebral palsy and epilepsy, and atopic disease, including atopic dermatitis and asthma, have been studied independently. Several studies demonstrate an association while others do not.18-20 A recently published small study demonstrated that prenatal antibiotic use may be associated with the development of asthma by age three in children at risk for asthma (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.8).18 Medication use by trimester is even more scarcely studied.Prenatal antibiotic risk associated with asthma and wheezing was significant when antibiotics were used by the mother in the second to third trimesters but not during the first. 18,21 Conversely, a 2015 Cochrane review of prophylactic antibioticuse in the second and third trimesters which included seven randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate an increased risk of congenital abnormality. However, the authors concluded there was insufficient evidence to full evaluate possible fetal harm. 22 This paper, the conclusion of a 3-part review, provides updated information as of April 2015 on antibiotics in pregnancy to include drug-specific risk evaluation (Table 2) and clinical utility based on published evidence. AMINOGLYCOSIDES Amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, Aminoglycosides cross the placenta and may result in toxicities, especially if administered in the first trimester of pregnancy. Case reports of irreversible bilateral congenital deafness with maternal use of streptomycin in the first trimester have been described leading to a US boxed warning of the drug class and a FDA Pregnancy Category of D. 1,23 Other aminoglycosides have not commonly demonstrated similar hearing loss but if hearing abnormalities occurred symptoms were mild without clinical significance.24 Animal studies with gentamicin in rats and rabbits did not result in fetal toxicity.1 During pregnancy, the serum half-life of aminoglycosides isshorter and clearance is increased. Due to this and a larger volume of distribution in pregnant women, aminoglycosides may have a lower serum peak concentration compared to non- pregnant women. 25,26 Traditional or extended interval dosing of aminoglycosides in pregnancy are both supported in the literature.27 Despite toxicity reports, short courses of aminoglycosides, may be used in pregnant women with careful monitoring if likely benefit outweighs potential risk. Possible risks should be explained, especially in the first trimester. Due to the risks associated with streptomycin use specifically, this agent should be avoided.BETA-LACTAMS PenicillinsPenicillins and their newer derivatives are the most widely prescribed antimicrobial class during pregnancy. 1,2 Intravenous penicillin remains the first-line therapy for group B streptococcal prophylaxis at the time of delivery if the patient iscolonized with ampicillin recommended as a suitable alternative. 28 Penicillins generally cross the placenta in high concentrations. Those penicillins with increased protein binding such as the antistaphylococcal penicillins (except methicillin) produce lower fetal tissue concentrations compared with those penicillins with low protein binding such as penicillin G or ampicillin.29 Due to increased plasma volume and creatinine clearance in pregnant patients, serum penicillin serum concentrations may be decreased as much as 50% which may require increased doses and/or frequency.30 Penicillins have a long track record of safety over many years with the parent compound penicillin as well as the aminopenicillins (ampicillin and amoxicillin) having the most robust safety data.31 All penicillins and their derivatives as well as penicillin combinations with beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate or sulbactam have been assigned a Pregnancy Category B rating from the FDA indicating no proven human risk.23,31 Pregnant patients should be prescribed penicillins if possible unless an allergy is documented that would prohibit penicillin-based therapy. Cephalosporins Cephalosporins have a long history of documented use in the pregnant population and are often used for similar indications as penicillins.1 Cephalosporins remain a first-line option for many infections in pregnancy with general use reserved for patients allergic or intolerant to penicillin therapy. Cephalosporins have decreased plasma concentrations in pregnant patients due to increased renal elimination with potential dosage/frequency increases required.32 Unlike penicillins, fetal concentrations are low with most cephalosporins, especially first generation cephalosporins which achieve approximately 10% of maternal concentrations in the fetus.33 The FDA has classified all cephalosporins as having Pregnancy Category B.23 Findings from a Michigan Medicaid database suggested a potential association between ceftriaxone and cardiac malformation.23 However, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for the treatment of gonorrhea during pregnancy.34 Ceftriaxone should be used cautiously at term due to the potential risk of kernicterus. Newly approved agents such as ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are also Pregnancy Category B agents; however, they should be use with caution as there is a lack of published data during pregnancy.35,36 Carbapenems There is a paucity of data regarding the use of carbapenems during pregnancy. Ertapenem, meropenem, and doripenem are Pregnancy Category B while imipenem-cilastatin is a classified17as Pregnancy Category C.23 Pharmacokinetic changes associated with pregnancy have been clearly shown to decrease imipenem concentrations. A study of 20 patients showed a nearly 70% reduction in peak serum imipenem concentrations in both early and late term pregnant patients (n=14) compared to the non-pregnant patient (n=6).37 Carbapenem therapy should be reserved for pregnant patientswith infections resistant to penicillin and cephalosporin therapy with limited alternatives. Monobactams While its lack of cross reactivity with penicillins and cephalosporins makes aztreonam appealing, there are inconclusive data regarding the safety of aztreonam in pregnancy. Most safety data is in the perinatal period which supports its FDA Pregnancy Category B rating. 23 Data are limited in the first trimester thus aztreonam should be used with caution during this period.38 Aztreonam crosses the placenta although fetal serum concentrations are low.39 Due to a lack of data at this time, aztreonam use should be restricted to patients with severe penicillin allergy who cannot receive beta-lactam therapy. FLUOROQUINOLONES Although fluoroquinolones are a group of synthetic antibacterialagents classed as Pregnancy Category C, however, they are generally contraindicated in pregnancy. 23,34 Fluoroquinolones may be safe during the first trimester but are not recommended because previous animal studies found fetal harm.4,5,40 There is a suggested association with fluoroquinolones and renal toxicity, cardiac defects, and CNS toxicity in the fetus.41-43 Animal data has demonstrated bone and cartilage damage inthe fetus. 23 Data are inconsistent and more studies are needed to confirm these associations. Authors of a recent literature review concluded that the risks to humans may not be the same as animals however, because human studies had weak study designs, small sample sizes, and confounding variables, the data are not adequate to support their routine use in pregnancy.40 Because of the current evidence, fluoroquinolone use in pregnancy is only recommended if there is no alternative and the pregnancy remains viable.44 GLYCOPEPTIDES AND LIPOGLYCOPEPTIDES Vancomycin is a glycopeptide that is classified as PregnancyCategory B, and is thought to be safe to use in pregnancy in the case of serious gram positive infections, particularly during the second and third trimesters. 23 Vancomycin crosses the placenta and has been found in umbilical cord blood after IV administration.31 Despite the absence of robust clinical data evaluating use of vancomycin in pregnancy, there are reports to suggest that it is safe to use during pregnancy. In one report, vancomycin IV was given to 10 pregnant women for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.31,45 No abnormalities, including hearing loss or nephrotoxicity, were noted in the fetus after at least 1 week of vancomycin therapy during the second or third trimesters. Other cases, where vancomycin was administered for 13 and 28 days, found similar results, with no ototoxicity ornephrotoxicity in the mother or neonate.31 In animal trials, no congenital malformations were noted following IV administration of vancomycin in rats or rabbits given 1 to 5 times the maximum recommended human doses.31 When used orally, vancomycin has little systemic absorption, and is not believed to cause adverse effects during pregnancy.31 Higher doses of oral vancomycin (>500 mg), renal dysfunction and severe colitis have been associated with detectable serum concentrations with oral administration and should be considered in exposure.46 Telavancin, oritavancin, and dalbavancin are lipoglycopeptides with gram-positive activity similar to that of vancomycin.47-49 There are no human data available for telavancin, however,animal data suggest that telavancin may cause harm (Pregnancy Category C). 23,49 In rat, rabbit, and minipig studies, telavancin caused limb and skeletal malformations and fetal weight loss. The manufacturer recommends that women ofchildbearing potential have a serum pregnancy test prior tobeginning therapy with telavancin and placed on effective contraception continued during therapy. 49 There are no human data available for the use of oritavancin or dalbavancin in pregnancy, and animal studies found no fetal toxicity at doses comparable to human doses (Pregnancy Category C).31,47,48 With oritavancin, doses of approximately 25% of the humandose had no evidence of harm to the fetus in rat and rabbit studies, while higher doses have not been tested. 48 After dalbavancin exposures of 3.5 times the human dose, rats were found to have increased embryo lethality and offspring death.47 Telavancin, oritavancin, and dalbavancin should be avoided inpregnancy unless the benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. MACROLIDES AND KETOLIDES Data on the safety of macrolides in pregnancy are widelyvariable. 50 The first associations of erythromycin (Pregnancy Category B) exposure with cardiovascular defects and pyloric stenosis in offspring occurred in 2003, however later studies did not corroborate these results.51,52 In a retrospective cohort, investigators recorded the presence of congenital malformations, pyloric stenosis, or intussusceptions in order to determine the effect of macrolides on fetal development.50 In 1,033 women exposed to macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or roxithromycin), there was no association with development of major malformation in the fetus and macrolide use. In addition, exposure in the third trimester was not associated with pyloric stenosis or intussusception.50 In a review of maternal erythromycin exposure over 15 years, erythromycin was persistently associated with cardiovascular defects (risk estimate 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.26-2.39)).51 Most defects were considered mild. In infants with congenital heart disease and pyloric stenosis, there was no association with macrolide exposure compared to non-exposed controls.52 Azithromycin has generally been considered safe for use in pregnancy and is labeled as Pregnancy Category B.23 In rats and mice, azithromycin at doses 2-4 times human doses was not associated with any evidence of fetal harm.53 Clinically, a patient with Q fever was successfully treated with azithromycin18500 mg for 6 days.54 No evidence of fetal abnormality or residual infection was found. In a comparison of women exposed to azithromycin versus other antibiotics or non- teratogens, no differences were found in the rates of major malformations between groups.55 Similar to erythromycin, data with clarithromycin (Pregnancy Category C) have been conflicting. In animal studies, some rats exposed to clarithromycin in the first trimester did not result in teratogenicity, while other strains showed low incidences of cardiac abnormalities after clarithromycin exposure.53 Other data report cleft palate in murine studies and retarded fetal growth in monkeys.53 In clinical reports, including a prospective controlled study, clarithromycin exposure has not been associated with increased incidence of major malformations.30,56,57 Telithromycin is a ketolide antibacterial with similar structure and activity as the macrolides. There are no human data for the use of telithromycin in pregnancy, and it is labeled as Pregnancy Category C.58 In rats and rabbits, telithromycin was not teratogenic at doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.8 times the human doses.58 At higher doses, delayed fetal maturation was observed, possibly related to maternal toxicity. Given its relative limited utility and potential risk, telithromycin should be avoided in pregnancy. OXAZOLIDINONES Currently, there is a lack of controlled studies of linezolid andtedizolid in pregnant women. Positive maternal outcomes without fetal teratogenesis were detailed in a case report oflinezolid use (4 weeks) starting at 14 weeks of pregnancy. 59 Both agents are FDA Pregnancy Category C and animalstudies in mice, rats and rabbits have not shown teratogenic effects. 23,60 However, in rats, linezolid and tedizolid resulted in mild fetal toxicities including decreased fetal body weight and reduced ossification of the sternebrae at maternally toxic doses.60,61 A reduction in fetal weight and increase in costal cartilage abnormalities were seen with tedizolid use in mice with the absence of maternal toxicities (4-fold the estimated human exposure based on area under the concentration curve (AUC)).60 Fetal weight loss and maternal toxicity were identified with tedizolid use in rabbits. However, in a pre- and post-natal toxicity study of rats, no offspring defects were documented with tedizolid used at the highest tested dose equivalent to the plasma AUC exposure of the 200mg/day clinical dose.60 Oxazolidinones could be considered for use during pregnancywhen potential benefits outweigh the risks. TETRACYCLINES Labeled as Pregnancy Category D, tetracyclines have proventeratogenicity in humans. 23,62 They are associated with congenital defects while large doses have been linked to maternal liver toxicity.63 Tetracyclines cross the placenta and when used beyond the second trimester, they can bind to calcium in the developing fetus causing permanent discoloration of bones and teeth. They are contraindicated past the fifth week of pregnancy.23 The American Academy of Dermatology guidelines recommend avoiding tetracyclines inpregnancy.64 Topical tetracyclines are considered safe for the treatment of maternal acne.65 Tetracyclines should be used with extreme caution, if at all, in pregnancy, and only when a clear benefit has been established. In rare cases, doxycycline may be considered in pregnant women who have life-threatening tick-borne illnesses. Miscellaneous Antibiotics ClindamycinClindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic and is classified as Pregnancy Category B. 23 Some experts, but not all, support the use of oral clindamycin as an alternative to metronidazole as clindamycin has been shown to reduce preterm birth and late miscarriage.4,66 In contrast, vaginal clindamycin is not recommended due to systemic absorption, increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes (neonatal infection and low birth weight), and lack of efficacy.23,34 Systemic clindamycin crosses the placenta reaching cord serum concentrations about half of the mother's.67 Late clindamycin use (up to 32 weeks gestation) is associated with adverse outcomes and CDC treatment guidelines recommend avoiding vaginal clindamycin in the latter half of pregnancy.34,68 Daptomycin Daptomycin is Pregnancy Category B and should be used in pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the risk.15,23 There are no controlled trials with daptomycin (a cyclic glycopeptide) during pregnancy, however, isolated reports suggest that daptomycin may be safe to use.69,70 In the first report, a woman in the third trimester was successfully treated with daptomycin 4 mg/kg for 14 days for vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium pyelonephritis.69 In another report, a 14- week pregnant patient with a history of drug abuse was successfully treated with daptomycin 6 mg/kg for 6 weeks for tricuspid valve endocarditis.70 No adverse effects were noted in the patient or in the neonate at birth in either report. In animal studies, daptomycin was administered to rats and rabbits at doses 2-4 times human doses with no evidence of harm to the fetus.15 Fidaxomicin Although fidaxomicin, a non-absorbable macrocyclic antibiotic, is Pregnancy Category B, there are no published documented cases of use in pregnant women. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits at doses 66 to 200 times the exposure expected in humans at standard dosing (200mg orally twice daily) revealed no harm to the fetus.71 Systemic exposure to fidaxomicin is minimal with plasma concentrations falling below the level of detectability in most patients.72 No studies of fidaxomicin concentrations in breast milk are available; however, due to the pharmacokinetic profile, limited infant exposure would be expected. Fosfomycin Fosfomycin (Pregnancy Category B) is generally well tolerated and although it crosses the placental barrier, no adverse events in the fetus or infant have been reported.73 In Europe, it is used with caution in pregnancy as an injectable agent, which is not available in the United States.73 This agent is recommended19because of its high sensitivity, ease of use, and safety in pregnancy.74 75 Metronidazole Metronidazole is classified as Pregnancy Category B, however, it is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy.23,76 Several trials have linked metronidazole use in asymptomaticTrichomonas vaginalis infection or increased fetal fibronectin concentrations with increased pre-term birth (PTB) rates. 77,78 Multivariate analysis showed no relationship betweenmetronidazole exposure at any time during pregnancy with PTB, low birth weight or congenital abnormalities. 79 Vaginal metronidazole should be used with caution when used during pregnancy, as a potential link with congenital hydrocephalus has been suggested.80 Metronidazole also remains a guideline-recommended therapy for BV and Trichomonal infections in pregnancy but risk of repeat exposure during pregnancy is unknown and a reduced risk of PTB has not been clearly established. Nitrofurantoin An antibacterial specific to the urinary tract, nitrofurantoin is considered Pregnancy Category B.23,81 Animals exposed to doses 25 times that of normal human administration did not result in teratogenic effects.81 Because of limited systemic exposure and relatively benign adverse effect profile combined with proven effectiveness, nitrofurantoin is commonly used in UTI management in pregnant women. A Cochrane review of interventions for recurrent UTI in pregnancy, found only 1 study investigating nitrofurantoin, demonstrating effectiveness of nitrofurantoin combined with close surveillance, but not with nitrofurantoin alone.82 A recent meta-analysis of 8 studies did not demonstrate any association of nitrofurantoin exposure in women and major congenital malformation.83 In 3 case- controlled studies however, there was a significant increase (OR=1.22, 1.02-1.45) in malformations.83 Although not commonly reported, nitrofurantoin may increase risk of hemolytic anemia in pregnant patients with severe glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.84 Although there may be some concern in the recent meta-analysis requiring further investigation of possible teratogenic effects, nitrofurantoin remains an option for treatment of UTI and prevention of recurrent UTI in pregnant women. Polymyxins Polymyxin B and colistin are considered Pregnancy Category C.23,85 In the few published cases and single database examined, there does not appear to be an increased risk of PTB, low birth weight or congenital abnormalities, although the data are quite limited.86 In an animal model examining risk during pregnancy, polymyxin B demonstrated toxic effects to the embryo in a dose-dependent manner. This was hypothesized due to its effects on reduction in metabolism, heart loss or neuromuscular blockade.87 Topical use of polymyxin B as part of a Polygyrax\u00ae suppository is used outside of the United States for BV.88 Due to the limited use in pregnant women and high potential for adverse events, strong caution should be advised prior to use.Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are both rated FDA Pregnancy Category C.23 Animal studies have demonstrated teratogenic effects. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim both cross the placenta and should be avoided in the first trimester due to trimethoprim's mechanism as a folate antagonist. Exposure during this period can result in major congenital malformations (OR 2.43; 95% defects (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.05-2.95).89 Trimethoprim has also been associated with an increase in cleft palates with first trimester use (prevalence OR 14.29; 95% CI 3.46-59.05).90 Increases in cardiac (OR 2.49; 1.18-5.26) limb (OR 2.18; 1.13-4.23) malformations were seen with trimethoprim use 12 weeks prior to conception.91 However, maternal folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of major fetal malformations from trimethoprim. Sulfonamides should not be used in the third trimester as they theoretically result in an increase of unbound bilirubin due to competitive protein binding. However, the literature lacks clinical reports of this outcome with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.92 Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use during the first trimester has been also associated with urinary tract defects (OR 3.05; 95% CI 1.13- 8.23) and its use during the last two trimesters has been associated with small for gestational age newborns (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.16-2.23).89,93 Pharmacokinetic parameters in pregnancy are similar to those in non-pregnant women.94 Overall, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be avoidedin the first trimester and after 32 weeks gestation, if other treatment options are available. 92 In the second and third trimesters, use in pregnant women may occur if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Tigecycline Tigecycline is a glycylcycline that is classified as Pregnancy Category D and crosses the placenta.23 Animal data has demonstrated adverse outcomes including fetal loss in maternal toxic doses and possible discoloration of infants' teeth. Although no human studies exist to date, this medication should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.95 Anti-mycobacterial agents First-line therapy for TB in pregnant woman is consistent withthe non-pregnant populations to include isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. 96,97 A systematic review conducted by Nguyen et al., demonstrated overall safety of first-line therapy comparable to the general population.97 Of note, many patients were not necessarily exposed to anti-TB medications during the first trimester, representing the most critical time of fetal development and risk of abnormalities. Isoniazid (INH) therapy, Pregnancy Category C, has not produced a signal of increased fetal abnormalities in animal or human data.97-99 A non-significant increase in hepatitis has been observed in pregnant women receiving INH, particularly in those with pre-existing liver disease and HIV.98 Monitoring of liver enzymes is important and is recommended throughout pregnancy.97,98 An elevation of 3-5 times upper limit of normal20may prompt discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis therapy. INH is also recommended for latent TB infection (LTBI) in pregnancy as a first-line treatment. Low risk patients may be advised to defer treatment of LTBI until after pregnancy for concerns over medication exposure. High-risk patients (e.g. HIV) should be initiated on INH therapy. Pyridoxine (B6) daily oral supplementation (25-50mg/day) is advised in all pregnant women receiving INH to mitigate neurologic complications in mother and newborn.97,98 Rifampin use in animals at up to 10 times the normal human dose did not produce any fetal abnormalities, however increasing the dose to 15 times human exposure at the time of conception was associated with significant fetal malformations.98,100 Use of rifampin in over 2,000 pregnant women has not produced an increase in fetal abnormalities.98,101 Rifampin has a Pregnancy Category C rating.23 INH coupled with rifampin is known to increase liver enzymes additively, thus careful monitoring is advised. An association between rifampin and newborn bleeding has been described, thus prophylactic Vitamin K may be necessary.98 Data on alternative rifamycins, rifabutin and rifapentine, arelimited in pregnancy and thus should be used with caution. 96 Several cases of rifapentine use have reported both normaldelivery and fetal abnormalities, which were also observed at standard exposures in some animal studies. 102 They are considered Pregnancy Category C and not recommended in the current guidelines.23,96 This may expose the fetus to anti- TB medications during the most critical time point. Ethambutol is Pregnancy Category B and is generally considered safe in pregnancy.23,96 It is associated with retrobulbar neuritis in the general population; however there has not been an associated increase in either pregnant mothers or infants born to mothers exposed to ethambutol during pregnancy.98,103 There are no controlled studies to date investigating pyrazinamide (PZA) use in animals or humans; however literature is available documenting use without fetal ormaternal harm.97,104 Pyrazinamide may be associated with increased risk of hepatotoxicity, especially in combination with INH and/or rifampin. The current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend caution with pyrazinamide use in pregnancy, however, the World Health Organization and International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUTLD) recommend the use of PZA in pregnancy.96,105 In general, PZA is thought to be safe in pregnancy (Pregnancy Category C), however careful risk assessment is needed and enhanced monitoring, specifically of uric acid and liver enzymes is suggested. Fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, which may be used in multidrug resistant MTB, should be avoided in pregnancy as discussed in prior sections.96,97 The newest antituberculous agent, bedaquiline, is considered Pregnancy Category B.23,106 Reproductive studies in rats revealed no fetal injury, howevercaution should be exercised in pregnant women. 106 Due to relative lack of use in the United States, additional agents will not be discussed, however the IUTLD recommends against all injectable anti-tuberculosis agents in pregnancy.105 CONCLUSIONS The use of antibiotics in pregnancy requires carefulassessment and a discussion of risk versus benefit to mother and fetus, both short and long-term. In general, many antibiotics are considered safe in pregnancy, especially beta- lactams, macrolides, clindamycin, and fosfomycin; however, additional data are needed for the majority of antibiotic classes. Emerging antibiotic resistance will certainly play a role in future use of broad-spectrum and alternative agents in pregnancy. Pharmacists play a prominent role in risk assessment and evaluation of available evidence for optimal antibiotic selection, dosing and monitoring. Pharmacists should also be aware of the new guidelines for product labeling and pregnancy risk implemented in the summer of 2015.Table 1.
