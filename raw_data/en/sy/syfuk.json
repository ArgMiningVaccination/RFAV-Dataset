To be forced to recommend one company bringing out a new range of products, whose composition has not been widely discussed and has no track record, is beyond belief. To attempt to give all people with blood-pressure problems, no matter what the cause, one formula, ignoring all other health factors, is incomprehensible. There are so many other products from different brands that may be more effective, products with a history of being useful; why pick this small range of untried products? Maybe the answer is that complementary medicine is basically ignored in pharmacy degrees and very few pharmacists have the knowledge to discuss or ask the relevant questions regarding complementary products. How embarrassing for pharmacists to be caught with their hand in the till. Ian Collins, Caulfield North Make results available I AM a health consumer and am disgusted at this agreement. If it wasn't enough that pharmacies credulously offer such quackery as ear candles and the good old magic water of homeopathy, the agreement with Big Quacka means that any lingering vestiges of trust in pharmacies has vanished. Pharmacies are putting financial objectives well ahead of the ethical treatment of customers. All guild pharmacies should come with a health warning and advice to customers to wash off the snake oil after visiting their pharmacy. I trust the guild will also make available the results of the peer-reviewed randomised double-blinded clinical trials of Blackmores Companion preparations so customers can make informed choices. Graeme Hanigan, Mount Eliza Improve your diet I AGREE with Mortlake pharmacist Stuart Baker that the deal is not in patients' interests (The Age, 27/11). Much evidence exists that it is best to obtain essential vitamins and minerals by including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in our diet - for ''cost-benefit'' and health reasons. The argument that this arrangement is part of a preventive health approach, and patients have the right to information is self-serving. Plenty of information is available already: it's called advertising. Margaret Jacobs, Northcote End the monopoly PEOPLE outraged by the new pharmacy deal should also be aware of a much greater rort - a pharmacist with an existing business can block any new pharmacy within 1\u00bd kilometres. No other business has a deal like this. Is it any wonder existing owners make so much while young pharmacists can't get a job. Stop this monopoly now. David Beattie, Mont Albert Open up trade further THE threat to standards in the pharmacy profession posed by the Blackmores alliance surely makes a compelling case to open the pharmaceutical trade to supermarkets. Peter McQuillan, Hobart, Tasmania We are addicted to unsustainability THE Planning Minister is, like his predecessors, in a spot. While he probably knows he is not doing the right thing when overriding the wishes of local councils and the community, he also knows the state relies on more and more developments - high-rise, low-rise, low-density, high-density, just keep building. Without this continuous stream of brick, concrete and glass, Victoria's economy would look very bleak. Until we get a government with the fortitude to reshape Victoria's economy to a more sustainable industrial and knowledge-driven export powerhouse, along with a stable population, our planning ministers will have to obey the masters in Treasury. Meanwhile, the community has to put up with ill-considered developments all over our paved-over Garden State. Bernard Ellis, South Yarra Erosion of 'a fair go' I FELT sad reading Daniel Flitton's article (''Anxiety, lack of trust rising'', The Age, 27/9). Pessimism seems to be pervading the Australian way as we have embraced the ideals of capitalism and greed for wealth and clamour to be on the right side of the wealth divide. Ideals of egalitarianism and ''a fair go'' have been eroded as society has polarised away from majority middle class to a fracturing puzzle of haves and have nots. Tony Abbott fans the flames of any group, minority or majority. Julia Gillard fails to get even simple messages understood. Divisive politics continues, misinformation is stated as truth, and views are divided even further. The European and US debt crisis threatens the global economy, and only now is the US floating the idea of a Buffet tax, where the obscenely rich actually pay the same rates as everyone else. How has their society got so unbalanced? Are we close behind? Polarisation is changing Australia and we may not like what we see in the future. There is nothing more certain than death or taxes, but with less tax we may see the death of the Australia we cherish. Julian Druce, East St Kilda Reap what we sow WHEN I worked at CSL in the 1960s under the Health Department, the manufacture of penicillin was one of the most active areas. Now CSL imports supplies, the result, no doubt, of decisions taken since privatisation. It claims it has no control over the current scarcity of supply (''Hospitals' penicillin crisis, The Age, 27/9). Global capitalism has much to answer for in its adverse effects on public amenity and wellbeing through obsession with the bottom line and the relentless quest for profit. Our forefathers had more than just self-interest in mind when they established essential services in government ownership. They were smarter and more prescient than later generations dominated by selfish economic rationalism. Graeme Noonan, Phillip Island AFL's lucky escape THE AFL had a lucky escape on Monday night. If a player has been ruled ineligible to receive the Brownlow Medal, he should also be ineligible to receive any more votes from that point on. Having an ineligible player receive the most votes is not good for football, and leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth - especially the player who ends up winning by default. If the award is really for the best and the fairest, what is the point of continuing to give votes to players who can't win it? Carmel Murphy, Croydon South Exposure confused with glamour WHAT a statement in elegance, style and dignity Rouba Houli made at the Brownlow count, in contrast with some who confuse exposure with glamour. Her beautiful dress demonstrated more skill and creativity than the predictable strapless numbers that have become merely variations on an over-worked and tired theme. Her designer deserved naming credits. Morag Thorne, Mulgrave Historical links EDDIE, Eddie, the irony. My father was the elder brother of Albert (Leeta) and Harry Collier (Collingwood Brownlow medallists in 1929 and 1930). As the eldest boy, he often shouldered the burden of family struggles through crippling poverty due to the gambling addiction of their father, Albert. The families of problem gamblers suffer devastating financial consequences and debilitating shame and social problems. My father left school at 12 to help support the family. Andrew Wilkie's proposals go some way to protecting the vulnerable families of this century. Josephine Grant (Collier), Templestowe Look out for mates ROMSEY is one town that won the right not to have pokies. I was involved in the battle and the years of court hearings. All I remember are the stories people kept telling me. Surveys taken years apart said the locals didn't want pokies. Why? The single common factor was that people knew somebody who had overcommitted to pokies with disastrous results. There was the butcher who was called out to restrain a neighbour from murdering his wife, who had gambled the house mortgage; the grandmother who had to move because she lost her house at pokies; the young mum at playgroup who was still affected by family memories of a dad at pokies; a plumber who, when he took his family for a meal out, saw his favourite babysitter from childhood sitting like a zombie at the machines. Sue Kirkegard, Romsey No time for analysis THE ABC news tells me the Prime Minister has announced an important policy. In the same breath I am told the Opposition Leader says the policy is rubbish. No grounds are given - there is no time for analysis in the seconds available. Daily we are treated to this kind of government-says-A, opposition-says-not-A reporting. Every policy announcement is accompanied by the apparent invalidation of it. The ABC is ostensibly taking a no-bias approach. But this kind of reporting, which gives equal weight to the announcement of important policy, often the result of months of administrative input, and knee-jerk cries of ''rubbish'' is not even-handed. It simply makes governing impossible. The government of the day should be granted the presumption of authority it has earned at the ballot box. It does after all have to bear the consequences of its policies. The opposition has no such authority and no such responsibility. Its proper role is to analyse and reveal weaknesses in policy, not to systematically undermine the authority of government. Giving equal weight to assertion and counter-assertion encourages, indeed produces, radical instability in government. Lack of bias, as a goal, requires much more discriminating reporting. Freya Mathews, Brunswick East Safety in numbers THE Baillieu government has missed the bleeding obvious (Focus, 27/9). If more people travelled on trains at night, there would be naturally more people around at stations, surely a disincentive for assaults and other anti-social behaviour. And how do we get more people on evening trains? More frequent services and a conspicuous staff presence at stations are proven to work. Waiting an hour between trains to Hurstbridge or 30 to 40 minutes for other lines is no better than 20 years ago: commuters are long overdue for a maximum 10-minute wait between trains. When services are improved, such as on regional lines, patronage throughout the day has soared. Phil Bourke, Macleod Biomass misses boat TED Baillieu needn't trouble himself over possible conflicts of interest when considering Gary Squires's latest proposal for Victoria's native forests (''Tree lopper turns up as biomass spruiker'', BusinessDay, 27/9). Biomass power generation is only viable within a national emissions trading regime, and it has become clear that native forest won't meet the criteria set out in the Clean Energy Future package now before Parliament. Mr Squires has run his dash, and then some. The age of converting high-value habitat to high-volume commodity is over. Justin Tutty, Darwin, NT Stop playing victim WHY is it that fellow Indians/Hindus give us a reputation of being boring curmudgeons with no sense of humour (''Hindus want to ban play that has Ganesh reclaim swastika from Germany'', The Age, 27/9)? It's one thing to critically analyse and review a play after watching it. But it is another thing to find offence in any non-Hindu's reference to a Hindu character. I would have expected more from a religious body that, in India, promotes cartoons of all its mythological stories. Let us stop playing victim for once and have a laugh. Jaya Rengasamy, West Melbourne AND ANOTHER THING... Dane Swan's Brownlow speech: \"... and to my sister, who doesn't come to the footy very often, an dwhen she does she's in the bar most of the time.\" Classic Collingwood. The AFL IT'S a sad day when football clubs can survive only at the expense of people losing more than they can afford on the pokies. Christine Weatherhead, Glen Waverley COLLINGWOOD: proudly sponsored by problem gamblers. Ker-ching, ker-ching. Vincent Mahon, Melbourne THERE can be no argument about it now; footy is all about making money. Forget sport; forget social responsibility. Rob McPherson, Brighton I AM a Collingwood Football Club member and am still waiting for a response to my emails to the club earlier this year asking them to support the proposed controls on pokies. Tony Delaney, Clifton Hill WATCHING Collingwood beat Hawthorn. Marvellous. Watching Jeff Kennett's smirk wiped right off his face. Priceless. Dennis Urbans, Forest Hill THE AFL needs problem gamblers to finance its habits? It's time I took an interest in soccer. Mick O'Mara, Winchelsea THE real tax on footy is the ''suit tax'' we pay so highly paid suits can justify why non-participating clubs should be able to sell grand final tickets for up to $1500. Now that's a tax. Peter Fyfe, Erskineville, NSW The state THE Police Association claims to have a tape of Ted Baillieu committing to higher salary increases than the government's current offer. So all it has is a politician's promise? Alan Williams, Port Melbourne ''BAILLIEU promises to halt language decline'' (The Age, 26/9). Every teacher working in a government school knows what a Baillieu promise is worth. Alan Whittaker, Kew East WHAT does our government have against lungs? First it was Melbourne's lungs (green wedges) in jeopardy and now funding for lung transplants at The Alfred has been curtailed. No wonder it's becoming harder to breathe. Bryan Fraser, St Kilda THE place to be: if you're a developer. Angela Munro, Carlton North Other matters ECONOMISTS don't understand our love affair with cash. The answer is right before their eyes. Just look at the charge imposed when using a debit or credit card for a purchase - often between 1.5 and 3 per cent. Irene Wyld, Cape Schanck PRIME Minister Netanyahu gave a distinguished speech at the UN General Assembly. But it was not quite as memorable as the one he wrote earlier for President Obama. Peter Barnett, Toorak THOUSANDS of peaceful demonstrators occupy Wall Street to send a message to bankers that enough is enough, yet not a word of it in our mainstream papers. "}
