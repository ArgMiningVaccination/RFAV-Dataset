They have contributed to innovative and significant breakthroughs in Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, Genetics and other fields. Dr. Johanna Budwig is also one of those women, whose tenacity, passion and diligence aided her to make a massive contribution to medical research, leaving behind an indisputable legacy which to this day helps save lives. Sadly, she passed away in 2003 following an accident from which she never recovered. For the past 60 years, Dr. Budwig\u00b4s protocol has been very successful in helping people to improve their health. Her discoveries led her to identify some of the main causes of disease. She discovered that many known chronic illnesses are due to a lack of oxygen in the body, the consumption of refined or partially hydrogenated oils, and a deficiency in essential fatty acids. In the book Cancer Cause and Cure by Dr. O.P. Verma, on page 47-48, Dr. Budwig is quoted as stating \"... So I decided straight away to go for human trials and enrolled 600 patients from four big hospitals in Munster (Germany). I started to give flax oil and cottage cheese to the cancer patients. After just three months, patients began to improve in health and strength, the yellow green substance in their blood began to disappear, tumors gradually receded...I treated approximately 2500 cancer patients in the last few decades.\" In her book \"Flax Oil as a True Aid against Arthritis, Heart Infarction, Cancer and Other Diseases\", on page 32, Dr. Budwig makes the following statement: \"I often take very sick cancer patients away from the hospital where they are said to have only a few days left to live, or perhaps only a few hours. This is mostly accompanied by very good results. The very first thing which these patients and their families tell me is that, in the hospital, it was said they could no longer urinate or produce bowel movements. They suffered from dry coughing without being able to bring up any mucous. Everything was blocked. It greatly encourages them when suddenly in all these symptoms, the surface-active fats [flaxseed oil and Quark] with their wealth of electrons, start reactivating the vital functions and the patients immediately begin to feel better. It is very interesting to ask how this sudden change is possible. It has to do with the reactions patterns, with the character of electrons.\" DR. JOHANNA BUDWIG - A GLIMPSE OF HOPE www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 6 In addition to the several clinics and doctors who endorsed Dr. Budwig's work such as Drs. Willner and Roehm, here is a comment from two German physicians, Dr. Bernd Belles MD and Dr. Gerd Belles MD. Both specialize in cancer treatment and are strong proponents of Dr. Budwig's healing approach. Here is what they have to say: \"We are general practitioners specializing (among other areas) in Holistic Cancer Treatment. For our holistic approach, we use Tumor Therapy....The one element which clearly stands out as having the greatest importance and forming the basis of all holistic tumor therapy is the oil-protein diet according to Dr. Johanna Budwig. If this nutritional regimen is implemented without deviation, there is a chance of recovery at every stage of tumor development (which we have personally witnessed in our practice!). We now try to make all our tumor patients arrange their regimen in accordance with Dr. Johanna Budwig's suggestions. It is crucial to stick to her dietary schedule exactly as stated, however. Any deviations will be severely punished by the renewed formation of tumors\". Courtesy of German original: www.oel-eiweiss-kost.de and Budwig goes on to say: \"From 1939 on, I was in charge of the dispensary in a military hospital with 5000 beds. In 1949, I returned to Dr. Kaufmann's facility in Munster at his request and I was immediately assigned the post of State Expert for Chemical Research on Drugs and Fats.\" \"As part of an evaluation of drugs based on sulfhydryl groups, I was confronted with the fact that no blood-chemical measure existed to test fat metabolism.\" Her knowledge of physics and chemistry came into play and she utilized radioactive isotopes of iodine and cobalt to develop a technique with paper chromatography that allowed her research team to \"determine the exact valences and confirm theories on fat metabolism\". She was the first to be able to analyze fat in living blood, thus opening the door to a vast new and important technology around the world. She noticed that sick cancer patients' blood was all clumped together instead of free-flowing as in healthy people. Also the blood had a strange greenish unnatural color, which was a sure sign of oxygen deficiency. To quote Dr. Budwig: \" Our eating habits are often lacking in high unsaturated acid fats, and contain an excess of man-made oils known as trans fats (or partially hydrogenated oils)\". These trans fats are found in commonly used cooking oils. Most companies extract oil from corn, sunflower seeds, and other plants through extreme heat, and other artificial processes, none of which are the natural extraction procedure. As a result, these oils are no longer alive, and are no longer advisable for consumption. Additionally, when these heavy oils are incorporated into our cell membranes, they destroy the electric charge. Without that charge, our cells start to suffocate due to a lack of oxygen. The aforementioned trans fats are also a trigger factor for Type II Diabetes, since insulin is a large molecule and trans fats challenge the molecule's entry through the cell membrane. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 7 After administering a mix of flaxseed oil and quark, Dr. Budwig found that the blood of her patients was no longer clumped together and displaying a greenish color. Instead, she could see a bright red color, which is a very positive indicator and a sign of improvement and increased oxygen intake. By means of a signed document dated August 24th, 2000, Dr. Johanna Budwig authorized our clinic, the Budwig Center, to use her techniques and protocols, which have helped a vast number of people to improve their health. The Budwig Center\u00b4s main approach is to establish the reason/cause of the disease and the specific trigger factors involved. We can determine the cause, whether it is a degenerative or chronic disease, or even a tumor. Armed with this insight we can alleviate the adverse effects of the disease and aid remission through natural therapies and treatments. With this approach, we can also reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other treatments of general medical practice, if you should choose to undergo such treatments. Microbes / Viruses / Fungus : (Pathogens) Several studies have shed light on how some types of Cancer and tumor activity are caused by unique viral microbes found inside the impaired cells . These microbes enter weak cells, causing damage by starving them of oxygen and healthy nutrition, amongst other things. The impaired cell area is an inviting environment for fungus and virus to settle. Toxins : Toxins are the largest contributing factor to disease. Toxins can be produced by tobacco, alcohol, dangerous chemical products (harmful chemicals, atmospheric contaminants or hydrocarbons, which are used and stored in the workplace, home & garden) and other external agents. By weakening the cells, toxins contribute to the formation of cancerous tumor cells, which breed and encourage other types of cell damage. For example, 3000 chemicals can be found in one cigarette. Studies have also revealed that toxins and harmful chemicals can be found in our personal hygiene and household products. Heavy metal poisoning is very common, one of its causes are infections that are developed from certain types of dental fillings. It is therefore highly advisable that anyone in need of root canal work request that their dentist run X-rays and any other relevant tests to check for infection. Long-term stress and negative emotional traumas can produce toxins in our body too. An entire chapter has been written on this subject. Many chronic diseases are connected to negative emotional experiences of the past or present. Hormone replacement therapy and hormonal imbalance are also \"toxic\" to the body. Compromised Immune System: INTRODUCTION - Some of the main causes of Cancer and other diseases www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 8 Prolonged stress, pushing oneself even when tired and in need of rest, extended deep sadness that lasts for weeks, months or even years, improper diet (especially high in white refined sugar) and lack of regular exercise all contribute to a weak and compromised immune system. Under these circumstances, the body's defense system is not able to fight off the harmful pathogens that are a constant threat. Nutritional imbalance: Our eating habits could be another risk factor. We live in a fast-paced, fast-food society where ready-made meals and canned food are commonplace, not to mention the way food itself is processed. To this we add pesticides, fertilizers, chemicals, growth hormones and genetically modified crops to increase shelf-life; the list goes on and on. Current investigation and countless testimonies indicate that poor nutrition is a key factor in how many diseases develop. Degenerative illnesses and tumors are also linked to nutritional deficiency, this is particularly so in the case of diseases that attack the nervous system and induce severe neurological damage. Patients suffering from a degenerative disease who have an unbalanced, unhealthy diet are at a higher risk of contracting a virus, a fungus or some other unwanted microorganism. Nutritional deficiency disrupts intercellular communication and leads to hormonal imbalance and structural alterations in amino acids. All this affects the entire cell reproduction mechanism and DNA instructions. Regular consumption of white refined sugar, fizzy drinks (one fizzy drink contains more than 10 teaspoons of refined white sugar), potato chips (crisps), industrially- made cakes, as well as fried food, constitutes a risk factor. Similarly, it is important to avoid ready-made meals, processed meats (hot dogs, sausages, bacon and ham), fast-food and food additives, etc. Refined vegetable oils, containing trans fats, are widely used for deep-frying (chips, fried chicken, pastries) and processed foods (mayonnaise, tomato ketchup, and others sauces and dressings). When ingested excessively, they actually suffocate the cells, depriving them of oxygen. We must take precaution when shopping for food. Vegetable oils may be labeled \"100% pure\". Even if partly natural, these are still manipulated products. Why? Because most manufacturers extract oils from plants using extremely high temperatures and chemical products. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 9 When these oils are mixed with proteins, they hinder blood and lymphatic circulation, cause heart damage and inhibit our regeneration process. This slows down - and potentially halts completely - the bio-electric activity in these areas. According to Dr. Budwig, corrosive and caustic chemical products, namely, sodium hydroxide (commonly known for its use as a drain cleaner) are also used in the refining process. Eliminating these harmful pseudo fats and replacing them with healthier ones (e.g. flaxseed oil and other cold-pressed oils) is a giant step towards fighting cancer and other diseases. Include cold-pressed oils in your diet, such as: olive oil, sunflower seed oil, safflower oil or virgin coconut oil (which is the best for cooking because it does not alter chemically when exposed to high temperatures). The label must read \"cold-pressed\", \"virgin\" or \"extra-virgin\" (in the case of Olive Oil). Most food is cooked between 350\u00ba- 400\u00baF (175\u00ba-200\u00baC). At home people generally cook food at more than 105\u00baF (40\u00baC). These high temperatures destroy most of the beneficial enzymes. Steam cooking our food is a much better alternative. The goal of Budwig Center\u00b4s protocol is to rectify the proportion of all minerals and nutrients in the body in order to achieve the balance as well as the electromagnetism required for all the necessary reactions to take place in our body. Why are some people more prone to degenerative diseases, tumors and other chronic illnesses than others? Well, we are all exposed to parasites, virus, fungus, harmful toxins and other health risk factors on a daily basis. Moreover, our immune system can be weakened by severe negative emotional shocks, (such as the death of a loved one, divorce, family issues, financial setbacks, etc.), over-working, a negative state of mind (which can also be the trigger for depression and anxiety disorder), lack of sleep and poor nutrition. Unknown to most, all of these situations can severely undermine our immune system and be contributing factors to a major illness. In summary, if we follow a balanced diet, eat the right foods and, therefore, nurture a strong immune system, our bodies will be able to fight off intruders and withstand the stress negative experiences can put on our system. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 10 T he mixture of flaxseed oil with cottage cheese/quark - also known as The Budwig Muesli - taken while following the diet as detailed below, is the cornerstone of the Budwig Program. How to make the Budw g Muesli Step 1 - Mix 3 tablespoons of flaxseed oil with 6 tablespoons of cottage cheese/quark (maximum 2% fat content). If the fat content of the cottage cheese or quark is too high, the flaxseed oil will not mix into it, cancelling out the oxygenating benefits of the Budwig Muesli. Do not stir by hand . Use a blender or a hand-held electric mixer for 1 minute at a slow speed. The muesli should have the consistency of whipped cream, with no excess oil. Do not add anything else until it has a creamy consistency. IMPORTANT! Please be advised that step 2 (adding the flaxseeds) is not applicable to patients with cancer of the colon, rectum and especially patients who have had a colostomy. S tep 2 - Separately, in a coffee grinder, grind 2 tablespoons of whole flaxseeds and add to the mix made in step 1. This muesli turns rancid after 20 minutes , so it must be ingested immediately. Do not grind and store seeds to be used later. Optional - To sweeten the muesli you may add 1 teaspoon of honey (raw, unpasteurized honey is best, containing all of its healthy properties) or blended pieces of fruit. However, if you prefer other flavors, add lemon, parsley or garlic. If you would rather a runnier consistency, add goat's milk, oat milk, almond milk, or organic rice milk. You could also add dried fruits, such as ground hemp seeds, ground almonds, ground sunflower seeds, Brazil nuts, and pumpkin seeds (do not use peanuts ). For a change, why not try adding vanilla, cinnamon, lemon juice, raw cocoa or grated coconut. Some prefer a touch of cayenne pepper... be creative! DR. BUDWIG\u00b4S FORMULA (Flaxseed Oil and Cottage Cheese) www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 11 The flaxseed oil must be kept cold, so store it in the fridge. Try to purchase directly from the manufacturer, (e.g. Barlean\u00b4s, N. America, who offer a discount to cancer patients on the Budwig program or Linovita, Europe), or from a herbalist/health food shop. IMPORTANT - Once made, the Budwig muesli should NOT BE STORED . It must be ingested within 20 minutes of its preparation. The cottage cheese/quark can be frozen if necessary. To follow the Budwig Program y ou will need these 2 appliances , which we provide during your stay: 1- A coffee grinder for grinding flaxseeds. 2- A blender for mixing flaxseed oil and cottage cheese/quark. It must be an electric mixer, as mixing by hand does not obtain the same consistency. Note: When quantities are mentioned this is what we mean: 1 teaspoon = 5ml, 1 tablespoon = 15 ml, 16 spoonful's = 1 cup and 4 tablespoons = \u00bc cup. SUGAR : Although we may directly avoid sugar, please keep in mind that the following foods have sugar content: Ice-cream (commercial ice creams also often contain chemicals like carboxymethyl cellulose, butyraldehyde, amyl acetate and diethyl glycol which is also used in anti-freeze and paint removers), pastries, fizzy drinks, boxed cereals, ready-made sauces and even in savory food, for example, bread. Read labels carefully. Avoid fructose syrups, maple syrup, sugarcane honey (molasses) and artificial sweeteners. Fizzy (soft) drinks can have up to 10 teaspoons of white refined sugar. Fruit juices from concentrate have a high sugar content and low nutritional value since the UHT manufacturing process leads to the loss of most of its beneficial vitamins. REFINED OR HYDROGENATED OILS: Regardless of the plant or seed, oil that have been refined cause our cells to suffocate. We should, therefore, avoid fried food (chicken, fries, chips, doughnuts, etc.) and try to cook our hot meals at home using extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil, which can tolerate high temperature without altering its components. DAIRY PRODUCTS: Except cottage cheese or quark used in the Budwig M uesli, we do not use dairy products (including butter) in our diet because they contain animal fats that retain toxins and contribute also towards Candida and fungus growth. BUTTER: Should be avoided, make your own Oleolux instead (re cipe provided at the end of this guide). SHELLFISH: Lobster, clams, shrimp, prawns, (although they are no t shellfish: squid, octopus, and other mollusks are not recommended either). Shellfish (from which seafood is made) eat FOODS TO AVOID - ACCORDING TO DR. BUDWIG www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 12 everything in their environment; so by consuming them you may also be ingesting heavy metals and other toxins. Wild (non-farm feed) fish is acceptable. PORK AND COLD MEATS: Please be reminded that animal toxins are stored in their fat, which is why it is best to avoid pork and cold meats. Also, many types of cold meats contain chemical additives such as nitrates. Dr. Johanna Budwig said that red meat contributes to swelling or inflammation and was not in favor of eating pork due to the nature of the pig\u00b4s digestive system. Pigs eat everything in sight and digest their food in approximately 4 hours, leaving a large amount of toxins, which end up in the fatty tissue of the animal. Ongoing consumption of pork produce has been linked to inflammation of the joints (arthritis). R EFINED GRAINS & CEREALS: White bread, pasta, and all refined cereals are hard to digest. They do not contain the nutrients and fiber needed by the intestine, and worse still, they help increase glucose levels, which also promote Candida and fungus issues. COFFEES, TEAS, AND PREPARED BEVERAGES: Coffee contributes to pH acidity and is also d amaging to the nervous system and kidneys. A Cancer patient should not drink it, and all teas should be herbal loose-leaf infusions, because tea bags and paper filters contain harmful chemicals, such as chlorine. MICROWAVE: M icrowaves destroy most nutrients and the beneficial elements that food can provide for us, as well as it distorts the molecular structure of food. TEFLON (Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): Food cooked on Teflon type frying pans contains smal l particles of PTFE, which, when consumed, are harmful to the reproductive system. ALUMINIUM KITCHEN UTENSILS: We recommend using ceramic kitchen utensils and we p rovide them during your stay at the Budwig Centre. We also recommend cooking with cookware made of stainless steel, wrought-iron, glass or earthenware. SAUERKRAUT JUICE AND FERMENTED FOODS: Dr. Budwig favored fermented foods. Dr. Budwig h ad all her patients drink a glass of fresh sauerkraut juice first thing in the morning. She recommended to add a little pineapple juice if you find the taste hard to take. She knew that cabbage offers a host of health benefits. The famous Captain James Cook sailed around the world without losing a single sailor to scurvy, thanks to the foods his ship carried, including sixty barrels of sauerkraut. COTTAGE CHEESE / QUARK / KEFIR COTTAGE CHEESE / FROM AGE BLANC: (not on its own) mixed w ith ground flaxseed oil muesli, twice a day. Fromage blanc (Spanish Quark), when made from skimmed milk, is very similar to low-fat quark. It is important to use the low or zero-fat variety, since, for the purpose of reducing what Dr. Budwig called 'respiratory poisons', it is advised to use low-fat quark (cottage cheese) for the preparation of the flax oil/cottage cheese mixture (Dr. Budwig considered animal products to be respiratory poisons and personally favored a vegetarian diet). The rich in omega 3 linseed oil, which she was greatly in favor of, only produced the chemical reaction that enabled the flaxseed oil to become water soluble and enter the cells when mixed with quark or cottage cheese with low or zero-fat content. FOODS RECOMMENDE D BY DR. BUDWIG www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 13 The negative aspects of dairy seem to be largely neutralized when combined with flaxseed, as a chemical reaction takes place and the muesli formula becomes bio available and henceforth floods the body with high amounts of life giving oxygen. SWEETENERS: Xylito l from Birch trees (avoid Xylitol obtained from corn or other sources) Agar (a jelly-like substance obtained from algae), and stevia from plants, are acceptable sweeteners. HEALTHY ANIMAL MEAT OR GUARANTEED DESIGNATION OF ORI GIN: Dr. Budwig stated in h er book \"Flax oil as a True Aid against Arthritis, Heart Infarction and Cancer \", on page 34: \"I do not forbid patients meat, unless they are on the edge of the grave.\" Following an interview Dr. O.P. Verma held with Dr. Budwig, he quoted her in his book \"Cancer Cause and Cure\", on p age 56 as saying: \"I reject frozen and preserved meat. Fresh meat is OK.\" In her Oil-Protein Diet Cookbook , Dr. Budwig writes on page 175: \"While traveling, you can always care for yourself with Linomel and hot or cold milk, and/or fruit juices.\" She also recommends eating various types of fresh fish to temporarily replace the flax oil and cottage cheese/quark when travelling. She writes: \"...you can protect yourself against harm while travelling by ordering fresh fish such as trout, pike, carp and other fresh fish\". Meat can be replaced with mushrooms and seaweeds, especially Spirulina (contains about 65% protein and 3 times as much protein as red meat). There are many other vegetarian sources of protein such as hemp, lentils, sprouts, nuts and seeds. But if you decide to eat meat, we recommend you choose free range, organic poultry (chicken, duck, turkey). Red meat causes inflammation and, of course, non-organic red meat contains synthetic hormones and anti-biotics. Processed meats have several harmful preservatives. The only 'meat' that a cancer patient would consume sparingly would be free range, organic chicken and wild caught fish (fish with fins and scales) such as: Anchovy, Barracuda, Bass, Pilchard, and Whitesh. EGGS: Dr. Budwig was a vegetarian (or close to it), so she did not use eggs in her cooking. She did allow some types of meat, so perhaps organic, free range eggs would be permitted. If you decide to consume eggs, opt for poached, soft boiled or, even better, raw in a smoothie (make sure to wash the eggs before consuming them raw). ORGANIC FRUIT AND VEGETABLES: Whenever possible, we recommend consuming seasonal fruits and vegetables, preferably raw or steamed to retain all the nutrients. For a larger intake, we suggest making vegetable juices or fruit and vegetable shakes. We do not recommend fruit juices where the pulp has been separated from the fruit. We advise you to use a type of blender that retains the pulp and is capable of juicing vegetables like carrots (such as BLENDTEC or VITAMIX). Always try your very best to consume only organic. When fruits and vegetables are organic you also have the peace of mind that they are not GMO (Genetically modified). NUTS, DRIED FRUITS AND SEEDS: Only natural (no hydrogenated oils) and not roasted. Almonds can be soaked to make them more usable in sauces (see recipes). Several published studies have identified walnuts as bearing unique cancer-fighting qualities. Researchers at UC Davis and other institutions have uncovered that diets rich in whole walnuts, as well as walnut oil, have the ability to slow prostate cancer growth in mice. Other studies determined that just two handfuls of walnuts each day could reduce to half the risk of breast cancer and tumor growth. It is believed that walnuts can shrink levels of the hormone IGF-1, known to play a key role in development of www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 14 both prostate and breast cancer. Also Researchers found they reduced cholesterol and increased insulin sensitivity, making them valuable in the fight against heart disease and diabetes. Flaxseed or Linseed oil is delicate and subject to oxidation. From the moment of extraction until it reaches your kitchen it should always be kept between 5\u00baC and 12\u00baC. Since this is logistically difficult and out of most people's hands, it is recommended to include the actual seeds, ground in our daily food plan. Flax seeds themselves with the shell or husk contain very important nutrition that is not in the oil. Dr. Johanna Budwig included ground flaxseeds in her meals in addition to taking the muesli. Another way to eat them is soaking the seeds 2 or 3 hours before to 'wake up' the seeds and eat them whole. This can be done with chia seeds as well. HERBS and HERBAL TEAS: Dr. Budwig used herbs generously in her program . Such as Chai t ea, Jasmine tea, Basil, cinnamon bark, clove, fennel seed, dandelion, fenugreek seed, ginger, spearmint, star anise, turmeric, and thyme. Many herbal teas are effective for pain and meridian balancing as in Chinese Medicine, which we emphasize in our clinic . (More on Chinese Medicine and Herbs later in this Guide) COLD PRESSED OR EXTRA VIRGIN OILS: Olive oil, sunflower seed oil, hemp seed oil, macad amia oil, sesame oil, grapeseed oil, coconut oil etc. Each type of oil has a distinct taste and contains vital characteristics to oxygenate the cells. They are to be ingested raw, as a dressing or in a shake. The only oil that should be used for cooking is coconut oil. ORGANIC WHOLE GRAINS : Dr. Johanna Budwig\u00b4s favorite grain was buckwheat. Try variations like quinoa, whole grain Basmati rice, millet, and spelt. The Western diet uses large amounts of wheat in their dishes and recipes, and growing numbers of people are intolerant to it. Try sprouted grains or Ezekiel bread. Corn is not recommended because (unless otherwise stated) it is normally genetically modified (GM) and could easily have traces of mold. ORGANIC PULSES : Chickpeas, beans and lentils are all very nutrition al, and especially rich in amino-acids. Natural (no sugar) pickles are also fine. Note: Dr. Budwig was basically a vegetarian, therefore her daily plan did not mention any kind of meat or eggs as discussed above. If you decide to consume fish, poultry or eggs, add them to this food plan. UPON RISING: About an hour or more before breakfast, drink [4 to 8oz / 100 to 250ml] of raw sauerkraut juice. Add some fresh pineapple juice, if you do not like the taste. Honey Jun-Green Tea Kombucha is also a fermented drink that naturally contains a multitude of live enzymes and DR. JOHANNA BUDWIG DAILY PLAN www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 15 acids and loads of vitamins (including B vitamins), yeasts and antioxidants, and can be drank before meals. BREAKFAST: Begin with a cup (250ml) of green tea or any herbal tea. This should not be left out as the warm tea will make the ground flaxseeds in the flaxseed oil and Cottage cheese recipe swell. Now consume a bowl of fresh made Flaxseed oil and Quark (cottage cheese) as per the recipe already outlined above in this Guide. You can follow with some whole grain bread (Spelt or Ezekiel bread is fine) with cucumber, tomato, radishes or other raw veggies. MID-MORNING: D rink a glass of freshly made vegetable juice from carrots and/or beet, celery, lemon, apple as well as green vegetables - lettuce (avoid ice-berg lettuce), chard or spinach. SUNBATHING : Dr. Budwig found that when she had her patients lie in the sun, they started feeling much better and became rejuvenated. She referred to the sun as having a stimulating effect on the secretions of the liver, gall bladder, pancreas, bladder and salivary glands. Twenty minutes is adequate to avoid sunburn. No sunscreen or sunglasses are used (more on that later ). During the 24 hours following your sunbathing session, it is recommended to shower with water but no soap to avoid obstructing the vitamin D production that takes place in your skin. EXERCISE: Dr. Budwig said: \"I would never allow a cancer pati ent with metastases to jog, ride a bicycle, or to practice stretching exercises. His body must relax.\" At Budwig Center we recommend a gentle 20 minute daily walk in nature and, when possible, to use the mini- trampoline, gently, for a few minutes daily, as this is beneficial for the lymphatic system. BEFORE LUNCH : Start with a cup of herbal tea. One Tablespoons of freshly ground flaxseeds added to a glass of sparkling wine, Champagne or Spanish Cava (especially if you have brain cancer, poor appetite or digestion). Instead of Champagne, pure fruit juice with its pulp retained is fine. Using a Blendtec type blender retains the pulp. LUNCH: include a green salad and home-made salad dressings. Steam vegetables such as peas, yams, red potatoes, kale, tomatoes, spinach, beets, carrots, chard, cabbage, brussel sprouts, broccoli, onions, artichokes, asparagus, peppers, green beans. Also whole grains, such as buckwheat, millet or brown rice and lentils and beans are encouraged. Add Oleolux and nutritional yeast flakes after cooking. Also, add healthful spices such as cayenne pepper, paprika, turmeric & others. Whole grain, Ezekiel or homemade breads (See Budwig Center Guide for recipes and ideas) LUNCH DESSERT : A cup of warm herbal tea. Consume another bowl of F laxseed oil and cottage cheese with fresh fruit, but this time without the freshly ground flaxseeds. MID-LATE AFTERNOON: For brain cancer and the very weak, one tablespoon of whole flaxseeds, freshly ground, stirred into a glass of sparkling wine, Champagne or Cava ( Brut Nature is the best, as no additional sugar has been added) or a 4 to 8 ounce glass of fruit juice, especially papaya, grape, cherry or pineapple, preferably with the pulp. The fruit juice with flaxseeds is for all types of cancer except brain cancer. EMOTIONAL STATE : The mind and body function as one, so try using E.F .T. (Tapping) or other emotional therapies to control anxiety and negative emotions. Watch comedy movies, listen to pleasant music and enjoy the company of good friends and family. DINNER : (see LUNCH recommendations) BEDTIME: Dr. Budwig allowed a glass of organic red wine to h elp combat insomnia. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 16 Is there any replacement for Cottage Cheese / Quark? Some websites that talk about Dr. Budwig and her food program even suggest using yogurt, eggs, vegetable powders, nuts or garlic. What did Dr. Budwig say on the matter? Yogurt : First of all, if you read through all her books and research, she never recommended or sanctioned the use of yogurt as a suitable substitute for quark in the Budwig Diet. She was adamant on using quark (cottage cheese) right up to publishing her last book in September 1999. That is not to say that she necessarily was opposed to yogurt, she just did not mention it as an option. It probably is not as effective as cottage cheese/quark because it lacks the protein density of cottage cheese and may not fully mix with flaxseed oil. The dairy product needs a certain protein density to facilitate complete water solubility of the flaxseed oil. After mixing yogurt even in double or triple proportion of the cottage cheese, on close observation with a magnifying glass you will find that there are still tiny oil specks floating on top, yet with quark that does not happen. Please keep in mind that a chemical reaction takes place when the sulfhydryl groups in quark or cottage cheese bind with the unsaturated fatty acids in flaxseed oil. This reaction allows the flaxseed oil to become water soluble and easily be absorbed into the cell membrane. I would not risk using yogurt when you are fighting with cancer and your life is at stake! Kefir Cottage Cheese : This is an acceptable substitute for l actose intolerant persons. For people who seem to have some intolerance to dairy it seems to be easily solved by making your own homemade Kefir Cottage cheese. The kefir is already fermented for a longer period, thus the conversion of lactose to lactic acid is virtually complete, and doesn't present the same digestive problems, even for those with irritable bowel disease, in most cases. After mixing the Kefir Cottage cheese and linseed oil for at least one minute, try adding the juice of a whole lemon for even better digestion and a fresh zingy flavor. If this Kefir Cottage cheese still causes you some dairy intolerance issues, try taking the enzyme lactase when consuming dairy (lactase pills). Goat or Sheep Milk: In all her books and interviews, Dr. Budwig never mentioned goat milk. She does however mention sheep's milk as being acceptable. Since the fat in goat milk is different and generally considered healthier, it could be used exceptionally if you cannot locate Cottage cheese from cow milk. If you live in a country where goat and sheep milk are the norm, use sheep milk if at all possible, and make Kefir Cottage cheese with that milk. Vegetable Powders, Eggs, Nuts or Garlic: Dr. Budwig would never approve of any of these substitutes for the following reasons: Dr. Budwig was aware of the Vegan alternative, BioSan's Companion Nutrients , but when asked by a Swedish professor about quark alternatives for his client, former president, Bill Clinton, she disregarded companion nutrients completely. And there is no indication that they work. FREQUENTY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DR. BUDWIG PROGRAM www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 17 The same is true of vegetable protein powder instead of cottage cheese. Over the 16 years I have been researching cancer remedies and studying the Budwig protocol here at the Budwig Center, I have not had any patients or heard of any cancer healing testimonials on record, achieved with the help of BioSan's Companion Nutrients, powdered vegetable protein or other substitutes. Based upon USDA food tables, leeks, chives, garlic, cabbage, red pepper and asparagus contain sulfur, but not sulfurated proteins in any appreciable amount. We need to keep in mind that it is not the sulfur in vegetables that we are after, but the sulfurated proteins. So while these vegetables (as well as many other foods) do contain sulfurated proteins, the problem is they do not contain the amounts required for the Budwig mix. Egg yolks: would be a better choice but they are much too fatty for consideration in the Budwig diet and the consumption of eggs, even organic free-range, is controversial as nowhere did Dr. Budwig approve of them directly. Nuts and seeds: have a very high level of sulfur containing proteins, especially walnuts. The proteins in nuts and seeds are already balanced with omega 3, 6 and 9 fats by nature, but when flax oil is added, this natural balance is lost. Therefore, once again we will not reach the proper fat/protein proportion obtained with dairy, as recommended by Dr. Budwig. In conclusion, there are two reasons why using nuts as a dairy substitute would not be effective: Too much omega-6 and too little sulfur proteins in relation to the fats. Did Dr. Budwig recommend organic food? Whenever possible, purchase organic food, as studies have proven that organic produce contains up to 69% more natural antioxidants than conventional crops with pesticides. A UK research group inspected data from over 300 reports testing the differences between organic and conventional crops. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 18 They reached the conclusion that the antioxidant impulse acquired from changing to organic produce is the equivalent of one or two additional portions of fruit and vegetables every day. This change also reduces exposure to nitrates, nitrites and toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. Pesticides and herbicides literally form a layer on our food, while exposure to these chemicals damages our DNA and is linked to such conditions as Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Why did Dr. Budwig discourage taking vitamin and mineral supplements? In Dr. Budwig's [German-language] book \"Fotoelemente des Lebens\" (Photo Elements of Life), p. 5, she talks about \"the addition\" of chemical substances, referring to antioxidants. She was obviously referring to man-made antioxidants, which are synthetic, and not antioxidants that are naturally occurring in foods. She also spoke of \"electron thieves\", such as margarine, animal fat, butter, nitrate, ionizing radiation, cytostatics (chemotherapy), antioxidants and vitamins with antioxidant properties (in high doses). These can prevent the uptake of electrons, blocking cell respiration. The following are quotes from the Budwig protocol: \"Vitamins in capsules or pills contain fragmented nutrients and are mostly synthetically made. There is a long list of synthetic components, some of which are damaging; amongst these synthetic elements is talcum which is similar to asbestos.\" Dr. Budwig also said: \"High doses or levels of antioxidants (antioxidant supplements) could reduce effectiveness or interfere with the Budwig Program.\" She encouraged her patients to eat food in the form that God made it, not manipulated and processed. Therefore foods that naturally contain antioxidants are acceptable. For example, when eating grapes try to eat the seeds of the grape, as they are one of the richest sources of natural antioxidants. The Budwig program does not include any vitamin, mineral or antioxidant supplements. Were Vitamin C in high doses and Vitamin C infusions approved by Dr. Budwig? Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling (Nobel Chemistry Prize in 1954 and Nobel Peace Prize in 1962), advocated the consumption of high doses of Vitamin C in the treatment of many diseases, including cancer. Although Dr. Johanna Budwig was aware of Dr. Pauling\u00b4s research, she did not use it in her program. However, from Dr. Budwig's views with respect to antioxidants (Vitamin C is an antioxidant), she did not recommend doing Dr. Pauling\u00b4s therapy at the same time as the Budwig Program. That is to say that if a patient wants Vitamin C infusions, they are advised to stop ingesting the cottage cheese/quark and flaxseed oil mix during that time. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 19 Are Ozone or similar high-oxygen treatments suitable? Translated and extracted by Healing Cancer Naturally \u00a9 2006 from Dr. Budwig\u00b4s books Das Fettsyndrom and Der Tod des Tumors. From Das Fettsyndrom pp. 76 ff : \"The use of oxygen concentrate, aerosols, hydrogen peroxide injections and other methods of counteracting hypoxia or tissue anoxia, means forcing blood to take oxygen. Trying to do this through non-biological means is the wrong way to go about it. The priority should be to investigate why the blood is not absorbing enough oxygen?\" The link between a lack of oxygen in the blood and how it affects our health has been firmly established. The effects of insufficient oxygen can range from fatigue to a potentially fatal disease. Dr. Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner both in 1931 and later in 1944 for discovering the cause of Cancer, said: \"Cancer has one main cause. The main cause of cancer is when normal cellular oxygen breathing, is replaced with an anaerobic cellular breathing (less oxygen)\". Once a cell\u00b4s oxygen availability drops below 60% of its normal rate, the cell is forced to change to an inferior energy production method (fermentation); the cell cannot return to an adequate oxygenation system, and loses control of replication, and therefore starts to frantically make copies of itself, a condition we call cancer. Dr. Warburg pointed out that any substance depriving a cell of oxygen is a carcinogen. Dr. Budwig discovered that by supplying flaxseed oil and quark to her patients, the body\u00b4s oxygen absorption increased immediately and naturally. Did Dr. Budwig use herbal remedies? Johanna Budwig also wrote cookbooks for housewives; KREBS EIN FETTPROBLEM was one of them . Here she recommends using recently harvested pot herbs or wild herbs, both in seasonings and salad dressings. Salads dressed with wild herbs are particularly important. Dandelion, for example, is on the top of the list in terms of health benefits. (Later in this Guide more details will be given on the use of herbs and Chinese Medicine .) www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 20 Is there a danger in consuming dairy for ER-positive breast cancer? The enormous benefits of cottage cheese with flax oil outweigh the possible concerns with growth hormones in non-organic milk. Just the same, always try to use unpasteurized organic dairy when possible. It would seem that ER-positive (estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer patients respond to the protocol exactly the same as non ER-negative patients do. Should I avoid flaxseeds and flaxseed oil if my tumors are highly estrogen- receptor-positive? For hormone-sensitive cancers, the estrogen-likeness of flax is a good thing. It loosely \"fills\" the estrogen receptor in the tumor so that \"real\" estrogen cannot and in that sense it is an estrogen blocker. Several studies have been done to determine how the phytoestrogens in flaxseeds may help cancer. One theory compares the estrogen-receptor blocking ability of flaxseeds with estrogen-receptor modulation drugs. The weak plant-based estrogens block the estrogen receptors on cells within breast tissue, starving them of full-strength female estrogen, possibly stopping tumor growth and preventing cell damage. Flaxseeds contain a weak plant estrogen called lignan. Lignans can help improve the way our body metabolizes its own estrogen. This in turn can reduce the development of fibroid tumors. The recommended intake is about two tablespoons of ground flaxseeds per day. By doing this you can reduce the development of those tumors by 20%. Flax contains lignans, which may have an antioxidant effect and block or suppress cancerous changes. Dr. Budwig did not encourage the consumption of flaxseeds on their own but always with some other food product. When cottage cheese or quark are mixed with the flaxseed oil and freshly ground flaxseeds, this creates a powerful anti-cancer formula Should I get surgery to remove my tumor(s)? Dr. Budwig said that each case must be considered individually. If the tumor is located in an area that is life threatening, then you have no choice but to undergo surgery. However, generally speaking it is not the tumor that is the problem, unless of course they are interfering with the proper functioning of the body. The important thing is to contain the tumor so that it does not metastasize (spread to other parts of the body). In fact, there are experiments that show that tumors serve as a sort of \"septic tank\" or detoxification factory which absorbs surplus toxins, thus keeping them out of the general circulation where they could do harm. Consumption of refined sugar indirectly or even directly contributes to the formation of tumors. Tumors actually ferment and use sugar to do so. The tumor is not really your \"enemy\", however, as it helps your body expel poisons. So in other words, without the tumor you could be very ill. Once you carefully follow the full Budwig protocol, the body - which made the tumor in the first place - will also cause it to disappear all on its own. So we need to www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 21 follow an approach that works with the body. Instead of starting off by removing the tumor, we first need to do a deep detoxification program for at least 3 to 4 weeks, using special herbs, ionic foot detox system, gentle mini trampoline sessions, coffee enemas, daily walks or sunbathing (the detoxification program should be adjusted to each patient's needs). Next, we need to follow the full Budwig approach for two or three months. If by then the tumor, for some strange reason, starts to grow, - which it rarely does - you can always undergo surgery to remove it. How Can I Overcome Cachexia \"Wasting Away\"? One issue that tumors do cause is the consumption of energy. Cancerous tumors apparently take up to some 18 times more sugar (energy) than healthy cells, which if not stopped leads to \"wasting away\" called cachexia.* To prevent this from happening, eat the high energy foods recommended by Dr. Budwig. Consume plenty of raw food foods such as coleslaws, green salads and freshly squeezed juices. Also, daily expose as much of your body as possible to light and sun. Even if it is a cloudy day, lie outside, as some of the sun's rays will reach your body. Make your home an EMF free zone by turning off the internet at night and, if possible, the electricity in the room where you sleep. Use flaxseed oil as outlined in this guide. For patients fighting cachexia, the flaxseed oil enemas and oil pack massages would be essential. Daily sessions of positive EFT (Emotional Freedom techniques) would be very beneficial as well. There are special words to use in \"talking to your tumor\", which we provide with our Budwig programs. Highly Nutritional Meal Shake to combat Cachexia 1.5 cups rice milk or oat milk beverage 6 Tablespoons (British Dessertspoon) of protein powder (cold-processed whey powder) 1 small banana 2 teaspoons of virgin cold-pressed coconut oil 1 teaspoon of xylitol (from the Birch tree) or 1/8th of a teaspoon of Stevia Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend well. Chill before serving and take the following supplements with the shake. \u0001 12 tablets of chlorella \u0001 12 capsules of L-glutamine (amino acid) \u0001 12 capsules of L-leucine (amino acid) \u0001 3 soft gel Krill oil www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 22 - Do not put in the shake but drink these down with the shake Drink this combination at least once daily until the issue is resolved. Would 'fasting' help to detox and speed up the healing process? The basic answer is no. The body is already so depleted that it would not normally do well on a fast. For people in good health this is an effective tool. The Budwig Center's program includes a detox program using herbs to cleanse the liver, lungs, kidneys and intestinal tract. Coffee enemas are used to detox the liver. The food, juices and smoothies in the Budwig food plan will also help the body to cleanse, so no additional fasting/cleansing would be needed nor advised. How can I control Severe Pain that often comes with Cancer? Pain by some holistic doctors is considered a \"second stage\" and is actually a positive sign indicating recovery. Even as vomiting, headaches and diarrhea are often signs the program is having a positive effect. Here are some natural remedies for managing pain. Use a few of them and see which ones work on your type of pain. \u0001 Reset Resonator Sessions \u0001 TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) Therapy \u0001 EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) [recommended] \u0001 Earthing (or grounding) \u0001 Acupuncture and (administered at the (administered at the Budwig Center) \u0001 AcuGraph test will discover the imbalance in the 5 elements in Chinese medicine that lead to pain and the test will indicate which herbs will restore the balance \u0001 Baking Soda baths which alkalize the body \u0001 Coffee Enemas - harmful bacteria is a leading cause of pain \u0001 Flaxseed oil mixed with quark or cottage cheese (FO/CC) complemented by Eldi oil enemas, massages and oil packs Cherries \u0001 Kombucha (honey green tea Jun Kombucha) \u0001 Apple cider vinegar & honey: 1 - 8 oz glass of cool water 1 - cap full or apple cider vinegar 2 - Tsp of organic honey Stir well and sip. \u0001 Nutritional yeast: pain stemming from neuritis (inflammation of a nerve) may www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 23 respond quickly to nutritional yeast, a rich source of B vitamins (which are sometimes described as \"nerve food\"). \u0001 Essiac tea Hot chili pepper powder in water \u0001 Habanero peppers, garlic, ginger (see Habanero peppers plus garlic cancer treatment): In some cases when there is severe pain and nothing else works, this recipe has proven effective within minutes, providing 12-hour pain relief. \u0001 Vitamin B-3 (Niacin)-- 50 mg, up to 6 times per day \u0001 Amygdalin/Laetrile/Vitamin B17- relieves pain, nausea, & vomiting. Available in the form of ground apricot pits. Note: freshly ground flaxseeds, an essential part of the Budwig diet, are good sources of natural Vitamin B17. \u0001 MSM - 2 to 8 grams (2,000 to 8,000 milligrams) of MSM per day, in 2-3 divided dosages, depending on gastrointestinal tolerance. How can I avoid toxins and artificial chemicals? You can keep your house, body and clothes clean simply by using products such as white vinegar, baking soda, borax, and dish soap. There are plenty of suggestions on the Internet. Dr. Budwig recommended that her patients avoid toxins derived from chemical products such as household cleaning products, washing-up liquids, detergents, cosmetics made from chemical products, chemical hair dyes, smoke from any toxic source, cigarette smoke, etc. Avoid mercury amalgam dental fillings, any other metallic fillings, aluminum pots and pans, and other sources of heavy metal poisoning. Consume organic, natural food produce (no chemicals, additives, preservatives, pesticides, etc.), filtered or ionized water; use natural body-care products, herbal-based exfoliating creams, oatmeal peels and sea salt or sodium bicarbonate for brushing teeth and gargling. Why replace amalgam dental fillings? You probably know that mercury and silver dental fillings are unhealthy and should be replaced with non-metallic ceramic fillings or any made from some other natural or bio-compatible material. Unsuitable fillings can release small amounts of mercury into the body when ingesting hot liquids. Toxins from Amalgam fillings directly affect the breast, lymph and reproductive system. It is indispensable to have them replaced with a bio-compatible composite. The Budwig Center can recommend a highly qualified biological dentist. It is important to seek out a competent biological dentist that will use the proper composite fillings, i.e. glass and plastic ionomers, and gold foil. Contact the Budwig Center for arrangements to be made beforehand if you would like to have some mercury fillings removed during the two week clinical program. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 24 Why did Dr. Budwig recommend walking outdoors and sunbathing, even on cloudy or rainy days? Dr. Budwig made her patients sunbathe and take walks in the fresh air for 20 minutes a day, even on cloudy or rainy days. The sun\u00b4s source of vitamins strengthens the immune system, regulates blood pressure and helps balance cholesterol and pH levels in the body. This is why she wanted all her patients, even those in advanced stages of cancer, to benefit from this therapy. Sunbathing on the beach, on the banks of a river or by a lake is highly recommended (within the previously mentioned time frame of 20 min a day). Not only does this expose the body to the sun\u00b4s benefits, walking barefoot on sand or on grass helps to balance the immune system and our blood pressure. Thus, it is highly recommended to do this on a daily basis. On average, southern Spain has 325 sunny days a year, which makes it an ideal location for our Center. Patients can enjoy frequent walks on the beach, which is only 15 minutes away from our clinic. What precautions should I take when sunbathing? www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 25 Dr. Budwig was adamant that all her patients have daily sunbathing sessions with as little clothes on as possible. The sun is a source of vitamins, but we must be very careful when being exposed to the sun\u00b4s rays. When sunbathing, take note of the following precautions to avoid burns, heat exhaustion, and other damages to the skin, which could also evolve into skin cancer if exposed continuously and for long sessions. PRECAUTIONS: Avoid sunbathing between 12 noon and 4 pm. (Even though outside of these hours the sun rays are not as intense, sunbathing must still be done in moderation). Use hats or caps to protect your head. Do not use any sun protection that has harmful chemicals in them. If you only expose yourself for 20 minutes, no sun screen is needed. If you go fishing, skiing or some other outdoor activity that requires you to be a long time in the sun, use Shea butter (Karite). You can also make your own homemade sunscreen; http://www.keeperofthehome.org/2015/06/how-to-make-your-own- sunscreen-lotion.html Keep hydrating the body by drinking lots of water, or cold herbal tea (please see our chapter on teas) and ingesting fruit or salads. What exercise should I be doing? Dr. Budwig said: \"Each case should be studied individually, but I would never allow a Cancer patient or of any other serious illness to run, or cycle... The sick body needs a certain amount of rest.\" Having said that, and although in s evere cases rest is recommended, it is true that a certain amount of exercise is positive so as not to become too sedentary. As mentioned previously, the type of exercise, its intensity and duration, depend very much on each patient\u00b4s condition. www.BudwigCenter.com Generally speaking, a minimal exercise regime could be followed as long as the and the activities do not require Walking and Swimming: Everyone can do it and helping our heart and our body. these walks could last between 10 that ten minutes of brisk exercise trigger Deep Breathing : This can be done whoosh sound.

Dr. Budwig made sure her patients obtained natural Vitamin D by spending time outdoors every day. In reality, the Budwig Diet provides high amounts of omega-3, for which cod liver oil should not be required. Additionally, environmental toxins such as PCBs, fertilizers, mercury, lead, petroleum and others abound in the world's rivers and oceans. So fish oil is likely to contain dangerous contaminants which, apparently, only molecular distillation is able to completely remove. If you do use fish oil, you may wish to look for a product that is molecularly distilled under extreme vacuum (this allows the oil to \"boil\" at relatively low temperatures), as well as independently certified as being free of contaminants. Udo Erasmus (author of \"Fats That Heal, Fats That Kill\") agrees with this approach. Krill oil was not mentioned by Dr. Budwig when she talked about cod liver oil. It is one of the best natural foods for preventing excessive blood clotting, which can lead to strokes and heart attacks (a concern once you reach your 40's). This is a tiny shrimp-like creature that lives in the pristine waters of Antarctica. Krill feed on plankton floating on the ocean's surface and contain high amounts of beneficial omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, and much more absorbable. And because krill is at the bottom of the food chain, it does not accumulate mercury, unlike large fish species. The Flaxseed oil and Cottage cheese mix also helps prevent heart attacks and strokes. Why is it so serious to be constipated when fighting cancer? It is unhealthy for anyone to suffer from constipation, but it is actually dangerous when you are fighting cancer. The body is expelling countless dead microbes, toxins and debris. These need to be eliminated on a daily basis, otherwise you will suffer from 'autointoxication'. You can use 1 teaspoon of Castor oil every hour or 1 teaspoon of Epsom salts in a glass of juice every hour, until you get results. A water or coffee enema is also helpful. Does the FSOCC thin the blood, posing a problem if I get surgery? Some suffer from swelling and/or excessive bleeding after an operation. Flax oil does thin the blood somewhat; however, the Flaxseed oil's mild blood thinning quality should not be a serious matter unless you are on blood-thinning medication. In that case, you should make allowances for it. You need vitamin K, which is the natural blood clotting agent. You can get it from dark green leafy vegetables, especially Swiss chard and Kale. Is there any difference between golden and brown flaxseeds? Linseed and flaxseed are synonyms, both used to denote the seed of flax. As for golden or brown flaxseed, there is really no difference. Some go with their taste preference. You can use either one. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 28 Should I purchase flaxseed oil with added lignans? No, it is not recommended to purchase Lignan linseed (flaxseed) oil; it is best to purchase the regular flaxseed oil with no added lignans, as you will obtain these fresh when you add the ground up flaxseeds to the mixture. Purchasing oil with added lignans is not recommended because: the lignans are not fresh; it contains less omega-3 fats than regular flaxseed oil; and, tends to contain added antioxidants (which must be avoided according to Dr. Budwig). To keep the lignan particles afloat and in suspension, the flaxseed oil (with added lignans) needs to be repeatedly shaken or stirred, thus introducing more oxygen into the oil, which accelerates oxidation (rancidity). Should I avoid all fruits, juices, honey, etc., since sugar feeds cancer? Refined sugar is bad for you and is believed to feed cancer and causes a host of diseases. However, please understand that most natural foods - such as vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts - also contain carbohydrates, which are broken down into glucose (sugar) during digestion. Dr. Budwig made that clear that refined sugars (white refined sugar, cane sugar, maple syrup and so on) should not be consumed. She did allow berries, fruit and fruit juices because of their nutritional value (without specifying which ones). When consumed in reasonable quantities, most natural foods (including fruits) have a glycemic load that is low or average. The important thing is to have a balanced, healthy diet that will provide our body with the necessary energy and nutrition. Dr. Budwig did not make a hard rule about using honey for the Budwig mix; she simply stated that some 'may' be used. However, the flax oil/cottage cheese seems to mix better when honey is added. Only use non-pasteurized, raw honey because eating processed honey is like eating sugar. Stevia and xylitol (only use xylitol from Birch trees), figs, dates and raisins (note that the glycemic load of these three is higher than most fruits) as well as all fruits are acceptable sugar substitutes. How can I buy fresh flaxseed oil and keep it fresh? Yes, Flaxseed oil is fragile and needs to be handled properly. If you freeze flaxseed oil, it can last for approximately one year. Once opened, if you continue to keep it frozen it still should last for several months. You can keep it in the freezer all the time. Additionally, care should be taken not to subject flaxseed oil to more light than necessary when pouring it (e.g. try not to pour it in sunlight or under direct fluorescent or incandescent light; LED lamps are better). Why did Dr. Budwig have some patients consume champagne with flaxseeds? While Dr. Johanna Budwig did not prescribe alcohol f or every patient, she did for those whose energy level was very low (a maximum of 2-3 glasses a day with 1 tablespoon of freshly www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 29 ground flaxseeds added to each serving). That is not necessarily to be taken as a requirement, but rather as an option. Another option she used was a glass of fresh papaya juice with a tablespoon of ground linseeds. However, for the critically ill and brain tumor patients, she favored the flaxseed/champagne combination. French Champagne, Spanish Cava and sparkling wine (with no sugar added) all exert a positive influence on the intestinal environment. Their ethanol content is a great supplier of energy that is rapidly absorbed by the body, but which, unlike glucose, cannot be utilized by cancer cells. Ethanol thus is an optimal energy source for debilitated cancer patients and it does not feed the tumor. Ethanol additionally stimulates the appetite which typically will be near-absent in this kind of patient. Only use Cava that has these words on the label: \"Brut Nature\"; otherwise, you will probably get a product to which refined sugar has been added. How can I overcome nausea and vomiting? NOMETEX: This is a small device that you attach to the wrist which has no side effects http://www.chemoband.com/nometex-anti-nausea-band-for-chemotherapy.html Nausea : You may need to interrupt the program for a few day s if you get ill due to the die off of degenerative disease and tumor cells. So start the program gently and if you have a strong reaction, back off for 4 or 5 days if necessary. Ease off on all the remedies and follow some of the suggestions here: Peppermint tea: 2 teaspoons of dry peppermint leaves to 2 cups of water; boil and strain; add some Stevia and lemon juice if desired. If necessary, you can drink up to a gallon (4 Liters) of this tea in a 24 hour period if very sick (according to Dr. Gerson). It washes out the bile duct and duodenum, improving their function. glass (250ml) of w ater and sip on it throughout the day. This should relieve the symptoms. Nausea might have something to do with the gallbladder or the liver. Early signs of magnesium deficiency include: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, muscle contractions and cramps, seizures (sudden changes in behaviors caused by excessive electrical activity in the brain), personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms may occur. Severe magnesium deficiency can result in low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). Magnesium deficiency is also associated with low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Eat oatmeal: when weak and suffering from nausea. Try also raw grated carrots, apple sauce, mashed bananas, or watermelon. 'Gastrolyte' (available in drug stores): It comes in a packet to mix with water. It h ydrates, provides electrolytes and helps the stomach to settle. It is very similar to a www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 30 product for children called Pedeolyte. It is very light and easily tolerated by those who are very ill. Cloves : Chewing on a fresh clove will help. Another option is to take a 500 mg clove capsule 3 times a day with water. Clove essential oil - a few drops should stop vomiting and an infusion will relieve nausea. Ginger tea : Put the juice of a thumbnail size of fresh ginger i n hot water. Leave to infuse for 5 to 10 minutes; drink or sip the tea. You can also use 1 teaspoon of ginger powder in hot water, let sit for 5 minutes. Are coffee enemas a good idea? WARNING : Not recommended for liver c ancer patients or extremely thin and weak patients. Dr. Budwig did not use coffee enemas on her patients. She did, however, administer flaxseed oil enemas. Coffee enemas are one of the most effective ways to detoxify the liver and reduce pain. However, they are not recommended for long periods of time, as they deplete the body of minerals. It\u00b4s advisable to do the enema at the beginning of any liver detox treatment, preferably once a day for 3 weeks, after which you can reduce to twice a week. Chlorophyll enemas are also very rewarding (using \u00bc liquid chlorophyll diluted in water). Green tea or chlorophyll enemas are not as effective for detoxifying the liver, but an excellent option from time to time. As abnormal cells start to naturally die off, the body needs to purify itself to avoid self-poisoning. We recommend that you consult a specialist first in order to avoid side-effects. The caffeine absorbed into the enterohepatic circulation system through coffee enemas purifies the hepatic ducts (including the bile ducts) from toxins, and also cleanses the sigmoid colon. It is a low-volume enema that remains only in the sigmoid colon . There is a vein system between the sigmoid colon and the liver called the enterohepatic circulation system. When the stool reaches this point (the sigmoid colon), it contains many toxins, which are sent to the liver for detoxification. The coffee enema will increase the transit time in the bowel. The caffeine that is absorbed into the enterohepatic system causes the liver ducts, including the bile ducts, to empty out toxins (it actually causes the liver to \"vomit\" out toxins). Releasing the toxins into the hepatic ducts, makes room for toxins from the body to enter the liver for detoxification. The alkaloids in the caffeine stimulate the production of glutathione-S-transferase, which is an enzyme that facilitates the liver detoxification pathways. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 31 Coffee enemas are safe even for people who are sensitive to caffeine because the coffee remains in the sigmoid colon, where it will not be absorbed, provided the proper amount is used and the enema bag is not placed too high. You will need the following materials: \u0001 An enema bag or bucket, preferably one of clear plastic that you can see through \u0001 A coffee machine to make 3 cups of coffee for male adult (2 cups for child or woman of 50/60 kg) \u0001 A tea pot to make 2 or 3 cups of green tea \u0001 3 cups (3 x 250 mil) of pure water \u0001 Organic (if available), fully caffeinated, drip grind coffee \u0001 Use 2 cups of coffee if you weigh around 60 kg and 3 cups for people around 80 kg \u0001 Air mattress (especially if you are older or weak, you should lie on a soft air mattress, like ones used at the beach; cover with plastic and old towels) \u0001 A plastic or metal type filter to strain the coffee (do not use paper filters as they contain harmful chemicals) Procedure for Water Cleansing Enema \u0002 Pour 2 or 3 cups of pure water (the water will need to be preheated to body temperature) into the enema bag. Open the valve to allow the water to run to the end of the catheter tip to get rid of any air bubbles, then close the valve when all the air has been removed from the enema tube. \u0002 Use a coat hanger to hang the enema bag at least three feet above your back as you will be positioned on the floor on all fours. Maybe put the enema bag on a door knob or towel rack. Do not hang it too high, as on a shower head, because it will be too forceful and the hose will not reach. It should flow very gently into the rectum and sigmoid colon only. It is not a high enema or colonic cleanse. \u0002 Place yourself on all fours - like a dog or horse - on a thick towel or air mattress. Lubricate the end of the tube as well as the anus, and then gently insert the catheter into the rectum about 4 or 5 inches (10 cm). Use lubrication, such as food grade vegetable oil, olive oil, a vitamin E capsule, or KY jelly should be fine, unless you are chemically sensitive. It is generally a good idea to avoid petroleum products. \u0002 After gently inserting the tube into the rectum, open the valve, but not all the way , as this could be too much at one time and cause pain. Let the first 2 cups (500 ml) of water flow in slowly. Close the valve as soon as there is the slightest amount of discomfort or fullness. Do not change positions or use an incline board to cause the enema to enter further into the colon; this defeats the purpose of this type of enema. \u0002 You do not need to hold water in your body very long, as you would in the case of a colon cleanse. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 32 Procedure for the Coffee Enema \u0001 Put 4 cups (4 x 250 ml) of pure water into the coffee machine and use 4 tablespoons of coffee (organic if possible). 4 cups will probably yield about 3 cups of coffee due to evaporation. Do not use a paper filters, as they contain chemicals. Use a nylon or metal permanent filter or a coffee machine that uses no filters. \u0001 Allow coffee to cool down to a very comfortable, tepid temperature. Test with your finger . It should be the same temperature as a baby's bottle. It's safer to have it too cold than too warm; never use it hot or steaming; body temperature is acceptable. Some make the coffee extra strong and then add a little cold water to cool it down; but if you make the coffee well in advance , it will have time to cool down. If you cannot wait, put some ice cubes in to cool it down faster. \u0001 Now REPEAT the same procedure as with the water enema. Use old towels and, for greater comfort, use a pillow and bring along some appropriately relaxing literature. Try to hold the coffee inside your body for 15 minutes. Less time is fine but also less effective. Perhaps the first time it will be hard to hold for very long, but with practise you may be able to hold it longer. \u0001 When you have finished your session, rinse out the bag and tubes with boiling water or, better yet, hydrogen peroxide (agua oxigenada in Spanish) and hang it up to dry. If you feel wired or hyperactive, have palpitations or irregular heartbeats after a coffee enema, you should reduce the amount of coffee, usually by half for a few days or weeks. IMPORTANT : We only recommend doing coffee enemas with organic coffee . Also, be sure of the source of your water. It should be pure and clean, from a chemical-free spring or well, or filtered water. When is it advisable to do enemas with Flaxseed oil (Eldi oils)? Judging from her available German books published after 1968, it appears that Dr. Budwig used Eldi oils (the exact recipe seems to be lost) with nearly all her cancer patients, at least the serious cases (which most of her cases were). She also said linseed oil could be used instead of Eldi oils. Mixing 70% flaxseed oil with 30% Wheat Germ oil would give you a similar product to Eldi oil. There are now a number of other providers, including in the USA, who offer Eldi oils. Eldi oils are a central pillar of Dr. Budwig's treatment advice for very ill cancer patients who are very weak and/or unable to eat . Starting in 1968, she also added ruby laser treatments. FAR Infrared saunas would be a close match. Two times a day (i.e. morning and evening), rub Eldi oils into the skin over the whole body, a bit more intensely on the shoulders, armpits, breast www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 33 and groin (where the lymphatic vessels are) as well as the problem areas, such as the breast, stomach, liver, etc. Leave the oil on the skin for about 15-20 minutes and follow with a warm shower without using soap. Follow up with another shower, this time using a mild soap, and then rest for 15-20 minutes. The purpose of the shower, once the body has been oiled and the Eldi oils have penetrated the skin, is to allow the warm water to open the pores so the oils can penetrate the skin even more deeply. The second shower, where one washes with soap, cleanses the skin so that clothes and linen will not become overly soiled. Always use the Eldi oils in conjunction with the oil-protein diet (Budwig Diet) and do this consistently, even if it seems difficult at times. The oil-protein diet together with Eldi oils can be a helpful method to improve your health and overcome illnesses. Instructions for enemas using Eldi Oils -Time and frequency: Between 3 and 5 pm; once or twice daily, for 1 week (use your own judgment); then once a day for a week or until the patient recovers their energy and appetite. It is best to start with a water enema to cleanse the bowel (see instructions for water enema in this Guide, in the section about coffee enemas). Next heat 250 ml of flaxseed oil or Eldi Oils (flaxseed oil with wheat germ oil) in a bain-marie. Inject the lukewarm Eldi Oils into the rectum via irrigator, enema syringe or similar. Use long rubber tip if preferred. If possible, have the patient positioned with knees and elbows on the floor and buttocks slightly raised. Once all the oil has been absorbed, have the patient first lie on their right side for 15 minutes and then on their left for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. Be sure the patient has a comfortable surface to lie down on. NOTE: Dr. Budwig did not leave exact indications for enemas using Eldi oils (such as any particular symptoms that would suggest the patient needs it), but it is assumed that the enema was mainly used in very severe situations where the patient could not eat the flaxseed oil/cottage cheese (quark) mix. Instructions for applying Eldi Oil packs Take a piece of cloth made of pure cotton. Cut to fit the body part where you want to apply, such as the knee, breast, stomach, etc. Soak the cloth in the Eldi oils; place on desired area; cover the cloth with a plastic sheet and wrap it up with an elastic bandage. Leave on overnight. Remove in the morning and wash the area where it was applied. Repeat in the evening. Keep repeating the same procedure for several weeks. The oil pack is only suitable for local problems (but not when there is metastasis). www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 34 How can I do the Budwig program when I am traveling? In her Oil-Protein Diet Cookbook, Dr. Budwig wrote on page 175: \"While traveling, you can always care for yourself with Linomel and hot or cold milk, and/or fruit juices.\" She also recommended eating various types of fresh fish to temporarily replace the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese/quark when travelling. She writes: \"...you can protect yourself against harm while travelling by ordering fresh fish such as trout, pike, carp and other fresh fish. However, canned (tinned) fish, also shrimps, prawn and other items from the deli counter which frequently contain artificial coloring agents and harmful chemical preservatives, must be strictly avoided.\" (Credits: Healing Cancer Naturally) You can pack a small stick blender and coffee bean grinder (for the flaxseed), a mixing container, and some paper towels. Transport your flax oil and seeds in a small dark, insulated, airtight food storage glass or plastic container and upon arrival in your hotel room, store it in the fridge. When going out for a meal, ask for healthy menu items such as salads, baked potatoes, steamed vegetables etc. and in your small airtight food storage container, bring along your own flax oil/cottage cheese dressing made up in advance (but only a few hours in advance, as it should be as fresh as possible ). (Credits: Healing Cancer Naturally) Should I continue taking medication while on the Budwig Program? Since drug intake can jeopardize the healing effectiveness of the Budwig protocol, Dr. Budwig took patients off medication as soon as possible. However, please work with your local doctor on this matter as he/she monitors your progress. It is important to keep in mind that, at times, those who start with conventional medicine cannot wean off their medication easily due to their body seemingly needing certain drugs to help cope with serious symptoms or deficiencies. Which Scans are useful to detect cancer and tumors? When you want to know the level of active diseased cells and tumor activity, you need a PET/CT scan, and not a simple CT or MRI scan. When diseased tumor cells die, they may still show up on CT & MRI scans with no indication that they are dead. However, PET scans indicate whether diseased and tumor cells are dead or alive and whether cells are actively dividing and growing. Which foods can I eat to help gain healthy weight? The single most important nutrient for gaining healthy weight is protein. High-protein foods include organic free range chicken, fish and eggs . Also, consume the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese mixture twice a day . Protein supplements such as whey protein can be added to the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese mixture or to your smoothies as a temporary measure to gain weight. Be sure to use only cold filtered plain whey. Using spices, sauces and condiments can help with this. The tastier your food is, the easier it is to eat a lot of it. Nuts: Almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, etc. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu Page 35 Dried fruit: Raisins, dates, figs, prunes and others. Fats and Oils: Extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil. Eat a ripe avocado as a bedtime snack. Grains: Whole grains such as oats and brown rice. Tubers: Red Potatoes, sweet potatoes and yams. Dark chocolate (look for raw chocolate fudge recipe in the recipe section of this Guide), coconut milk, granola. Many of these foods are very filling, and sometimes you may need to force yourself to keep eating even if you feel full. It may be a good idea not to eat a ton of vegetables if gaining weight is a priority for you. It simply leaves less room for energy-dense foods. Eating whole fruit is fine, but eat fruit that does not require too much chewing, such as bananas. Why is skin brushing important? Skin brushing is a healthy practice in skin and body care. Soap only cleans the skin superficially and does not completely remove dead cells left on the skin, which can block pores and thereby, hinder the removal of toxins through perspiration (approximately a third of our body's toxins are eliminated through sweat). We recommend skin brushing once a week on every area that should require it, using strokes in the return direction of the circulatory system (towards the heart). 5 minutes or less is enough time to clean and care for our skin. Use a sponge made of a natural material. How did Dr. Budwig help patients who were weak and with liver cancer? French Champagne, Spanish Cava and sparkling wine (with no sugar added) all exert a positive influence on the intestinal environment. Their ethanol content is a great supplier of energy that is rapidly absorbed by the body, but which, unlike glucose, cannot be utilized by cancer cells. Ethanol thus is an optimal energy source for debilitated cancer patients, and it does not feed the tumor. Ethanol additionally stimulates the appetite, which, typically, will be near-absent in this kind of patient. Only use Cava that has these words on the label: \"Brut Nature\"; otherwise, you will probably get a product to which refined sugar has been added. I f a patient's liver is affected, they may need to be eased into the Budwig Diet with a transition diet. Dr. Budwig says in her 1977 book \"Der Tod des Tumors\" (The Death of the Tumor), p. 167: \"In liver and gall bladder disease we first only gave (ground) flaxseeds, i.e. Linomel for several days besides the regular diet. Only after a few days did we begin with the actual Oil/Protein Diet, for instance with 1 tablespoon quark (cottage cheese) mixed with 1 teaspoon flaxseed oil. We then gradually increased (it) depending on the severity of the case and on tolerance. The quick and beneficial effect of the Oil/Protein Diet is especially evident in such sick people.\" In her last book (1999) Cancer - The Problem and the Solution, p. 117, Dr. Budwig writes this: \" Diet Instructions to begin the Oil-Protein-Diet\" In addition she put them on the \"Transition Diet\". See more details in the Budwig Recipes www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 36 After the cancer has gone into remission, how long should one stay on the Budwig program? In Dr. [The Death of the Tumor Vol. 2], and \"Cancer - The Problem and The Solution\", she writes: \"With persons who previously suffered from cancer and who feel well again - having even lost their tumors and metastases - after strictly adhering to the oil-protein diet, I've observed the following: if they re-change their diet within the first months [after their recovery], such as by eating sausages and cold cuts or eating on a holiday whatever the usual hotel cuisine will serve, all of a sudden, their erythrocytes will be heavily re-infested by these 'cancerobes'.\" Usually by the time you are considered free of cancer, your taste buds and food choices have been permanently altered and you no longer desire harmful foods. Your mind and body together will reject them as you know how dangerous they can be. This will make it easier to follow the basic Budwig food plan for the rest of your life to maintain optimum health and prevent cancer from returning. If a person on a rare occasion were to eat a small portion of sugary pastries, ice cream, or some deep fried food, etc., this would not be serious, however the important thing is to never go back to the unhealthy food choices of before that caused the cancer in the first place. It would seem that when a person has had cancer once, they will always have an increased susceptibility to develop cancer in the future. For this reason, one must be careful for at least 3 years, although we recommend 5 years. In reality, all of us should be eating according to the Budwig food plan to maintain good health and prevent cancer. It is not a difficult food plan to follow. Is there really any better way to live, then a plan that makes you feel full of energy and life, and helps you avoid a host of health issues? Once you lose your good health, it is hard to enjoy much of anything. The Budwig Center recommends that you continue eating the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese at least once a day, twice a day is even better. Detoxify the body on a regular basis (e.g. with an ionic foot detox, once a week would be recommendable) and have FAR Infrared saunas once a week, continue doing Resonator sessions once a week to destroy any new cancer microbes as well as a host of other harmful pathogens. Daily 20 to 30 minute walks and jumping on the rebounder, along with lots of positive experiences, spending happy times with friends and family. It is highly advised to have regular sessions of EFT (Tapping) to deal with new or old negative emotional issues. Laughing with friends and watching comedy movies, as well as singing, all exert a strong healthy influence on the body. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 37 Which other therapies were recommended by Budwig Center? Dr. Budwig writes in her book \"Der Tod des Tumors (Bd. 2)\" [The Death of the Tumor, Vol. 2], on page 143, on the subject of self-help and treatments she endorsed: \"What other therapeutic measures are advisable, permitted, recommended? I always reply: Everyone should do what they can - cold water treatments, hyperthermia, homeopathy, phytotherapy (herbs), even psychotherapy, or sometimes even surgical intervention depending on the situation. Dr. Budwig herself encouraged patients to proactively employ other personally helpful natural and holistic treatment modalities, thus recognizing that an active stance may be required to optimally support and enhance the self-healing process of the physical body, and that the whole person, or body/mind, may need to be addressed and engaged in this venture. Dr. Budwig's philosophy was not about destroying cancer cells, per se, but more the approach of destroying the microbes and pathogens that are in the cell. In doing so, the cancer cell then reverts back to a normal healthy cell or, if they are too damaged, they will naturally die and leave the body. Therefore, the Budwig Center only uses therapies and remedies that are in harmony with her approach. Recommended therapies include Phytotherapy (100% natural herbal compounds). To determine which treatment is right for each patient, we start by performing a VEGA TEST, which allows us to get insight into the patient's specific needs. Colon Hydrotherapy (internal irrigation), homeopathy (medication with natural components), Acupuncture, Electromagnetic and low current Frequency Generator sessions, Saunas (FAR Infrared), psychotherapy (guided imagery, positivity, eliminate trauma, visualization), as well as other techniques to improve living processes, ranging from simple techniques like massage and reflexology to E.F.T. (Emotional Freedom Technique). www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 38 Therapies available at the BUDWIG CENTER Our staff at the Bu dwig Center consists of two Medical Doctors, an Oncologist, a registered Nurse, two certified Naturopaths, two psychotherapists, a VEGA test Expert therapist, which all together can provide several effective Budwig approved therapies that are outlined here in our Guide Since Dr. Budwig passed away, numerous studies and investigations have been carried out to find new types of therapies and remedies for cancer, tumors, chronic and degenerative diseases. We carefully analyze each one and select those that do not conflict with Dr. Johanna Budwig\u00b4s original concept and approach to cancer. Psychotherapy, Psycho emotional Therapy pair and Kinesiology Testing www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 39 The Biomagnetic Pair is a technique developed by the Mexican Doctor Isaac Goiz. In this therapy, pairs of magnets are set in strategic places on the body to modify the pH and treat many diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungus and parasites. It is a wonderful help to treat a great variety of illnesses in a natural way. This therapy hardly ever causes negative side-effects. It is easy to apply to achieve amazing results. It cannot destroy tissues or spread infections, nor leave chemical waste. Within this therapy there is a section devoted to treat emotions. This is called \"Psycho- emotional Pair\". According to Eastern Medicine, emotions are vibrations that can be stored in different organs according to their nature, thus emotions such as sadness and depression can be stuck in the lungs, anger and rage in the liver and gallbladder, disappointment and bitterness in the pancreas, emotions associated to finances and the material world can be located in the colon or intestines. Kinesiology testing Using a testing technique called Kinesiology (Involuntary Muscle Movement Testing Technique) we can locate harmful emotions stored in many parts of the body. Once we place the suitable pole of the magnet in each location on the body, so that we have both positive and negative poles placed in pairs, negative emotions are removed as vibrations, resulting in a return to balance. After every treatment you feel a great sensation of lightness and relaxation, just like after having had a great massage. This helps to unblock and release the trapped emotions. After every session we can only feel peace and wellbeing. Each negative emotion is like an electromagnetic unbalance expressed by the body with certain micro-electrical emissions, meaning that every negative emotion will cause a physical alteration which will be manifested in organs, glands, tissues and systems. Eventually, our immune system will be weakened, leaving the body exposed to many infections and even cancer activity. Emotional states such as stress, depression, anxiety, and others like these are accumulated in the body, changing its biological terrain, making it acidic, oxidized, causing the adrenal glands to secrete more cortisol and adrenaline, and forcing healthy cells to change their inner program. All this results in unexpected results for our health. By treating our trapped emotions, once they are detected and located, we can set them free with this technique to improve our quality of life, prevent and treat psychosomatic disorders. This technique gives us the chance to reestablish our balance bio-energetically, by dissolving the emotional blockages, thus positively affecting the flow of energy. This therapy, when applied regularly, can help to prevent many ailments since it can treat all different psycho- physical levels, avoiding the activation of genetic predispositions to certain type of illnesses. EFT - EMOTIONAL FREEDOM TECHNIQUE THERAPY (Also known as \"Tapping\") www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 40 The Budwig Center emphasizes combining natural therapies and treatments with emotional therapy. So many studies confirm the link between a person\u00b4s physical condition and their emotional state or morale. Depressive or negative states can affect our immune system, lowering our defenses and, as a consequence, leave us more vulnerable to all types of pathogens. A serious negative emotional shock (family or work related) over time can trigger a serious illness, and can even facilitate tumors, cancer or another degenerative disease. Bio-decoding consists of guiding the patient to identify the negative emotions linked to the symptom or symptoms of the illness, so as to locate it and decode it. This encourages the patient to free this emotion and therefore address the root of the disease. When a patient is mentally prepared for this type of self-examination it becomes easier to understand some of the reasons causing illness and identify the most effective way to fight it. Some patients do not understand this type of therapy, so our team of specialists will help them to identify the important link between our thoughts, feelings, and our health. At the Budwig Center, we use EFT therapy : Emotional Freedom Technique , as well. Patients visiting our clinic for clinical program treatments can request an EFT session and an hour and a half session of Par Psycho-Emotional therapy, which is a kinesiology test to treat emotions with magnets. There is also a group session of psycho-immunotherapy, which stimulates the immune system through visualization and Neurolinguistic programming. One of the advantages of these sessions is that, as well as being treated, you are also given instructions to be able to follow the treatment in the comfort of your home. This knowledge is a truly valuable tool. And for patients who request more of these therapies, our psychotherapist is available to provide sessions using other techniques such as the Test of Great Symbols, which consists in identifying trauma and blockages from the past with the objective of decoding them. The mind-body connection: It is indispensable to keep both our body and mind balanced. Emotional therapy helps to re-balance that connection. Combined with other treatments and therapies, patients will improve their state of mind, which in turn will directly lead to an improvement in one's health. It\u00b4s also important to be aware of sensitive areas or \"Tapping points\". Within EFT, each tapping point relates to a specific area or organ in the body. Stimulating these centers with www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 41 the appropriate techniques notably enhances the immune system\u00b4s responses as well as the body\u00b4s general well-being. In the book \" COURAGE AND WISDOM IN A TIME OF NEED \" (which you receive with your Home or Clinical program), in the last chapter, EFT is explained in further detail. A link is provided to a web page with MP3 downloads. You will gain more insight into EFT from top professionals around the world. View EFT as your personal coach who helps you stay positive and focused during your time of recovery. The BUDWIG CENTER strongly encourages spending at least 5 minutes (more is better) every day of your life dwelling on positive thoughts. Following this routine you will start to see a shift in your entire outlook and overall well-being. There are EFT (Tapping) therapists now in most parts of the world. We would encourage you to get a session or two in order to understand how it works and feels. Simply search online for \"EFT Tapping Therapists\" in your area. You may find there are several therapists to choose from. After studying the EFT material - and once you have had a session or two - you will be ready to continue the daily routine alone. To demonstrate the power of the mind- body connection, let me tell you about an experience of three men unloading a freezer truck. The young man in the freezer area was making fun of the other two young lads to whom he was passing boxes. Finally, when he passed them the last box they quickly closed the door on him and said: \"You can freeze to death you looser\". The man in the truck yelled and banged on the door but he heard their voices fade as they left him all alone in the freezer. The next morning they came and opened the door to the freezer truck and the man was curled up in a ball, he was dead. The strange thing was, they had turned off the freezer unit and it was warm in the truck. They could not understand how he died. The conclusion of the police was that the young man thought he was going to freeze to death and so he did. These thoughts had an incredibly powerful force on his mind. The lesson is this: your brain leads your body; think positive; think that your body will heal; tell your brain to heal your body, and it will. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 42 As it's been well said, it's not always what happens to us that is the most important but how we react to what happens. We can use the challenge to learn and grow, or we can decide that life is not fair and become bitter! To a large degree it's up to us. We have all heard the expression \"You are what you eat\". Another truism is: \"You are what you think \". Day after day your thought patterns will eventually be your manner, your personality and how you come across to others. Every emotion is preceded by a thought ! When experiencing difficult times, do not give up or give in. Stay positive! Think positive! The brain runs the body. If we let our brain think negative ideas day after day, then that message will be transmitted to our body. \"Men often become what they believe themselves to be. If I believe I cannot do something, it makes me incapable of doing it. But when I believe I can, then I acquire the ability to do it even if I didn't have it in the beginning\" - Gandhi We need to control what we think. When we control our thoughts we have achieved the highest level of 'emotional maturity'. It is neither wise nor healthy to let our minds run wild thinking whatever it wants for as long as it wants like some spoiled, undisciplined child! So chase away those negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. Even if you simply do not feel happy or positive at some moment, tell yourself you are happy and laugh out loud, simply do whatever you can to think in a happy and positive manner and in a short while this attitude will help you to feel happy. Sometimes humming or singing a song you like helps switch off negative thoughts. We start to feel much better when we learn to let negative thought patterns go and focus on things that are encouraging. See the power of the mind over the body. Watch this YouTube presentation of a man nicknamed the \"Ice Man\", who can swim in a glacial lake so cold that it would kill a normal person. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUQwFZ_xFdM Every patient that enrolls in one of Home Distance or Clinical programs will receive the Budwig EFT Guide, which also includes MP3 downloads and course instructions. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 43 Hyperthermia therapy Hyperthermia therapy is a treatment whereby an artificial fever is induced into the body or to the area to be treated. The tumor cells are intolerant to high temperatures, so the hyperthermia treatment elevates the body\u00b4s temperature to around 43\u00baC, thus blocking the harmful cells and potentially destroying them altogether. Hyperthermia in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiotherapy increases the impact of both of these therapies, improving recovery and considerably reducing treatment time. Fever is the body\u00b4s defense mechanism that is activated when a physical anomaly caused by a pathogen is detected. This mechanism raises the body\u00b4s temperature to remove the threat and restore normality. In speeding up the metabolism, fever suppresses the spreading of the viral or bacterial invasion. Hyperthermia is a therapeutic procedure that raises the cancerous tumors' temperature to at least 42.20 C (108\u00baF) for one hour. Cancerous cells are blocked and killed at 42.2\u00baC (108 \u00ba F) without damaging healthy cells. There are several other methods to induce a rise in body temperature: total immersion in hot water, ultrasound, and sauna, to name a few. Hyperthermia combined with low doses of radiation is an effective treatment for many types of Cancer. Another very positive aspect of Hyperthermia is the lack of side-effects. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 44 Benefits of hyperthermia : 1. Removing accumulated toxic chemicals that may cause cancer or other critical illness. 2. Improving blood circulation, so that tissues are better oxygenated and therefore aiding elimination of acid waste. 3. Weakening or even killing cancerous cells, due to their heat intolerance. The Vega test The Vegatest method is based on the principles of electro-acupuncture according to Voll. The VEGA Test EXPERT assesses your condition to pinpoint the source of your health issues. Designed and made in Germany, the device helps to find the origin of what is causing health issues, while also recommending the best treatment for each individual. Our equipment verifies every aspect of your health; the greater organs (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, etc.), the spine, teeth, tendons, muscles, hormones, etc. as well as possible parasites, virus, harmful bacteria, fungus, or toxins affecting the organs. The body works as a whole, and very often when conventional testing (physical or biochemical) does not give any clear answers as to what is causing the disease in a patient; it may be that the illness is of a functional nature, not morphological. The VEGA Test discloses a high number of underlying causes of illnesses, which would otherwise be difficult to detect, as well as www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 45 diseases with common symptoms such as migraines, back ache, fatigue, general and localized pain and sleep disorders. Phytotherapy (Herbal and Plant Based Formulas) Phytotherapy (treatment using medicinal plants), is an important part of our program. Always be aware that Phytotherapy is more effective when used in conjunction with a comprehensive treatment, since ingesting medicinal plants on their own for specific healing purposes may have no relevant effect on the illness. A thorough patient study must be first undertaken to determine which treatment is suitable for that person, to establish the correct dosage, and to identify which active ingredients can be used in each case. Many plants have characteristics, substances or extracts suitable for treating different illnesses like cancer, tumors and other major diseases. Pharmacology also employs active ingredients from plants, but in most cases, instead of using them in their natural state, they are synthesized and later combined with other substances. CHINESE MEDICINE and HERBS The VEGA test also works with the five elements in Chinese medicine and the appropriate herbs will be recommended to treat any imbalance that is discovered. The Five Elements in Chinese medicine, - which are Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 46 - when out of balance cause a host of health issues. Selected herbs will balance these 5 elements. The VEGA test is best combined with standard medical tumor marker tests (PET scans, blood tests, etc.). The Home Program B, C and Clinical programs include the VEGA test along with all the instructions. Infrared sauna therapy (FIR) Infrared Sauna Therapy FIR is also available at The Budwig Center. One of the most effective methods to detoxify the body of heavy metals and other harmful elements is the Infrared Sauna therapy (FIR). At the Budwig Center, all our apartments are equipped with a mobile sauna unit (dome style), and we recommend that all our patients acquire one for daily use at home. Perspiration and fever are the body\u00b4s natural way of eliminating toxins. The benefit of Infrared Sauna Therapy (FIR) lies in engineering high temperatures to stimulate perspiration, and through sweating our body is capable of eliminating a significant amount of toxins. The detoxing effect is so great that it also helps strengthen the immune system. The idea is to raise the body\u00b4s temperature between 41- 45\u00baC (107-113\u00baF). Sweat generated under normal conditions or in a conventional steam sauna contains 97% water and 3% toxins. The sweat secreted while in the Infrared Sauna FIR is composed of between 80-85% water and 15-20% toxins! The BUDWIG CENTER places great emphasis on the need to detoxify the body and remove the accumulation of potentially carcinogenic and damaging heavy metals like lead, mercury, zinc, nickel, cadmium, as well as alcohol, nicotine, sodium, suluric acid, copper, aluminum, pesticide residues, petroleum-based toxins, chlorides, fluoride, fats and cholesterol. Drink lots of purified water during each thermotherapy sauna session. CAUTION: Saunas may not be recommended for women with inflammatory www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 47 breast tumors and fluid retention (ascites), as the sauna increases lymphatic swelling and lymphedema, which raises CA 15-3 levels. Avoid saunas if it causes redness or swelling. During the medical consultation, the doctor may advise you whether this therapy is recommended in your case. Colon hydrotherapy or Colonic irrigation Colon hydrotherapy or Hydro-colon therapy is a therapy requiring specialized equipment, and ours is one of the most efficient machines available today. Colonplus is the latest in technology and innovation. Frequency and side-effects: This type of therapy should be supervised by a docto r or a specialist. Do not try to acquire the equipment for home use. Colon Hydrotherapy should only be administered occasionally for the removal of residue and other intestinal waste. Our program includes 1 session, as this type of therapy is only for preventive purposes and to eliminate residue that could harm the body. This therapy is suitable for people with: Skin problems: acne, eczema, dermatosis, etc. bloating, obesity. arthritis, rheumatism, www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 48 Other problems: depression, insomnia, stress, headaches, degenerative diseases, low defense system, varicose veins, rhinitis and general allergies. What is colon hydrotherapy or Hydro-colon therapy? C olon hydrotherapy is the irrigation of the large intestine using an infusion of filtered and purified warm water inserted into the rectum through a tube. This procedure is pain-free, relaxing and harmless. The machine has a double tubing system: one for irrigation and the other for waste disposal. The equipment steadily maintains the liquid\u00b4s temperature and flow so that fecal matter, along with any other waste that may be on the intestinal walls, can be removed from the body. We recommend this therapy because the storage of decaying fecal matter, toxins and other organic waste in our body can contribute to different types of disease. This therapy is not recommended if any of the following applies in your case: Recent surgery to the large intestine or rectum Diverticulosis Pregnancy of 3 months or more Anal fissures and fistulas Intestinal bleeding or ulcers Abdominal hernia Serious heart disease or high blood pressure Kidney failure For any further enquiries relating to this therapy, please do not hesitate to contact our specialists who will be happy to answer your questions. Therapeutic massage: JADE Thermo massage www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 49 All of our organs are connected to the spine. The Jade thermo massage bed is designed to stimulate the key points of our backbone. The right pressure on those key points, the stimulation to the spine, the chiropractic function, and the infrared-generated heat, all provide endless benefits. This type of massage treats the nervous system, helps reduce stress and muscle strain, improves blood circulation and increases energy levels. Our clinic recommends all our patients to take special care of the spine. Benefits of Jade Thermo Massage: Reduces stress levels, relieves fatigue, relaxes joints, increases energy levels and rejuvenates the body Stimulates the immune system, improves blood circulation and detoxifies the body Reduces and removes back pain (depending on their physical condition, a patient may require several sessions) Increases lymphatic capacity and reduces blood pressure Helps with aortic sclerosis and reduces spine swelling Aids digestion, reduces water retention and improves sleep All organs will noticeably improve in performance Not recommended if any of the below applies in your case: 1. Very high blood pressure 2. Herniated disc (slipped disc) or protrusion 3. Tumors anywhere on the back 4. Acute osteoporosis 5. Pregnancy 6. Acute swelling 7. Hemorrhage or bleeding 8. Patients with pacemakers 9. Fractures anywhere on the back 10. Any type of steel or titanium rods or pins in the back due to corrective surgery www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 50 Reflexology This therapy involves stimulating and applying pressure to selected points on the feet, which are believed to be reflective of the main organs. Zones and reflex areas relevant to each patient are targeted in order to re-establish and normalize bodily functions. A profound state of relaxation ensues, activating bodily processes and defense mechanisms. During your 1-2 week stay at the clinic, you will receive instructions on how to administer your own reflexology session in the areas corresponding to the affected organs. Your companion can also watch the demo if she or he is willing to apply the technique. You will also receive Lemongrass essential oil (to be diluted and mixed with a cold pressed oil such as sunflower, olive or extra virgin coconut oil; the ratio would be: 20% lemongrass, 80% - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 51 Lemongrass essential oil is known for its stress and anxiety relieving properties as well as for its effectiveness in treating insomnia and other common ailments such as headaches and stomach aches. It is therefore highly recommended for a full body massage and in this case, reflexology. If you require further information about the benefits of essential oils, please see page 36. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 52 NATURAL PRODUCTS RECOMMENDED BY THE BUDWIG CENTER DETOXIFICATION and CLEANSING We start you off with a 3-week herbal detox program that cleanses the liver, lungs, kidneys and intestinal tract. It is important to start off with cleansing and detoxification. One would never paint over the walls of their house or spray paint their car without first removing dust and dirt. For all our natural remedies to work best, the first step is a total body cleanse. Amalgam fillings contain mercury, which is the second most toxic substance on planet Earth. Arrange to have a biological dentist change these. There is a very good, affordable biological dentist just a few minutes away from our Clinic, whom we highly recommend. To start our 3-week detox program, we recommend a coffee enema every day for the first 3 weeks. Full instructions are provided in our BUDWIG GUIDE. Additionally, we provide you with natural herbal detoxification remedies to cleanse the digestive system, as well as the liver, kidneys, and lungs. Following are the various aspects that are covered during the first month. Liver Detox & Support : The liver performs some 3000 functions per day and n eeds to be supported and detoxified on a regular basis. You will receive herbal formulas that help cleanse the liver of toxins, improve hepatobiliary function, as well as treat acute and chronic hepatitis and gallstones. Lung Detox & Support: We use a natural product containing essential oils (thyme a nd pine) of the highest quality and propolis extract to cleanse and support the lungs and respiratory system. Candida Control: Candida Albicans is actually at the root of many health problems. The Budwig Center has a very effective homeopathic formula that addresses all 20 strains of the fungus. The following symptoms are related to fungus and candida: constant fatigue, recurring sinus infections, irritability, anxiety, allergies, panic attacks, feeling unduly stressed, moody or depressed, lack of focus, headaches, post-nasal drip, rashes, eczema, digestive issues, (bloating, gas, heartburn, acid reflux, cramping), fibromyalgia, pain in your joints, irritable bowel syndrome, oral or vaginal thrush, athlete's foot, jock itch, rectal itching, colitis eye floaters, eye sensitivity to sunlight, dairy intolerance, and cataracts. Candida albicans are tiny yeast organisms, which are very harmful and are responsible for issues that affect almost every system in our body. In the medical world, it is not easily diagnosed. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 53 Simple Home Saliva Test: Try this simple test to see if you have Candida. First thing in the morning, before you put ANYTHING in your mouth, get a clear glass of water. Work up a generous amount of saliva, then spit it into the glass of water. Check the water every 15 minutes or so for up to one hour . If you have a Candida yeast infection, you will see strings (like legs) traveling down into the water from the saliva. You will also see the \"cloudy\" saliva sink to the bottom of the glass, or cloudy specks will seem to be suspended in the water. If there are no strings and the saliva is still floating after at least one hour , you are probably Candida yeast free . If your saliva falls to the bottom of the glass you have advanced Candida overgrowth. The Budwig Center, using the Vega testing device, finds the right natural remedy for the fungus or mold present in each patient's body. Our program also includes a homeopathic formula specifically designed for treating Candida infections. It is estimated that 90% of the world's population suffers from Candida to some degree. Most people with Cancer have Candida overgrowth . Did you know that the average person has about four pounds (approximately two kilograms) of microorganisms living in their intestinal tract? A healthy person has around 80-85% beneficial organisms and only about 15-20% harmful. If you regularly consume processed foods, take antibiotics, birth control pills, steroids, or are exposed to heavy metals (such as amalgam fillings in the teeth), chlorinated water, pesticides, and other environmental toxins, the result is that good bacteria is destroyed and bad bacteria flourishes. As they spread, they release large amounts of harmful substances into our intestinal tract. The consequence is a compromised immune system; we are left more susceptible to a Candida infection. If left untreated, Candida can develop long, stringy structures called rhizoids that are able to burrow through the intestinal walls. Once in the bloodstream, Candida can spread all throughout the body, compromising the following systems: digestive, circulatory, respiratory, endocrine, nervous, excretory, reproductive, and immune. It is well known that a yeast cell produces over 75 known toxic substances that poison the human body. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 54 Kidney detoxification and support: This is attained using an astringent herb that has a diuretic action. It has an affinity with the urinary tract and can be used to soothe inflammation, hemorrhaging, cystic ulceration, ulcers, cystitis, as well as treat infections. Detoxification and support of the digestive system: During the first month of the program, we work on removing toxins such as heavy metals (mercury, cadmium, lead, and aluminum), as well as chemicals and impurities from the gut, skin, and mouth. Antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal treatment, using a natural source of iodine : Dr. David B rownstein MD stated: \"Although there are many natural items that provide such wonderful effects for the body, one nutrient stands head and shoulders above the rest \u2014 iodine. In all my years of practicing medicine, I have yet to see one item provide such miraculous effects on the body as iodine does\" . Dr. Brownstein specializes in thyroid issues (energy, weight loss or gain). After testing his patients he discovered that over 95% of them were deficient in iodine . Many of his patients have seen 3, 4 or more specialists (endocrinologists) who cannot figure out their health issues, specifically the thyroid. All cells in the body need iodine for proper functioning. Dr. Brownstein believes that iodine deficiency is a major cause of breast cancer and other diseases of the reproductive organs such as ovarian, uterus and prostate cysts and cancers. Body Detox and nutrition with Spirulina: This is a wonderful plant in the form of blue- g reen algae, which springs from warm, fresh water bodies. The benefits include: preventing sniffling and sneezing, reinforces your immune system, helps control high blood pressure and cholesterol, and helps protect you from cancer. Additionally, this potent detoxifier provides 20% more protein than meat . Boosting the Immune System with Homeopathic Formulas www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 55 There are 4 main causes of cancer and most other dis eases. A weak and compromised immune system is one of the principal factors that lead to illness and chronic diseases. Nearly everything that goes wrong with us can be traced directly to an immune system failure. Our immune system is often compromised by stress, being overworked or run down, trauma and unhealthy lifestyles. Daily our immune system suffers attacks from toxic viruses, bacteria, and parasites. In fact, 30% of parasites live in our digestive systems, while the other 70% live in our blood, all organs including the brain, and even in our eyes and sinus cavities. There are over 1,000 types of parasites that can live in the human body. The Budwig Center uses a skillfully crafted homeopathic combination that is taken for a minimum of 7 months and greatly enhances the immune system. It was developed by Dr. Gilbert Gladys MD. When the immune system is working at optimum levels it will successfully destroy harmful microorganisms. You simply open each capsule, put the homeopathic contents under your tongue and hold for 30 seconds so it releases into the blood stream. Here is a description of what this homeopathic formula can do: Angiogenesis Inhibitors : Prevents the growth of new blood vessels around canc er cells. Under the microscope, you can see hundreds of these brown-stained blood vessels and capillaries that are feeding cancer cells, bringing oxygen and nutrients . Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts. About 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers, and virtually 100 percent of us, by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid. Yet, without a blood supply to them, most of these cancers will never become dangerous. When functioning properly, our body can control angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from feeding cancers. Apoptosis: It is estimated that the average adult has some 70 trillion cells. Every day, between about 60 billion cells die due to apoptosis (natural cell death) and are replaced by new healthy ones. Cancer cells have a sinister ability to avoid natural cell death and are almost immortal . Our Homeopathic Apoptosis Formula induces the natural cell death of these rogue diseased cancer cells. DNA Repair : In order to prevent the 60 billion normal cells that our body creates daily from mutating into diseased cancer cells, DNA Repair stimulates the natural formation of healthy cells. Oncogenesis: Our body makes copies of our cells, like a high-spee d photocopy machine. New cells make copies of old cells along with their DNA, whether good or bad. The Oncogenesis Homeopathic Formula provides the correct genetic information to the cells www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 56 during their reproduction to inhibit them from producing more diseased copies of themselves. Stem Cells Regulation: Provides additional support to prevent unhealthy dis eased cells from creating more impaired copies of themselves . The homeopathic Stem Cells Regulator is designed for this purpose. Metastasis : Cancer reaches a more critical stage when it spreads to other parts of our body (metastasis). The Metastasis Formula is designed to prevent and slow down metastasis . ESSENTIAL OILS For essential oils to retain their highest quality, the plant must be steam distilled with water, and no chemical products must be used in the process. Depending on each plant, they must also comply with specific norms, such as temperature, pressure and distillation time, in order to guarantee a complete essential oil. The quality standards are followed for these procedures: 1. Growth and collection. 2. Selection of source. 3. Specific standards in distillation. It is largely thanks to essential oils that virus, bacteria, fungus and parasites cannot live and reproduce. Essential oils are more potent than some herbs and food, which is why they are so important in our anti-Cancer program. It\u00b4s also important to vary the essential oils on a weekly www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 57 basis so that the evolving abnormal cells don\u00b4t become resistant to the specific characteristics of a particular essential oil, making it less effective. At the Budwig Center, we have prepared 4 different formulas under rigorous investigation. These are prepared in optimum proportions to obtain the best results. Each formula is to be taken for one week. AHCC AHCC is especially recommended for chemotherapy patients, and is to be included in the daily diet. Chemotherapy is very aggressive for the body and among other effects, significantly runs down the immune system. AHCC strengthens the immune system in order to better assimilate chemotherapy (in the case of those who choose to undergo chemotherapy) while reducing the adverse effects to our body. AHCC is an immune stimulant nutritional supplement used worldwide, with very positive results. This compound is not made from regular mushrooms found under normal conditions. AHCC is made in a laboratory in Sapporo, Japan . It\u00b4s a hybrid of the Shiitake and other medicinal mushrooms known for their great health benefits. The effectiveness of this new compound has been proven both on its own and in conjunction with other therapies. Another important AHCC feature is that it does not present side effects. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 58 ASTRAGALUS (Astragalus membranaceous) - Reduces side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. Astragalus membranaceous is another natural product recommended by the Budwig Center, suitable for patients going through chemotherapy or radiotherapy. This natural supplement is outstanding for the following reasons: Stimulates the immune system. Benefits liver function. It can also be used on Hepatitis patients CHLOROPHYLL www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 59 When the red blood cell count is low or there is a shortage of healthy red blood cells, we are at risk of developing anemia. To help create new red blood cells and improve blood oxygenation, take \u00bd a glass of liquid Chlorophyll every day. Red blood cells will increase in a few days. Combine with eating chard, broccoli, artichoke, dandelion, lambs lettuce, endive, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, green beans, green pepper, green asparagus and fruit (kiwi, avocados and some types of seaweed). One of the most interesting aspects of chlorophyll is how closely it resembles our blood, more specifically, our hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in our red blood cells that carries oxygen from our lungs to different parts or our body. A Budwig Center patient in need of an operation was told by the doctors that her red blood cell count was too low to be able to operate. She drank \u00bd glass of chlorophyll each day and in three days she was back to normal and the operation went ahead. The hemoglobin in our red blood cells and the chlorophyll in plants are virtually identical in molecular structure. Photosynthesis is the process that converts solar energy, water, and carbon dioxide into our main fuel source: glucose. All animals, human beings, and plant life obtain their supply of energy through photosynthesis. Certain drugs can be given (your doctor can recommend which ones would be recommendable in your case). For example Epoetin stimulates red blood cell production, Thrombopoietin stimulates platelet production, and G-CSF stimulates the bone marrow to produce granulocytes (white blood cells) and stem cells. On the other hand, hemostatic agents can be given to control minor bleeding. You may also want to look into stem cell transplant to replenish healthy cells destroyed by chemotherapy. Vitamin deficiency and anemia: In addition to iron, your body needs folate (folic acid) and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Bee Pollen is rich in B vitamins. GINGER www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 60 Ginger enables and improves blood circulation. That is why it is great for the cardiovascular system. It can prevent heart attacks, angina, and other heart conditions. It has excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It improves the digestive system, (preventing ulcers and gastritis, improving intestinal flora, eliminating harmful microbes), is effective against dizziness, morning sickness, and can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. Ginger is an excellent source of carbohydrates and is rich in fiber. It contains protein (albeit in small quantities), minerals such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron and vitamins A, C, B1, B2, B6 and E, among others). Ginger is one of the healthiest foods in the world, and can be consumed freshly grated, dried, or in tea. BEE POLLEN Bee pollen contains large amounts of minerals, vitamins, protein and carbohydrates, and contains all the necessary ingredients for a balanced diet. This \"perfect food\" contains twenty-two nutrients needed by the human body, including all the Vitamin B complexes, vitamin C, D, E, K, and Beta Carotene (vitamin A), as well as several minerals, enzymes and coenzymes, plant-derived fatty acids, and amino acids. Amongst its benefits are the following: Excellent restorative properties for different deficiencies, weakness or physical exhaustion. Recommended as part of a balanced diet. Increases hemoglobin and encourages the proliferation of red blood cells. Recommended for certain types of anemia. Regulates bowel movement. Balances cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood. Stimulates and strengthens the immune system and is considered to contain antibiotic properties. Contains skin and hair nutrients. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 61 Bee pollen is the richest source of vitamins to be found in nature. Its high content of Rutin, a flavonoid complex, gives it a vasodilating and anti-inflammatory effect. How do I take it? 1 tablespoon/day is the recommended amount. You may wish to add it to the cottage cheese/quark and flaxseed oil mix or to a milkshake. Contraindications and side-effects: Not recommended for patients or people allergic to pollen or with seasonal allergies, as it may cause severe anaphylactic reactions Not recommended either for patients with kidney failure. Consult your doctor, specialist or call us and we will assess your case and guide you through the best choice for your situation. ARTEMISIA ANNUA Artemisia annua (also called sweet wormwood) belongs to the Asteraceae plant family, which has over 23,000 species. Artemisia annua is a natural plant found in several parts of the world, including China. It contains a component called artemisinin, which has been used for many years in China to control high fever and malaria. While there are specific strains of malaria that have developed immunity to artemisinin, it is also true that combining it with other elements is still one of the most effective treatments against this illness. On the other hand, there are several lines of investigation that show artemisinin to be an effective cancer treatment. We have included artemisinin as part of our natural treatment for cancer. What precautions should be taken when ingesting artemisinin and how to take it? 1) Not recommended on its own. In order for the body to absorb it properly, mix it with www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 62 oils rich in Omega3 (flaxseed oil with cottage cheese/quark mix). Mix 4 drops of artemisinin with the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese/quark mix. 2) Take care when choosing a product with artemisinin, because not all of them have been tested and approved. 3) Artemisinin should n ot be taken during chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment. Wait 30 days after finishing the treatment. 4) Not suitable for pregnant women in the first trimester. 5) Consult your doctor or specialist if you have any type of allergy to this kind of substance. The instructions how to take Artemisinin come with e very order, along with the daily dosage and other recommendations. TURMERIC (CURCUMA) Turmeric may well be the most important plants for our health. Within the cancer field, it is renowned for its beneficial properties. The Budwig Center relies on a formula that has harnessed the properties of Turmeric, with outstanding results. Turmeric is helpful for: - Reducing pain www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 63 - Reducing inflammation - Reducing tumors - Eliminating free radicals (therefore, acting as an anti-aging product) - Improving joint mobility - Renewing brain cells, improving memory and concentration - Improving blood circulation, thus supporting the heart and brain - Balancing sugar levels in the blood - Fighting indigestion and soothing constipation - Maintaining healthy cholesterol levels Most turmeric (curcuma) is not easily absorbed by the body. The Budwig Center uses a formula, which is a mix of concentrated turmeric and pure mineral water. The water and turmeric are vortexed (spun) together, producing a highly absorbable remedy. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 64 PETS AND PARASITES We appreciate that pets greatly contribute to emotional wellbeing and are recommended by some professionals, such as psychologists. The need to take time to walk a dog, for example, forces some people to be more mobile and to partake in physical activity. This is also positive. However, we would like to highlight that these benefits may be curbed if pet hygiene is being compromised. It is imperative that the animal and its accessories be kept clean. Always wash your hands after touching your pet and never allow an animal to jump or walk on surfaces where food is handled . It is equally important to deworm your pet regularly, at least once a year depending on the animal. Parasites with which our pet may be able to live and cope can easily be transmitted to us. For this reason, pet hygiene must be a priority; otherwise, this beloved member of the family may become a risk factor that contributes to illness. Our tests can indicate if you are infected by parasites and, if so, a natural herbal blend of black walnut, cloves and wormwood may be prescribed, which effectively eliminates eggs, larvae and adult parasites. PREVENTION FOR WOMEN: USE OF BRAS Bras are a personal item used daily by women and have evolved over time. Many gynecologists recommend the use of wireless bras. Why? The pressure that underwired bras put on the breast and the lymph nodes can provoke bumps and mastopathy, which could develop over time into breast cancer. A tight under-wired bra may press on various lymph nodes and block the lymphatic system. As a result, toxins cannot be eliminated naturally through lymphatic drainage. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 65 Over time, this can cause accumulation in the breasts, leading to the formation of cysts, fibrous nodules or cancerous tumors. Due to all of the above, we recommend the use of wireless bras. Use sports bras and, when possible, limit wearing bras all together. Do not wear a bra to sleep or while around the home. COSMETICS & PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS M ost of us use personal hygiene products and cosmetics on a daily basis: soap, toothpaste, shampoo, body lotion, shower gel, shaving cream, deodorant, and so on. Knowing that our skin is the largest organ of the body and that it absorbs whatever we apply on it, our aim should be to use natural products. We may not be in the habit of reading the ingredients on our cosmetics and personal hygiene products, but it is highly recommended we do so, just as we do with food. Here is a short list of some \"non-desirable\" ingredients that we should try to avoid: - Alcohol, as in isopropyl alcohol (common in toning and shaving creams) - Parabens : (in deodorants, creams, and makeup) - Petrolatum (Vaseline) or paraffin and - Sodium laureth sulfate and Phthalates : (shampoos, toothpaste, cosmetics, soaps, etc.) At the Budwig Center, we recommend that you find natural, hand-made products, with ingredients you are familiar with or made by companies who are environmentally friendly. We have no affiliation with any company that sells natural beauty products; however, you will receive more information with our Home Distance and Clinical programs. LEMON JUICE AND BICARBONATE FOR CERTAIN DISEASES AND FATIGUE An easy and effective addition to our daily routine for fighting disease and increasing energy levels is to take lemon juice with sodium bicarbonate. Athletes use sodium bicarbonate to gain more energy at sporting events. Sodium bicarbonate combined with lemon juice is a source of vitality and health. Many of us suffer from excessive acidity. Our bodies are 70% water and should be kept at a balanced pH (acid / alkaline balance) to avoid growth of harmful micro- organisms. When our body becomes too acid, we should see this as a warning signal, showing us that our eating habits and lifestyle need immediate attention. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 66 Our saliva pH levels should normally be between 7.0 and 7.4 before drinking anything. Our urine is slightly more acidic in the morning because our bodies have been cleaning out the acids throughout the night. Therefore, you may get a urine pH level reading between 6.0 and 7.0, but it will improve drastically after drinking the sodium bicarbonate and lemon beverage for a few days. An ideal urine pH reading is between 7.0 and 7.2. PRECAUTIONS Sodium bicarbonate is considered unsafe for lactating mothers, pregnant women, and children under 5 years of age, unless specifically prescribed by a doctor. Please be aware that sodium bicarbonate is high in sodium, so if you suffer from oedema, liver disease, kidney disease, or high blood pressure, we recommend you begin with only 1 glass of the sodium bicarbonate and lemon mix in the morning. Medical supervision must be followed-up to confirm your condition and your progress. In the beginning you may experience some stomach cramps and feel thirstier as a side effect. See a doctor if your feet swell, if you feel weak, if your breathing slows down or you get nauseous. NEVER ingest the oven powder!; it\u00b4s a totally different substance to sodium bicarbonate. The ingredients in the oven powder can be harmful to your body. If you\u00b4re on prescribed medicine, you will need a medical authorisation to ingest sodium bicarbonate. The intake of sodium bicarbonate and lemon is not a substitute to a healthy diet, regular exercise and adequate rest. If you have chronic or serious illness, it is important to have medical supervision. Athletes should be informed by their trainers and doctors, in the eventuality that sodium bicarbonate could be considered a performance enhancer, and banned in the sport or country of origin. SEA SALT BATHS A nice warm or hot sea salt bath not only makes you feel good but brings a multitude of health benefits. Consuming natural, unrefined Celtic Sea salt (if it does not say 'unrefined' on the package, then it is refined), can actually help improve your circulation, regulate your blood pressure and minimize irregular heartbeats. It also acts as a natural antihistamine, helps clear sinus passageways and even helps cleanse the lungs of www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 67 mucous and phlegm, and aids in the prevention of muscle cramps. When used in the bathtub, sea salt also carries many benefits. Sea salt contain many minerals and nutrients that are beneficial for the skin. Sea salts, when combined with warm water, help open up the pores which can also help treat certain skin conditions such as psoriasis. Bathing in salt water effectively eliminates toxins, relaxes and rejuvenates the skin, while balancing the body's energies. The sodium, contained in sea water helps the body remove toxins and by-products of metabolism through the lymph system. This is important because it helps eliminate fluid that is trapped in the ankles, thighs, and knees. In short, we can remove acids through the liver, lungs, and kidneys as well as through the skin through osmosis. Salt water baths improve the body's alkalization. DRINK PURE SPRING WATER Our bodies consist of over 70% water and the brain is 90% water. So it is vital to drink healthy, 'pure' water. In the industrialized world of today, aqua vivens ('living', energetically charged water) is a rarity. In our drinking water supply systems, water is exposed to the detrimental energetic effects of straight unnatural water pipes, high mains pressures and chemical treatments. Water is not allowed to move in its naturally winding way, thereby causing loss of life force. Independent tests carried out by the Bio field Laboratory in Vienna have shown that the physical properties, the pH and conductivity of water change in a subtle way with energization. In some tests, the pH of acidic distilled water was raised towards the 'normal' pH range of pure water. These changes appear to be a direct result of the clustering of the molecules with energization. We believe that water has memory which is attributed to the dipolar structure of the water. Hundreds of water molecules group together and form clusters, in which colloidal minerals and bio photons (light energy) interact. These clusters are very sensitive structures and are impressionable by vibrational influences. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 68 In this way, water acts as a receiver and transmitter of information. Homeopathy is based on this principle. The natural world, which we are a part of, moves in a spiraling fashion. Water flowing in a natural meandering river system forms whirls and eddies and never follows a straight path, and like all free falling objects, raindrops fall in a subtly spiraling motion. We believe that this spiraling motion is fundamental to life and is important in ways which are not yet understood by mainstream science. This is particularly evident in shellfish, snails, antelope horns, pine cones and climbing plants such as clematis and ivy. In a more subtle way, all plants grow in a spiraling fashion, always turning to face the sun. The DNA of all organisms forms a double helix spiral . WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS Water purification and filtering systems are an important step toward removing harmful chemicals and pollutants from water, especially if you live in countries where the water could contain parasites or harmful chemicals (i.e. Chlorine and Fluoride). Distillation and reverse osmosis systems can be used, but they produce lifeless acid pH water and such expensive systems are not required. Also, water stored in plastic containers usually contains dioxin, Bisphenol A (BPA) and PCBs. These plastic chemicals have been associated with many health issues including birth defects, hormonal disruption, and even cancer. We recommend that you find a water filtration system that addresses the particularities of your local source of water. www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 69 Cancer has been developing over some time due to some 'disturbance in the energy fields of the body'. The news of this diagnose can be so impacting that many have expressed it causing depressive states. So please don't lose hope! When you lose hope you have lost half the battle. People are winning the battle over cancer every day and especially using the tools outlined in this Guide, so you can too! I highly recommend you try not to walk this road of recovery alone. Finding people to be there for you, supporting and encouraging you through the good days and bad is very important. As I emphasize to my patients that come to the Budwig Cancer Center, forgiveness and 'counting your blessings' are two of the most important emotional states you need to stay strong. Forgive absolutely everyone that has disappointed you at some time in your life because holding a grudge is too heavy for you to carry and especially at this moment in your life. Why not get a note book and write down as many positive and good blessing you have in your life. Keep adding to that list day after day. Read over that list as part of your daily meditation program. I warmly encourage you to take 20 minutes of quiet time every day to read and meditate using this empowerment page. Remember that Dr. Budwig warned that any modification or addition to the program could compromise the end result. There are many Centers and Clinics that use only some of the Dr. Budwig approach, such as the flaxseed oil and cottage cheese mixture; however, they use other therapies and remedies that could nullify the benefits of this formula. The Budwig Center was directly authorized by Dr. Johanna Budwig in August 2000 to use her program. We are careful to adhere to the original Budwig protocol and that is why we have witnessed very good results with all types of cancers, as Dr. Budwig did. At the Budwig Center, we aim to get to the true cause of the disease and do whatever possible to help the body overcome that cause. Once the four (4) main causes of cancer are professionally dealt with using our program, the body can then effectively heal itself. Our program starts the day you sign up and ends the day you recover your health. Products and remedies, as well as emotional balancing systems, are sent immediately to your home address. All our patients receive regular newsletters and permanent support. Regular Vega tests allow us to supervise your progress and offer more help. You have the choice of signing up for our Distance programs or coming to our Clinic in Malaga, Spain. CONCLUSION www.BudwigCenter.com - www.BudwigCenter.eu - www.BudwigCenter.es Page 70 In conclusion I would like to say that we believe we have one of the best, most comprehensive programs available at the moment, with an endless list of testimonials that are evidence of the success of the Budwig approach. I sincerely wish that by you adopting these tools from this book you will 'add years to your life and also 'life' to your years'.
